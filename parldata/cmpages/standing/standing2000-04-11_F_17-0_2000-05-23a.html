<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/096/2000096.htm">Learning and Skills Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 98</center></H4>
<H4><center>Grammar schools: retention of selective admission arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 302.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> I welcome you, Mr. Butterfill, to the Chair. We look forward to working with you. You will find the Committee, certainly those hon. Members on the Government Benches, full of cricketing metaphors. You will be lucky not to hear someone refer to England's gigantic victory over Zimbabwe--albeit that it was aided by a former Zimbabwe batsman, Mr. Graham Hick. However, it is for the other side to discuss cricket; we are here to discuss learning and skills. We shall do so even more diligently, Mr. Butterfill, under your chairmanship.
<P>
In seeking that clause 98 should not stand part of the Bill, we wish to reinstate sections 105 to 108 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. In so doing, we shall restore the Government's manifesto commitment that parents, not local authorities or Ministers, should decide whether grammar schools are to keep their selective admission arrangements.
<P>
Clause 98, which was introduced by Baroness Blatch in another place, takes that power away from parents and places it back in the hands of local authorities. The details of the petition and ballot process were strenuously debated during the passage through Parliament of the 1998 Act, and we did not expect to have a rerun of the debate less than two years later, in a Bill that has nothing to do with grammar schools or school admissions.
<P>
We have made our position on selection clear time and again. We do not support selection by ability at the age of 11, and we do not wish to see it extended. The policy on petitions and ballots on the future of selective admission to the remaining 164 grammar schools was agreed at the Labour party conference in 1995 and publicised in the document "Diversity and Excellence" before the general election.
<P>
We continue to believe that parents, rather than Ministers or local government officials, are best placed to decide whether those 164 grammar schools should continue to select their pupils by ability, which is why I seek to reinstate the procedures that allow parents to do just that. During the 25 years before the 1998 Act became law, the number of grammar schools fell from 809 to 166. Why, during its 18 years in government, did the Conservative party do nothing to stop them closing? It was a Conservative Government who first gave parents the right to hold a ballot on whether a school should opt out of the local education authority and become grant-maintained. Why does it now, in opposition, want to deny parents the right to ballot on the future of selective admission?
<P>
In March, parents in Ripon voted in favour of retaining selection by ability to the town's only grammar school. Some people have argued that the result of that first ballot should be taken as an indication that parents in all areas that have a grammar school want to keep selective admission. They say that we should not reinstate the ballot provisions. That is nonsense. Accepting that argument would mean letting Ripon parents vote for all parents, which is an odd proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): The Minister is also aware that major concerns have been expressed locally about the Ripon ballot, particularly to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), whose constituency is nearby. Given the nature of the people who took part, that ballot is not typical of what other parts of the country might decide. I hope that the Minister takes seriously the representations that have been made to the Department for Education and Employment about how people were selected for the written ballot, which seems exceptional.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall comment on the possibility of a future ballot in a few minutes.
<P>
I cannot put the argument better than my noble Friend, Baroness Blackstone, who on Report in another place said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>By analogy, it would be like the result of a by-election determining the governance of the country as a whole.--[Official Report, House of Lords, 14 March 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1484.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure, following the Romsey by-election, that the Conservative Party would not want that. Indeed. I am not sure we would either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I am unusual. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] I thank hon. Members. The by-election that resulted in my entry into the Commons reduced the majority of the then Labour Government to one, so that by-election did change events. A pact was made with the Liberal Democrats., who can speak for themselves, but that by-election changed the balance of power in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the Minister will not be tempted to follow that line of discussion. We are here to discuss the Bill and not the outcome of by-elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Absolutely. and it would take more than one fluke by-election result to unseat the Government.
<P>
We are aware that petitions have been circulating in another eight areas during the school year. A number are within wholly selective authorities where either all or almost all children take selection tests and go either to grammar schools or, for those that do not pass, the alternative. Parents in these areas may take a different view from that of parents in North Yorkshire, where only 5 per cent. of children attend grammar schools and a wider range of alternatives exists.
<P>
The number of petitions circulating, the degree of interest and the 75 per cent. turnout in the Ripon ballot show that parents want the opportunity to express their opinions. They should be able to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Can the Minister enlighten the Committee as to how many of the other petitions are expected to trigger a ballot before the end of the school term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> No, I cannot. It will depend on the number of petitioners. I make no judgment as to whether it will be many, a few, or none, at all. Some interest in certain locations has been shown in the possibility of a ballot, but we shall have to wait and see whether those ballots come about.
<P>
We hear arguments from the Opposition that petitions and ballots are a threat to some of the country's best schools, and that our policy on selection cannot be reconciled with our pledge to raise standards. I am not persuaded by such arguments. Grammar schools obtain excellent results, but they should because they accept only the most able students. We recently published some telling statistics in response to a parliamentary question tabled, interestingly enough, by the noble Baroness Blatch. They showed that the average performance of the top 25 per cent. of pupils in maintained comprehensive schools is comparable with that of pupils at grammar schools, who make up roughly the top 25 per cent. of the ability range in selected areas. I will make that data available. Also, recent independent research suggests that pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 in mainly comprehensive areas make more progress than those in selective areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I am listening to the Minister carefully as he advances anti-grammar school material. Will he tell us whether he himself is in favour of grammar schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The burden of my argument--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Ah!
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman cannot say "Ah" when I have merely said that [Laughter.] The burden of my argument is that he and I may hold views on the issue, but it is the parents' views that count. That is our important argument and is the reason why we want to give parents the final say. The hon. Member for Hertsmere does not want parents to have the final say. My children were happy at the local comprehensive school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister says that he believes that parents should have the final say. Why does he not believe that the parents of children attending stand-alone grammar schools should have a say in a ballot?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We discussed on other occasions the way in which elections would be held. I know that views differ about the fairness of the procedure. We have aimed for a balance. I know that not everyone is happy with it, although sometimes the fact that both sides of an argument are not happy means that a reasonable balance somewhere in the middle has been reached.
<P>
The Government had three choices. We could have kept to ourselves the power to close grammar schools. The previous Government did that, and with our majority we would, I suspect, have got such a measure through Parliament. However, that would have imposed the same solution on everyone and denied parental choice. We could have done what the Liberal Democrats wanted us to do and handed power to local education authorities, but that would also have denied parental choice. Instead, we chose to let parents decide.
<P>
There are two reasons for placing the future of selection by ability for the 164 remaining grammar schools in the hands of parents. First, it gives parents a choice about an issue on which they feel strongly. Secondly, it allows us to concentrate on our main agenda of raising standards in all schools. Many of us want to focus on all the schools that our children attend, rather than to be drawn back in history into the debate about selection. That debate is best resolved by parents locally.
<P>
As my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone explained in the debate in another place, we are tackling poor performance in a variety of ways in primary and secondary schools. We are maintaining our stance on standards and finding the resources to improve them for the benefit of all children. We have been told that our policy on selection removes opportunities from bright and gifted children, but we have a range of policies to promote diversity in schools and cater for pupils' different needs, whatever their ability.
<P>
We are increasing the number of specialist schools that provide opportunities for children with particular interests in the arts, languages, sport and technology to play to their strengths. Specialist schools are working. On average, their examination performance in 1999 improved even more than that of other schools. Specialist schools are also popular. By September 2000 there will be specialist schools in 86 per cent. of local education authorities. We are also encouraging setting, which takes account of the different abilities of pupils in different subjects. In addition, we are working on a national strategy for improving the education of gifted and talented pupils. Our excellence in cities programme includes initiatives for that group.
<P>
We chose to put the power to decide the future of selective admissions in the hands of parents whose children would be affected and we want that power to be reinstated. That is why I shall encourage my hon. Friends and, I hope, Liberal Democrat Members, to join me in opposing the motion that clause 98 should stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It will perhaps come as no surprise to the Committee to learn that I intend to maintain that clause 98 should remain part of the Bill. The Minister's attitude comes as no surprise in one sense, because in advance of the House of Lords vote, Baroness Blackstone said that if the amendment that has now become clause 98 was passed, the Government would want to reverse it. However, it is a shame that, after reforming the House of Lords and getting rid of the 623 624 hereditary element, the Government are not prepared to listen to it when it speaks on behalf of many in the country, not least those who are affected by the proposals on grammar schools.
<P>
I do not want to go over all the ground again. I admire the Minister's courage and dexterity in doing so. I have been reminded in particular of what the Secretary of State said about grammar schools--apparently humorously--at the unfortunate 1995 Labour party conference. In the twists and turns of various election campaigns, including a by-election shortly before the general election, parents were told that the grammar school in their area was safe with Labour. A straightforward reading of the Labour party manifesto does not convince me that it bears the interpretation that the Minister has given it. Altogether, this has been an unhappy episode for the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> It may be helpful for me to remind my hon. Friend of the comments made by the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) during a debate that occurred on the Floor of the House on 20 October last year, which I initiated. The hon. Gentleman confirmed that, in his view, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Wirral, South on a pledge that grammar schools would be safe under a Labour Government.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Well, there we are. Any parents who read today's debate and consider the Minister's remarks will come to another conclusion. Whether or not the Government want to take responsibility for it, the process that they have set in train and which they want to continue by reversing the clause will undoubtedly put grammar schools under threat. That threat may not materialise, but it is a threat none the less.
<P>
I want to concentrate on the experience gained from Ripon and the one ballot that has so far been held. I heard what the Minister said when he adopted the argument of Baroness Blackstone, who told the House of Lords that she did not want one ballot to speak for the whole country. That contrasts with the attitude of the Secretary of State and--dare I say it--the spin that he and others gave to the ballot result by saying that they wanted to draw a line under the process. Apparently, that is not now the case and we are back to twists and turns in policy.
<P>
After the Ripon result, the Secretary of State said that he was not hunting grammar schools. He may not want to hunt them, but he is showing no signs of calling off the dogs. We heard from the Minister today that another eight petitions are circulating in various parts of the country. Notwithstanding the Ripon result, that seems to suggest that campaigners against grammar schools remain every bit as committed. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Labour Members are voicing support--perhaps some of them will voice it more clearly. The hon. Members for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane), for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) and for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) are all prepared to say that they are against grammar schools. However, when a Minister speaks on behalf of the Government, he is not prepared to venture an opinion, but merely to say that he wishes to put the matter in the hands of parents.
<P>
There is still a chance for Ministers to reconsider their attitude towards the clause and to take advantage of this opportunity to draw to a close an episode in policy making, that has not been a happy one for the Government, from any viewpoint. Notwithstanding what Labour Members have said, I ask them to consider carefully what occurred in Ripon. Although the outcome of the ballot was welcomed by many people--including parents with children at both the schools in Ripon, parents throughout North Yorkshire and the country, and people in many quarters--there are lessons to be learned from what occurred in Ripon.
<P>
The process in question came from the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998 and its consequences in Ripon have been widely criticised, not only by those who are, like me, opposed to the abolition of grammar schools. As The Times put it:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Ripon vote has proved the folly of the system. A spiteful campaign has brought charges of unfairness and dirty tricks on both sides, while unsettling children, parents and teachers. There has been no groundswell of local support for abolishing the grammar school, but national activists from the Campaign for State Education have nevertheless whipped up hostility to set parent against parent.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the considered views of The Times, which is no slavish friend of the Conservative party or, indeed, of any other party.
<P>
The process does nothing for the cause of education in areas such as Ripon. One of the points to which The Times and my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) drew attention was the way in which the improving secondary modern school in Ripon came in for attack from campaigners. Ripon college was recently granted city technology college status and was widely accepted as being an improving school.
<P>
Another unfortunate factor is that the system put in place by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 allows the process to be repeated in a few years' time. Pupils in Ripon who have had that going on during their first year at school will face the same experience when they sit their GCSEs.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): Will the hon. Gentleman explain his opposition to a further ballot on selection? When the Conservative Government were in power, he supported exactly the same arrangements for ballots on grant-maintained status, which could take place each year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman shoots the ground from under his Minister, who has said that we should always listen to the view of parents on the matter. The justification for the Minister's case is that he has put the decision in the hands of parents. However, the choice on grant-maintained status was arbitrarily taken away from parents, in whose hands it had been, notwithstanding the decisions that had been reached in individual schools. If the hon. Gentleman studied the history of ballots in grant-maintained schools, he would know that the ballots usually resulted in a large majority in favour of grant-maintained status. In any view, those schools have improved as a result of that status. Has the hon. Gentleman any such schools in his constituency? Five secondary schools in my constituency became grant maintained. The policy was successful and widely welcomed by parents, including those not of my political affiliation.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have a cornucopia of riches. I shall first give way to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) and then to the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd, who is a passionate abolitionist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The situation of grant-maintained schools is comparable. Many grant-maintained schools have done well, but those in my constituency received much greater funding than those that remained with the local education authority. That seems to have had something to do with their greater success. Will the hon. Gentleman state how much more the grant-maintained schools in his constituency received than they would have received had they remained with their LEA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can confirm that those schools are suffering currently and that they are having to lay off teachers and classroom learning assistants. They are certainly not dancing with glee. To go off on another brief expedition, I note that, even if what the hon. Gentleman said was right, the Government promised those schools that there would be a levelling up. On any view, there has not been a levelling up for them. Their finance has been frozen and the Government have done nothing to help them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Ruane </B>(Vale of Clwyd): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman who, I think, will confirm that he is an abolitionist when it comes to grammar schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the popularity of grant-maintained schools in the opt-out reign. In a seven-year period in Wales, only 16 schools opted out. Schools were deliberately targeted in areas in which the opt-out rate was low. One school next to my constituency had £7 million flung at it to encourage other schools in the neighbourhood to opt out. That money was taken from the other schools' budgets and deliberately dangled as a carrot to encourage them to opt out. However, in my local school there was an 80 per cent. no vote and in a neighbouring Catholic high school there was a 75 per cent. no vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to talk for too long about grant-maintained schools--we have turned down that path. As the hon. Gentleman knows well, there was a determined campaign against grant-maintained status by local authorities and Labour party activists in parts of the country. In Hertfordshire, where there was a politically hands-off approach, grant-maintained schools were extremely successful.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should not be discussing grant-maintained schools. Can we return to the subject of the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am sorry. Notwithstanding efforts to the contrary, I have allowed myself to be tempted away from the path that I was taking. I shall return to my point. The threat against grammar schools continues, and there is a threat of the same process occurring in the areas containing the 164 remaining grammar schools if just eight petitions circulate. Queen Elizabeth's school in Barnet, which children from my constituency attend, is a good school that offers an additional educational opportunity through being a single-sex grammar for boys aged 11 to 18. It is the only such school in the London Boroughs of Barnet, Harrow, and Enfield and in south Hertfordshire, which includes my constituency. Members of the ethnic minorities in the area concerned especially appreciate the school.
<P>
How many more times will we see the process that we saw in Ripon repeated around the country only to result, we hope and confidently expect, in the outcome produced there? Consider the problems that subsequently occurred. The damaging distractions, the divisions, the failure to make education a top priority and the political splits that have removed educational opportunity have done nothing for the cause of education. The Ripon ballot revealed an unhappy process. Surely the Government would welcome the opportunity to get themselves off the hook that their policy, with all its twists and turns, has put them on. That was the Government's initial spin, but they have retreated to the original misguided policy which does nothing for educational opportunities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) makes a good case for why we should not have GM ballots on grammar schools. That is our policy. They are disruptive, set parent against parent and engage the groups on either side in a huge dispute. Education gets stuck in the middle and forgotten. Our policy is clear: LEAs should decide school planning. That happened before GM ballots and, following the Secretary of State's comments on selection, we expected the Labour party, in keeping with its traditional support for local democracy, to allow LEAs to fulfil their responsibility to plan local education provision for all pupils in their areas.
<P>
We were surprised to see the Government take the cowardly path of creating the ballot system, which has caused problems. We are not in favour of such ballots. They could, however, be the lesser of two evils. We support the Government's desire to remove the clause, which is clearly headed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>retention of selective admission arrangements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The national party of the Liberal Democrats is persuaded by the case for comprehensive education. The selective system does not deliver results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman is causing me consternation and confusion. In recent local elections in the borough of Trafford, where my constituency is located, his party fought on the basis that it would retain the grammar schools and selective education because they work well and should not be changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I said in my opening remarks that the matter should be left to LEAs. Individual councillors who deal with the situations in their communities should look to their consciences. I make no bones about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the most striking feature of the recent election in Trafford was that it was targeted by the Conservative party as the one local authority district that it had to win to justify its policy on educational selection, and it failed to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is an interesting note on the election, but I am interested in the broad point of delegating power to a local authority. It is up to local councillors to decide what to do. We have made a clear policy statement on selective education, as have Labour and the Conservatives. We will make the case for comprehensive education, which has been put effectively in another place and in this House. The Ripon ballot highlighted the problems. LEAs should have a broad overview and responsibility for their areas.
<P>
We are disappointed with the Government's new framework for local schools planning, which relies on schools Organisation plans and new structures. That should have been tested. The greater delegation of powers to local authorities was replacing the historical notional assumption that local authorities could plan, but when they did anything controversial, the Secretary of State would overrule them. We were establishing a system in which independent local bodies could make decisions without big brother in the Department for Education and Employment in Sanctuary buildings dictating what local authorities should do with schools and education in their areas. That system provides the greatest accountability. Parents can choose to get rid of local councillors if they are uncomfortable with their decisions. We believe that such accountability is appropriate, because all parents in an area have a say. It cannot be assumed that allowing one school to operate a form of selection will not have a knock-on effect.
<P>
The Conservative party's proposals for schools are utterly ridiculous. Every year, parents come to hon. Members when they are not getting the schools that they want for their children, who are then shunted about the city. Those who deal with school admissions know that giving schools a totally free choice on which pupils to accept--a free-for-all--will affect other schools in the area. To believe otherwise--to believe that they can act as independent islands--is bizarre.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The LEA's role is not to control what goes on in the schools--that has not been the case since the local management of schools was introduced. They are responsible for strategic planning. Decisions on how many places are available to match the local population are critical, and it is appropriate that parents should have a right to put councillors in place or remove them. The appropriate body to make those decisions for Ripon is North Yorkshire county council. It is entirely appropriate for councillors of any political persuasion to stand on the pro- or anti-grammar school ticket, and to make it absolutely clear whether or not they would reform the system in North Yorkshire--to make Ripon's schools comprehensive or to keep them as they are--and for the parents of North Yorkshire to make the appropriate decision.
<P>
The Ripon ballot has raised questions about the knock-on effect, particularly when we consider what has happened to schools at the Harrogate end of the county. It is important to consider the detail of the balloting arrangements, to discover just how flawed they were. As I said, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough received a comprehensive submission from Mrs. Debbie Atkins. She is one of many who wrote to the Secretary of State criticising the ballot, and I understand that she has not yet received an appropriate response.
<P>
That submission is quite persuasive. It shows that the number and distribution of parents who were balloted was not appropriate. During the past three years, the 2,067 parents of children in the schools in the Ripon catchment area have sent 200 children to the Ripon schools. Those are standard feeder schools. In a number of other potential feeder schools, 636 parents were excluded because they had sent fewer than 10 pupils during that time.
<P>
Some big questions must be asked about why the ballot seemed to mitigate against those schools that had the least chance of getting pupils into the grammar school. If a school's pupils did not usually gain places at the grammar school through the 11-plus exam, that would count against it being admitted to the ballot. That might not be because the school wished it, but because its social mix or other reasons prevented it sending people there.
<P>
Finally, and perhaps most controversially, 930 parents of children at private schools outside the Ripon catchment area from which only 35 pupils went to the grammar school during the past three years were included in the ballot. I understand that a similar anomaly exists for infant schools that did not count as feeder schools, despite the fact that pupils from those schools may eventually have gone to the grammar school, although the combined primary schools count did include parents who believed that they had been excluded.
<P>
The submission notes that many of the parents of children at one of the schools that sends pupils to the grammar school is on the border of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. I understand that the Grosvenor House school, a private school in Harrogate, and the second largest school in the ballot, did not send one child to Ripon grammar school last year, but it was allowed 12 per cent. of the eligible voters.
<P>
It is not a question of private versus state provision. The parents of children in private schools are still council tax payers and have a stake in their local school, but we must question the fact that the parents of children attending state schools who aspire to go to the grammar school were not included in the ballot, whereas the majority of parents of children in private schools--only a few of those children go on to the grammar school--were included in the ballot. Parents in the area have a right to feel aggrieved about how the ballot was conducted.
<P>
There is a huge argument about the ballot and who did what. I shall not go into that, but there was a problem with those balloting arrangements in pitting parent against parent. As I said, the same problems existed when we had the grant-maintained ballots. The Labour party was quick to attack those ballots, which was appropriate at the time because they caused large-scale disruption. The present ballots have had the same effect of pitting parent against parent, and all sorts of accusations have been flying around.
<P>
One point we must touch on briefly is the extent to which figures can be distorted to show that either comprehensive or selective education is better. Such figures have been crucial in deciding whether ballots should be held. In Sheffield, we are entirely comprehensive and have been for many years, which has caused no problems. We have excellent schools and our pupils by and large have a good experience of the education system. From a personal and local point of view, I am persuaded of the case for comprehensive schooling. Some of the figures--[Interruption.] Excuse me, Mr. Butterhill, that was my battery running low; my mobile was not turned on.
<P>
One of the arguments made in the Ripon ballot was that Ripon college and the Ripon grammar together had a much better grade A to C GCSE pass rate. [Interruption.] My mobile is definitely turned off, Mr. Butterfill. My apologies. the two schools had a distinctly better pass rate of pupils with five grade A to C GCSEs than comparable comprehensive schools in North Yorkshire. Questions have been raised about how the figures were calculated--specifically how comparable figures are possible as selection, by its nature, distorts the process. Pupils progress to different schools, and distort the figures for the comprehensive catchment area. I shall quote some comparable figures. The nearby local comprehensive, King James's school in Knaresborough. has a 72 per cent. five grade A to C GCSE pass rate. That compares with the figure, which is quoted by those who campaign to keep selection, of 66 per cent. for the Ripon schools. Some parents believe they have found a more effective method of calculation that produced a rate 55 per cent. for these schools, which is the average for the county.
<P>
Figures are thrown about. However, it is clear from the figures for other schools that if the top 30 per cent.--the top performers--are in a grammar school rather than in the local comprehensive, it has a 100 per cent. pass rate for five grades A to C GCSEs. If we consider how pupils perform in different contexts, we see that in local comprehensives, the top 30 per cent. achieve the top rates. The Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), referred to such figures in his opening comments, which have been considered across the piece.
<P>
We constantly distort the figures when we play in this game, but there is no evidence to suggest that selection per se produces better results than a comprehensive system. These points are important, because the case that is made is unfounded when one takes into account the totality of pupils.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. We are in danger of being led into a debate on the relative merits of comprehensive and grammar schools, which is not the subject of the clause or the amendment. I have been tolerant because it is reasonable to allow some passing reference, but we should not be getting into this wider debate on clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I take full account of those wise words of guidance. I was concerned that the hon. Gentleman's line of argument seemed to be that the appropriate comparison with the performance of grammar schools was the performance of the best performing comprehensive schools. The whole point of comprehensive education is not that some comprehensives perform better than others, but that they all perform to a given standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Hallam will not be tempted to respond to that intervention at any length.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I was seeking to discuss the information in the context of a ballot, and I will continue to do so rather than drift off into the question of principle. On ballots, much of the information that has been put out has not given the true picture of the reality. The hon. Gentleman has given another example where we can pick and choose our statistics; that is one of the problems with the ballot arrangements. I return to my original point: the LEA is the body that is best equipped to consider the schools in an area and to examine what is happening. It has a handle on a wide range  of factors, such as the socio-economic background of the pupils, the questions about value added in which the Government are now engaging and other such matters. The LEA can make a decision on such matters, but parents necessarily have less detailed and comprehensive information--if I can use the word "comprehensive" in this context--that inevitably comes from one point of view.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats support the removal of the clause because we do not believe that we should seek to retain selective admission arrangements. There should be a means of challenge, although it should operate through the local authority, which stands for election every year--or, in the case of the whole lot, every four years--and can publish a clear manifesto commitment and which has authority for schools generally in its area. Indeed, it seems entirely ridiculous and quirky that odd schools should be left out of that general responsibility. We regret that the Government have not been persuaded to rectify the situation, but I hope that they will be persuaded of the case for allowing local education authorities to have the proper democratic power to which they should be entitled and which would allow them to make these decisions. We believe that most LEAs will be persuaded of the case for comprehensive education and that a more comprehensive system, in which schools can work effectively, will be established across the piece. Those schools will include those in my area and most other parts of the country, where such arrangements are the norm and we have not seen the world come to an end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> It is exactly two years and three months since myself and other hon. Members debated clauses 104 to 108 of the Bill that became the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. I think that I am the only member of the Committee who was present in those debates--[Interruption.] I see that I was not, so I apologise to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden), who may share my sense of dæjã vu. We have at least followed through from the beginning of the process to what should be its end.
<P>
Before I advance in more detail my arguments about why those sections should be deleted from the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 and why the clause should stand part of the Bill, I cannot resist making a passing reference to the welcome intervention that was made by the hon. Member for Bury, South. The hon. Gentleman chose to characterise the recent local elections in the borough of Trafford as a referendum on the future of grammar schools. The Conservative party, which was fighting for the retention of grammar schools in Trafford, polled 51.5 per cent. of the vote. The hon. Gentleman's party, which was identified with the removal of grammar schools, polled 37 per cent. of the vote. He will admit that, on any normal referendum basis, the electorate gave a fairly safe endorsement of the continuation of the current education system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he is now a supporter of proportional representation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Absolutely not. If the hon. Gentleman had listened to the statistics that I cited, he would know that the Conservative party won the election in Trafford on a good first-past-the-post basis. I am sure that the need for boundary changes will be addressed. If the hon. Gentleman visited the wards that his party held in the borough of Trafford a couple of weeks ago--
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman should wait for me to answer his previous question. If he visits the wards that his party lost, he will find that some of them have half the population that is to be found in some of the wards that we won in my constituency. I do not want to be drawn into speaking about the boundary commission. However, when one party receives for three years--the whole electoral cycle in a local authority area--more votes than its principal opponent and ultimately gets an overall majority, one does not want to be a supporter--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is being drawn down precisely the path that he said he would not take. Will he please return to the clause?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall return to the theme with relish, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
One of the saddest aspects of the current Parliament is that a Government claiming to be more interested in standards than in structures took early action focused directly on the structures of education. They did that in relatively limited areas of the country but where, by and large, the system had been working well. If the Government are truly more interested in improving standards than in tinkering with structures, they should have left the remaining grammar schools alone two years ago when the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was passed. If it is their true agenda today, they should warmly embrace clause 98, which was wisely added to the Bill by the upper House. In the present climate that House seems to take more care of the interests of the electorate and behaves more like a democratically responsive body of Parliament than the House of Commons.
<P>
It is not just my view that the broad mass of the people are often better served by a selective education system and the retention of grammar schools. I want to quote from a book published in 1998, entitled "A Class Act: the Myth of Britain's Classless Society". It was written by Andrew Adonis and co-authored by Stephen Pollard, a former research director of the Fabian Society--not a body that I would often pray in aid of my political beliefs. The authors state clearly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The comprehensive revolution has not removed the link between education and class, but strengthened it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Elsewhere in the book they state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The comprehensive revolution tragically destroyed much of the excellent without improving the rest. Comprehensive schools have largely replaced selection by ability with selection by class and house price.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Much as I and some Committee members might enjoy it if I continued to read at length from the book, I shall not. However, Ministers and Labour Members should reflect on the potential consequence of the provision that they passed two years ago, which will continue if clause 98 is removed from the Bill. The consequence would not, of course, be a great uplifting of standards in areas where they were poor, nor sudden access to the best schools in the country, regardless of the ability of the children's parents to pay, but the reverse.
<P>
In my constituency there are four grammar schools, two of which were, oddly enough, independent schools until four years ago. The two Roman Catholic grammar schools found grant-maintained status so attractive, because it enabled them to offer education free of charge, while retaining proper control of their educational and religious ethos, that they opted into the state sector. The fact that schools would choose to join, rather than try to leave, a state education system, must be a mark of its success. The four grammar schools in my constituency are all in areas with relatively, or, in some instances, extremely high, property prices. If schools such as Altrincham boys grammar school, my old school, Altrincham girls grammar school, St. Ambrose college and Loreto convent become comprehensive schools, the effect will not be to open them to all children regardless of their parents' affluence, but the reverse. They are already open to all children regardless of their parents' ability to pay. They currently provide places on the basis of the child's ability.
<P>
If the provisions introduced by the Government two years ago come to fruition and a ballot in the borough of Trafford removes selective admission from the relevant schools, admission to Altrincham boys or girls grammar schools will depend on people living in an area that has some of the most expensive housing in the north of England. That is not an extension of the egalitarian ideals that--presumably--used to drive the Minister and his colleagues--it is quite the reverse. Whereas the great socialists of the past--the Webbs--stood up for grammar schools as providing a ladder of opportunity for working-class children, today's Labour party, sadly, is happy for the quality of school that children attend to depend on the value of the houses that their parents can buy.
<P>
The Minister said that the Government are adhering to their manifesto pledge by insisting on the removal of clause 98. According to him, their policy before the election was that local parents should decide, but what is a local parent in the context of a school? My argument, which I rehearsed two years ago, is that if parents have an interest in a school because their children are within its catchment area and therefore able to attend it, that makes them local parents. I am sure that parents would understand that logic.
<P>
The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 had a different effect. As the hon. Member for Hallam said, it created a diverse and bizarre electorate for stand-alone grammar school ballots, which did not include parents with children at the school at that time who had the strongest and closest interest in its future. The Government would do well to defend that perverse logic to anyone. Whole-area ballots are almost as perverse. For example, people who live in Altrincham might expect their child to attend one of its grammar schools rather than Stretford grammar school or Urmston grammar school in the north of the borough. It is odd, therefore, that the electorate for deciding the future of grammar schools in the south of the borough of Trafford would include parents who live in the north of the borough whose children would not, in normal circumstances, expect to attend those schools.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's argument. Who does he think should decide the future of grammar schools, because I am in the dark on his policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I promise the hon. Gentleman that he will be enlightened.
<P>
In a rare display of affinity with the Liberal Democrats, I made it clear in the debate on the 1998 Act that I was happy for the situation to remain unchanged, which would have had some interesting effects. The Government properly aim to increase interest and turnout in elections. The local electoral process would be greatly invigorated in areas with outstanding schools that are threatened, as they sometimes are, by people with an ideological objection to selective education rather than a genuine attachment to raising standards in schools. I have no doubt that, had the relevant clauses of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 never been passed, the grammar schools and the selective system in my area would remain today and tomorrow. Further, we would not have had the uncertainty and difficulties that have faced the schools and parents, who have been left in total chaos for years, not knowing what the future of the local educational system was to be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> May I take it, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the reason why comprehensive education has swept almost the entire land in the past 35 years is that it is what people want for their children in the vast majority of cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I do not dissent from the view that comprehensive education became popular. However, it became popular for the wrong reason and because of fashion. Comprehensive schools sometimes worked well. More often than not, like most successful schools, the ones that worked well were in the most affluent areas that benefited most from parental interest. Affluence and parental interest decide the issue. Having warmed to the Liberal Democrats in one respect, I might astonish the Committee by criticising my party. Those with strong convictions about the benefits of selective education should have fought the case more firmly and vigorously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I was disappointed that the hon. Gentleman chose not to give way previously. On the question of his party's record, will he remind the Committee which Secretary of State abolished the greatest number of grammar schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman has already made that point and there is no need for me to answer his question. Although it is always a pleasure to have the name of the lady in question pass my lips, I will not say it now.
<P>
The Minister describes the Government's intentions as a manifesto commitment to which he claims they are remaining consistent. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred to the celebrated speech made by the Secretary of State at the Labour party conference in 1995. The speech was recently the subject of clarification when the Secretary of State made it clear that he was only joking when he said that there would be no more selection by interview or by exam. Many of us have thought that what the Secretary of State said must have been a joke The Government's performance demonstrates their preparedness to tolerate all forms of selection in admission to schools. Without referring too personally to individuals, their tolerance is also demonstrated by the readiness of a certain member of the Government to take advantage of selective schools, whether they be grammar schools or schools that select by interview, perhaps on religious or quasi-religious grounds. I am sure that the name of the new arrival has already been put down and that a place will be saved for him.
<P>
Pledges made in the media before the general election make it clear that the Government's claim to be standing by a manifesto commitment is far from candid. I draw the Committee's attention to the personal guarantee given by the present Prime Minister at the time of the Wirral, South by-election. Obviously for the immediate consumption of parents and others in that constituency who have an understandable attachment to the excellent schools there, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Labour Government would not close your grammar schools. That is my personal guarantee.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We start to act a picture of how worthwhile a personal guarantee from the Prime Minister can be. The Minister may try to justify semantically what was said on the grounds that it was a reference to the suggestion that a Labour Government would not close grammar schools, but would simply put in place a rigged ballot system to ensure that local parents could be blamed for closing them. However he tries to advance that argument, the reality is what local parents would have understood by that personal guarantee--that grammar schools on the Wirral would remain safe.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not asking the Committee to believe me. I am asking it to listen to the words of an hon. Member for whom I have a high regard and who is honest. All hon. Members are honest and honourable, but the hon. Member for Wirral, South is perhaps more honest than the generality of hon. Members. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Given that I stood for election on the basis that grammar schools were safe in Labour's hands, I would vote for the retention of grammar schools.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If our grammar schools are doing a good job, and in my patch they certainly are, let us leave well alone--"If they ain't broke, they don't need fixing."--[Official Report, 20 October 1999; Vol. 336, c.371.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the clearest indication of not only what I and parents throughout the country might have understood from the Government's pre-election rhetoric, but of what some Labour candidates in 1997 understood from the Government's pledges.
<P>
What has happened during the intervening two years since the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 became law? We have heard that in Ripon there was a resounding vote to retain an excellent grammar school and an excellent secondary modem school on the other side of the road. Those of us who believe in the retention of selective education took great heart from that as an indication that parents understand the benefit of a system that is working well in Ripon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully and he referred to the parental ballot in Ripon. He said that the Labour party pledged that a Labour Government would not get rid of grammar schools and, indeed, the balloting process leaves that to parents. He congratulated parents in Ripon for keeping the grammar school, so does he think that the Labour Government kept the grammar school in Ripon or that the parents made the decision to retain it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I think that we have seen a clear illustration of the two Labour Governments that the country has had the misfortune to endure during this Parliament. The old Labour Government are supported by some hon. Members who are, honourably and properly, happy to say that grammar schools should be closed. There is nothing wrong with that. They are in public life and Members of Parliament are entitled to have views. If one were old-fashioned enough, one could argue that they have an obligation to express those views and opinions. I congratulate them for doing so. That strand of the Labour Government have ensured that the grammar school ballot regulations are heavily loaded against retention, even to the extent of wording a ballot question with no reference to grammar schools, let alone to the decision being whether it should remain or not. The old Labour Government were successful in sneaking that question into the legislation and putting grammar schools under threat.
<P>
The Government's other side might consider it a success that they have not had to take the rap for the closure of an excellent school in Ripon, because some members of the Government would like the issue to go away. I hope that new labour will triumph and that clause 28--[Laughter.] l am anticipating a later discussion. I hope that clause 98 will remain in the Bill. There is no doubt that that would make life easier and more comfortable for some Labour Members. For example, the hon. Member for Wirral, South enjoys the ringing support and endorsement of that most sensible of Labour Members, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who champions the need to retain the Wirral's excellent grammar schools, principally on the grounds that they give his constituents an opportunity--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening to the hon. Gentleman carefully, and he has made some apt and interesting points. However, I hope that we are not about to hear an exposition of the personal views of each and every Government Member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Butterfill. If I were able to divine the personal views of every Government Member, I might have been tempted to try your patience. However, as most of them wisely keep their own counsel on the matter, recognising it to be one of an increasing list on which they find little sympathy among the wider public, I am unable to enlighten the Committee further.
<P>
While there has been a great success for good education in Ripon, in many other parts of the country--such as the Wirral, Kent and, in my own area, the borough of Trafford--the education system remains under threat for as long as the balloting regulations remain in place. That is the nub of the issue, regardless of the benefits or disbenefits of selective education, about which I--and Labour Members--have strong views. The Liberal Democrats have strong views on both sides of the argument, depending on where they find themselves when called upon to express them.
<P>
What is the real cost of the measures that the Government implemented through the School Standards and Framework Act 1998? Costs are involved in the bureaucracy of the system and within the Department. Financial costs arise from the need to police disputes and to take account of occasions on which the grammar school ballot regulations have been breached. Although I have made three or four complaints, all of which were valid, only one has been upheld by the Secretary of State. Judging such complaints takes up the time of Ministers and officials. Costs are also involved in the petitioning process. In Kent, the Wirral and Trafford--or any area in which a petition is undertaken regarding a ballot to abolish the grammar schools--it is necessary to engage the services of Electoral Reform Ballot Services Ltd. to maintain lists, and to communicate with local schools and parent bodies.
<P>
However, that is a tiny fraction of the cost of the legislation. The real cost lies in what it does to schools and children's education in areas where there are good schools with high standards, which should be viewed by the Government as examples of excellence. Those excellent schools, which have been fortunate in enjoying the support of parents and their local conununities, find their attention and efforts diverted away from the worthwhile and important goals of improving still further the standards that they have set, fundraising and encouraging parental involvement in the running of the school. The parents who care most about schools in areas such as mine are finding that the effort, time and commitment that they are prepared to offer because of their belief in what is available to their children--and those of their friends and neighbours and of future generations--is now diverted into running support groups: bodies that exist to defend institutions that should not need to be defended. They are institutions whose achievements and records speak so loudly for themselves that they should not be under threat from a Government who claim to be interested in standards and not in structures.
<P>
If the Government have the good sense to think again--and to accept the wisdom of another place, which inserted clause 98 in the Bill--parents, teachers and schools will be able to get on with the job of educating children. We could then leave behind the sterile ideological debates that the Government have thrust upon an unwilling public through the School Standards and Framework Act. We do not want it; the public do not want it. I suspect that the Government would find that, in a ballot in Trafford, Kent or elsewhere, the good sense of parents would ring out in defence of a system that works, just as it did in Ripon.
<P>
The Government insist on maintaining a ballot system, a petition system, which hangs like a sword of Damocles over the heads of excellent schools around the country to no purpose. The entire effect of the sections of the School Standards and Framework Act that the clause will excise is negative. It spoils education in good schools and lowers standards. That is something of which the Government should be ashamed, and they should think again.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I shall be careful and try to tread the fine line between matters of procedure and matters of content, although it is not always possible to separate the two.
<P>
The Opposition have made rather heavy weather of this matter, as we might have predicted. The hon. Members for Hertsmere and for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) refer continually to grammar schools. In a selective system, the majority of children do not go to grammar schools. This gives a fascinating insight into the archaic mindset of the Conservative party's approach to these issues. They focus entirely on the historic privileges that have been granted to a minority of children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me an opportunity to respond to that. If he had followed my regular contributions on this matter over the three years in which I have been a Member of Parliament, he would know that that charge cannot be levelled at me. If he would like me to stand again later and give the other half of my speech, I should be happy to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I would not wish the hon. Gentleman to do that. However, I am sure that he will, when the Bill reaches its final stages on the Floor of the House. My point was that the official Opposition focus, in everything that they say, on the needs of a minority, not the majority.
<P>
I would be delighted for every school in the country to call itself a grammar school, if that is what each school chose to do. Grammar is important, but we must separate the issue of the name of the school from that of the nature of the system. In the constituency of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, the majority of children take a test at the age of 11--that is, those who do not flee the constituency to be educated elsewhere because they choose not to take a test. The majority take a test at 11 and fail it. They live with that sense of failure for the rest of their lives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The hon. Gentleman claims some knowledge of my constituency. However, I wonder if that knowledge extends to the reality of what its high schools achieve. Among them is the Ashton-on-Mersey school--a sports college which was designated a beacon school by the Government and which has won two charter mark awards--and the New Wellington school, which has won a charter mark award and has technology college status. Those are very successful schools. Children who attend them are not branded failures--they emerge with an excellent education that is well suited to their needs, abilities and aptitudes.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B> Mr. Chaytor:</B> The hon. Gentleman's constituency is only about a dozen Metrolink stops from mine, and I would draw his attention to the achievements of children in my constituency, where there is a coherent and completely comprehensive system for 11-to-16 schools. If he were to compare the figures for children in my schools with those in his own, the point would be well made, and I shall return to it.
<P>
I said that the Opposition could oppose parental ballots for grammar schools and their re-running, and yet passionately support--as they did for a number of years--annual ballots for grant maintained schools. However, I am still waiting for a reply. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hallam for describing the situation in Ripon, and reference was made to Ripon college's influence on the result there. It is interesting to note that, compared to schools in the surrounding area, Ripon college performs very poorly. If the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough were present, he would spell out that the achievements of comprehensive schools in Knaresborough far exceed those of secondary moderns such as Ripon college.
<P>
I find it odd that hon. Members who are elected to Parliament through the ballot box should seek to deny parents the opportuniy similarly to exercise their preference on this most sensitive and controversial of issues. I am in favour of ballots and elections because, in an election, information has to come out. The Ripon ballot was curious for many reasons. The two main schools involved took a proactive role that, arguably, contravened regulations. As was said, an official complaint has been made about the way in which the ballot was conducted. The ballot was also curious because of the nature of the electorate. A huge number of parents were able to vote although their children were in private schools many miles from Ripon. Some of those schools had not sent a child to Ripon grammar school for several years. However, there is an important difference between arrangements for stand-alone ballots and those that may apply in Trafford, Kent or other parts of the country where the system is completely selective.
<P>
In conclusion, I should like to make two or three points. In his opening remarks, my hon. Friend the Minister quoted the most recent analysis of last year's school performance tables, which, I believe, was undertaken by Professor Jesson. It established conclusively that, in the equivalent ability range, comprehensive schools throughout the country scored between 3 and 4 percentage points higher than selective schools. In making that point, I want to correct the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, who implied that that comparison was valid only in respect of the upper achievement band.
<P>
I am not a great fan of league tables, and we should take such precise analyses and percentage differentials with a pinch of salt. However, on the basis of current information, it is indisputable that, in respect of the top 25 per cent. of the ability range, comprehensive school children are performing better than selective school children.
<P>
As I said, I am in favour of ballots and elections because the information has to come out, and I strongly oppose retaining the clause as it stands. If future ballots take place, the analysis of last year's performance tables will be widely publicised and will challenge the stereotypes of parents who examine the relevant figures for local authorities. Once again, I shall compare the achievement in the local authority in my constituency, Bury, with that for Trafford, which is the local authority in the constituency of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West. Bury is comprehensive and Trafford is completely selective, but the figures for GCSE achievements show that, year on year, schools in Bury score higher. The figures for SATs in primary schools or the staying-on rates of those who are post-16 show that Trafford does not compare equally with neighbouring districts--not even with those that have a lower level of affluence than that which Trafford enjoys.
<P>
I do not have the figures for last year's staying-on rate in Trafford but I do have the most recent figures that are available. Those figures show that children in Trafford have a poorer staying-on rate at the age of 16 than many other districts in the north-west, all of which have a comprehensive education system, including Berwick, which does not enjoy a similar level of affluence to that of Trafford, Stockport, which has a similar level of affluence, and Chorley.
<P>
I believe passionately in the importance of using parental ballots in the admissions system. That will focus parents' attention on the way in which all the children in a district perform under selection, compared with the way in which all the children in neighbouring districts perform in comprehensive education systems. It may take some years for such information to percolate and for people to analyse and assess it. That is why it is important that parents have a second bite of the cherry in three or four years' time.
<P>
Sooner or later the truth will out. The basic truth about selective education in Britain is that for decades it has been directly responsible for the comparatively poor level of achievement among British children compared with those in similar countries and for the endemic class divisions in British society. That is why I support the clause's deletion and the right of parents to choose the admissions system in their local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Last week, Mr. Butterfill, you were the harbinger of the news that you would be in the Chair today. You consequently made my weekend--I spent the entire time looking forward to this moment.
<P>
Hansard will confirm the fact that the Minister used cricketing metaphors in his opening remarks--at least, his initial remark was to that effect, but that may have been a slip of the tongue. It is not because he used that metaphor that I shall declare an interest at the outset--there are no grammar schools in my constituency.
<P>
Before I became a Member of Parliament, I was aware of a school that was, I believe, called the St. Marylebone Philological school. I played cricket against its old boys, who toured the country calling themselves the old philologians, which suggests that they were either not very good at philology or that they wanted to have a name that associated them with the school at which they had been educated, although the school no longer existed.
<P>
We have already alluded to the fact that the Bill has a Welsh dimension. I remark in passing that in the days when Neath grammar school existed, it produced two captains of cricket for England--we were better at cricket then than we are now. I cannot think of any Welsh captains of the English side since then. I do not want to stress that or to be in any way combative to the hon. Member for Bury, North, who criticised our concentration on grammar schools. You, Mr. Butterfill, would rule us out of order if we talked more widely on subjects that are remote from grammar schools.
<P>
I have an atavistic association with the original debate in this context. Maurice Jacks, who was the director of the department of education in Oxford, and my father, who served on the Committee that considered the Education Bill before its enactment in 1944 and who was the leader of the Conservatives on London county council, which supervised the Inner London Education Authority, conducted a long dialogue in the correspondence columns of The Times about the future of secondary education. They were first cousins, although the readers of The Times did not realise that, and I never asked my father whether they had conducted their dialogue by telephone before conducting it in The Times. However, that is the background against which I was brought up.
<P>
There are no grammar schools in my constituency, but I know that 34 per cent. of young people in Northern Ireland go through a selective education system, and that figure might be even higher if the Catholic Church did not insist on the principle that Catholics should be educated in Church schools. I have a story, which I shall tell briefly, about a time when there were problems getting passports in this country--as there has been again, more recently. The Treasury decided to allow the Home Office to create three more posts for the offices providing passports. At that time, someone who applied to Belfast for a passport got one in four days; someone who applied to Peterborough got one in 40. It is not surprising that, in those circumstances, the Home Office decided to give all three places to Belfast. That happened during my time in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The qualification needed to work in the passport office was two GCSEs: 1,200 people applied for the three places in the Belfast office. The selectors decided, therefore, to raise the required qualifications to two A-levels. That still left 400 people with two A-levels applying to work in the passport office. That is a tragic story, because it shows the lack of opportunities in Northern Ireland at that point in the troubles for people with considerable educational qualifications, and that they were prepared to take a job for which just two GCSEs were required. However, it was also the glory of the system that there were so many people in Northern Ireland with A-levels. That was the underlying reason why it was possible to get a passport in Belfast in four days, whereas Peterborough took 40 days.
<P>
The commanding argument in favour of the clause is that it will guarantee straightforward stability in the system; removing it would create instability in the lives of the pupils concerned. The Minister made an implicit technical criticism of the other place when he expressed his surprise, given the subject of the clause, that it had been inserted into this Bill, but that could not have happened if the insertion had been inappropriate.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said, the Government's first tranche of reform for the House of Lords has produced a different situation, in which the judgments made by the Lords have greater constitutional validity. The House of Lords voted to insert the clause into the Bill by 166 votes to 161. The Liberal Democrats made it clear that they would vote with the Government, and we can see their names on the Government side. I am not anti-Liberal or anti-Liberal Democrat; four members of my family served as Liberal Members of Parliament between 1835 and 1918, so it is in my blood and I recognise the genes. However, I do not understand the Liberal Democrats' logic for voting with the Government, either in the House of Lords or today, as I infer from the comments made by the hon. Member for Hallam that they intend to do. Perhaps, it is because they are against grammar schools nationally, but for them locally. To that, I can only say, "Fancy that". Although the arithmetic suggests that the Liberal Democrats voted with the Government, and not with the official Opposition, it remains a considerable surprise that the Government lost the vote. One has to look, therefore, at Cross-Bencher votes and at differential abstentions. Those are just the kind of questions that will inform Millbank tower's inquest this week on the local elections.
<P>
I have sought to remain within your strictures and constraints, Mr. Butterfill, as to the rules of order relating to this debate. Therefore, I shall turn, finally, to the subject of the Secretary of State's joke. I alluded earlier to the 1944 Act, which was piloted through the House of Commons by Rab Butler. He, too, was given to jokes, which were often ambiguous, but were genuinely the funnier for their ambiguity. You would rule me out of order if I gave examples, Mr. Butterfill. However, I neither see the Secretary of State's joke, nor understand his rationale in seeking to explain it, looking back on it five years later. Perhaps it is the way he tells them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): It is nice to see you in the Chair, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
I listened carefully to the thoughtful contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North. It might have been somewhat wasted in the context of this debate, but it would be very worth while in the context of another. His contribution was wasted, unfortunately, because he gives too much credence to what happened in another place. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) has just given us the voting numbers, and details of who voted with whom. The fact is that the clause has no place in the Bill. It was opportunistic, at best, and downright mischievous at worst. There was no cause to have a clause of this nature in the Bill, which seeks to bring together some of the strands of post-16 education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): On that specific point, does my hon. Friend agree that if the Bill had started in the House of Commons, the insertion of the clause would never have been allowed?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I agree entirely. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said that the clause was quite properly inserted. I am sure that that is the case; the House of Lords would not make a mistake of that nature. However, that does not stop the clause being mischievous. Its purpose is to disrupt the Bill and to make it disjointed when it seeks to be coherent. It is a last-minute defence of an education system introduced in 1902 and modified slightly by the Haddow report in the 1930s to become a three-legged arrangement comprising technical, grammar and secondary schools. That reminds me of the gold, silver and lead analogy.
<P>
That system was introduced because it reflected the state of intellectual opinion at that time, in relation to the wider education of the population. We have manifestly failed with the present arrangements dividing children into sheep and goats at the age of 11. The country has not been well served by that system. We lag behind in so many ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that Germany has been well served by a system similar to the one that he described, which involves selective education between technical and academic schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Mr. Butterfill, you will stop me if I embark on a discussion about continental education systems, and rightly so. We are discussing the nature of education in the United Kingdom and whether the clause, inserted by the House of Lords for what I believe are mischievous reasons, is appropriate for the Bill. I declare that it is not, because the system that we run has not benefited from the approach implicit in clause 98. The clause represents a last throw of the dice to protect a system that many on the Tory Benches in the House of Lords believe benefits an elite fraction--
<P>
Mr. Brady indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> Yes, it does--it is no good the hon. Gentleman shaking his head. It is an old class argument that has been going on since 1944, when we had the first chance to introduce comprehensive education, which was extended in 1965-66 by Shirley Williams, who is now in the other place. During Mrs. Thatcher's rule as Secretary of State for Education and Science, the argument was used to sweep away more grammar schools than under any other Government before or since. We are trying to modernise the system of post-16 education for the benefit of students and of Britain. The global, competitive world market in which we now work requires a modernised, improved and up-to-date system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> With regard to the class system, has the hon. Gentleman heard the views of Eric Hammond, who is involved in this issue in Kent? He believes that if grammar schools were to be abolished, they would simply turn into independent schools in the independent sector. Does the hon. Gentleman think that that would diminish the class system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I never had much respect for Eric Hammond when he was an electrician, let alone now. [Laughter.] The point is that education must be appropriate to the needs of the young people and students whom we are trying to assist, so that they, in turn, assist the whole nation. We should not be surprised that many young people do well in grammar schools. They come from the best intellectual backgrounds; from families who are extremely interested in education and the nature of education. If they were all in comprehensive schools, and those schools had the great benefit of the excellent teaching that is available in grammar schools, we would be able to rationalise the use of our resources towards the aims of education. This country would then be a dam sight better off than it is in continuing to fight the old class war of privilege, which the Conservatives clearly enjoy and on which they thrive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Does anyone else want to join in?
<P>
I believe, Mr. Butterfill, that during my attempt to brief you on the atmosphere of the debate, I implied that references to cricket were made by right hon. and hon. Members on the Government Benches. If so, that was a terrible mistake on my part, which may betray a certain deference to Conservative Members in terms of which party is the party of Government. The comments were made by Opposition Members; if I said the reverse, it was a slip of the wrist and should be declared a no-ball.
<P>
We have had an interesting and wide-ranging debate about a subject that was one of the great topics of discussion when, in another era, I first became a student of social policy. The debate had an historic ring to it. Conservative Members have been looking back in anger, while we are determined to look forward to the prospects for all our children in all our schools.
<P>
I always enjoy listening to the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, but, in recounting his memories of the Conservative years, he was rather reticent about which Ministers were responsible for what policies. I found it interesting that, although he would be proud to describe himself as an arch-Thatcherite, he could not bring her name to his lips on this occasion. The lady was not for naming. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Fabian Society and the Webbs. However, the Fabians are a moderate group of men and women who would be unlikely to open their doors to him. Should they ever go on a demonstration, their chant would be, "What do we want? Gradual progress. When do we want it? In due course.
<P>
We have heard echoes of an historic debate between the apostles of elitism and those who want fairness for all children. The ideological battery of the case for elitism is, like that of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, running down. The debate has highlighted the fact that many of our children are doing well in the comprehensive system. My own children went to comprehensive schools. Let me re-emphasise the results to which I and one or two other hon. Members referred. If we compare all 15-year-old pupils in all grammar schools--about 25 per cent. of such children attend grammar schools--with the top 25 per cent. of 15-year old pupils in comprehensive schools, the results are remarkably similar. In 1998-99, 95.4 per cent. of the grammar school group achieved five or more grades of A to C at GCSE or GNVQ, but 100 per cent. of the comprehensive school group achieved similarly good results.
<P>
I do not particularly want to draw that distinction--the statistical comparison is close, but there is nevertheless a difference. The comparison shows that our able boys and girls are doing remarkably well in comprehensive schools, and those of us who support the comprehensive system will not be surprised by that. I wish that, occasionally, Opposition members of the Committee would recognise the importance of comprehensive schools and applaud the great success that such schoolchildren, and their parents and teachers, have achieved. Most of our children are educated in comprehensive schools, and recognition would be timely. Perhaps we are about to hear some.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I make no apology for standing up for the schools in my constituency, which are not comprehensive. I was concerned that the Minister's defence of the comprehensive system was elitist: he referred to the performance of only the most able. If he were to compare the performance of all children at GCSE level, he would find that those local education authorities that are selective, or partially selective, perform better than those that are comprehensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> This is not a debate on the merits of the comprehensive school, but the argument is that it offers the best educational opportunity for every child. I am not overly idealistic; some comprehensive schools are struggling, and an agenda has been established for their improvement. I was trying to address the implicit point that our most able boys and girls can be properly educated only in grammar schools. My argument is based on data that I applaud and am happy to broadcast. Despite what a distinguished correspondent in The Guardian would have us believe, that data shows that many of our highly able boys and girls are doing extraordinarily well in the comprehensive school system. We do not want to look back in anger at the old system. We want to move forward, and consider standards in respect of all schools and all children.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): Does my hon. Friend remember the Opposition's pledge to create a grammar school in every town? Their general approach to comprehensive schools was to transform them into grammar schools and in so doing, create secondary modern schools. In my home town of Leek, there are two comprehensive schools. According to the Opposition's pledge, one would become a grammar school and the other, in effect, a secondary modern school. That would create division in a town in which two comprehensive schools have worked together extremely well and produced excellent results for all young people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I understand that, and the Conservatives' position on the matter is clear. Ours is also clear: there will be no new selection and no new grammar schools under this Government. Opposition Members do not like the ballot box, but that is where this issue will be tested at the next general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I rise because I have a suspicion that the Minister is moving on from the elitist point. In extending his argument to higher education, does he think that all British universities can be world class, or is it desirable that a number be capable of competing with any university in the world?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Well, it was not for me to leave behind the elitist point. I was inviting the Opposition to do so, and that is my historic challenge to them. We must be careful not to test your patience, Mr. Butterfill, by straying too far into university sector territory. However, I recognise that universities have a variety of roles. Some will achieve academic excellence on a world stage, and others, while achieving much excellence, will have a greater role in, say, community and economic development.
<P>
That said, I am always happy to give way to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster because I enjoy his contributions. He mentioned his family interest in the London county council. My father was the last chairman of the council when 35 glorious years of socialist rule in County Hall came to an end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Thirty-one years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It would have been longer, had not a certain Government abolished the London county council to make way for the Greater London council. I say that because there are some on the left of the political spectrum who think that Leon Trotsky invented the GLC. In fact, it was introduced under a Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is not going to respond to that point, and we are not going to debate the Greater London council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> May I assure you, Mr. Butterfill, that after this sitting, I will communicate to the Under-Secretary what I would have communicated to him, had you allowed me to do so?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall certainly read that communication, and respond if necessary. I try not to stray from the matter at hand, and I have occasionally been embarrassed to discover that I am the only member of the Committee who is sticking to the point, although I sometimes range widely to show that I am a more rounded person than I may appear to be.
<P>
I shall not consider in detail the question of the fair balloting of parents and which parents should form part of the electorate, save to repeat the point that there are those on both sides of the argument who are concerned about the ballot system. We have tried to stick to the middle ground, but we recognise that we have not pleased everyone. The question was asked why parents of children already attending grammar schools cannot vote. The point is that, depending on the outcome of the ballot, the completion of their children's education will be unaffected. Changes in admission arrangements resulting from a ballot will affect only later intakes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Under-Secretary has given an interesting reply. In the light of it, why cannot parents of children currently attending grammar schools vote in whole area ballots?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am tempted not to go into detail on that issue, because a whole area ballot differs entirely from other ballots. It is a different ball game.
<P>
Opposition Members occasionally talk about the closure of schools, but there is no question of getting rid of any schools. Schools will continue to do excellent work, and only the admission criteria may change. In a way, we have been debating different forms of democracy, all of which have merit. Some would argue that the Government should decide such matters. The hon. Member for Hallam argued strongly that such matters should be decided by local government and the local education authority. However, we stick to our argument that, in this case, it should be up to the parents. The Government want to look to the future and focus on the standards issue.
<P>
The point was made that we were rather churlish in not agreeing with the House of Lords, and that we had not listened to them. In fact, we listened carefully, but we simply disagreed with their majority decision. The clause should not stand part of the Bill, and, should there be a vote, I urge my colleagues to vote no.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 305, in page 46, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'() Sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996 (intervention) shall have effect in relation to powers and duties conferred or imposed by virtue of Schedule 7 as if--
<P>
(a) those powers and duties were conferred or imposed by the Education Act 1996, and
<P>
(b) the bodies specified in sections 496(2) and 497(2) were any local education authority, any school organisation committee and the governing body of any maintained school (within the meaning given by section 20(7) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998).'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When proposals for changes to school organisations are made under the provisions of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, the various public bodies involved are subject to the provisions of sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996. The sections give the Secretary of State powers to take action where certain public bodies act, or propose to act, unreasonably in the exercise of their functions or are in default of their duties. That means that the Secretary of State has the power to intervene if, for example, a local education authority fails to discharge a duty in relation to its functions in the statutory proposals process--it may have refused to implement a proposal by the school organisation committee. He also has the power to intervene if a school organisation committee fails to discharge a duty related to considering and making decisions on proposals. For example, it may fail to pass a proposal on to the adjudicator on which it had failed to achieve a unanimous vote.
<P>
Sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996 do not automatically apply to the provisions in the Bill. Explicit provisions are therefore required to ensure that the Secretary of State's powers of intervention apply to the functions of local education authorities, school governing bodies and school organisation committees as they are exercised under schedule 7. That is the purpose of amendment No. 305.
<P>
I am sure that Opposition Members will understand the importance of the amendment. I remind all hon. Members that the position of the Learning and Skills Council is already covered under clause 25. That gives the Secretary of State the power to give directions to the LSC in the event of it failing to discharge a duty or unreasonably exercising its functions under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I am pleased to join the Committee after an earlier commitment.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary expand a little on his explanation? I am not clear whether the amendment provides the Secretary of State with these powers so that he can force the various bodies to carry out their functions or so that he can counter judgements with which he is dissatisfied. Those reasons are qualitatively different. Has he sought these powers because the bodies are not doing their job or because he does not like their decisions and he feels the need to overturn them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Quite simply, if the local education authority fails to discharge a duty in relation to its function in statutory proposals procedure or if it fails to discharge any other duty, the Secretary of State can intervene. I want to make it absolutely clear--and I hope that this will reassure the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)--that he can act only if the bodies are acting unreasonably, or illegally. The amendment would tidy up the procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> What the Under-Secretary is saying is that the Secretary of State cannot intervene if the bodies come to a different conclusion from him, provided that they were doing their job. The amendment is concerned not with a failure to reach the same conclusion, but with a failure to perform.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am happy to confirm that. It does not depend on the subjective opinion of the Secretary of State. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 102, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Inadequate Sixth Forms</center></H4>
<P>
Amendments made: No. 287, in page 73, line 4, leave out from '80' to 'forms', in line 5, and insert 'the Chief Inspector'.
<P>
No. 288, in page 73, line 7, leave out from beginning to 'shall' and insert 'The Chief Inspector'--[Mr. Wills.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, amendment No.335, page 73, line 14, leave out from '2' to end of line 16.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 336, in page 73, leave out lines 22 to 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have rather raced through the past few clauses. For the convenience of the Committee I should say that we have come to the part that deals with what are described as inadequate sixth forms. Clause 102, which has just been ordered to stand part of the Bill, brings into effect schedule 7, which contains a process for dealing with such sixth forms. It is worth noting that the schedule deals with both school sixth forms and 16 to 19 institutions. The process leads eventually to the closure of sixth forms identified as being weak under the criteria laid down in the schedule. I will have words to say about the criteria in due course because we have concerns about them.
<P>
I want to probe one or two aspects of the process of what is supposed to happen when a school sixth form is identified as being inadequate. The procedures are similar to those followed by local education authorities and governing bodies for the discontinuation of a school or a change to a school's age range under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. The process is triggered by a report, which might come from an Ofsted inspector or, under paragraph 4, from another person. Amendments Nos. 335 and 336 explore who else could trigger the process other than an inspector. We look forward to hearing from the Under-Secretary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I hope that what I am about to say will offer the hon. Member for Hertsmere reassurance and enable him to withdraw the amendment. We are resisting the amendments because they would remove one of the safeguards for schools that has been built into the arrangements for dealing with inadequate LEA-maintained sixth form provision. Here, as in other respects, the arrangements mirror those which apply elsewhere in the school inspection system, as I think that the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
12.30 pm
<P>
Sixth forms will generally be inspected as part of routine whole-school inspections undertaken by teams that are under contract to Ofsted and which are led by a registered inspector. When a registered inspector judges at the end of a schools inspection that special measures are required, the School Inspections Act 1996 requires that Her Majesty's chief inspector should be informed and that he should take the final decision. That ensures consistency in decision making, which we believe to be an important safeguard for schools.
<P>
A judgment that a sixth form is inadequate will have serious implications for a school. We therefore believe it appropriate that the process of arriving at that judgment should be the same as that for schools that require special measures. Corroboration by Her Majesty's chief inspector of the adverse judgments made by registered inspectors is a valuable safeguard for schools that goes back to legislation introduced by the previous Government and which we do not want to discard.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may not be altogether clear about the changes that we are making. Government amendments Nos. 287 to 290, which have already been debated, revised some references to a registered inspector that are contained in the schedule, but not others. The purpose of those Government amendments is principally to ensure that provisions in schedule 7 that relate to area-wide 16 to 19 inspections are consistent with clauses 63 to 65, which provide for those inspections. We found that we were able to use simpler and briefer wording for those provisions.
<P>
In contrast, paragraphs 4(1)(b) and 4(2)(c) relate to school inspections under part I of the School Inspections Act 1996 and their wording needs to be consistent with that Act. The significant difference is that a registered inspector can make a report of a school inspection, but only the chief inspector or a member of his inspectorate will be able to make reports of 16 to 19 area inspections.
<P>
I hope that that explanation helps the hon. Gentleman and that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are discussing the trigger mechanism for the whole process for finding that a school has an inadequate sixth form because it is failing to give pupils of sixth-form age an acceptable standard of education or has significant weaknesses in one or more aspects of its activities. Clearly, such conclusions are very important, and I am seeking assurance that the person who triggers the mechanism will be somebody of appropriate expertise. I think that I have received that assurance from the Under-Secretary. I shall consider his remarks more carefully and read them alongside clauses 60 and 81.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I confirm that I am giving the hon. Gentleman that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It was not one of our major concerns about this part of the Bill, but it was none the less a concern that a process that could have such serious consequences should be brought into train only by somebody who is suitably qualified. I accept the Under-Secretary's assurance, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 289, in page 74, line 35, leave out from '80' to 'forms', in line 36, and insert 'the Chief Inspector'.
<P>
No. 290, in page 74, line 40, leave out from beginning to 'shall' and insert 'The Chief Inspector'.--[Mr. Wills.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No.337, in page 76, line 12, after '(1)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Subject to subsection (1A) below,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to consider amendment No. 338, in page 76, line 14, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1A) Proposals under subsection (1) above may not be published unless they have received the consent of the local education authority for the school concerned.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have just been talking about the trigger mechanism for starting the process of deciding whether a school has an inadequate sixth form. We now move on to what happens when the process has been triggered. The Minister may not agree with me, but what follows is fairly cumbersome. Following, receipt of the necessary reports of the inspectorate, the local learning and skills council may publish a proposal for closing the sixth form. That proposal then goes to the school organisation committee. If the committee cannot reach unanimity on the proposal, it will go to the adjudicator. The adjudicator makes a decision and it is then for the school organisation committee to consider his proposal.
<P>
I think that I have given a reasonable summary, but the Minister will no doubt correct me if it is not entirely accurate. In any event, it is a cumbersome process. However, it is not clear what role the local education authority has. One would have thought it reasonable for the LEA at least to have a say. The purpose of amendment No. 338 is to give the LEA that opportunity once the LSC has published its proposals--the first step following the receipt of the inspector's report. I should be grateful to hear the Minister's response on the LEA's role. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> A point has occurred to me. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the LEA is inevitably a stakeholder in the process? I understand that the Government propose to channel only the base load of sixth form funding through the learning and skills council. In principle, it would be open to an LEA to provide additional funding if that were deemed appropriate. If a problem existed, the LEA might consider it appropriate to enlist additional funding to rectify it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely correct. I guess that that will be the case for a number of sixth forms.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify how parts I and II of the schedule operate? At the beginning of part II, paragraph 16 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Learning and Skills Council for England may publish proposals for an alteration of the school as a result of which it will not longer provide education suitable to the requirements of pupils who are over compulsory school age.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nothing in the Bill seems to restrict that to cases in which the LSC has received reports from the inspectorate. Is it possible under part II for the LSC to publish such proposals without having received a report from the inspectorate? If that is not possible, can the Minister identify the provisions that make the exercise of the LSC's power conditional upon receipt of the inspector's report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I find myself in the unfortunate position of not being able to agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman said. I shall do my best to reassure him, but I cannot accept the amendment. The description that he gave was not wholly accurate, and I shall explain why. The adjudicator's decision does not go back to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This may have been my fault. I did not say that the adjudicator's proposals went back to the Secretary of State. Paragraph 36 provides that they go back to the school organisation committee. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where proposals are approved under paragraph 35 they shall be implemented.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to the decisions of the adjudicator. Sub-paragraph (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But the school organisation committee . . . may modify the proposals, after consulting such persons as may be prescribed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I  suggest that a further step in the process is envisaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As the hon. Member for Hertsmere recognised, the process has been established to deal with serious issues. It is an important aspect of the Bill. The amendments would neutralise the LSC's power, to propose the closure of LEA-maintained sixth form provision that has been found to be inadequate after two consecutive inspection reports. The average time between such reports would be two years. I cannot stress enough that only serious circumstances would trigger the powers of the LSC to make such proposals. If LEA-maintained sixth form provision had been deemed inadequate over such an extended period, earlier opportunities for the school and the LEA to turn a situation around would have been neglected or have failed. Why should the very same LEA that has failed or neglected the need to correct what is clearly a serious situation be given a veto over the LSC's power to propose closure? That does not make sense.
<P>
The LSC's power is a reserve power of last resort. It is in everyone's interest to identify problems and weaknesses a long time before the power is triggered and to take remedial action without waiting for the first adverse inspection report. That is a task for schools themselves with the support of their LEA. Schools should routinely evaluate their performances by pinpointing weaknesses to identify where improvements are needed. LEAs should also monitor schools' performances and raise concerns about low standards. Furthermore, when standards are unacceptably low and intervention is needed to secure improvements, LEAs can issue a formal warning notice. If a school governing body fails to comply with the notice, an LEA can appoint additional governors and suspend the school's delegated budget if that will secure the necessary improvements. If a first inspection report finds sixth form provision to be inadequate, the LEA can help the school to draw up an action plan and it will state what action it intends to take to turn around the quality of provision.
<P>
In short, LEAs that maintain inadequate sixth form provision will have all the time and powers of intervention that they need to set matters right. If they fail to use that time and those powers to ensure that young people in their area get a fair deal and the education that they deserve, the LSC must be able to intervene without its proposals being subject to veto by the LEA. Even if the situation goes that far--this relates to the second point that the hon. Member for Hertsmere made--the LEA will remain very much involved. The Secretary of State's guidance to the LSC in paragraph 16(3) will require it to consult LEAs before it publishes proposals to close inadequate sixth form provision. LEAs will also have a vote on the local school organisation committee which will be responsible for approving LSC proposals. Only if the committee votes unanimously to approve the proposals will action be taken to implement them. If a unanimous decision is not forthcoming--the LEA might vote against the proposals--the matter will pass to the schools adjudicator. The LEA is centrally involved throughout the process. There are important safeguards to ensure that local accountability and local decision-taking powers are entrenched in the process.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In considering proposals, the committees--and if relevant the adjudicator--will have a statutory duty to have regard to objections raised by any body, including the local education authority, during the period, which will be specified in regulations. Nobody can be sure that a local education authority will not have sufficient opportunity to make representations against learning and skills council proposals. That will be so even when a local education authority has failed over a sustained period to use its own considerable powers of intervention to turn a sixth form round and ensure it is delivering an adequate education for the young people it serves.
<P>
I have taken some time reassuring the hon. Gentleman. I hope he can now withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not as reassured as I would like to be after listening to the Under-Secretary's admittedly careful explanation. He has not gainsaid the proposition that there is nothing in the Bill that will allow a local education authority to have its say. The process can proceed as far as the adjudicator, and he can take a decision if the local education authority is in disagreement with the proposed course. I accept that there are various options available to a local education authority. However, we are dealing with a procedure that is set in train once reports have been received and the LSC has taken the decision to close the school.
<P>
The Under-Secretary referred to local education authorities having the power of veto. Many will find that a strange way of looking at local education authorities and local democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I intervene for two reasons. I omitted in my explanation--and I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's description of it as careful--to answer his point about whether the learning and skills council can act on anything other than an inspection report. I also failed to refer him to the relevant part of the Bill. A learning and skills council can act only on inspection reports. I refer him to paragraph 4 of schedule 7.
<P>
As he is still concerned, I shall remind him of something of which I am sure he is already aware. The adjudicator in all circumstances must act reasonably. I hope that reminder will provide him with a little extra comfort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I had seen the provisions in paragraph 4, but I am not sure they cover every possibility that could arise under part II. I will consider the matter more carefully. However, I am unsure about whether it is impossible for a learning and skills council under part II to do as it wishes whether or not it has received the reports from the inspectorate. If that is the Government's intention, perhaps the Under-Secretary will examine the issue again and satisfy himself that the Bill embodies their intentions. If the Under-Secretary thinks that there is any risk that it does not, perhaps he will come back at a later stage with some amendments to ensure that it does. I accept that may be the Government's intention, but is that what the Bill provides for.
<P>
As for the main point about local democracy, we are concerned about the criteria for designation as an inadequate sixth form. Nobody wants to see an inadequate sixth form. The Bill gives a particular definition of an inadequate sixth form. We shall come to our concerns on that later. However, a disagreement could arise between the local learning and skills council and the local education authority as to inadequacy and whether a particular sixth form is inadequate or not. If a learning and skills council takes it upon itself to publish proposals for the closure of a sixth form and is prepared to push that through, there is nothing that the local education authority can do. A local education authority's wishes can be overridden. The case could go to the adjudicator, whose word would be final.
<P>
The adjudicators must act reasonably, but the qualification applies to all such bodies in the proposals. If the adjudicator acts unreasonably, he may find himself before a court under judicial review. We cannot set much store by such a safeguard. We are concerned about local democracy. Is it not appropriate that at some stage in this long drawn-out process, in the ping-pong played between the LSC and the local school organisation adjudicator, for the LEA to have its say. It seems that the Government are determined that it should not, and I do not draw the reassurance that I would like from the Minister's reply. I am not happy. However, in order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 304, in page 78, line 34, leave out '35(5)' and insert '35(6)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 306 to 319.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The amendments correct technical deficiencies in part III of schedule 7. They are about getting the provisions right down to the last detail. I hope not to detain the Committee.
<P>
Parts II and III of schedule 7 set out the technical procedures for the LSC's handling of proposals to close an inadequate sixth form or to discontinue an LEA-maintained institution for 16 to 19-year-olds. It has always been our intention that those provisions should be consistent with the procedures set out in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 on proposals relating to LEAs or school governing bodies for changes to school organisation. Indeed, they were closely modelled on existing legislation. However, a few wrinkles need to be ironed out. They are rather technical; I shall try to be clear and brief.
<P>
Amendment No. 304 merely corrects a cross-reference. Amendments Nos. 306 and 307 relate to circumstances in which the school organisation committee approves proposals subject to a specified event occurring. For example, an LSC closure proposal might be dependent upon the approval of a related proposal by an LEA or school governing body to add additional sixth form places elsewhere. Amendment No. 306 makes it clear that an approval that is conditional on such a specified event can be given only when the event occurs within a specified time. It would not be reasonable to the parties concerned to leave such situations open for an unknown or unlimited time. Amendment No. 307 provides that if the event does not occur within that time, the LSC proposals must be treated as having been rejected.
<P>
Amendment No. 308 relates to circumstances in which the school organisation committee considers changes to LSC proposals that have already been approved. Those changes might be to the implementation date of a proposal or to the time span of a conditional approval. The amendment makes it clear that when the change is to the specified time by which a specified event must take place, the committee may agree it so long as the specified time has not already passed. I hope that the Committee will agree that that is a common-sense proposal.
<P>
Amendment No. 309 provides that the school organisation committee can agree to changes to proposals that have been approved only when the changes have been requested by the LSC.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 310 and 311 relate to new LSC proposals that relieve those responsible--the LEA, the governing body, or both--from the duty to implement a previously approved closure proposal by the LSC. Such new proposals would be brought forward when changes in circumstances mean that implementation would be difficult or no longer appropriate--for example, if required improvements to a school sixth form had been achieved after the LSC's original proposals to close had been approved. Amendment No. 310 clarifies that such new proposals would have to be made by the LSC, and that they must be published and dealt with in accordance with regulations. Amendment No. 311 provides that, when the new proposal is approved, the original proposal will be treated as rejected.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 312 and 313 remove unnecessary provisions that add nothing to the meaning of the schedule and that are also out of line with similar provisions in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. We are concerned that that might give readers of the Bill pause for thought when, in fact, no difference is intended between the provisions of the Bill and those of the 1998 Act.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 314 to 319 make similar changes to procedures in Wales as amendments Nos. 308 to 311 make for England. The difference is that schedule 7 proposals that relate to schools in Wales will be made by the Council for Education and Training for Wales, and they will be decided by the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>
The amendments complete the technical infrastructure in the Bill for the handling of the LSC's proposals, and ensure that it is in line with the equivalent provisions in the 1998 Act. Regulations will be made in due course that will be modelled on equivalent regulations made under the previous Act.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 339, in page 78, line 43, after '(1)', insert 'At the end of the period prescribed under paragraph 34 above.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 340, in page 79, line 8, at end insert 'including the parents of pupils at the school concerned.'.
<P>
No. 341, in page 79, line 30, after '(1)' insert 'Subject to paragraph 36A.'.
<P>
No. 342, in page 79, line 45, at end insert--
<P>
'36A. No proposals may be implemented unless they have received the approval of a majority in a ballot of parents at the school concerned.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Amendment No. 339 is modest and I can deal with it in short order. It concerns what happens when proposals go to the school organisation committee. Under paragraph 34, any person can send objections to proposals to that committee within a period to be prescribed in regulations. Under paragraph 35, the committee will consider proposals. The amendment would ensure that the committee did not consider proposals until the end of the time for putting in objections so that the committee had the opportunity to consider objections that people wished to make and which were properly made within the prescribed period. I hope that that modest amendment will find favour with the Minister.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 340 and 342 are more substantive. I notice the hon. Member for Bury, South exhibiting interest in them. I expected him to be interested given the speeches that he made earlier. The Minister is also showing interest--he expressed the doctrine of parental decision making. We would like to find out through the amendments--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has referred to the hon. Member for Bury, South. That hon. Member is not a member of the Committee, although the hon. Member for Bury, North is.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I fear that I should apologise because I was the origin of the error. That was unforgivable on my part because I should have known better. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am not so easily insulted and do not attach great importance to the significance of terminology, hence my willingness to see every school in the country named a grammar school if that suits the parents.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is important for the benefit of Hansard that we ensure that we refer to the correct hon. Member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I must say to the hon. Member for Bury, North that I am sincerely sorry. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West for trying to get me off the hook, but I must take responsibility for getting the constituency wrong.
<P>
The amendments relate to the role of parents. There would seem to be nothing requiring parents even to be consulted. We are told that the Learning and Skills Council and the school organisation committee may consult such persons as they wish, but there is no requirement on them to consult parents. We should be grateful to hear from the Minister whether he envisages parents having a say in the matter at all. If so, at which stages will they be consulted? If we think that parents are as important as has been suggested, would it not be best to include a measure requiring consultation? We agree that parents should have a say on the matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 342 goes further and would require a parental ballot on proposals to close a sixth form. We look forward with interest to the Minister's response. He will recollect our debate on ballots for grammar schools. A ballot for a grammar school will not close a school but will change its character. The same is true here--a school's character will be changed if its sixth form is removed. The consequences would obviously be important for the school.
<P>
We wonder why parents should not have the right to express their views in a ballot. The process would be initiated not by parents but by others--by inspectors and the LSC. However, parents will want to have their say. What is the Minister's attitude towards that? How does he draw a distinction between this situation and the case of grammar schools? The importance of ballots and parental decision making in grammar schools was stressed. That was a common cause adopted by many Government Members. We look forward to hearing the Minister's response. What say will parents have on the matter?
<P>
Debate adjourned.--[Mr. Betts.]
