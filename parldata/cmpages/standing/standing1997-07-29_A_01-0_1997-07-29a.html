<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, I should remind the Committee of a number of important matters. A financial resolution has been tabled, which is available in the Room. I should also like to remind the Committee that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I shall not select starred amendments at either morning or afternoon sittings.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of public sector student loans to the private sector.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Willis to move amendment No. 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): Mrs. Dunwoody--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman means to stand up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Forgive me, Mrs. Dunwoody, this is my first Standing Committee, and I did not realise that one stood in a Standing Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I should help the hon. Gentleman. Standing Committees are actually ad hoc Committees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Your wisdom knows no bounds, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should like to have that in writing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If I get a knighthood, as I have been promised by the Minister for School Standards, I will do so.
<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 20, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) It shall be a condition of the payment of subsidy under subsection (3) above that the element of subsidy involved in any one loans portfolio shall not exceed one quarter of the amount originally advanced.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill is before us only because the former Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), included the proceeds for the sale of the student loans portfolios in the tax and spend plans for the current year and for next year. The present Chancellor made clear in the Budget debate that the sale of the loans portfolio was critical to the Government meeting their targets. The decisions that we take in Committee will play no significant part in dealing with the funding of our universities. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment will not have access to the money. The Bill is a measure designed simply for financial expediency.
<P>
When a similar measure was before the House in 1995, the now Minister for School Standards attacked it. I remind him of some of his statements when the Education (Student Loans) Act 1996 was in Committee--I am sure that he has read the report of those debates avidly.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats do not have any philosophical difficulty with the principle of student loans, or with the involvement of the private sector. Indeed, the recent announcement made by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, following the publication of the Dearing report, that in future loans will be repaid through the Inland Revenue on an income-contingent basis, makes the principle more acceptable to us.
<P>
We also understand the need to keep the public sector borrowing requirement under control, and we recognise the important part that the private sector must play. We have always asked that negotiations be open to scrutiny and that a tight regulatory system be in place to protect both students and the taxpayer.
<P>
Of course, we know that none of the moneys from such ``fire sales'' will be used to address either the underfunding of our universities or the growing poverty of our students. Our main purpose in tabling the amendment is to protect the taxpayer. Although the Treasury may benefit from receiving about &#163;1.6 billion this year and &#163;1.5 billion next year, taxpayers may not benefit, especially if Sir Ron Dearing's proposal for a new way of calculating the student loan debt in a manner that will not count against the PSBR is acceptable to the Treasury and is agreed.
<P>
Under the proposals, the Secretary of State can make any arrangements he thinks fit to subsidise the private sector buyers and to guarantee any losses incurred through default. The Bill contains no measures to limit the extent of those subsidies. It enables the Secretary of State to write a blank cheque to the private sector.
<P>
I remind the Minister of what he said in 1995 when discussing a similar proposal in Committee. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bill does not restrict the amount of subsidy that could be made available to private sector institutions. We should not give private sector bodies a blank cheque. The Bill should contain some restriction to limit the amount of taxpayers' money that will be given to private sector institutions as an incentive--some might say bribe--to become part of the scheme.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 19 December 1995; c. 93.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Caution was also advised by leading experts, including Dr. Nicholas Barr of the London School of Economics who wrote in The Times on 12 July that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Government might recoup only half the face value of the debt while the existing repayment system remains, but a sale could release an annual `pot of gold' of &#163;1.6 billion if the repayments were linked to national insurance''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now know that the Government intend to use not national insurance but the income tax system to collect future debts, so why do they not attempt to include the existing debts under such a collection system, thereby gaining a greater level of repayment and reducing the need for subsidies to the private sector?
<P>
Our amendment would achieve exactly what the Minister sought to achieve in 1995--it would amend the Bill to ensure that the taxpayer is protected and that some modest constraint is placed on the Secretary of State when negotiating the sale of debt portfolios. The Minister will recognise our amendment's similarity to the one he moved on 19 December 1995--in fact, the only difference is the addition of an s to the word ``loan''.
<P>
It should also be remembered that, if the Secretary of State fails to obtain changes in the Treasury accounting rules to service future debt, there will have to be a dramatic increase in the amount of revenue raised by the sale of student debts. Last Wednesday, the Secretary of State announced in his statement to the House that he would extend the student loan facilities to cover 100 per cent. of maintenance costs and the &#163;1,000 element of the new tuition fee that some students will have to pay. The sums will be vast, so the taxpayer stands to lose a significant amount if the first round of subsidies go unchecked.
<P>
On Second Reading, I likened the Secretary of State's proposals to a game show called ``The Price is Right''--the price is always right, whatever that price is. If the amendment is not accepted, the right price really will be any price.
<P>
Again, I remind the Minister of his comments in 1995, when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If banks, or other financial bodies are to be involved in the scheme, there is nothing wrong with restricting the amount of the subsidy. Amendment No. 10''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the amendment that he moved on that occasion--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would provide that the subsidy was no more than a quarter of the loan.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to attack financial institutions' profits as the Minister did in 1995, when he was in opposition--indeed, I suspect that his right hon. Friend the Chancellor is already eyeing them up for windfall profits for the latter half of this Parliament. However, the hon. Gentleman was right to say that a balance must be drawn between the taxpayers' interests and the banks' profits.
<P>
When the Chancellor said that the size of the continuing subsidies could not be predicted in advance, he was saying loud and clear that here was yet another opportunity for the City to profit at the expense of the taxpayer.
<P>
Our modest amendment would not put a negotiating straitjacket on the Secretary of State. I shall conclude by quoting what the Minister said in 1995:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I should have thought that it would assist the Minister in negotiations that, clearly, are difficult. Accepting the amendment would have indicated to the private sector how far the Minister could go, and no further.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 19 December 1995; c. 94, 97.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what the Minister said in 1995, so I am sure that he will have no difficulty whatever in accepting our amendment today.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed, I hope that, as Chairman, I may be allowed some licence. Some members of the Committee are new to the House and I did not want to interrupt the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). However, I hope that all members of Committees will read the guidance on Standing Committee procedure--I know that every member of the Committee already knows it by heart and will therefore know that it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The reading of speeches is even less suited to a standing committee than to the Chamber; and extracts from documents, quotations, etc. should be reasonably short.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also says that a Chairman has reprimanded a Minister for making too detailed a speech from notes, although the use of notes is acceptable.
<P>
Traditions such as standing to speak in Committee are not only a simple and straighforward matter of courtesy to the Chair, but a means of ensuring that one's words are recorded. More recent generations of politicians have perhaps lost the ability to project their voices and are so used to having microphones under their nose that they sometimes forget that they need to be heard. I hope that members of the Committee will forgive me for saying that at the outset. Some members of Committees think that our procedures are arcane, but in fact they are useful and have evolved, for practical reasons, over a period of time. That is the last Dunwoody lecture for today--I do not intend to continue in that vein, but I think that it was important to state those points.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I shall ask the Committee to resist the amendment. Before doing so, I should like to say that I am sure that I speak for all members of the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody, in saying how privileged we are to have you chairing our proceedings; we spent many a long night together in the Committee stage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which was a very stimulating experience.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am tremendously flattered that a young man of the Minister's brilliance should make such allegations, but I was in fact chairing that Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was going to say that our proceedings this morning may not be as stimulating as those Committee proceedings.
<P>
I want the Committee to resist the amendment for two main reasons. First, the main thrust of the amendment seems to be based on comments I made during the Committee proceedings of what became the Education (Student Loans) Act 1996. I shall explain briefly the significant differences between the measure before us and the proposals contained in that legislation. Secondly, if the amendment were passed, it would create great difficulties, which I shall detail, for the Bill as it stands.
<P>
The 1996 Act, which was introduced as a Bill in 1995, dealt with measures completely different from those contained in the present legislation. It was the previous Government's attempt to introduce a twin-track approach to student loans: the public sector loan held by the Student Loans Company with a private sector loan held by banks or other financial institutions which is the measure that the Government wanted to introduce. That twin-track approach was unattractive to banks and financial institutions and most people knew that the private sector had no interest whatever in administering student loans. We knew that the Government would have to provide subsidies to a sector that was not interested in the proposals and that those subsidies would need to be extremely generous to make the twin-track approach attractive to the private sector. We moved our amendment because the then Government had not received any expressions of interest from the private sector.
<P>
I shall quote briefly from the Committee proceedings of the 1996 Act. In order to explain clearly, on behalf of the then Opposition, the reason that we were proposing that restriction, I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am pointing out that, given the Minister's failure to get private sector institutions interested--as he had to admit last Thursday--we have no faith in his negotiating abilities. For that reason, we are trying to place a restriction in the Bill.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 19 December 1995; c. 96.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I had therefore proposed the restriction for one reason and one reason alone: because the Minister had said during the previous week's proceedings that the private sector had shown no interest in the proposal. In fact, the Bill has inspired much interest in the private sector. No fewer than 20 substantial financial institutions are already involved in the first stage of the competition. As a restriction was appropriate at that time, because of the lack of interest, the genuine competition that is now forthcoming as a result of our proposals will ensure that the subsidy would not need the sort of restriction set out in the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I refer to my second reason why I want the Committee to resist the amendment. The restriction to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``one quarter of the amount originally advanced''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not fit well with a loans portfolio that will often run for a period that extends to 25 years. When we take into account inflation, the amendment would cause enormous practical difficulties in administering the new procedure outlined in the Bill. For those reasons, the amendment should be withdrawn. The Government's position is not inconsistent with the stance that we took when we debated the Education (Student Loans) Act 1996.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. It is disappointing that he missed the main thrust of our argument, which concerns subsidy. I fully understand that the Education (Student Loans) Act 1996 dealt with different loans--those from the private sector to individual students--but we were still concerned with a subsidy. The hon. Gentleman was right to argue at the time that the Secretary of State could not have an open negotiating position and that some limit needed to be placed on it to protect the interests of the taxpayer.
<P>
We are arguing the same today. As Dr. Nicholas Barr said, there is a real danger--despite the fact that, according to the Minister, some 20 financial institutions are interested in bidding for the student debt portfolios--that there will still be a need for a substantial subsidy to underwrite presumed debt.
<P>
The idea of putting a 25 per cent. limit on that subsidy, to use the same phraseology as the Minister, seems reasonable. The hon. Gentleman is now saying, however, that he anticipates that a subsidy greater than 25 per cent. of the existing loan will be offered to private sector institutions. If that is the case, it must be placed clearly on the record that the Government are prepared to give substantial amounts of taxpayers' money to the private sector to fund a shortfall in the current budget.
<P>
I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but I should be grateful if the Minister would bear my comments in mind. We shall reserve our position for the debate on Third Reading. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 2 to 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule agreed to.
<P>
