							<a name="08012328000364"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> Good morning, Mr. Gale. It is a
pleasure to introduce amendments Nos. 103 and 104, which aim to
restrict the use of family intervention tenancies to circumstances in
which a recognised family intervention project approved by the
Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers provides behaviour support
services. Without the amendments, the general reference to behaviour
support services in subsection (3)(b) may enable landlords to use such
highly insecure tenancies to claim that they are providing intensive
support services, when the nature and quality of those services are not
subject to scrutiny. Two separate but identical amendments are
necessary because the clause contains separate provisions for secure
council tenancies and assured housing association or private
tenancies.</div>
					<a name="08012328000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that the Minister accepts that the purpose behind the amendments is to
ensure that action is taken in a proper and measured way. Given the
pressure on time, I will not elaborate unnecessarily and I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s response.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>
					<a name="08012328000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000365"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Mr. Iain Wright):
						</b> Good morning to
you, Mr. Gale, and to the rest of the Committee. May I say
what a pleasure it is to see you back in the Chair.</div>
					<a name="08012328000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now come to amendment No.
103. To be honest, I did not think that we would get this far, but we
have. For the reasons suggested by the hon. Member for St. Ives, I
shall take the two amendments together. As he said, they are identical
and apply to two separate provisions in the clause.</div>
					<a name="08012328000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would have significant implications for the delivery of the
family intervention programme. Although the Department for Children,
Schools and Families and its partners have developed close working
relationships with projects that receive Government funding, that
relationship does not involve formal designation or accreditation. We
would therefore need to consider in some detail how any formal
accreditation would work and to assess the burdens that it would place
on projects. We would not wish to impose rigid criteria on projects if
that served to shackle their innovation or restrict their flexibility
in tailoring individual services to the specific needs of individual
families. For example, it is unclear whether the amendments propose
that projects should be subject to performance management or inspection
as a condition of any designation.</div>
					<a name="08012328000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that there are concerns about the possible misuse of family
intervention tenancies, but I strongly believe that such concerns are
unfounded, and I have a FIT in my constituency. Family intervention
projects continue to prove how successful they are at tackling the root
causes of antisocial behaviour. Over time, similar approaches may come
into existence to provide equally effective behavioural support to
antisocial families, but such approaches may not necessarily be classed
as family intervention projects or receive direct Government funding,
and we do not want them to be unable to include family intervention
tenancies. To that end, we have specified in the Bill that family
intervention tenancies can be used only in the context of behaviour
support services, by which we mean that they must address antisocial
behaviour. That sets the necessary parameters for the use of such
tenancies without creating undue
restrictions.</div>
					<a name="08012328000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
moving the amendment, the hon. Gentleman said&#151;I think that I am
quoting him correctly, but he can always intervene if I have got this
wrong&#151;that these insecure tenancies cause a burden in terms of
any landlord. That is a crucial point, which I want to address on the
record. It is very important to note that family intervention tenancies
can be used only by social landlords, such as local authorities and
registered social landlords, because FITs will be applicable only to
those tenants who have a secure or an assured tenancy. As we are aware
and as we will debate when we consider part 2 of the Bill, both types
of landlord are subject to regulation. Because of that crucial point, I
do not think that we need to consider the new layer of regulation that
the amendments would impose. I hope, therefore, that my explanation has
allayed the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has about the misuse of
family intervention tenancies.</div>

							<a name="08012328000366"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I am grateful. I was seeking for my language to
apply to a wider range of landlords in circumstances where the FIT
measure might be applied. It is reassuring that the Minister is saying
that it would be used only in very narrow circumstances. However, I
hope that the Minister appreciates that there are organisations outside
this House that are concerned that FITs could be used to tip the
balance against the interests of families who, in many circumstances,
the state is trying to
help.</div>
					<a name="08012328000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000367"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That last point is crucial. The state is trying to
help those families. An awful lot of resources are devoted to targeted
and focused help for antisocial families. FITs are voluntary and we may
come on to that issue in the clause stand part debate. I recognise the
sentiment in which the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment. However, the
key point is that we have defined it narrowly to avoid the risk that he
has identified. We are trying to balance that with the need for
flexibility and innovation to ensure that the resources used and the
approaches taken to address the needs of antisocial families are as
targeted as possible. I hope that that reassures
him.</div>
					<a name="08012328000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000368"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I wish to probe the Minister further. This is a
short debate, but I simply want reassurance from him in respect of
circumstances that I am sure he can envisage&#151;certainly I can in
my constituency&#151;in which neighbours have created the
circumstances in which a family have become subject to a FIT. In such
circumstances it is the others who have been victimising them and who
should be the focus of these actions. The family could be the victims
rather than the
perpetrators.</div>
					<a name="08012328000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000369"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
I recognise the example that he raises from my own constituency case
load. However, I must point out that FIPs and FITs are entirely
voluntary. Families are accepted into these support programmes only
after an extraordinarily rigorous process of evaluation to ensure that
they are likely to benefit from it, to weed out that sort of
victimisation&#151;for want of a better term&#151;and to tailor
support to the family&#146;s needs. That is in everybody&#146;s
interests. As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, and as I tried to
make clear earlier on, that takes considerable time and
resources.</div>
					<a name="08012328000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Projects
are established to ensure that long-term changes in behaviour are made
and that families do not give up at the first hurdle. We do not want to
facilitate fast-track evictions for so-called problem families. Any
eviction from a project would be seen as a failure by the agencies
concerned. The latest evidence suggests that very few families are
dropping out of support programmes. We must bear in mind the voluntary
nature of these measures and that families want to engage in this sort
of support programme to get help in addressing their behavioural
issues. The FIT is devised as a temporary tenancy to help that
long-term stability. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012328000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000370"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification and for the reassurance on the circumstances in which
FITs and FIPs will be applied. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>Having received those reassurances on the parameters within which they
operate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08012328000371"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Just before we proceed, I have been looking, as
no doubt hon. Members have been looking, at the schedule before us for
consideration and completion by Thursday 31 January. I think that we
need to concentrate a few
minds.</div>
					<a name="08012328000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am willing,
subject to the staffing of the Committee, to sit, if necessary, this
evening and I am also willing to sit next Tuesday evening. I say that
now because the usual channels may want to consider this proposal
fairly carefully. As Members of the House, we have a duty to the staff
of the House to give them adequate notice if we intend to sit longer
than the allocated hours. We do not need to change the programme
resolution to do that, because we would simply extend the afternoon
sitting. That would entail a break, say, from 7 o&#146;clock until 8
o&#146;clock, because I do not think it is reasonable to expect
people staffing a Committee, either civil servants or indeed the
Chairman, to sit for more than three hours without some type of a
break, for fairly obvious reasons. However, we could sit from 8
o&#146;clock until 10 o&#146;clock and we could sit from 8
o&#146;clock until 10 o&#146;clock next Tuesday. You might like to
consider that as a Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012328000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful if the
usual channels could let me know by the end of the morning, so that I
can let the staff know if you are thinking of sitting later this
evening; next Tuesday is a bit of a moveable feast. I am giving that
advance notice now, simply because hon. Members, should they take that
decision, might wish to look at their own
diaries.</div>

					<a name="08012328000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
these amendments is to ensure that the notice issued to families before
they decide on a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>voluntary basis, as we have just been discussing, whether or not to sign
up to a family intervention project and family intervention tenancy
contains advice as to how families may obtain assistance in relation to
the notice. That will involve directing families to take independent
advice before they reach a decision.</div>
					<a name="08012328000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to stress&#151;I have
done this on a number of occasions this morning, but I think that it is
crucial&#151;that families sign up to FITs on a voluntary basis.
Therefore, it is important, if not vital, that, where they do so, it is
as a result of an informed decision to accept both the support
programme on offer and the insecure tenancy offered in relation to that
support.</div>
					<a name="08012328000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
have every confidence that landlords and projects will ensure that
families are made fully aware of the decision that they are being asked
to make and its potential consequences, to make it incumbent on
landlords to advise families to seek independent advice about the
content of the notice with which they have been issued will further
assist families in working through their decision.</div>
					<a name="08012328000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">These amendments therefore
provide for the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying the

landlord&#146;s action is not antisocial behaviour, but something
else, such as rent arrears. The amendment would ensure that fast-track
eviction proceedings available for family intervention tenancies could
be used for antisocial behaviour reasons
only.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012328000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process for
family intervention projects and tenancies has been laid out by the
Government, which hopefully we all understand. However, under the Bill,
if the landlord decides to continue with proceedings for possession
after following the process for family intervention tenancies, the
county court cannot examine the reasons for doing so. We are concerned
about the inflexibility there, and the lack of discretion to refuse an
order raises alarm bells for us. We seek the Minister&#146;s
perspective on that, because we cannot believe that it is right, nor
the Government&#146;s intention, to create a process so inflexible
that it could be a breach of natural justice for the tenant. Although
landlords could use the provision in many ways, it goes against the
spirit of what I think the Government are trying to do with this
legislation. Shelter feels the same, and on its behalf I ask the
Minister to share his perspective and to take on board what I think is
a fairly common-sense modification to this part of the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000378"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I disagree with the amendment, although I
appreciate the manner in which the hon. Gentleman moved it. If we
accepted the amendment, it would allow the courts to postpone, stay or
suspend an order for possession granted in respect of a common law
tenancy. As I think that he said, currently that is not the case. A
court must award possession if it is satisfied that due process has
been followed, and set the date on which the landlord can gain
possession of the property.</div>
					<a name="08012328000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, for instance, a family
wilfully refuse to pay rent for the family intervention project
accommodation that they are occupying, having voluntarily agreed to do
so, the amendment would mean that the courts had the power to decide
whether, and on what terms, the tenant might remain in the property.
That would create a situation similar to that of secure or assured
tenancies. I believe strongly that that would seriously undermine our
proposal that family intervention tenancies should be common law
tenancies. We want to provide landlords with greater flexibility in
arranging tenancies for families who have voluntarily accepted support
and who are housed in specialist
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="08012328000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Family
intervention projects have been proven to deliver notable successes in
helping families address the root causes of antisocial behaviour. To
give courts the discretion proposed by this amendment would threaten
the use of family intervention tenancies as an effective 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>tool in encouraging families to comply with the terms of their support
contract. In other words, in voluntarily accepting a family
intervention tenancy, they should be aware of the consequences of their
actions. If they subsequently refuse to meet the conditions of the
tenancy, the landlord may move to evict
swiftly.</div>
					<a name="08012328000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
what the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, however, and his
concerns about clause 261. We are mindful already of the need to guard
against the misuse of family intervention tenancies and have provided
safeguards in this clause, including a right to a review of the reason
why eviction is being sought under a local authority family
intervention tenancy. In addition to that review procedure, it is
possible, if the tenant deems it necessary, to apply for judicial
review of the reason for a decision to
evict.</div>
					<a name="08012328000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one accepts
the premise, which I do not, that the courts should be given discretion
where possession under a family intervention tenancy is sought, I
question the validity of removing that discretion solely where
possession is sought on antisocial behaviour grounds. I think that the
hon. Gentleman made that point himself, so in some respects I am making
his argument for him, which was not my intention. However, it would
mean that courts would have discretion over matters such as rent
arrears, with which it is relatively easy to demonstrate matters of
fact, but not in cases of antisocial behaviour, in which issues are
often much more complex and open to subjectivity. On that basis, I
disagree with the amendment. I think that we have covered this matter
adequately in the Bill, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012328000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000379"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> Well, Mr. Gale, the Minister makes
the case for the amendment, and then asks me to withdraw it. In
fairness to the Government, they have shown active recognition of the
link between antisocial behaviour and the social needs of
perpetrators&#151;we all agree on that. Also, Shelter has done some
research to back up the effectiveness of taking a support approach, so
there is no disagreement there. In terms of enforcement, communities
need protection, and it is appropriate for housing providers to use
measures available to them to enforce the responsibilities laid out in
tenancy agreements. However, the Minister&#146;s argument goes wrong
on its non-acceptance that this approach balances the legislation
against the tenant and in favour of the landlord. The FIPs are
voluntary, as he says, but surely this is a significant disincentive to
families taking part in the project, not least because it seems to make
their tenancies less secure.</div>
					<a name="08012328000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000380"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Is not that precisely the point? The voluntary
nature&#151;I remind the hon. Gentleman of our discussions on
previous amendments&#151;helps to strengthen the information provided
to families, so that they are fully aware of the consequences. Families
have to enter the process voluntarily.</div>
					<a name="08012328000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000381"></a>Lembit
&#214;pik:
						</b> That involves an assumption that every family
will have a full and confident grasp of the legislation and terms of
the tenancy, but such families often are not good advocates for their
own best interests. In some senses, that is why they have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>difficulties in the first place. The Minister is ignoring the reality
that various families will not be able to digest and interpret the
legislation in their interests and are therefore susceptible to being
victimised by its effective use by others. The notice to quit on a
family intervention tenancy can be issued for any reason, not solely
for antisocial behaviour. That is wrong.</div>
					<a name="08012328000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test as to what behaviour
would merit possession is not robust enough. Landlords often feel that
possession is merited, but that view has not always been backed by the
courts. The position taken here will actively alter circumstances for
many families. That is why the courts should have the power to exercise
discretion when antisocial behaviour is not the basis on which the
landlord seeks possession.</div>
					<a name="08012328000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">This part of the legislation
was conceived primarily to deal with antisocial issues, but mission
creep has meant that it now has a broader remit. We are uncomfortable
about the clause, as is Shelter. In other circumstances, I would push
the matter to a vote, but I shall not do so, given the shortage of
time. However, I give notice that we may return to this issue on
Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000383"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> This important clause enables the Secretary of
State to empower housing authorities to offer equity
loans&#151;interest-free loans which pay a percentage of the market
value when the property in question is sold. Owners of flats in blocks,
who are known as leaseholders, cannot maintain and improve the fabric
of the building and estate grounds. Instead, their landlord does that
and reclaims a share of the cost by levying major works service
charges. Owners of ex-council flats bought under the right to buy or on
the open market will remain as leaseholders and will therefore remain
responsible, under the terms of their leases, for contributing to the
cost of repairs, maintenance and improvements.</div>
					<a name="08012328000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">A survey by London councils
suggests that up to March 2007, of 154,000 council leaseholders in 26
London boroughs, 9,100 have received or expect to receive major works
bills for &#163;10,000 or more. I have met hon. Members with regard
to this who are concerned about leaseholders facing high bills for
major works. Clause 265 widens the range of options that landlords can
use to assist their leaseholders in paying such bills.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>
					<a name="08012328000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 450B of the Housing Act
1985 enables landlords at their discretion to offer leaseholders
interest-bearing loans. The clause amends section 450C of the 1985 Act
regarding the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to make regulations.
The Housing (Service Charge Loans) Regulations 1992 already allow
housing authorities to offer loans for service charges on properties
bought under right to buy. In specified circumstances, loans to the
original right-to-buy purchasers are mandatory. Interest must then be
charged, and administrative expenses up to &#163;100 may also be
charged to the
borrower.</div>
					<a name="08012328000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations also give housing authorities discretion to offer loans to
help with service charge bills on terms of their choosing to any of
their leaseholders, but it is not clear whether they are currently able
to offer equity loan terms, or whether they must charge
interest.</div>
					<a name="08012328000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">A working
group of London boroughs concluded in 2005 that if landlords had the
option of offering interest-free equity loans, it would increase the
likelihood that leaseholders would be able to pay the money that they
owe. Interest-bearing loans may be unattractive to leaseholders because
the proportion of interest to principal grows over time so much that
the borrower becomes liable to repay twice or even three times the
amount originally
borrowed.</div>
					<a name="08012328000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
an example, albeit I have to admit an extreme one. If a leaseholder
faced a bill for major works for &#163;30,000 and there was a period
of 15 years before the property was sold, at an interest rate of 7 per
cent. the amount due would be &#163;82,771&#151;nearly three times
the amount borrowed. However, with equity share loans, the amount to be
repaid will depend on the movement of the market value of the property
over the period of the
loan.</div>
					<a name="08012328000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If leaseholders
are unable to pay what they owe, the landlord has to make up the
difference. Although it is always open to landlords to take the
leaseholder to court and obtain a judgment that can be enforced by a
charge on the property, it is clearly preferable to all concerned if
that can be avoided. It is in the interests of leaseholders themselves,
and of taxpayers and tenants, that landlords can offer the widest
possible range of payment options. The amendment to the regulations
which may be made as a result of the clause will place no obligation on
landlords. Instead, it will add to the range of options available to
them to use if, in their judgment, the circumstances justify
it.</div>
					<a name="08012328000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
regarding valuation of the property will enable the Secretary of State
to amend the 1992 regulations so that if a landlord and leaseholder
agree to a loan on equity share terms, an impartial assessment can be
made by district valuers of the market value both on commencement and
eventual payment of the loan. Provision can also be made for paying for
the district valuer&#146;s
services.</div>
					<a name="08012328000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
27 seeks to give local authorities and registered social landlords the
power to buy a share&#151;formally, an equitable interest&#151;in
flats that they have let on long leases. The power is to be used for
the purpose of assisting the owner of such a flat to meet some or all
of the service charges that he or she is liable to pay. The new clause
fulfils the Government&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>commitment in our statement to Parliament on 29 March 2007 to give
landlords such a power. Under the new clause, the Government, or, in
Wales, the Welsh Assembly, may make regulations that give landlords
this power and also impose conditions where appropriate on how it will
work in practice.</div>
					<a name="08012328000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have specified that the landlord must pay the purchase price by
cancelling part or all of the service charge that the leaseholder is
liable to pay. This is to ensure that the money is used for this
purpose only. The purchase price will be a price related to market
value that is acceptable to both the landlord and the leaseholder.
Either party may ask the district valuer to determine the value. The
regulations may specify, as I mentioned, that the district
valuer&#146;s costs in such cases will be met by the leaseholder and
deducted from the purchase
price.</div>
					<a name="08012328000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should make
it clear that the power to buy an equity share is not mandatory. It
will be one more way in which landlords can help leaseholders to meet
their obligations, and entering into such an agreement will be entirely
voluntary for both parties. The Government are not seeking to specify
in detail any of the terms of the contract. It will be up to the
parties to reach agreement, but we intend to provide a framework so
that landlords have the necessary powers.</div>
					<a name="08012328000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
basis of the hardship that some leaseholders face as a result of high
service charges, I am keen to help as much as possible. I have met
representatives of London boroughs to discuss the matter and instructed
officials to consider using existing resources, such as funding from
the regional housing pot and the private sector renewal fund, to target
and assist leaseholders who might not be able to pay their service
charges by any other means. That is consistent with our aim that those
funds should help those in need and on low
incomes.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="08012328000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to point
out, though, that many local authority landlords already offer a range
of payment options, but if none of those appear suitable, landlords
will be able to use the power introduced by the new clause to purchase
equitable shares if they and the leaseholders agree that it is the best
way to help the leaseholders meet their obligations under the
lease.</div>
					<a name="08012328000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new power
to purchase equity shares will be introduced by means of regulations,
and amendment No. 132 ensures that the new clause will be commenced by
order when the regulations are laid. I hope that I have made the
situation clear and that the Committee will accept the new clause and
amendment.</div>

Housing Act 1985 provide powers to the Secretary of State and Welsh
Ministers to grant consent to a local authority to dispose of tenanted
properties. As already mentioned, section 135 of the Leasehold Reform,
Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 requires that a local authority
first be accepted by the Secretary of State on an annual disposals
programme before seeking her consent to a large-scale disposal under
sections 34 or 43.</div>
					<a name="08012328000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 9
repeals section 135, but amends sections 34 and 43 to preserve certain
requirements and definitions otherwise lost. One requirement is that
the cost to the Exchequer of any large-scale disposal be considered
before consent is given, and the amendments provide powers to make
orders with respect to such disposals. The orders might amend the
number of homes considered to constitute a large-scale disposal, which
is currently 500 or more, or the time period during which a large-scale
disposal might be deemed to have taken place, which is currently five
years ending with the date of the disposal. There are other
transitional and supplementary provisions as deemed
necessary.</div>
					<a name="08012328000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment simply makes it clear that any such order, if made by the
Secretary of State, will be subject 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>to annulment in pursuance of a resolution by either House, while any
such order made by Welsh Ministers will be subject to annulment in
pursuance of a resolution of the National Assembly for Wales. As with
the earlier group of amendments, this is a technical matter to take
into account the devolution settlement. I hope, therefore, that the
Committee will accept the amendment.</div>

						</b> The Minister is probably not aware that there
was a huge amount of debate on the relative jurisdiction of the Welsh
Assembly and the Secretary of State for Wales following the most recent
Government of Wales Bill. In essence, the argument was that those most
in favour of devolution were concerned that the Secretary of State had,
at least in theory, the power to disregard the wishes of the Welsh
Assembly. Conceptually, given the technical elements of the
legislation, that could recentralise decision making in Westminster
regardless of the wishes of the Assembly.</div>
					<a name="08012328000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that the Minister
may not be able to answer the question now, but in that case I would be
grateful if he would write to me. Can he clarify whether there is any
situation in which an order made by Welsh Ministers could be annulled
or modified by the Secretary of State for Wales? I stress again; he may
not have the answer now, but, in the Welsh context, it would help me to
have an answer at some point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000394"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Amendment No. 154 is a consequential amendment
necessitated by amendments to the Housing Act 1985 caused by Schedule 9
to the Bill. Section 133 of the Housing Act 1988 deals with onward
disposals of homes. It requires that should an organisation, which in
practically every case is a registered social landlord, want to dispose
of homes that a local authority has transferred to it&#151;as a
result of the Secretary of State granting her consent to do so, under
section 34 or 43 of the Housing Act 1985&#151;it must obtain the
consent of the Secretary of State before doing
so.</div>
					<a name="08012328000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement was introduced to give local authority tenants whose homes
were passing out of local authority ownership some comfort that, should
their new landlords want to sell on their homes, the Secretary of State
would ensure that they were properly protected. Section 133 requires
that before granting consent the Secretary of State should take into
account matters considered when granting the original consent under
section 34 or 43. The amendment does not change the position; indeed,
it preserves it. It is necessary because the current provision refers
to section 135 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development
Act 1993, which schedule 9
repeals.</div>
					<a name="08012328000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment requires the Secretary of State to consider the Exchequer
costs of a further disposal because that should have no impact on
Exchequer costs. If a local authority makes the onward transfer, so the
transfer is the first transfer away from local authority ownership, the
Secretary of State will be required to give consent under section 32 or
43 of the Housing Act 1985, and will consider the Exchequer costs in
that event and at that time. Value for money and any effect on the
public purse is already considered as part of the consent
process.</div>
					<a name="08012328000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
part of amendment No. 155 is simply a clarification. Schedule 9 ensures
that definitions contained in section 135 of the Leasehold Reform,
Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 are preserved by inserting them
into section 136 of that Act. The amendment makes it clear that the
reference to the Secretary of State in the transplanted definitions
should be read in the same way as references to the Secretary of State
elsewhere in that
section.</div>
					<a name="08012328000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
part of amendment No. 155 relates to definitions of social landlords
and registered charities for the purposes of section 51 in schedule 1
to the Housing Act 1996. The definitions include a body that had been
the recipient of a large-scale disposal of property by a local
authority under section 135 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act 1993.</div>
					<a name="08012328000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said several times
this morning, schedule 9 repeals section 135 but retains the definition
of a large-scale disposal through amendments to section 34 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>or 43 of the 1985 Act. The amendment therefore amends the definitions in
the Housing Act 1996 to ensure that they include organisations that
have inherited a large-scale disposal of stock either under section 135
or in future under the amended sections 34 or
43.</div>
					<a name="08012328000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have

in relation to the matter
specified.</div>
					<a name="08012328000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
under the Housing Act 1996 is used by the Department for Communities
and Local Government and the Ministry of Justice to provide grant in
aid to fund the Leasehold Advisory Service, known as LEASE, an
executive, non-departmental public body which I am sure that hon.
Members have contacted in relation to constituency matters. LEASE also
provides an important front-line advisory role in respect of
residential leasehold law as it affects England and Wales, as well as
other leasehold-related functions.</div>
					<a name="08012328000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Welsh Assembly Government

these amendments came to light, Mr. Gale, after clauses 268

important in that they allow the clauses to achieve their original
intention. Amendments Nos. 117 and 118 allow funding to be given for
the provision of advice, information and a dispute resolution service
for leaseholders and the leasehold sector in general in relation to a
wider range of leasehold-related
matters.</div>
					<a name="08012328000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was
concern that the advice had to be restricted to legal matters. The
amendments, combined with clause 268 itself, would create a funding
provision that is more appropriate to today&#146;s needs, and to the
provision of good, independent general advice and related services for
leaseholders and the leasehold sector in general.</div>
					<a name="08012328000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for amendments Nos. 119 to
122, the original intention underlying clause 273 was to enable the
Lord Chancellor to fund a wider range of services, including
information, training and dispute resolution in relation to residential
commonholds. These services will supplement the funding of general
advice. They will increase knowledge of commonhold and improve the
quality of the experience of living in a commonhold. The amendments
also make it clear that the funding may be used even if the matter at
issue is not strictly a matter of commonhold law narrowly
defined.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I am sorry, as we are making
good progress, to slow things down a
little.</div>
					<a name="08012328000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 269
deals with housing revenue account subsidy and, although it is only one
clause, it is quite an important element of the Bill. I am not sure
that we have learnt an awful lot about what Government plans are in
relation to the subsidy. I want to draw the Minister a little bit more
on what the Government want to do in this area.</div>
					<a name="08012328000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the oral evidence session,
the Local Government Association representatives said that in principle
they would like to see some reform, particularly where money is taken
from some local authorities to subsidise other local authorities. In
the current year just under &#163;3 million will go from the Poole
housing partnership into the national subsidy arrangements, which is
&#163;12.03 per tenant per week. Housing is a problem in Poole and
one would prefer at least some of those resources to stay in the local
area.</div>
					<a name="08012328000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Library has
provided me with the information, Mr. Gale, that in 2006-07
the total subsidy under the housing revenue account subsidy
arrangements was &#163;707,727,683, of which &#163;562,492,298 came
from the Government. The point of my concern is the &#163;115,235,385
that came out of some local authorities to subsidise other local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012328000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
parties accept that need has to be a major element in the provision of
housing and there are special problems in central London and some of
our bigger cities, but I do think that the Government should explain
why they are taking money paid by tenants in rent out of some areas to
subsidise rent-paying tenants in other areas.</div>
					<a name="08012328000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some anomalies. I
have the list that shows what the Government call the negative subsidy
entitlement, which is the money that people put in. We are not
necessarily talking about leafy suburbs putting money into the
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="08012328000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
pick up a few examples. In 2006-07 the London borough of Barking
contributed just under &#163;11 million of its tenants&#146; rent
to the national subsidy scheme. I seem to remember that there was a
question relating to housing and the British National party in the
borough of Barking in east London. One wonders 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>whether putting &#163;11 million into a national subsidy scheme from
rents paid by the tenants in that area is a sensible
idea.</div>
					<a name="08012328000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Bolsover,
just under &#163;4 million goes from council tenants into the
national scheme; in Castle Morpeth it is &#163;500,000; in
Chesterfield it is just under &#163;3 million; Chester le Street
contributes &#163;1.8 million. Those are not necessarily the leafiest
areas. From the tenants of Durham, &#163;1,671,546 was used to
subsidise people elsewhere. I am not familiar with Durham, it may be a
very leafy place in the north-east, but I suspect that there is a need
for those funds. I can tell the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd&#146;s Bush that Hillingdon contributes &#163;8 million to
the arrangements. Welwyn Hatfield gives under &#163;12 million. That
is quite a lot of money from a relatively small
town.</div>
					<a name="08012328000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would really
like the Government to set out their plans. The largest element of
subsidy comes from the taxpayer. If housing need is the key matter, it
is right that the taxpayer should fund it through the national system
of taxation, but &#163;115 million comes from contributions from the
majority of districts and boroughs, in order to subsidise relatively
few but, I suspect, quite needy
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08012328000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to know how the Government want to proceed under the clause. They
evidently have some thoughts about reforming the system. I cannot see
an argument for taking money paid by some tenants in
rent&#151;although perhaps not in some areas that have their own
problems, such as ex-coalfield areas&#151;and using that money
principally to subsidise some of our large cities and central London.
The Government should look at reforming that situation. Given the
amount of money, even to express their intention of phasing out the
subsidy over a period of years would be helpful for authorities that
are making a contribution to the national pool. When I talk to my own
housing authority, I am told that if the money were allowed to remain
locally it could help deal with voids in maintaining properties, and
could also be an income stream for new
build.</div>
					<a name="08012328000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we accept
the principle of localism&#151;that it is better that money raised
locally remains local&#151;there is not a strong argument for taking
the &#163;115 million in 2006-07 that I have mentioned from
authorities in subsidy arrangements. I know that there is concern among
not only Conservative but Liberal Democrat and Labour authorities about
the way the scheme operates. I do not think that it is particularly
fair, and I hope that the Government can clarify under clause 269 what
sort of proposals they will be making for
reform.</div>

George:
						</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Poole on
initiating the debate on this matter. There is certainly a perceived
injustice among those authorities that lose out under the measure.
Given that there is also a perceived lack of transparency in the way in
which resources to be transferred between authorities are calculated,
those authorities that lose out under this measure have little
motivation to comply. All the incentives, in fact, work against a just
system; the justice of social housing finance needs to be clearer.
Those authorities that are losing out, as the hon. Member for Poole
quite rightly identified, clearly wish to have the matter addressed. I
hope that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>Government will address that point on Report and perhaps make clear how
that perceived injustice will be
corrected.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I welcome
the Government&#146;s intention to look at the housing revenue
account, and I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Poole for
carrying out such assiduous research into my constituency. It was
enormously helpful, so thank
you.</div>
					<a name="08012328000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
councils have signalled that it would be very helpful if they could
spend surpluses in their revenue accounts locally. It could transform
their ability to carry out repairs and bring houses up to the decent
homes standard. It could also create reinvestment in local social
housing. I thank the Minister, therefore, for considering the matter,
and look forward to what he has to say about changes that might be
made.</div>
					<a name="08012328000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012328000400"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I, too, welcome clause
269. In future years, I think that we will look back on it as possibly
one of the most important parts of the Bill. As I understand it, it
will provide the ability to exclude housing authorities from the
housing revenue accounts subsidy arrangements, for either some or all
of their properties. That could be done not just for existing
properties but for those yet to be built, which is quite an important
consideration. I look on that as a decentralisation measure that will
give housing authorities more local control over decisions on future
investment and critically&#151;I shall come back to this&#151;over
decisions on income received and, in particular, on the setting of rent
levels.</div>
					<a name="08012328000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Poole mentioned, the clause also maintains the current
national redistributive system, which, as a London Member, I support,
given the particular difficulties in London and in urban areas in
general. That system ensures that the share of overall housing
resources nationwide is maintained. When people say to me, &#147;The
big London authorities, and in particular some of the inner London
authorities, receive a subsidy of about &#163;15 per tenant&#148;,
I point out that rent levels in inner London are significantly greater
than in almost any other part of the
country.</div>
					<a name="08012328000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim is to
maintain the fiscal neutrality of the redistributive system, and we
could get into the equations for net present values and all the rest.
However, I shall focus on the important point. According to figures
from 2005, 82 per cent. of housing authorities control 63 per cent. of
the stock and they receive no subsidy from the system. So they could
choose&#151;one hopes&#151;to opt out of the current subsidy
arrangements. However, some of those authorities are concerned that the
additional debt that they will have to take on through the net present
value calculation will make it difficult for them to exercise that
choice on their current incomes. Will the Minister address that point?
What lessons has he learnt that could assist authorities that wish to
exercise their right to exclude themselves from the HRA
arrangements?</div>
					<a name="08012328000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most
important aspect, and one that has not really been touched on, is the
desire of many local councils to build new houses to meet the housing
need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>in this country. Estimates are relatively modest. As we know, for quite
some time there has been no real council house building&#151;there
have been a couple of hundred houses here or there, but effectively the
councils do not make a contribution. This measure will enable a modest
increase to something in the region of 2,500 to 3,000 council houses,
which I welcome, although I accept that it may be just the
start.</div>
					<a name="08012328000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In welcoming
the clause, my second question to the Minister is about the pilot
schemes that are in place with a number of local authorities. Can he
give us a reassurance that he will continue to look at the issue and,
where possible and where value for money can be achieved, he will
welcome more council house building as a contribution to the
country&#146;s overall need?</div>

							<b class="B">Grant
Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): I rise to thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Poole for his great research and for initiating a
debate on this subject. This is an incredibly complex area and the
other day I heard the Minister for Housing acknowledge that complexity.
Once we start talking about negative subsidy arrangements, the mind
starts to boggle, not just for lay people like us, but for the housing
officers and finance officers in councils up and down the country who
scratch their heads to try to get to the bottom of these very detailed
arrangements. It is clearly a matter that requires Government
attention, and I was pleased to hear the Minister for Housing give an
undertaking to do that the other day. I am curious as to why it is not
included within the current legislation&#151;perhaps the Bill could
have gone further in starting to resolve the problem.</div>
					<a name="08012328000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is incredibly difficult for
local authorities. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole mentioned my own
constituency of Welwyn Hatfield&#151;a small borough in what I am
sure the Government believe to be leafy Hertfordshire. In fact, it is a
place with very significant housing needs. One of my wards, Peartree
ward, is one of the most deprived and I would challenge the Minister,
or anyone else, to come to Welwyn Hatfield and visit that deprived ward
and not to come away believing that it is an area with significant
need.</div>
					<a name="08012328000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012328000402"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Raynsford</b> (Greenwich and Woolwich) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman alluded to the complexity of the housing revenue account
subsidy system. Does he recognise that the fact that Welwyn Hatfield is
not a recipient of subsidy is a reflection of the historical pattern of
the provision of the housing stock by a new town development
corporation that did not result in the local authority having to
acquire the same level of debt, and therefore entitlement to subsidy,
that would apply in other areas? It is purely because of those historic
circumstances that his authority does not acquire subsidy. It is
precisely that pattern which relates to the debt of individual
authorities, and therefore subsidy entitlement, and which has created a
framework that looks so bizarre.</div>
					<a name="08012328000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000403"></a>Grant
Shapps:
						</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich for that intervention. His knowledge and
interest in the detail of housing is recognised across the House. He is

<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>absolutely right about the historic nature of the formation of what are
effectively two new towns&#151;Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield.
However, to say that today&#146;s residents must for ever pay for
some historic creation of housing a long time ago&#151;last year in
2006-07, the negative subsidy amounted to close on &#163;12 million,
and this year it is even more&#151;is, I think, unfair on current
residents of a borough such as mine and many others across the country.
We must eventually recognise that it is unfair to continue paying out
in support of some notional argument about the way in which the housing
was originally created.</div>
					<a name="08012328000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The modern-day reality is that
not only does a council such as mine find itself in extreme financial
difficulty as a result of the complexities of the negative subsidy
arrangements, but this year in particular, the arrangements have not
been made known to local authorities in order to allow them to plan.
That is unacceptable. As I understand it, they would usually have a
good idea before the new year. This year the announcements have come
much later. I ask the Minister to recognise the problems that that
creates in setting the council tax for the year ahead.</div>
					<a name="08012328000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is widely acknowledged that
there are problems with the current system. I welcome the
Government&#146;s view on reviewing the process and look forward to
the Minister&#146;s further comments on the
subject.</div>
					<a name="08012328000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000404"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I have enjoyed this debate. I agree with my hon.
Friend the Member for Edmonton when he says that, of all the clauses in
the Bill, this will be highlighted as one of real historic
significance. I know that officials always faint when I start saying
this, but, as a former borough councillor, I am very excited to say
that this is the return of the council house. We are trying to remove
from local authorities the disincentives to build homes. I shall just
turn around and check whether any officials have
fainted.</div>
					<a name="08012328000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as a
former borough councillor, I am excited by the fact that local
authorities will have a direct role, where it proves value for money,
in the delivery of an increased supply of housing in their area. That
is a tremendous challenge, but it is also a tremendous opportunity,
and, as a Minister with responsibility for housing, I am pleased that I
have been able to help facilitate it by pushing the Bill
forward.</div>
					<a name="08012328000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">This one
clause provides the necessary legislative changes to enable us to
implement two important and inter-related policies. First, as hon.
Members have said, it will allow us to exclude the whole of a
council&#146;s stock from the housing revenue account subsidy system,
subject to agreement with the respective council. This is generally
known as self-financing. Under the arrangement, the council would in
future keep all its income from rents and other charges rather than
paying surpluses or receiving subsidies based on a set of allowances.
That will allow local authorities to service debt in order to build new
council houses.</div>
					<a name="08012328000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have mentioned the six pilots. Evidence from them seems to
suggest that self-financing could provide a range of benefits. I shall
highlight just some of them. The pilots have suggested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>that there is the potential to deliver more efficiencies, to deliver
better asset management, to lever in more private investment and,
crucially, to create opportunities for local authorities to add new
supply.</div>
					<a name="08012328000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several hon.
Members have spoken about how short-term planning does not help anybody
in moving forward with council stock. The hon. Member for Poole spoke
about that extraordinarily well&#151;in that respect, he crossed the
Floor. The modelling seems to suggest that we could have efficiencies
of some 10 to 20 per cent. from better planning of investment and
repairs. For example, moving from piecemeal, reactive maintenance to a
more planned longer-term cycle of major and minor repairs could help
cut costs.</div>
					<a name="08012328000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was taken
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s discussion of the fact that the HRA
subsidy system is a national system based on how much there is to
spend, how much there is a need to spend and how much money local
authorities need to maintain and repair their stock. I am conscious of
the fact that there are local considerations to take into account. The
pilots seem to suggest that self-financing could provide a direct link
between what people pay in rents and charges and what they receive in
services. Therefore, it could allow future decisions to reflect local
choices and increase local
accountability.</div>
					<a name="08012328000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is more ability and more scope for better strategic asset management,
including a better phasing of replacements, disposals and major estate
remodelling schemes to meet changing local needs, and, crucially, there
is more scope for increased investment. The pilots suggest something
like a doubling of projected levels of capital investment over 30 years
through things such as private finance, additional prudential borrowing
and additional rents from new-builds and reprovision. So there is great
potential that we need to tap into, and I am keen to do
that.</div>
					<a name="08012328000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
clause will enable us to exclude specified properties within a council
from the HRA subsidy system, including future properties. Again, this
will be subject to agreement with the council. It will be used to allow
councils to apply to exclude new homes added to the HRA in
future.</div>
					<a name="08012328000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">No provision
is made within the HRA subsidy allowance for financing the capital
costs of new council housing. The Bill&#146;s provisions will
therefore enable councils, subject to entering into an agreement, to
keep the full rent from a new home and to use the element not needed to
meet the running costs to help finance the costs incurred in providing
that new home.</div>
					<a name="08012328000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amount of extra money that that will give the council will depend on
the type of housing provided, but on average, as we have mentioned in
relation to the redistribution element, the subsidy system assumes that
running costs are equivalent to about three quarters of the rental
income. The remainder is pooled and redistributed to support HRA debt
in councils across England, but in the future could be used to finance
the debt incurred in providing the new homes. Again, there is
tremendous scope and potential there.</div>
					<a name="08012328000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we have to
recognise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton mentioned, that
even the full income from a social rent will not be enough to service
the debt to finance the provision of the new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>home. In every case, as has been mentioned in our consideration of the
Bill, we would expect a council to provide land on which to build the
homes and there could be scope for a community land trust to help push
that deal forward. Further capital subsidy might be provided from some
of the capital receipts.</div>
					<a name="08012328000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many cases, it will still be
better value to join up with a registered social landlord to deliver
the new housing in order to benefit from the levering in of private
finance. Where a council wants to do its own development and give
direct provision, the clause will ensure that, as with an RSL scheme,
the business case can be made on the basis of the full return from the
investment. That will make a significant difference, which we think
will encourage more councils to consider that option. I suggest that it
is an extremely exciting
era.</div>
					<a name="08012328000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alongside the
provisions in the Bill, the Government believe that we need to look
more widely at the system for financing council housing. I pay tribute
to what the hon. Member for Poole said with regard to that. The hon.
Member for Welwyn Hatfield mentioned my right hon. Friend the Minister
for Housing, who last week during oral questions on the Floor of the
House mentioned that after we discuss the RHA subsidy system we need to
lie down with a wet towel around our heads, and she is absolutely
right. That is why she announced a review of the HRA subsidy scheme on
12 December. I have provided copies of that statement for members of
the Committee so that they are fully aware of what is going on. The
written ministerial statement that my right hon. Friend provided sets
out the form and purpose of the review.</div>
					<a name="08012328000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to address the concerns
that the hon. Member for Poole mentioned. I do not want to pre-empt the
finding of the review during its early stages, but I think that we need
to establish a long-term, sustainable system for financing council
housing that enables councils to plan, not for the short term, but
effectively for the long term. The current system relies too much on
short-term funding decisions that are based on an assessment of
short-term expenditure needs. It is in no one&#146;s interests for
that to continue.</div>
					<a name="08012328000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield that the annual subsidy
determination process has become more difficult as we balance competing
and conflicting interests from tenants, taxpayers, landlords and
government. We need a longer-term settlement that is fair, as far as
possible, to all of those groups, and the review will help us to
achieve that.</div>
					<a name="08012328000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to say much more on this significant clause. It has been an
incredibly interesting debate and we are entering an exciting era that
has a longer-term perspective on the HRA system. We need to get things
exactly right on competing and conflicting priorities. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Edmonton mentioned, moving away from an era when
we were building 245 council houses a year to one when we will build
several thousand a year at least is an important step that will help
improve housing supply and ensure that we address the country&#146;s
acute housing needs. That will ensure that council housing can have a
direct role in the provision of housing if there is the political will
for it to do so and if it provides value for money. This is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>a great opportunity and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about
this.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> I support the clause. I think that every hon.
Member has had somebody come into their surgery who has returned from
one of the world&#146;s conflict areas having fought bravely for this
country and that person is surprised to find themselves at the bottom
of the housing ladder. In many cases, they are worse off than somebody
who has been permanently within the area. Two different problems
occur.</div>
					<a name="08012328000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, when
somebody is in the armed forces they are probably not much thinking
about the need to gather and gain points within a local authority to
rise up the housing need scale. Secondly, often the nature of going
away and fighting in the armed forces means that you come back and your
life is not as it was when you left. In particular, the area that you
call home is ill defined to the extent that there is not a home
authority for that member of the armed forces. There is a case that I
can think of in my constituency and, speaking to hon. Members, I know
that cases are found elsewhere. It becomes unclear which authority they
should be applying to and I have come across instances where no
authority is initially prepared even to add that individual to its list
of people in housing need. That is unsatisfactory for a group of people
who have risked their lives on behalf of this country, as is the
secondary point that even when they are recognised by an authority
because there is a link to the area, they find themselves at the bottom
of the list and starting from scratch. The amendment addresses that
issue. In areas with significant housing need&#151;in the south and
elsewhere&#151;points need to accumulate, sometimes to over 100
points, in a local authority area, before there is any chance of being
housed at all. It is not a coincidence that the people that I have met
working in homelessness and rough sleeping have so often had experience
in the armed forces before becoming homeless. I think that one in five
people who sleep  in the streets, for example, have been in the
armed forces.</div>

include mental health, losing the camaraderie and the
institutionalisation of being in the armed forces. Does he accept that
those, and not the issues that thankfully are being rectified by the

She is right that the issues that contribute towards homelessness,
including among former members of the armed forces, are incredibly
complex. Any attempt to pretend that there is one silver
bullet&#151;an individual thing that one can do&#151;or one single
cause is hugely misguided. Of course, one factor is the amount of
social housing provision. It remains a fact that in every year of the
past 10 years less social housing has been built than in every year of
the previous 18. That means that the amount of housing available for
people coming back from conflicts has diminished. It affects people
across the picture, particularly those returning from
conflict.</div>

The hon. Gentleman has a habit of throwing in statistics as soundbites.
Does he accept that on social housing, the rot set in with the decline
in council house building? There is a very useful table in the Unison
briefing, showing that, in 1979, some 75,000 council houses were being
built. Now, belatedly perhaps, the Government are addressing the issue,

The local authority must not only accept them on to its list, but go a
little further than the clause by acknowledging that their need is

clause is about ensuring that access to council 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>accommodation or social housing should be available on the basis of need
rather than local connection? We are remedying a change made by a
Conservative Government in 1996, which imposed a residence test that is
unhelpful to members of the armed forces. It was not in the original
Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977, which sought to meet
people&#146;s needs without that consideration. We are now remedying
a mistake that the previous Conservative Government
made.</div>

Shapps:
						</b> I am grateful for the intervention, but I shall
leave it to others who were around at the time to discuss previous
Acts. I am very pleased, however, to see the provision in the Bill. The
big difference is that, in the past decade, our armed forces have been
sent to war far more than in any recent period. Those wars have
continued for a long time, and service has been distant from this
country, so the issue has been brought into much sharper focus. I
certainly support the clause, but I urge the Minister to go further and
not only create a connection with the local authority, but prioritise
the housing needs of those returning from armed
conflict.</div>

						<a name="08012328000416"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Gwynne</b> (Denton and Reddish) (Lab): I, too, welcome the
provisions in the clause and the way in which it alters the provisions
of the 1996 Act. Like the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield, I understand
that, under current housing legislation, it is often difficult for
members of the armed forces who are nearing the end of service or
returning to the UK to show that they have a local connection with the
district council area where they have been serving, living or are
returning to. Since becoming a Member, I have had a small number of
such cases in my constituency casework. The problem means that they
become a low priority for council housing because they have relatively
low point allocations. If they go on through the homeless register
instead of the council allocation and if they are accepted as being
homeless, they are often removed to another local authority area where
they have a previous connection rather than being considered for
homeless accommodation in the district in which they have applied for
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012328000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister confirm my reading of the clause&#151;that it will ensure
that armed services personnel will be considered to have a local
connection with an area in which they are stationed or living, in order
to equalise their status with the local civilian population? If so, it
will enable them realistically to be considered for council housing in
their local areas as they move from military life back to civilian
life. I would welcome that.</div>

						<a name="08012328000417"></a>
							<b class="B">Sir
George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I, too, welcome
the clause, but does it extend to the families of military personnel?
The explanatory notes say that the effect of the clause is
that</div>
					<a name="08012328000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person in the
armed forces will now be able to establish a local connection with a
district...in the same way as a
civilian.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012328000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a
common scenario is when a family is in married quarters and the
couple&#146;s relationship breaks down or the one who is on active
service, usually the husband, leaves the armed services, leaving the
family in those quarters. At that point, the MOD says, quite
reasonably, that it needs the married quarters and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>serves a notice on the family to quit. Does the help in clause 270
extend to the family of the personnel member and enable them to
establish a local connection in the same
way?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000418"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am pleased that both sides of the Committee
agree that the clause is important. I welcome the words of the hon.
Member for Welwyn Hatfield on the clause and am more than happy to help
him draft a press release to the effect, &#147;Shapps praises
Government on Housing and Regeneration Bill&#148;. Perhaps we can do
that some time this evening. Somehow, though, I suspect that will not
be the case.</div>
					<a name="08012328000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regardless of which areas we
represent, we all know from our constituency work that former services
personnel have had a battle to obtain social housing, because they are
not treated as having a local connection with the areas in which they
have been serving. Let me put on record that it is absolutely
unacceptable that they should be put at a complete disadvantage because
of their service to the country. On the contrary, we must provide our
servicemen and women with the best possible support as they move back
to civilian life. I hope that I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member
for Denton and Reddish regarding his concerns. His reading of the Bill
is exactly my understanding of it. I hope that provides some
reassurance.</div>
					<a name="08012328000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
why the clause will amend the Housing Act 1996 to enable service
personnel to establish a local connection with the district in which
they are serving or have served for the purposes of allocating social
housing under part 6 of the Act and providing homelessness assistance
under part 7. Broadly speaking, a person has a local connection with a
district if he is or was normally resident there by choice.
Additionally, someone may have a local connection with a district
because he or she is employed there, has family associations there or
because of special circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08012328000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether someone has a local
connection with a district can be relevant when they seek social
housing, because the 1996 Act allows local authorities to take local
connections into account when deciding who gets priority for social
housing. Local connections are also relevant in respect of
homelessness, because people who are accepted as being unintentionally
homeless and in priority need who do not have a local connection with
the district in which they have applied for help may be referred to
another authority in which they do have a local connection.</div>
					<a name="08012328000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich eloquently pointed out, and I would
like to put it on record as well, under the current legislation,
service personnel and their families are specifically excluded and are
treated as not having established a local connection with a district
because of employment or residence while serving in the forces. I think
that the whole Committee will agree that that is simply unacceptable.
Clause 270 will remove the provisions that prevent service personnel
from establishing a local connection in those circumstances. That will
mean that residence and employment of serving members of the armed
forces will be taken into account in the same way that it is for
civilians who live and work in a district.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>
					<a name="08012328000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Member for
North-West Hampshire mentioned a specific point about families and
particularly wives trying to establish a local connection when a
marriage breaks up and a wife and family are left living in married
quarters. I reassure him that his reading of that situation is correct.
However, the question of whether a wife will establish a local
connection because of residence in these or any other circumstances
will depend on the usual factors that apply to everyone: namely,
whether she was normally resident there and whether it was a residence
of her own
choice.</div>

is agreed across the Chamber of the importance of providing ex-service
personnel with accommodation. He has given reassurance in relation to
the district where they have been based, but that district is often not
where they would wish to remain because bases are outside urban areas
or because they want to return to the town in which they were born.
They can often find themselves in those difficulties and will not be
able to establish a local connection, even though they might have lived
there for a considerable period. Will the Minister reassure the House
that the concerns for personnel who do not want to remain in their
district will be taken into
account?</div>

circumstances that the hon. Gentleman outlined, a local connection
would remain. If a wife wanted to move back to where she was brought
up, she would have a local connection there already. I am pleased that
the whole House supports the clause. I think that clauses 269 to 272
are, in their different ways, extremely important parts of the Bill and
of housing policy. It is important that we ensure that servicemen and
women are put on an equal footing when applying for

there are three Gypsy and Traveller sites. One is called
Barbaraville&#151;set up by the late Barbara Cartland&#151;and has
been there for 45 years. In the last couple of years, I have spent

that for legislation to pick out individual groups based on ethnicity
is a dangerous approach to take to this House creating legislation. The

						</b> I spent a Friday evening with residents in one
part of my constituency, Bell Bar, who were concerned that a report was
recently published which identifies a piece of land near them as a
possible location for a Gypsy and Travellers site. The reason that the
allocation is required&#151;as the Minister will know&#151;is that
the Government have told the regional structure of government to find
additional sites and tell local authorities where to provide them. The
residents&#146; concerns are many, but my specific concern is that we
have three Traveller-Gypsy sites in my constituency, all of which
operate extremely well. There is no obvious requirement for more, given
that the number of temporary Traveller encampments has fallen in recent
years, yet provision is required for an additional 17 pitches. I hope
that that helps to define the
concern.</div>

effectively provides a benefit to one section of the community that
does not exist for others, in this case the ability to obtain land for
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>specific purpose that does not exist if one does not happen to be part
of that group. I am querying that principle, and I am surprised to hear

						</b> I was intrigued by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comment that the clause will provide benefits for one particular ethnic

believe that the provision or protection of sites to those within the
travelling community group who may not otherwise have anywhere to
reside is any additional benefit above and beyond that provided to the
housed population. It merely provides something to ensure that they
have some measure of protection in our society, which is not
unreasonable. I shall not stray into mentioning dog whistles and so on,
but it is important that we take a balanced
approach.</div>
					<a name="08012328000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not having

purpose in rising was to seek the Minister&#146;s advice on the
purpose of the clause. Notwithstanding your advice on new clause 15,
Mr. Gale, which was not signed by other members of the
Committee and therefore will not be debated, I ask the Minister whether
there is provision, or an intention to amend the clause, to address
concerns in parts of the country where there are substantial mobile
home sites. I am sure that the Minister understands that those sites
are seen by some as a lifestyle choice, based on the ambience and
lifestyle of the mobile home park. Because of the shortage of housing
provided by social housing providers, registered social landlords and
others, mobile home parks have become an alternative; for some, it is
the only route to meet their housing needs.</div>

					<a name="08012328000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that, over the past 10 or 11 years, the Government have addressed the
issue, in so far as they have consulted that sector and the residents
living in mobile home parks and have brought forward regulations to
provide them with a modicum of protection from some mobile home park
owners. However, in my experience of mobile home parks in my
constituency, the attitudes of the park owners are in some cases rather
draconian, and they are certainly not transparent in the way in which
they divvy up the energy bills and charges for those who come in and
out of the park sites. For those and other reasons, concern has been
expressed about the management of those
parks.</div>
				
					<a name="08012328000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those who fall off the
radar screen for the provision of social housing and who live in mobile
home parks because they have no alternative&#151;they do not do so
out of choice&#151;I seek the Minister&#146;s advice. Do the
Government ultimately intend to bring in regulations on mobile home
parks to put them under the regulator Oftenant? As drafted, the Bill
does not allow for
that.</div>
					<a name="08012328000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill allows
the Secretary of State to make provisions to extend its scope in
regulation. I therefore ask the Minister whether, if the purpose of the
Bill is to provide protection in society with regard to the quality 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>of the accommodation where people reside, he believes that they should
be given some assistance and should not be left outside the provisions

							<b class="B">Mr.
Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
The provision has been a long time coming, and the Opposition are right
to say that it was prompted by a decision of the European Court of
Human Rights. The Minister will doubtless correct me if I am wrong, but
the Government have willingly introduced the proposal. I am pleased
that they have done so, and I hope that the Minister is, too.</div>
					<a name="08012328000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a significant measure,
because it applies security of tenure to people living on local
authority Gypsy and Traveller sites, who do not currently have that
protection. That creates an intolerable situation, as people can be
evicted from the site with 28 days&#146; notice, as if they were
unprotected tenants. That is notwithstanding all the other problems
often associated with the level of accommodation provided on such
sites. For example, there are usually long-term residents on a site
near my constituency. They may be in caravans or mobile homes, many of
which are permanent dwellings in which whole families have grown up.
That is the comparison with other forms of social housing, and I shall
turn in a moment to the point raised by the hon. Member for St.
Ives.</div>
					<a name="08012328000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had hoped that
the proposal would be uncontroversial. I stand to be corrected, but I
thought that it had all-party support. I am member of the all-party
Gypsy and Traveller law reform group. That group, ably advised by the
Traveller Law Reform Project, has campaigned strongly on the provision
and welcomes its inclusion&#151;I think that my hon. Friend the
Minister is meeting the group tomorrow morning. If the clause is
accepted, as I hope that it will be this afternoon, I am sure that he
will be congratulated. It is therefore with some concern that I have
seen the official Opposition raising unsustainable objections to
it.</div>

concerned that I am raising concerns, which is the entire point of the
Committee. The idea is to analyse each line of the Bill. We did not
table amendments, but none the less we want some clarification. Will
the hon. Gentleman accept that even though the Government have included
the clause, it was done as a result of a European case, which the
Government fought in
court?</div>

						</b> I have gone over that ground and said that that
may well have been the prompt. However, I have also said that I think
the provision long overdue. The Minister can speak for himself, but I
see it as something that the Government are bringing forward positively
rather than, as the hon. Gentleman has put it, a problem. I do not
think it a problem for the Government, although it may be a problem for
the Opposition. There is still a considerable amount of discrimination
against Gypsies and Travellers in this country, of a type which would
be unheard of in relation to other ethnic
groups.</div>
					<a name="08012328000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has explained that the clause simply puts people who are for the main
part in established 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>homes in the same position as many other people in the public and
private sector in this country. The hon. Gentleman has said that I
should not be concerned, but I am concerned that Conservative Members
can hold such an antediluvian view in the 21st<span class="Sup"> </span>century.
However, that is a matter for them, and they must stand by it&#151;it
may go down well in Welwyn Hatfield, but it does not go down very well
in Shepherd&#146;s
Bush.</div>
					<a name="08012328000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be more
appropriate to raise another matter of continuing concern on clause 67.
If we have not reached that clause by this afternoon, which does not
look likely now, we can perhaps raise with the Minister on Thursday the
question whether local authority and RSL Gypsy and Traveller sites
should be considered as social housing and come within the ambit of
other parts of the Bill. There is a strong case for that, but this is
probably not the time to discuss
it.</div>
					<a name="08012328000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000437"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> When the hon. Member for St. Ives discussed new
clause 15, which was not moved, you were incredibly generous,
Mr. Gale, so I hope that you will allow me a moment or two
to clarify the position. I am intrigued by the new clause, which has a
lot of merit, and I am keen to help. I am also keen that the reforms
that we made to the park home sector a year or two ago need to bed
down, as I mentioned to the all-party group. In terms of licensing and
a &#147;fit and proper person&#148; there is merit in what the new
clause suggests.</div>
					<a name="08012328000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not minded, given the current wording, to accept anything along those
lines on Report, but I am keen to look into the matter to ensure that
park home owners feel reassured and that licensing in some form is
something that we can consider. I am not willing to accept the precise
definition in new clause 15, but I am keen to look at the matter and to
work with the industry and other stakeholders to move forward. I hope
that reassures the hon. Members for St. Ives and for North Devon (Nick
Harvey).</div>
					<a name="08012328000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 272
has been mentioned several times. It is important to reaffirm that it
gives greater security of tenure for Gypsies and Travellers living on
local authority sites. It narrows the disparity between Gypsies and
Travellers and the mainstream population, which has been a source of
genuine grievance and community tension for quite some time. I am
pleased to be able to try to reduce that community tension as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="08012328000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
situation has also been mentioned, and I want to put it on record. At
present, a local authority seeking to gain possession of a pitch on its
site is not required to do more than provide 28 days&#146; notice of
termination of the resident&#146;s licence, when it can seek a
possession order from the court. The site resident cannot put up any
defence against a claim for such an order. If the court is satisfied
that the notice was properly served, it has no discretion and must
grant the possession order, although, since the Housing Act 2004, it
can suspend such an order for up to 12 months. On private Gypsy and
Traveller sites and park home sites, the court can assess both sides of
the case, and it may deny a possession order, if such an order is
deemed unfair.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>
					<a name="08012328000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a disparity and my hon.
Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush is a
member of the all-party group on Gypsy and Traveller law reform, which
does an awful lot of good work in this area. I understand that the
chair of the group is my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North
(Julie
Morgan).</div>
					<a name="08012328000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000438"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:
						</b> Yes. I mentioned that my hon. Friend the Member
for Cardiff, North chairs the group, and indeed she brought forward the
private Member&#146;s Bill that received a favourable response from
the Government and led to this
clause.</div>
					<a name="08012328000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000439"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that. My hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, North has played an important role in
moving this debate forward. She has described the current
situation&#151;I think that I am quoting her correctly&#151;as
&#147;grossly unfair&#148;. My hon. Friends the Members for Ealing,
Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush and for Cardiff, North have worked
hard to remove that disparity, which is what clause 272 aims to
do.</div>
					<a name="08012328000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
mentioned before, but the new right is part of the Government&#146;s
response to the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in the
case of Connors <i class="I">v.</i> UK in 2004. I do not see that as a problem,
as the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield has suggested, but it is worth
setting out the scenario. The court found that the disparity between
local authority Gypsy and Traveller tenants and tenants of private
sites contravened article 8 of the European convention on human rights,
which is the right to private, home and family life. The
Government&#146;s immediate response was to give the court the power
to suspend a possession order in section 211 of the Housing Act 2004,
but following consultation and the work of my hon. Friends the Members
for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush and for Cardiff, North, we
considered that it would be right to go further than that. By removing
the exclusion of Gypsies and Travellers living on local authority sites
in the Mobile Homes Act 1983, clause 272 will ensure that the due
process afforded to other members of society in similar housing is
given to Gypsies and Travellers. They, too, will have the opportunity
to set out their case.</div>
					<a name="08012328000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am intrigued by the manner in
which the debate on clause stand part developed with regard to this
area, because I stress the point that clause 272 is basically providing
due process that is provided to other members of society. It is not
providing anything special&#151;it is just raising the game and
removing that disparity. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for
Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush that that is not particularly
controversial. It is just trying to remove some sort of disparity. The
court will need to take a view on the following matters: first, whether
a site resident has breached the terms of their agreement by, for
example, engaging in antisocial behaviour; secondly, whether they have
been given a reasonable opportunity to remedy that breach and have
failed to do so; and finally, whether granting a possession order is
reasonable.</div>
					<a name="08012328000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already mentioned the manner in which this debate has developed, and I
really want to stress that the clause will not give residents of local
authority Gypsy and Traveller sites any special rights&#151;it will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>simply give them the same rights as other people living in caravans and
mobile homes. It will not prevent site residents who break the
conditions of their agreements from being evicted. In fact, it should
become easier for local authorities to identify individuals or families
who have behaved unreasonably on sites in the past and to make informed
decisions on whether to give them a pitch. It will not give security of
tenure to anyone on an unauthorised encampment or
development.</div>
					<a name="08012328000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
important piece of work has been carried out by the independent task
group on site provision and enforcement, which was chaired by Sir Brian
Briscoe, the former chief executive of the Local Government
Association. The group noted the importance of changing the law in this
way. The final report from this group was published last month, and it
stated:</div>
					<a name="08012328000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
current situation is unacceptable. We would expect local authorities
too to welcome the clarification of the expectations upon them as
landlords that legislative change would
bring.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012328000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will
decrease the number of legal actions in the courts by creating a clear
and structured framework for local authorities to adhere to in the
eviction process, which will prevent them from opening themselves up to
allegations of unfair eviction and therefore reduce the expense of
fighting such
cases.</div>
					<a name="08012328000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08012328000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause will
not change the law governing private Gypsy and Traveller sites, or
other sites already covered by the Mobile Homes Act 1983, such as park
home sites. It is not particularly controversial, although some of the
letters that I receive, mostly from Opposition Members who pass on
letters from the public, tend to support the view of my hon. Friend the
Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush that that is the
last bastion of established racism, which should not be accepted in a
modern, tolerant society. There should be a political consensus that
every group has rights and responsibilities, and it is offensive to
single out groups and particular
characteristics.</div>

absolutely right to debate a clause such as this. He has gone a long
way in satisfying some of our concerns, for which I am grateful. The
Government must have had concerns about the measure, because the case
of Connors <i class="I">v.</i> the UK came to court in 2004. I hope, too, that
the Minister respects our right to raise the issue and to have a
sensible discussion about it. I am grateful for the clarification that
he has given, and I ask him to acknowledge that it is perfectly right
to discuss these

there is a need for political consensus on the issue. Racism and
bigotry should not be tolerated in any form. My sense is that in
general the public are wise to it and think it offensive to refer to
people in racist terms. However, there is a narrow element who seem to
consider that Gypsies and Travellers are exempt from such
considerations. We need a consensus in the House to ensure that that
sort of thing is not tolerated and to stamp down on
it.</div>
					<a name="08012328000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the greatest
respect to the hon. Gentleman, as I have not received a letter on the
subject from him, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>Conservative Members need to be firmer in smacking down people who send

The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that we have taken note of

that that resolves matters; let us now get back to the business of the

removes the low-rent test as a means of deciding whether the right to

test will remain for some purposes, such as determining the basis for
valuing the freehold and cases in which the claim is for a lease
extension as opposed to acquiring the freehold. The test will also
continue to apply to existing leases. Under the Leasehold Reform Act
1967, long leaseholders have a right to enfranchise subject to meeting
certain criteria, which include having a long lease at a low rent. A
complex formula sets out the criteria for determining what precisely
low rent is.</div>

of amendments to the 1967 Act mean that the low-rent test has

					<a name="08012328000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware that in some
areas&#151;for example, small rural settlements&#151;affordable
housing is difficult to replace after a purchaser has bought it
outright. In some circumstances, particularly in rural areas, land may
not come forward for development if its owner cannot be assured that
the housing built on it will remain affordable for future purchasers.
Currently, a number of measures can be used to keep shared ownership
housing affordable for future purchasers, including providers buying
back properties, but, frankly, such schemes are inconsistent between
landlords and are sometimes difficult to use or
apply.</div>
					<a name="08012328000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
want to provide the flexibility to respond to specific, local housing
need and, where necessary, to keep some shared-ownership housing
affordable for future purchasers. That is in line with the wishes of
landowners, providers and other rural interests. The changes that I am
proposing will enable some areas to be designated as protected areas,
where shared ownership housing cannot be lost to the open market but
will remain affordable for future
purchasers.</div>

							<a name="08012328000454"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I warmly welcome this new clause, and the
commitment to ensure a provision for retaining shared ownership in
areas of need. Yet this all depends, crucially, on the definition of
the area. Will my hon. Friend say a little more about how widely he
intends to set the parameters defining the protected areas? Will they
cover all rural areas and other areas of intense housing need, where
the loss of shared ownership housing through staircasing would reduce
the availability of housing for people in
need?</div>
					<a name="08012328000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000455"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. Friend has raised an extremely
important point. My intention is that the areas will be small and will
respond to specific local housing needs. Because of that, new clause 25
will do a range of things. It will amend existing legislation to enable
the Secretary of State to make an order designating an area as one
where limited land is available for the replacement of affordable
housing; it will enable local authorities to designate specific sites
within the area; and it will require all providers of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>affordable housing in those sites to keep that housing affordable in
perpetuity. In response to my right hon. Friend&#146;s specific
point, those areas will be designated quite
tightly.</div>
					<a name="08012328000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000456"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> My hon. Friend has not entirely satisfied my
concerns, because a tight definition would obviously mean that
relatively limited numbers of areas would benefit. In many rural
areas&#151;and, indeed, in some urban areas&#151;there is a real
worry, where it is extremely difficult to meet housing needs because of
high land values, that social housing provided through the shared
ownership route will be lost through staircasing without appropriate
safeguards.</div>
					<a name="08012328000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support
strongly the general principle of staircasing, but in those areas of
need, there is a strong case for protection. Is the Minister willing to
encourage local authorities that believe that their areas are
experiencing such need to make representations for their areas to be
designated under this provision?</div>
					<a name="08012328000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000457"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> My right hon. Friend has raised an interesting
point with which I have a lot of sympathy. I think that the areas will
be relatively small and will respond to specific acute housing demand.
I intend to publish criteria with regard to designating protected areas
and to consult stakeholders shortly. I think that this issue will be
debated during that process, but I take on board my right hon.
Friend&#146;s important
point.</div>
					<a name="08012328000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08012328000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Providers will
be able to maintain affordability through either or both of the
following mechanisms, which must be clearly stated in the lease. The
first is restricting staircasing under the terms of the
shared-ownership lease. Leases will need to state that the purchaser
cannot enfranchise and state a maximum share that a purchaser could
acquire. As I have suggested, this is an and/or situation. The second
mechanism is ensuring that providers have the right to buy back
properties and sell them on as affordable housing or nominate new
buyers from waiting lists when they are sold. The shared ownership
lease must detail that obligation. If the provider does not restrict
staircasing, they will be required to exercise the right to buy
back.</div>
					<a name="08012328000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the consultation that I referred to earlier, the National
Housing Federation welcomed the move to clarify the position of
leasehold enfranchisement rules in relation to shared ownership. The
federation also believes that staircasing restrictions will encourage
landowners in rural areas to discuss more openly the potential for
affordable housing, if they can be reassured that the housing will
remain affordable for future owners. The Commission for Rural
Communities considers that restricting staircasing is a usable
mechanism for retaining shared-ownership properties, and many local
authorities have welcomed the changes, which will increase their
ability to deliver and retain affordable housing in their
areas.</div>
					<a name="08012328000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 24
will allow housing associations to grant shared-ownership leases that
do not allow the purchaser to acquire 100 per cent. of the freehold.
That will provide an additional mechanism in order to retain houses on
a shared-ownership basis for future 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div>purchasers in a protected area, as proposed under new clause 25. That is
an important rule that will help to maintain
affordability.</div>

							<a name="08012328000458"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> Like the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich, I have some concerns. I welcome the general drift of the new
clauses, but I am concerned whether the definition of landlords to whom
the new clauses apply is sufficiently tightly or clearly drawn, so that
the landlords who may be subject to a process of ownership of a
property through staircasing rather than outright purchase are clear.
It is clear in new clause 24 that that applies to housing associations.
I just want to be clear that the drafting of the new clause does not
open up other tenants of properties equally to staircasing and, through
the back door, obtaining properties that we all hope will be recycled
within the local community to meet a local need in
perpetuity.</div>
					<a name="08012328000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich intervened on the
definition of the areas, the Minister responded that the Secretary of
State will define those areas tightly by order, which concerns me on
two fronts. We have been told that the Secretary of State will take the
decision. I seek reassurance that local authorities will have a
mechanism by which they can draw the boundaries, rather than it being
left to local authorities to apply to the Secretary of State for the
definition of where the boundaries of the protected areas
lie.</div>
					<a name="08012328000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister recognises that there is great advantage, particularly for
housing associations in areas where there is a particular need for
affordable housing, to apply a mechanism known in the trade as the
golden share. In other words, the housing association will always
retain the golden share, which would enable it to ensure that when a
property is given up by the occupant, that property can be directed to
meet the needs of someone who seeks local, affordable housing, rather
than being lost and sold on the private
market.</div>
					<a name="08012328000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where that
cannot be restricted, I seek the reassurance of the belt-and-braces
approach. If we cannot simply apply the golden share, we could have
staircasing of shared ownership up to a certain agreed level&#151;for
instance the housing association could retain a 10 per cent. or 25 per
cent. share that the occupant cannot purchase. Even where the golden
share applies, I hope that the Minister will allow those housing
associations to apply a legal covenant on the property, which would
ensure that it would meet the need for local affordable housing in
perpetuity. In circumstances where the property is subject to a section
106 agreement under a planning permission, I seek reassurance that the
new clauses will not undermine the intent of those planning
permissions, which themselves could be drafted in such a way, as
happens in many circumstances, as to direct those properties towards
specific social groups. Such properties are intended to meet a defined
local need for affordable housing.</div>
					<a name="08012328000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek reassurance, prompted in
part by the intervention by the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich, that we are not slackening control over the scarce provision
of affordable housing for local people. That is particularly true in
rural areas, as the right hon. Gentleman has identified, but there are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>many other parts of the country where the need within the local
community is particularly intense and where the provision of affordable
local housing is scarce. I hope that the Minister will take those
concerns on
board.</div>
					<a name="08012328000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000459"></a>Mr.
Raynsford:
						</b> I want to echo some of the concerns voiced by
the hon. Member for St. Ives and to repeat the points that I put to my
hon. Friend in my interventions, as his responses gave me the
impression that the Government are taking too minimalist a view of the
application of powers. As I understand it, one of the two provisions
relates specifically to housing association shared-ownership schemes,
and the other relates to leasehold schemes for the
elderly.</div>
					<a name="08012328000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
issue raised by the hon. Member for St. Ives is whether other
shared-ownership schemes would benefit from being defined within the
remit of the powers at a future date. That clearly cannot be done under
the definition in the new clauses, but there may be a case, in the
context of the Bill, for a more flexible framework to embrace private
sector providers as well as registered social landlords. If private
sector providers are providing shared ownership in areas of high value
and high housing stress, it may be that the restrictions on staircasing
should apply.</div>
					<a name="08012328000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue concerns the definition of areas. The current definition
of rural areas embraces areas with fewer than 3,000 homes. That has
generally been used as the criterion for defining rural areas. If the
Minister had indicated that it would be used as the basic criterion for
defining those areas where the restriction on staircasing will apply, I
think that many of the anxieties that the hon. Member for St. Ives and
I have voiced would have been satisfied as far as rural areas are
concerned.</div>
					<a name="08012328000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister knows, however, I have also voiced concerns about some urban
areas. There are parts of central London&#151;it is not only central
London but inner London as well&#151;where land values are incredibly
high. If social housing is lost, it is virtually impossible to
reprovision it. The high capital cost of investment makes that very
difficult, if not impossible, and there may well be a case for applying
the restriction in such
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08012328000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third issue that I want to highlight is encouragement for landowners to
release land at less than market value to facilitate housing
development. We have discussed this in Committee on previous occasions,
and, as the Minister acknowledged in his introductory remarks, it is
relevant to making land available in some rural communities, where
landowners are reluctant to make provision if they think that the land
will not be held in perpetuity for social housing
needs.</div>
					<a name="08012328000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">If landowners
are to be encouraged to make land available, it is essential that they
should not have any grounds for fearing that land that they offer at
less than market value could subsequently bring a windfall gain to the
person who occupies the home that has been built on that land. The
staircasing process could enable them to staircase up to outright
ownership and then to sell on the open market. There is a serious need
to encourage landowners to make land available at less than market
value in areas of high stress, if that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>crucial to the provision of affordable housing, but, unless we have a
good, broad and generous interpretation of the areas where such
restrictions will apply, the benefits that can be achieved will be less
extensive and more limited than the Government would like, and
certainly than I would
like.</div>
					<a name="08012328000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Minister in his response to accept that there should be a full
consultation with interested parties before the areas covered by new
clauses 24 and 25 are defined, and that the Secretary of State, when
defining the areas, should be mindful to listen to the views of local
authorities, housing associations and other housing providers, which
are aware of the needs of those areas and of the importance of
retaining an element of affordable and social
housing.</div>
					<a name="08012328000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="08012328000460"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> Several important points have been raised by the
hon. Member for St. Ives and by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich. I hope that I can address their concerns and
reassure both of
them.</div>
					<a name="08012328000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I interpreted
correctly the concerns of the hon. Member for St. Ives&#151;he can
always intervene on me, if I have this wrong&#151;I got the
impression that he was concerned that there would be some sort of
staircasing, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>or avoidance of staircasing, through the back door by non-social
providers. I hope that I understood him
correctly.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000461"></a>Andrew
George:
						</b> I am sorry if I did not make myself clear. I am
concerned about how widely the new clause may be drawn or interpreted
at present, and the extent to which it may be amendable in future and
applied more widely. Certainly there is a concern that affordable
properties that are intended to meet a local housing need may be lost
because of the provision in the new clause. Is that
unintentional?</div>
					<a name="08012328000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012328000462"></a>Mr.
Wright:
						</b> That is exactly what we want to avoid, and it is
the point of the new clause. New clause 25 will apply to all providers
in a protected area. I hope that that addresses the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about back-door staircasing and 100 per cent.
ownership. I understand his concerns about a top-down approach from the
Secretary of State providing an order. I hope that I can
reassure&#151;</div>
