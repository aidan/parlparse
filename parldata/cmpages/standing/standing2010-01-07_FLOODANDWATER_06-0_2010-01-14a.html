<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000469"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
taking amendment 113, in clause 9, page 7, line 16, at end
add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(10) The Secretary of
State shall as soon as possible instigate, publish and have regard to a
review undertaken by a panel of independent persons, including
representatives from local authorities, universities, professional
institutions and other bodies as the Secretary of State deems
appropriate, pertaining to the training that will be required for the
lead local flood authorities to undertake the functions conferred under
this section before this section is
commenced.&#146;.</div><a name="10011494000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we will be able to make some progress this afternoon. It is a
long Bill, and we are time-limited, of
course.</div><a name="10011494000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000470"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> It is great to serve under
your stewardship again this afternoon, Mr. Martlew. I was in
the middle of responding to the amendments, and I was making it clear
that we would fully fund the local authority&#146;s role in respect
not only of the diversity of training needs and so on, but of any new
duties, powers and responsibilities that emanate from the
Bill.</div><a name="10011494000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have carefully assessed the new burdens that we are placing on local
authorities, and we have committed to providing the necessary funding
in full. We have said that, from commencement, we will provide an extra
&#163;36 million a year to lead flood authorities as
area-based grants to fund the new role in England. That will allow
local authority-led flood management activity to triple from around
&#163;18 million to &#163;54 million a year. In addition, a
contingency sum of &#163;8 million has been set aside for year
1.</div><a name="10011494000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evidence that we have does not support increasing the funding
provision. Just to make it clear, it will ultimately be
taxpayers&#151;our constituents&#151;across the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>country, the vast majority of whom are not at direct risk of being
flooded, who will foot the bill. They will not thank us for straying
from a good evidence base or for providing more than we think is
necessary. In simple opportunity-cost terms, every &#163;1 that we
give to local authorities for flood management is &#163;1 that we
cannot spend on hospitals, schools or even on flood defences, such as
those on main rivers and around the coast, yet flooding from those
major sources represents a far greater risk than flooding from surface
water, and the benefits of investment in those defences exceed the
costs by around 8:1. We have made a commitment, but we need carefully
to examine any call for additional resources and, on behalf of our
constituents, to make rational decisions that are based on the evidence
available.</div><a name="10011494000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000471"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Martlew. The Minister&#146;s clarification was
helpful, but I am a little concerned that the Government are relying on
raising local levies. He seems to miss the point that that money will
come from exactly the same people whom he was talking about, and
district councils, internal drainage boards and the Environment Agency,
not the Government, will get the blame. Does he take that
point?</div><a name="10011494000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000472"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed, I do; the point is well made. That
is why we need to keep the matter under review. We cannot base our
decisions on a snapshot taken now, on the independent review that was
carried out last summer, on evidence from 2002 or whatever. We need to
keep working with local government, to make this work over
time.</div><a name="10011494000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth pointing out, by the way, that some of the functions in the
Bill will not kick in straight away. There is a time scale in respect
of the implications for the transfer of local sewers and the roll-out
of sustainable drainage systems development. That will be done
development by development, not all on day one. Indeed, there may be
cost savings at the front end, rather than increased costs. That is why
we need to keep the matter under
review.</div><a name="10011494000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000473"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): I do not think that
at this point we can set figures for how much money will be available.
We do not have national strategies, or strategies for England or Wales.
Can the Minister explain literally how this will work? Will a lead
local flood authority prepare a strategy and then go to the Government
and say, &#147;This is likely to cost &#163;8 million.
Can we have &#163;8 million, please?&#148; I am not quite sure how
it will physically
work.</div><a name="10011494000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000474"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> There will be no need for that. The
funding that I have described will be provided on the current
area-based grant system. If there were a call for more funding and the
evidence supported such a call, funding would be made available through
the normal support mechanisms to local authorities in those areas
identified as being at the greatest risk of flooding and so on; but of
course, our investment, which has doubled in recent years, would
continue.</div><a name="10011494000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
clarify a point made by the hon. Member for Vale of York, local levies
will not be used to fund the core elements of the Bill. We are
providing additional Government money to recognise the net burdens, and
we will keep it under review.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div><a name="10011494000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The assessment
of burdens is based on independent research carried out last summer,
when the draft Bill was published and consulted on. Just to make it
clear, the assessment takes the upper end of the likely costs, because
we are cognisant of the concerns that were raised by local government.
We went not for the lower end but for the upper end, to provide added
confidence.</div><a name="10011494000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have shown a commitment by providing funding this year and next to more
than half of all the county and unitary authorities in England, where
the need is greatest, to implement Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s
recommendations and take action straight away. As this is a devolved
matter, the responsibility for commissioning such a review in
Wales&#151;were it to come&#151;would rest with the Welsh Assembly
Government. Welsh Ministers are already discussing the impact with the
local authorities and with the Welsh Local Government
Association.</div>
<a name="10011494000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The funding
will be provided up front. This will not be a drag-down of funding; the
area-based grants that I mentioned&#151;&#163;36
million&#151;will be provided up front to fund the roles. If local
authorities require more, we will consider it, but we will need good
evidence to back up such a request. That is the dialogue that we are
currently having with the LGA.</div>
<a name="10011494000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all want
to see the Bill in place, so we must not put hurdles in the way of the
commencement of this legislation; that, however, is what these
amendments would do. The best way of determining whether authorities
are sufficiently funded is to provide money now&#151;as we are
already doing and as we promised to do&#151;and allow them to get on
with the job. We have already committed to monitoring the actual costs,
not the estimates, and we will make good any shortfalls that
arise.</div><a name="10011494000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and
Radnorshire&#151;please pass on my best wishes to the hon. Member for
Brecon and Radnorshire, who is ill today&#151;have tabled a further
amendment that requires the Secretary of State to instigate, publish
and have regard to a review undertaken by a panel of independent
persons about the training that will be required.</div>
<a name="10011494000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">To pick up on
the point raised by the hon. Member for Cheltenham and my hon. Friend
the Member for Stroud, I met with Unison and the Sector Skills Body
Forum only last week to discuss the ways forward and work force
planning within not only local authorities but the water sector
generally. We will be in a position to introduce some plans and
suggestions, but they are not all pertinent to this clause or this
Bill.</div><a name="10011494000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000475"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): Some facts and figures on
the matter would be quite useful. Although it is not necessarily the
responsibility of this Bill, knowing how many water engineers work in
local authorities would form a good backcloth to this legislation. What
is the potential shortfall and what is the age profile of those people?
As I said in my speech, we need to have a clear background to whatever
we pass in legislation. So, if the Minister would bring forward such
facts and figures, it would be very
useful.</div><a name="10011494000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000476"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I might be able to be of some help to my
hon. Friend. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I have just realised that I am
dropping my &#147;h&#148;s; I am suddenly talking a form of estuary
Welsh&#151;&#147;I might be of some &#146;elp to my hon.
Friend.&#148; My parents did not bring me up to drop my
&#147;h&#148;s in Parliament.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div><a name="10011494000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our assessment
is based on independent work by consultants. On average, it suggests
that 0.5 to 1.5 extra staff per authority will be needed for the lead
flood authority role, plus a similar number more to look after the SUDS
element&#151;as I mentioned, the SUDS element will not happen
overnight. The costs of those involved in SUDS can be recovered through
planning fees, which we have not discussed, so they do not need to be
funded.</div>
<a name="10011494000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">To allow some
contingency, however, the assessment of burdens assumes an average of
2.25 extra full-time employees per lead flood authority. Let me drill
under that average. As we know, some large county authorities with
significant risks may need to recruit four or five staff, while some
unitaries, which already have strong, ongoing drainage and watercourse
roles, might be able to perform the role with very few extra resources.
We need to keep the issue under review, but we are funding it. We are
also funding training and investment in it, by helping with graduate
schemes and skills schemes in local authorities. I am sure that I can
expand more on that as well.</div>
<a name="10011494000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000477"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I do not want to labour this point, but in my
experience of talking to local government officers, particularly those
who have a water engineering background, they do not totally understand
what SUDS are.</div>
<a name="10011494000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
technical expertise, and this is an evolving area. The Minister talks
about using the planning system, but developers will realise that this
will be an expensive part of a future planning proposal and do their
utmost not to spend that money. I want to know whether we are talking
to the building industry, particularly developers, about its
understanding of the
changes.</div><a name="10011494000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000478"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am pleased to say that such a discussion
is already under way; we are not waiting for the commencement of the
Bill to start on that. We are talking to the building industry, the
local authorities and others, because the change will involve, for
many, a new skill set. Alongside other Government Departments, we are
developing the technical details of the SUDS development and the
hierarchy that it will mean. There will be different types of SUDS
development. On the back of that, we have identified the skill sets
that are required. There is a job of work to be done, but we have not
waited to start it; it is already under way.</div>
<a name="10011494000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments suggest that a training review by an independent panel will
have to take place before the training of the lead local authorities
can commence. That cannot happen; we need to get on with the Bill. The
work is under way already. Although I wholeheartedly agree that there
is a need to ensure that the lead local flood authorities have the
capacity to undertake their role, requiring any sort of review before
commencement would be unduly bureaucratic and could have the
unfortunate effect of delaying the management of flood risk. That would
affect people who could otherwise be helped.</div>
<a name="10011494000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, we are working closely with a range of organisations including
the LGA, the Environment Agency, local authorities and the Sector
Skills Council to identify and provide the training required. We
recognise that that will take some time, and we have reflected that in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>the assumptions that we have made around the programme of work. I have
mentioned Wales, but when it comes to training it will be for Welsh
Ministers to instigate, publish and have regard to a review in Wales,
should the amendment go forward, because the matter is devolved. The
Welsh Assembly Government are currently discussing with the WLGA the
implications of the training requirement in the Bill, and are actively
considering the skills and capacity
issue.</div><a name="10011494000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me return to the matter raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Selby
and for City of Durham. The suggestion was challenging because it is to
do with net burdens, finance, costs and so on. They suggested putting
on a formal footing the discussions that we are currently having with
the LGA as a prime partner. I am quite taken with the idea, because we
are currently having intense dialogues with the LGA, as we have done
through the development of this Bill, the draft Bill and so on.
Formalising such talks would be a good way to take the whole matter
forward. Rather than have an independent panel, it would be better to
send Ministers away to put the talks on a proper footing and say,
&#147;You will now have to plan your way through this with the
LGA.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011494000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">This process
will not be over in 12 months, or even two years. The development of
SUDS and the transfer of private sewers will mean that we will still be
here in a few years. We therefore need to put our discussions on a
formal footing. I have no problem with doing that in some kind of
partnership with the LGA, and possibly others such as the Environment
Agency and the Department for Communities and Local
Government.</div>
<a name="10011494000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we do not need
to legislate to do that, and we do not want to delay the commencement
of the Bill. This afternoon, my officials are meeting the LGA. They
have a range of issues on their agenda, and I am quite happy for them
to raise the idea of formalising the arrangements there, so that we
take forward an ongoing assessment of the costs and burdens as they
arise. On the back of that, depending on what discussions arise, I am
happy to write to members of the Committee and the LGA to put things on
a formal footing. I hope that that gives some reassurance to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="10011494000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000479"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): That is a
helpful response and I thank the Minister. Will he confirm that if this
partnership is put on a more formal basis, it will consider matters of
training and skills, as well as financial
burdens?</div><a name="10011494000056"></a>

Irranca-Davies:</b> Absolutely. Regardless of the aspect of
skills I mentioned, which could be funded through local planning
application funding, we have the skills and training, SUDS and the
transfer of private sewers. A very good eye must be kept on all those
things. We are confident in the assessment that we have done. We have
gone for the lower, more conservative estimates. My hon. Friend is
absolutely right about formalising the way forward, and I am happy to

was:</div><a name="10011494000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider that the local authority proposal for catchment area flood
management boards, similar to Regional Flood Defence Committees, has
much to recommend
it.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not see that that recommendation, which I endorse wholeheartedly,

a debate on another clause, the Minister gave the definition for ground
water. The explanatory notes inform us that the definition of ground
water in the Bill is different from that in directive 2000/60/EC, on
establishing a framework for Community action. In the Bill, it is
defined in a way that is relevant to flood risk management. We are told
that it
includes</div><a name="10011494000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
water which is below the surface of the ground and in direct contact
with the ground or
subsoil.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
reflection, I wonder whether the difference in the definition might
have covered the points that I wished to include. To a lay person it is
confusing to have two different definitions&#151;one in the Bill and
one in the directive. It would be helpful to know the reasons for
having
them.</div><a name="10011494000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was pointed out in the evidence session last week that the difficulty
with the national flood management strategy is that there should be
regional variations. Will the Minister confirm that clause 9 allows for
such regional and local variations? For example, some rivers are deep
whereas others are shallow; some need to be dredged and some do not. We
cannot simply have a no-dredging policy. That might be changed if there
is a change at the general election. We will see about that in the
fullness of time. Certainly, we firmly believe that flood risk
management should be maintained at a local level, using the local
expertise of those who know the area, with a strategic overview by the
Environment Agency.</div>
<a name="10011494000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Farmers and
landowners are concerned that there should be a greater input from
local people in shaping local flood and coastal erosion risk management
strategies. How does the Minister envisage that such an input will
happen? Obviously, we will keep a close eye on the resourcing element,
and we will revert to that in future, even if not during the course of
this Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="10011494000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister explained the relationship between clauses 9
and 8. I am aware that the Bill covers an appeals procedure, which will
be most welcome. We accept that the Bill offers a more joined-up and
effective approach to managing flood risks, but we would like to know
how such large-scale preparations and recovery are to be funded. The
Minister has given us some indication of that, but perhaps he could
give me a specific reference so that I can read more about it
myself.</div>
<a name="10011494000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the insurance concerns, it will be difficult to see what the
relationship between the two strategies will be. One of my concerns,
which we will return to elsewhere, is that we should be able to write
into the Bill&#151;in clause 9 and elsewhere where relevant&#151;an
element of flexibility between the tiers, rather than having a constant
fixation with the county. The hon. Member for Stroud admitted to not
knowing a great deal about SUDS. The more I read about SUDS the less I
feel I understand them.</div>
<a name="10011494000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for SUDS
relating to highways, counties are definitely the right level of
authority, but for development, to which the Minister referred in
respect of recovering some of the costs through planning charges, the
district council is the relevant authority. We should either write into
the Bill a level of flexibility or state that to be the case. There is
no point in having that lack of clarity in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10011494000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to
note that the LGA and the local authorities accept their
responsibilities and look forward to the clarity that they hope the
Bill will give them. The Minister says that the funds are sufficient,
but the LGA is firmly of the view that the figures being used are
invalid and seven years old, which is a concern. It is the councils
that are the experts. Only a small percentage of authorities spend any
money on private sewers, so we beg to differ with the Minister. Does he
know how many councils spend heavily on repairing and maintaining
private sewers? Can he give us a ballpark figure for an annual
maintenance cost to those
councils?</div><a name="10011494000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000484"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): I would like clarification of
one or two points that were not covered in the previous debate. The
success of a flood risk strategy is tested by the outcome in an
emergency situation. How does risk management relate to an emergency
response, who are the consultees in the preparation of the strategy,
and at what stage are they consulted?</div>
<a name="10011494000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 9(4)
lists a number of elements of the strategy: functions, objectives,
measures, how and when the measures are expected to be implemented, and
an assessment function. The issue might be dealt with in
subsection (6), which refers to risk management authorities,
but will the Minister clarify who has consulted fire and rescue
services, police, statutory undertakers, St. John Ambulance, social
services and any other organisation that might be called to be part of
a response to an emergency flood? Perhaps we can return to this under
clause 13, which refers to co-operation and
arrangements.</div><a name="10011494000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000485"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am pleased to respond and I will try to
take your proviso on board, Mr. Martlew, and respond
directly and snappily. On the clarification of clause 19 and the
ability to have regional variations&#151;yes, absolutely. We see the
potential for catchment area flood boards, but we do not have to
legislate for them. They can be created already; they do not have to be

<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>statutory. That follows the theme we have been talking about: the need
to engage properly with local partnerships and local expertise on the
ground. If there is a mood in an area to do that, it can be done; doing
so is not
precluded.</div><a name="10011494000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of the difference in the level of ground water is an immensely
technical one&#151;it sometimes confuses me as well&#151;but I am
happy to answer it in writing. In the Bill, the definition includes all
water below ground level, but the directive covers water below ground
level that has reached the level of the water table. I said that issue
was technical, and those are only the introductory comments. I will
happily write to the hon. Member for Vale of York and other members of
the Committee to explain it in some
detail.</div><a name="10011494000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the local input of farmers and individual landowners, which I know has
been a theme of the Committee so far, the lead local authorities have a
duty to consult the public on their strategies, and that should include
farmers and their representatives. I am sure we will return to that
subject, and we will consider what we can do in guidance to make
matters
explicit.</div><a name="10011494000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the seven-year-old figures used in the assessment of some of the costs
that we are working on, there is a counter-argument that if we used
up-to-date figures from the past couple of years&#151;since, for
example, we made clear our intention to transfer private
sewers&#151;the fact that some local authorities might have amended
their practice in anticipation of that could give us a completely
different set of figures. The point the hon. Lady made is right: it is
clear from our previous discussions that it is necessary to keep those
figures under review, to assess the actual costs coming forward and to
use those to guide our future discussions. We need to have robust
evidence.</div>
<a name="10011494000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked me to point out where exactly in the Bill local flexibility is
provided for. It is in the agreements within clause 13(4) and clause
29, which deals with restructuring. To return to the issue of private
sewers for a moment, the LGA has not as yet come up with anything
better than our current analysis based on its figures. However, we are
interested to see whether we can do that
altogether.</div><a name="10011494000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence
suggests that some local authorities are indeed winding down their
activities in anticipation of the transfer. However, as I said, we will
formalise our arrangement with the LGA. In response to the query of the
hon. Member for Upminster about the relationship with an emergency
response, all relevant organisations would be involved in the local
resilience forum, which will consider flooding and other risks, so
there is a synchronicity with those organisations. I hope that answers
the hon. Lady&#146;s
questions.</div><a name="10011494000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000488"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It is good to be serving under your chairmanship
this afternoon, Mr. Martlew. I thank the Minister and the
hon. Member for Vale of York for their kind remarks, which I will pass
on to my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire.</div><a name="10011494000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
98&#151;amendment 99 is on a similar theme&#151;is trying to start
us on the road to what I think is needed: a radical step change in our
approach to planning. Planning at its best, in the tradition of
Ebenezer Howard and the Town and Country Planning Association, was a
discipline that tried to take an holistic view of an area and look at
the entire environment. Sadly, in the intervening century, the
pressures of legislation, competing local priorities, local authority
boundaries, and the sheer pressure of work and bureaucracy of planning,
have reduced the discipline at times&#151;or the exercise of the
discipline in practice&#151;to a rather stressful and bureaucratic
balancing act between competing interests at the very local level. It
is often terribly local. It is often about narrowing things down to the
consideration of just one site at a time. At best, it deals with zones
of a particular town. That matters a lot and can lead to unfortunate
approaches for towns as a
whole.</div><a name="10011494000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
approach can have a serious effect on the natural environment and the
landscape. With our growing awareness of the importance of ecology and
the natural environment&#151;in the jargon of ecosystem
services&#151;to people&#146;s health, well-being and quality of
life, it becomes increasingly important to try to reverse the
trend.</div><a name="10011494000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2008, the Liberal Democrats convened a working group, which I was
pleased to be involved in, to look at a range of policies on the
natural environment. Many organisations gave evidence to us on the kind
of changes to policy and legislation that might be needed to reinforce
the protection and good management of the natural environment. One of
the strongest pieces of evidence that came through from many
organisations, which coincidentally included those involved in the
&#147;Blueprint for Water&#148; and the campaign for better
management of water resources, was to shift the approach to planning
the natural environment to the landscape scale wherever
possible.</div><a name="10011494000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had planning at a larger than local authority level under this
Government. For example, we have the notorious regional spatial
strategies. Sadly, I think the Government have failed on a number of
grounds. First, because the measures are top-down, they have been
handed down by the Department for Communities and Local Government,
through the Government offices at regional level, such as the
south-west, and enforced on local authorities with consultation, but no
willingness to change. In that way, there is never any ownership and
the local knowledge and expertise does not come
through.</div><a name="10011494000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
allocation of spatial planning has been reduced almost to the
allocation of new housing. The only maps in the draft regional spatial
strategy for the south-west show where the new houses will go. There
are no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>comparable maps showing where the valuable green space is to local
communities or where there is vital biodiversity that needs to be
protected. There are certainly no maps showing the valuable
watercourses and the location of areas that hold water in the landscape
or could hold more water to protect against
flooding.</div><a name="10011494000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to give firm direction to lead local
authorities. It would not oblige them to work together on joint flood
risk management strategies, but would give a strong incentive to do so.
Two or more lead local authorities that share a common landscape area
or water catchment area should be able to work together to produce a
shared landscape-scale local flood management strategy. That would have
important benefits for flood risk management. In addition, it might
help to start the shift towards more landscape-scale planning for the
natural environment in general, and so have ecological and
environmental benefits. It might even save money if, instead of each
lead local authority producing its own flood risk management plan, we
enabled them to work together to produce joint
ones.</div><a name="10011494000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a huge opportunity and this is an important amendment. I hope that
the Conservatives will support it and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s support or encouragement on the
matter.</div><a name="10011494000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000489"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000490"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Partnership is important, but the amendment is
carefully phrased: it says, &#147;may work together&#148;. We
should never be in the business of forcing local authorities to work
together when they do not want to. I can imagine that some areas of the
south-west might not want to work together. It is about providing
incentives and trying to give a clear direction, saying that the best
way to approach the natural environment is on an holistic basis,
looking at a large landscape-scale approach, and that that would be
good environmentally as well has having planning
benefits.</div><a name="10011494000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000491"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> This is an interesting amendment, because
it would, in effect, make the Bill state expressly that lead local
authorities in adjoining areas can work together to produce a joint
local flood risk strategy. I have made it clear in my
previous remarks that I am quite keen on the idea of collaborative
working where the expertise is located and on a larger
area&#151;catchment area&#151;basis, which is curiously in line
with what the hon. Member for Vale of York said earlier about the
catchment-area approach. That makes sense for authorities that are
willing to work together. I accept that it would be beneficial and I
should like it to happen. Indeed, it is not only beneficial, but it
could be desirable in some cases. All I would say is that we do not
need new powers to enable that to happen: it is already possible under
existing
powers.</div><a name="10011494000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
lead local authorities wish to work together to produce a strategy
covering a shared catchment, that is possible. It is also possible for
them to put together a strategy covering the area of more than one
authority. The important thing is that there is a strategy that covers
an area, but it is possible to do that already in
practice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div><a name="10011494000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000492"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I have been following the debate closely.
I think that the impulse behind the amendment is credible
and deserves consideration. The Minister has said that he recognises
that water has no borders&#151;all Committee members recognise
that&#151;and we all want there to be shared responsibility. Will the
Minister give us some real detail about the ways in which local
authorities might co-operate as a result of the
Bill?</div><a name="10011494000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000493"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is a helpful intervention. On the
ground, in reality, we will see authorities having a joint
strategy&#151;I am utterly confident that that can happen
already&#151;and working together to ensure that the content of their
strategies are compatible with each other&#146;s. Clause 13 requires
authorities to co-operate in the exercise of their functions, so it
will facilitate that. The measure will also be supported by Environment
Agency guidance, specifically provided for in clause 7(6),
which will seek to disseminate best practice on partnership working.
This provision shoots through the whole
Bill.</div><a name="10011494000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham tabled amendment 99, which would
insert after &#147;another risk management authority&#148; in
clause 13(4) the
words</div><a name="10011494000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;group
of risk management authorities working
together&#148;,</div><a name="10011494000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">which,
again, is in the theme that he is advancing. The intention behind the
amendment is to allow collaborative working and delegations of
functions across boundaries&#151;this great idea of working
together&#151;which I agree should be permitted. I send some
sympathy, because this is the way we should be heading. We do not want
to compel or force, but we need to enable this to happen. However, the
amendment is not needed because the words &#147;risk management
authority&#148; will be read under section 6 of the Interpretation
Act 1978 as including the plural as well as the singular. One authority
will be able to enter into arrangements with a few others because
legally it defines itself as both singular and plural. Authorities
could come together as a
group.</div><a name="10011494000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be interested to know what the hon. Gentleman makes of those
observations and what the hon. Member for Vale of York feels about the
collaborative approach to working across
borders.</div><a name="10011494000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000494"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am minded to agree with the Minister. I
believe that the catchment management area is where the natural scope
would come. I have been briefed by the floods team of the EU Commission
directorate on the implications, and I know that in the context of a
future, broader Bill, there is definitely scope for that. My
impression, on a strict reading of the existing Bill, and from the
Minister&#146;s explanation, is that we do not need the
amendments.</div><a name="10011494000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be concerned if the Minister were saying that there would not be
natural scope, because such things are often difficult for adjoining
areas. I look at my own area, where trying to get district councils to
work together and with the county council is exemplary, but if the
Minister is saying that that is to be encouraged, I would be satisfied
that we do not need a formal statutory reference to
it.</div><a name="10011494000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000495"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am encouraged by what the Minister has said. It
was extremely positive, and seems to suggest that the amendments may
not be necessary, and that exactly the kind of shift that we are
looking for might be in his mind, too.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div><a name="10011494000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister might be able to clear up my one slight reservation.
Collaboration and co-operation are not quite the same as shared working
on a shared strategy&#151;it is only collaboration. The hon. Member
for Isle of Wight probably gave us one of the best possible examples:
Hampshire as an authority entirely surrounds the City of Southampton
unitary authority and would therefore be subject to flooding going
across
boundaries.</div><a name="10011494000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me put this absolutely clearly: would it be legal under the terms of
the Bill if Southampton did not produce its own flood risk management
strategy but collaborated on a Hampshire-wide flood risk management
strategy that explicitly included it? Or would Southampton be taken to
task for not having fulfilled its duty to produce its own flood risk
management strategy? If the Minister would clarify that, I might be
perfectly willing to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000496"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> My understanding is that joint work on
producing a joint strategy across border areas would indeed be legal
within the interpretation of the Bill. The Bill will allow that to
happen. That is my clear understanding, but, if it is not correct, I
will happily write to Committee members to clarify the matter. That is
how we fashioned the Bill; it is how I intended it to operate. It will
allow authorities that want to come together to produce a strategy,
either as a pair of authorities or as several authorities in a group,
to do so. Shared working is allowed within the scope of the
Bill.</div><a name="10011494000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only proviso I would give is that, ultimately, the buck must stop
somewhere. Authorities can work together and produce a shared strategy,
but the lead authority in any particular area is ultimately responsible
for what happens in that area. There is no sharing of responsibility.
It lies with democratically accountable individuals in the lead
authority, and I think that that is right. It is simple, and it is what
I believe Pitt was seeking. He said that we should not construct
another edifice that confuses people about where to go. Authorities can
get on with bringing strategies together, and can work on them together
to produce one strategy&#151;that is legally allowed&#151;but the
buck has to stop with the lead local authority in each area, which will
be
accountable.</div><a name="10011494000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000497"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am encouraged by what the Minister has said. It
seems that he has entirely answered my questions, and that he has
opened the door to a new way of working on planning policy, if only in
this narrow area of flood risk management. We may have started a local
revolution here. We may actually get to the stage where planning is no
longer a narrowing down to ever smaller districts and small plots but
finally starts to look at a more holistic level at landscapes. This
could be a very important development, and I am happy to beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000500"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for
Brecon and Radnorshire, I will not speak to the amendment for long, to
the relief, I am sure, of all hon. Members. It is a testing amendment,
and we have already discussed in another context the difference between
policies or activities having either to be consistent with a flood risk
management strategy or to have regard to it. We discussed that
previously in the context of whether one local flood risk management
strategy would have to be consistent with the national flood risk
management strategy, as that would be an entirely manageable
responsibility.</div>
<a name="10011494000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The demand
for consistency in clause 11 could be much more onerous, as it applies
to all risk management authorities. We are now including district
councils and internal drainage boards, which do not have huge
resources, and they are being asked to be consistent with all flood
risk management strategies and guidance. I should be interested to hear
the Minister respond on the legal implications of that and the
liabilities that it might put on such bodies. Guidance is normally
voluntary, but we seem to be placing a legal duty on bodies, such as
internal drainage boards, to be absolutely consistent with guidance, or
to risk sanctions that presumably could be quite serious. That barely
seems to be guidance any more, but something much more
demanding.</div>
<a name="10011494000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I begin to
wonder whether that is one of the examples of poor drafting that the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee might have pointed to, as
we do not seem to have quite got a grasp of the interlocking web, which
the Bill will create, of responsibilities and consistencies and of
people having to have regard to each other&#146;s strategies. I am
not sure whether that has really been sorted out, so I would be
grateful to the Minister for his
comments.</div><a name="10011494000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000501"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b><b class="B"> </b>In place of the requirement that
risk management authorities, except water companies, act consistently
with the national and local strategies, amendments 118 and 119 would
introduce a weaker requirement that they should &#147;have regard
to&#148; those strategies. Under amendment 120, water companies also
would not need to act consistently with the national strategy, but only
to have regard to it. We have touched in previous debates upon the need
to act consistently and not simply to have regard to a strategy. Under
the amendment, those authorities could depart from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>strategies when they give a reason for doing so, and  I do not
think that any hon. Member wants that to happen.</div>
<a name="10011494000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are firmly committed to ensuring that all risk management
authorities act consistently with the national flood and coastal
erosion risk management strategy, because, in the light of our previous
discussions, the national strategy has a key role to play in setting
out the important approaches to flood management&#151;for example, in
taking a risk-based approach, considering resilience-type measures and
obtaining the wider environmental benefits to which the hon. Member for
Cheltenham has referred.</div>
<a name="10011494000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The national
strategy will also seek to ensure that different authorities do not
work in opposition to each other. That is of real importance because,
as we have said, water does not respect political or administrative
boundaries; it can have detrimental effects from one area to another.
In any event, it is intended that the national strategy should set out
broad approaches and not be prescriptive about the detail of schemes,
and we have given the outline to the Committee. However, in acting
consistently with local strategies, that duty would apply to district
councils, internal drainage boards and highways authorities, not to
water companies.</div>
<a name="10011494000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 11(1)
and (3) state that water companies must have regard to the local
strategy, but not necessarily to act consistently with it. That is
intended to avoid placing excessive burdens on water companies and
their charge payers and interfering with the regulatory regime that
operates alongside it. None the less, water companies must act
consistently with the national strategy, because they have to</div>
<a name="10011494000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to
the local
strategies&#148;,</div><a name="10011494000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
they must be able to explain why they would deviate from
it.</div>
<a name="10011494000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000502"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It seems a little extraordinary to try to remove
the burden from charge payers and, more obviously, from the
shareholders of local water companies&#151;given the enormous profits
that the water companies make, presumably they will have the legal
resources to defend themselves if they were challenged&#151;but not
from something as small as an internal drainage board or district
council.</div><a name="10011494000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000503"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Indeed, but there are parallel obligations
for the water companies both in terms of the regulatory regime and the
people who pay their bills through the water mechanism. As I have
explained, they have to act consistently with the national strategy,
because they must have regard to the local strategy. They would have to
explain why they chose to deviate from it on any occasion, and they
will be held accountable by the scrutiny committees locally, as well as
by being judicially reviewable.</div>
<a name="10011494000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
measure being too prescriptive for internal drainage boards and,
perhaps, smaller councils, it is intended that the lead local
authorities work closely with other authorities in drawing up their
strategies. In that way, those that need to act consistently with it
should be able to comply. The Environment Agency&#146;s guidance is
intended to disseminate best practice for working together locally and
should help to facilitate working in partnership, rather than
duplicating work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div><a name="10011494000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a risk
management authority cannot comply with the measure, it can raise the
matter directly with the Secretary of State, who has the power to give
guidance to the lead local flood authority, which can review the
financial position. So authorities have that recourse if they need it.
We do not anticipate such a situation arising, but if they need that
recourse they have
it.</div><a name="10011494000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
intend all the bodies to work closely with the lead local authority in
putting together the strategy, so there should be little possibility of
the lead authority dictating to some other authority. Given the duty to
act consistently, everybody will have a strong and consistent incentive
to get involved in the
process.</div><a name="10011494000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
risk management partners will be full partners in the creation of both
the local strategies and the local guidance that relates to them.
Therefore, there is no reason why they will not want to implement the
guidance and strategies that have been part and parcel of their work.
The essence is that we do the job properly on the ground. I am talking
about real local engagement and collaboration. When we put our offer
out there and say to all the management partners that they have the
ability to create a local strategy, our expectation is that they should
get on with doing that job and deliver local
solutions.</div><a name="10011494000130"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000504"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The spirit of co-operation is alive and well,
and we obviously support the amendments. I found the Minister&#146;s
explanation most helpful, because clauses 11 and 12 are not quite as
clear as he has expressed
them.</div><a name="10011494000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000505"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not entirely convinced by the
Minister&#146;s explanation, which still seems to be slightly
tortuous. I have not detected an answer to the question about why a
legal duty will be placed on organisations such as district councils
always to be consistent with something that is called guidance.
Guidance is normally something that need not be applied
consistently.</div>
<a name="10011494000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000506"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I intervene only to reiterate that if this
was top-down guidance from a Minister in Whitehall, I would have
sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but this is local
guidance and local strategies that local bodies will construct
themselves. On that basis, they will be devising it in accordance with
the national strategy parameters and in a way in which they can
deliver, and that is very good for local
democracy.</div><a name="10011494000133"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000510"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> These are probably the most important amendments
that have been moved so far. I will consider each of them in turn,
although taking all the amendments together, the idea is that we
achieve what the Government say that they wish to achieve: the end of
the automatic right to connect, which was one of the primary objectives
of the Pitt
report.</div><a name="10011494000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
11 would insert a new paragraph (c) to clause 11(3) to insist that a
water company
is</div><a name="10011494000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consulted
on all major new developments and their waste water
capacity&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
to be clear, I am talking not about a minor development of one or two
houses filling in, but about major new developments, such as the 300
houses that I mentioned along the Muston road in a saturated,
waterlogged field. The Minister will probably say that water companies
are consulted at the moment, but I would like them to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>be consulted on planning applications on the same basis as the
Environment Agency, under planning policy statement 25.</div>
<a name="10011494000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea is
that a water company would not just be consulted on a major new
development of anything over 20, 30, 50 or more houses, as under the
Government&#146;s housing objectives, but be able to say that the
capacity of waste water coming from those houses would not connect to
the existing infrastructure, if that was so, and that conditions could
be attached in that
regard.</div><a name="10011494000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to earlier instances that the Committee has
considered, including on the Isle of Wight and in Gloucestershire
especially. From my knowledge of North Yorkshire, the Environment
Agency often sets conditions at a certain level, but the housing
development goes ahead and other existing houses from previous recent
developments are flooded through no fault of their owners. I hope that
the Minister will agree to establish the precedent that the developers
be required to pay for the costs of improving the infrastructure and
for making good the connection, rather than the existing
development.</div><a name="10011494000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment shows quite radical thinking and is intended to be helpful,
because the Government have stated&#151;the Minister said it as
recently as last week in the evidence session&#151;that they seek to
end the automatic right to connect. I hope that amendment 112 is in a
similar vein, but I will let the hon. Member for Cheltenham
explain.</div><a name="10011494000440"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="10011494000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 14, 15 and 22 add meat to what we intend. New clause 14 would
end the automatic connection as a statutory right. There would be no
automatic connection for waste water pipes for major new developments
without the agreement of the water or sewerage company. It states that
water companies must be consulted to ensure that the existing
infrastructure system can manage the new demands and that water
companies must have conducted a detailed assessment and looked at
scenarios to see what the extra demand and increased capacity will be.
Subsection (1)(c) of new clause 14, which is extremely important,
states:</div><a name="10011494000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;financial
responsibility for building the extra infrastructure has been
apportioned&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
speaks to the point that the developer and the new houses would have to
respond to the call for extra
financing.</div><a name="10011494000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Formal
planning permission would be given only on the basis that the criteria
the water companies had requested were met. That means that we would
not see the scale of spill-off into existing developments from new
developments that there has been. That would meet the Minister&#146;s
stated aim of ending automatic
connection.</div><a name="10011494000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 15 would make water companies statutory consultees on the same
basis as the Environment Agency. In the first year that the Environment
Agency obtained the new powers, there were 16 instances of planning
authorities proceeding to give planning permission, despite what it had
said. I think we can all point to examples where planning permission
should not have been given because the developments have flooded or
have caused flooding on adjoining properties. New clause 15 would give
water companies the same statutory authority, as consultees, as the
Environment Agency. They would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>able to set conditions and inform the planning process. New clause 22
would make consequential changes to previous legislation relating to
planning permission and connection to the sewerage
system.</div><a name="10011494000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Minister and the Committee will agree to the changes, because
all constituents in England and Wales would benefit from
them. In case I do not have the opportunity to speak after the hon.
Member for Cheltenham speaks to amendment 112, I state
now that we support it because we do not believe
that county level is necessarily the right level for the
approval of SUDS. We would like to see flexibility, as I
said earlier, and that amendment would
deliver it, subject to the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="10011494000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000511"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> I want to speak briefly in support of my hon.
Friend&#146;s proposals. Given the intention behind them, I am
surprised that they are not already in the Bill. This issue has been
discussed by Pitt and others. My impression was that there was a
consensus that we end the automatic right to
connect.</div><a name="10011494000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
living in areas that have flooded may have seen the drainage system
doing the reverse of what it is supposed to do&#151;throwing water on
to the streets and creating rivers running down them. That is a
spectacular but very frightening sight, and it is damaging to any
houses that happen to be in the way of what becomes a river. I have a
particular image in my mind of where that took place. Again, that was
following a new development being built in an area where it should not
have been built. We come back to the same
problem.</div><a name="10011494000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not got to the point where the regional spatial strategy for the
south-west has been accepted, and I hope it will not be accepted for
the reasons I have given in Committee and in the House many times. Even
if we go down that route, we are going to build an awful lot of
houses&#151;thousand and thousands&#151;on very small areas of
land. As I have said before, there would be more than 14,000 in my
constituency alone, which is an increase of almost 40 per cent. on the
current housing stock. That is a huge number of houses. Frankly, if we
go down that route without the safeguard of the amendments and new
clauses put forward by my hon. Friend, that would be very frightening
indeed.</div>
<a name="10011494000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noticed
that the Minister was nodding during much of the speech made by my hon.
Friend. I hope he will be sympathetic to the new clauses and
amendments, for the reason given not only by my hon. Friend and me, but
by everyone involved in this debate over the past two and a half
years.</div><a name="10011494000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000512"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I do not always agree with the hon. Member for
Tewkesbury, Conservative Front Benchers, Ofwat or Sir Michael Pitt on
everything, but I do agree with them on this. If I were being picky, I
might point out that there are some slight drafting difficulties with
some of the amendments, but their thrust is important and they address
a crucial
issue.</div><a name="10011494000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman rightly said, this was a key recommendation of the
Pitt report. Recommendation 10 is absolutely unambiguous:</div>
<a name="10011494000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the automatic
right to connect surface water drainage of new developments to the
sewerage system should be
removed.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also came as a bit of a shock to me to discover that the matter is not
as clear in the detail of the Bill. When South West Water wrote to me,
it stated:</div>
<a name="10011494000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Highway
drainage systems are the most common route by which excess
inappropriate flows gain entry into sewers and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>overload them. We do not accept that highway drainage should be
permitted to connect to foul or combined sewers and that connections to
surface water sewers should be by Agreement only... In order for them
to perform the essential role of protecting public health, sewers must
be regarded as critical infrastructure that should be protected from
the effects of flooding as far as possible. Due to their location
underground they are the first critical infrastructure to become
affected and overwhelmed during heavy
rainfall.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
concluded:</div><a name="10011494000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Flood and Water Management Bill increases the risk of flooding from
sewers resulting in failure of service, sewer flooding, pollution and
increased
costs&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a worrying conclusion. Of course, in new developments it is not just
the individual drainage of houses but road drainage that is being added
to. That is part of the whole equation. I am sympathetic to
amendment 11.</div>
<a name="10011494000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14
is extremely important and the assumption behind it is that in
practice, if the water companies&#146; consent is not given, new
developments cannot proceed. I hope that would be the result of the
provision if it goes
through.</div><a name="10011494000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000513"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> My only fear relates to the notion of adopted and
unadopted roads. We all have examples in our constituencies of
developers coming forward with proposals that in due course would lead
to the full adoption of roads, and we all know that that does not
always happen. I know the situation is a bit more drastic where water
is concerned, but will the hon. Gentleman assure me that if we pass the
amendments, we will end up with clarity and not with adopted and
unadopted sewers, and so on? Otherwise, this could be a
nightmare.</div><a name="10011494000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000514"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Exactly the same thought had occurred to me. New
clause 14 is drafted particularly with respect to new properties and
raises the theoretical probability that people could be left in limbo
again, with unadopted sewers. However, I think the implication of the
new clause&#151;this is why I said what I said before the hon.
Gentleman intervened&#151;is that in practice a new development could
not go ahead if the water company&#146;s consent had not been
obtained.</div>
<a name="10011494000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause also states that no connection will be granted
until</div><a name="10011494000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;formal
planning permission has been
given.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be a rather brave local authority that gave planning permission
for something when consent from the water company had not been obtained
and there was no automatic right to connect. In effect, the local
authority would almost intentionally create an anomaly in committing
the new developer to that situation. Therefore, the new clause is not
completely tidy. However, the important thing is that the issue in the
amendments and new clauses is being raised here. I hope that the
Minister takes that seriously enough to look again at whether we are
implementing Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s recommendation on that crucial
point.</div><a name="10011494000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a slight difficulty with new clause 15, partly because of the word
&#147;equally&#148;: it states that the planning authority, for all

and</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div><a name="10011494000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the Environment
Agency.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pretty content for the Environment Agency, which is a Government
body with explicit responsibilities for the natural environment and
sustainable development, to have an important consultative role.
However, water companies are principally private companies with
shareholder interests and private interests. They are businesses and
they might, somewhat mischievously, object to something simply because
it might increase their costs. We do not want to allow that. However,
the important point is that, through all the new clauses, we establish
that there is no automatic right to connection. Developers have to
recognise
that.</div><a name="10011494000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
112 addresses a slightly different issue. We think there may be a
mistake in the Bill. It appears logical, and it certainly is logical in
a unitary authority area, for the approving body to be the lead local
authority, but in a two-tier area, the lead local authority, being the
county council, is not the planning authority&#151;that is the
district council. The provision could create the strange situation
where there is an extra layer of bureaucracy. The Local Government
Association put it like
this:</div><a name="10011494000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
situation also means that developers who normally apply to district
councils for planning permission could be forced to seek a separate
approval for developments from county councils. This would create a
further complication for the recovering property market as well as
additional wasteful
bureaucracy.</div><a name="10011494000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
SUDS approval system should work in the same way as issues relating to
highways. In these situations in two-tier areas the district planning
authority consults with the county to ensure that highways issues are
properly addressed. The same system should be used for the approval of
SUDS. Local knowledge and a detailed understanding of the planning
process are vital if this system is to be successful in
practice.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
we are potentially complicating the whole process unnecessarily. There
is a planning authority. It should have that responsibility and we
should not in effect place that extra, rather complicated burden on the
lead local authority, whose expertise is not really in planning. That
is the purpose of amendment
112.</div><a name="10011494000171"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000515"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I appreciate the opportunity that the
debate affords us to get into the detail of the issue and to clarify
some matters. The issue that underpins that&#151;it has been raised
by the hon. Members for Vale of York and for Cheltenham&#151;is the
right to automatic connection. The question was, has that gone, and why
is that not stated explicitly? It has gone. Let me explain
why.</div>
<a name="10011494000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The automatic
right to connection is being removed. That will be conditional on the
SUDS approving body, an advisory body, approving the drainage. That is
in line with the recommendation of Pitt, who wanted a process whereby
developers have to consider alternatives to connection. Approval for
national standards, which I will come to in a moment to help explain
the matter, will do
that.</div><a name="10011494000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
effect, we are talking about a hierarchy in respect of SUDS. The last
option&#151;developers would have to show that every other option had
been exhausted&#151;would be connection. So the automatic right to
connection has gone. Let me explain the national standards, because
they are critical to this. Those standards are being developed by the
Construction Industry Research and Information Association. The first
draft will be out in spring this year.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div><a name="10011494000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislative framework for delivering SUDS is set out in the Bill, and
the standards will be open to public consultation. People will have the
opportunity to input their thoughts on what we propose, on the costs,
and on whether the process is good or could be improved, before we
finally sign it off. A project advisory board, encompassing key
stakeholders, has been meeting for some time to offer guidance on the
development of the standards.</div>
<a name="10011494000441"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10011494000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are developing the standards with the industry, and we will put them
out for consultation. I shall give an overview without revealing the
result. Essentially, a hierarchy will compel developers to start with
SUDS development of the various types, from swales to more complex
underground tanks and so on. That is the hierarchy of consideration. We
shall then put in criteria that the industry will have to meet. It will
have to reason its way through many hurdles before it can say,
&#147;Well, all of those have been exhausted. We simply cannot do it
because of the geography, the topography, the environment. We cannot do
anything else. Will you allow us to make a
connection?&#148;</div>
<a name="10011494000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to go into technical detail, but the matter will be put out for public
consultation. It will show clearly, in line with the Bill, that the
right to automatic connection will have gone. We have flipped the
situation completely on its head, saying, &#147;You start with SUDS
development, and you have to work your way through that before being
considered.&#148; Ultimately, the SUDS approving body&#151;the
SAB&#151;will have to decide whether to give the go
ahead.</div>
<a name="10011494000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000516"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> We are talking about different things. The hon.
Member for Stroud expressed the frustration that we all
feel&#151;that no one quite understands what a SUDS is. I came up
with a definition; when we get there, I hope the Minister will be
minded to approve it. However, I am not talking about the SUDS. I have
spoken to all the water companies and their umbrella organisations, and
they are convinced that if the Minister persists with the Bill in its
present form, there will be no end to the automatic right to
connect.</div>
<a name="10011494000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
talking about the SUDS&#151;the pond that takes the excess water,
which may or may not invert into a sewerage pipe. I shall be very
crude, Mr. Martlew, but as polite as I can be. I am talking
about the stuff that comes out of the toilet and goes into the waste
water pipe. It immediately connects into the main sewerage pipe, which
is the responsibility of the water company and the sewerage
undertaker&#151;it may not be the same company. A SUDS is completely
different. My understanding of a SUDS is that, broadly, it takes two
forms. One is the water spill-over off the road or highway. The
other&#151;</div><a name="10011494000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000517"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. This is an
intervention.</div>
<a name="10011494000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000518"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> It is. The other is what the Minister is talking
about. In my view, it should never have a connection into the sewerage
pipe because it is not sewage. The SUDS is the overflow for saturation
and water-logging. The Minister must address that
point.</div>
<a name="10011494000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000519"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me address that point directly. I
understand now what the hon. Lady is pushing at. There is some
confusion about what the Bill is trying to
achieve.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div><a name="10011494000182"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000521"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. It would be helpful if the Minister
replied to the intervention before taking another.</div>
<a name="10011494000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000522"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> But amendment 112 is on a slightly different
topic. It relates to SUDS.</div>
<a name="10011494000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000523"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I shall deal directly with the point.
There are no proposals to amend the existing right to connect what I
politely call foul drainage from new developments to the public
sewerage system. It is not in line with Pitt, and we believe that it is
not in the public health interest to do so.</div>
<a name="10011494000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there are
capacity problems with foul drainage, it is reasonable to expect the
sewerage undertaker to make provision for improvements to deal with it.
Where the timing of such improvements is not found to coincide with a
development proposal, it must be for the planning authority to take a
view on whether the problem is such that development should be
deferred. I hope the Committee is clear about that. I do not know
whether anyone disagrees, but what we are dealing with is separate from
foul water management and public health issues.</div>
<a name="10011494000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
permission, Mr. Martlew, I shall continue. I wish to make
progress on the amendments.</div>
<a name="10011494000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000524"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="10011494000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000525"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> May I make some progress first, as I
expect the hon. Gentleman will be asking about matters I am trying to
clarify?</div>
<a name="10011494000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 15
seeks to ensure that the relevant planning authority for all major new
developments consults water companies and the Environment Agency. It
further requires that the consultations are in accordance with planning
policy statement 25, that they establish the impact of the proposed new
development on the local drainage system, and that they inform the
planning
process.</div><a name="10011494000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members will be pleased to know that in England, the
Environment Agency is already a statutory consultee for planning
applications and is consulted on applications for major developments as
well as for most developments in flood risk areas. Those arrangements
are set out in a table in article 10 of the Town and Country Planning
(General Development Procedure) Order
1995.</div><a name="10011494000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Making
all water companies statutory consultees for all planning applications
would impose a significant burden on water companies. For smaller scale
developments, the cost of assessment of applications might well exceed
their value in informing a planning decision. It would also duplicate
the arrangements for the SUDS approval process, outlined in paragraph
11(3) of schedule 3, which lists water and sewerage companies, as well
as the Environment Agency, among the statutory consultees to the SUDS
approval body or SAB. Water companies will be consulted if the SAB is
considering a surface water drainage application and if a connection to
the surface water sewer is
proposed.</div><a name="10011494000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 15 would also be inconsistent with the laudable set of policy
proposals, on which the Government are consulting, aimed at improving
the planning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>consultation process. Our aim is to reduce unnecessary consultation and
to speed up the determination of planning applications, which is a
major consideration for many people in their areas as we look for
affordable housing and so on. Making all water companies statutory
consultees would not support that
objective.</div><a name="10011494000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011494000526"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Grogan</b> (Selby) (Lab): I have two quick questions.
First, would the Minister be more sympathetic to an amendment or new
clause that had a de minimis provision, with water companies being
statutory consultees for just the larger planning applications
considered by local authorities? Secondly, to clarify, who judges
whether the national standards for SUDs have been met in any
development?</div><a name="10011494000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000527"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> May I return later to the second point?
The idea of a de minimis provision goes away from the principle that we
are trying to establish, which is getting the balance right between the
loads on the system, and the easing or streamlining of the planning
application system. I shall come to how that works in a moment, because
what we are also configuring in the Bill is the ability to streamline
the point at which a potential developer&#151;whether private or a
social housing developer&#151;receives an answer on the planning
application and on sustainable drainage; they can have that answer at
the same time from one person, without having to go to two different
areas. I shall come to that, but it will help to deal with the issue
that my hon. Friend has
raised.</div><a name="10011494000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 22, which may or may not be probing, seeks water and sewerage
consultation on the proposed location of connection to the sewer. We
would not normally comment on the drafting of such an amendment, but it
is worth noting that new clause 22 as drafted would mean connections to
the foul sewer as well as to the surface water sewer. I am not sure
whether that is deliberate but, as the Bill deals with issues such as
surface water, let me focus only on that element of the new
clause.</div><a name="10011494000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the SUDS introduced by the Bill, the consultation proposed by new
clause 22 is unnecessary. Following the removal of the automatic right
to connect to the surface water sewer, the drainage of new development
will be assessed in the light of the SUDS national standard, which
would only allow a connection to the sewer as a last, or almost last,
resort. As stated previously, the SAB will be required to consult the
relevant sewerage undertaker before making its determination. As the
Committee will be aware, paragraph 7 of schedule 3 provides that no
construction can begin until SUDS approval has been obtained. The new
clause, as configured, would add to the burdens for local authorities
and for sewerage undertakers because it would duplicate the
arrangements that will be put in place for SUDS approvals. I suspect
that one of the things that has emerged from the debate is the need to
provide further clarity, so it might be an idea to write to members of
the Committee to provide further clarity on how we see the SUDS
developing, how that hierarchy will work and how the right to automatic
connection will figure within that and become, in a way, a last
resort.</div>
<a name="10011494000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000528"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> Is not the point of difference in that regard,
as I understand it, that where improvements 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>are necessary to the sewerage system because of large new developments,
under the amendment, the cost would fall on the developer, rather than
the public
body?</div><a name="10011494000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000529"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is one of the proposals that have
been put forward in our discussions, but it is not something on which
we need to decide now. Because of the consultation that we will have,
we will bring forward proposals, on both the hierarchy and alternative
ways of funding, and I strongly suspect that the proposal that has been
put forward will be one of the options. That is the appropriate way to
do it, because I suspect that local authorities, developers and others
will want to put forward their own ideas about the best way of funding
SUDS development. Is it to do with individual householders, local
authorities or developers themselves? Is it a proportionate approach
between them? Does it depend on the size of the development? We do not
have to decide on that for the Bill, but we will do so through proper
consultation.</div>
<a name="10011494000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
explain one aspect. The regulation-making powers already in the Bill
allow us to set a de minimis for who applies to the SUDS approving
body, so we could do it through that approach. If we are going to do
that, let us start with large developments. Again, however, we can
consult on that and take further ideas.</div>
<a name="10011494000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14
seeks to introduce a restriction on the connection of any new waste
drainage to the public sewerage system by making it subject to a number
of new conditions. Those conditions are that planning permission is
granted only after consultation has been carried out with water and
sewerage companies on the capacity of their systems to manage the extra
demand; that the companies have carried out a detailed assessment of
the extra demand likely to be created; and that the responsibility of
meeting the cost of creating any necessary additional infrastructure is
apportioned.</div>
<a name="10011494000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make it
absolutely clear that it is for water and sewerage companies to finance
their investment programmes, which already make provision for improving
the capacity of their infrastructure where they have investment planned
in response to proposals contained in development plans. To the extent
that a local planning authority considers it necessary for investment
in additional capacity to be brought forward to enable a development to
proceed, it is already open to it to seek a planning obligation to
provide for a contribution to the financing of that investment. Where
it is not satisfied that the necessary infrastructure can be put in
place, it may refuse planning permission.</div>
<a name="10011494000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Bill
is about managing surface water, the ability to connect foul drainage
to the public sewerage system will remain. However, subject to the
requirement under clause 41, all new sewers and lateral drains
connecting to the public sewerage systems will have to be built to a
standard to be published by the Secretary of State and adopted as part
of the public system. That answers the query that was rightly raised
earlier. We have been through that before in relation to a different
issue and do not want to repeat that mistake. That will be done by
entering into a formal adoption agreement with water and sewerage
companies under section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991.
Furthermore, as I have already mentioned, water companies will of
course be statutory consultees to the SUDS approval process where a
connection to the surface water sewer is proposed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div><a name="10011494000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and Radnorshire have tabled
amendment 112, which would amend paragraph 6(1)(b) of schedule 3 so
that if there is no unitary authority for an area, the role of the SAB
would not be given to the relevant county council, but to the local
planning authority. Paragraph 6(1) of schedule 3 establishes a SUDS
approving body and gives those functions to county or unitary local
authorities. The SAB would be responsible for approving all surface
water drainage systems for new construction work, in accordance with
the new national standards, and adopting and maintaining SUDS that
serve more than one property, where they have been constructed as
approved. Placing SUDS approval and adoption responsibilities at the
county local authorities level fits well alongside their existing
responsibilities for highways maintenance. We expect many SUDS to be
located in or alongside roads, especially within dense urban
environments.</div><a name="10011494000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, county councils will have wider responsibilities under the
lead local flood authority role in part 1. They will also have
responsibilities for surface water management planning. Placing the SAB
at the county rather than the district level, where many planning
authorities are located, will mean that the SAB has the wider surface
water and flooding overview, on a larger scale, to help it to determine
drainage
applications.</div><a name="10011494000442"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="10011494000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also worked to align the planning and the SAB approval processes.
When planning permission is needed, the developer can apply directly to
the planning authority for both planning permission and SUDS drainage
approval, which would streamline the process for developers&#151;a
point that I raised earlier. The SAB will be statutory consultee to the
planning authority and will return its decision to the planning
authority, which will notify the
developer.</div><a name="10011494000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
should be noted, in line with the comments that have been made, that
there is nothing to prevent unitary or county local authorities, in
their role as SUDS approving bodies, from transferring by agreement
their approval functions to a local planning authority. Let us be clear
about that. However, the SUDS approving body would retain
responsibility and liability for SUDS. The buck stops with the
approving body, but it could delegate the
function.</div><a name="10011494000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
11 would ensure that water companies are consulted on all major new
developments and their waste water capacity. The clause is about the
duties of risk management authorities in relation to flood risk
management strategies, so the amendment would not have a meaningful
effect in the context of the clause. In any event, what it seeks to
achieve is not necessary because, as I stated previously, SAB approval
is required when construction has surface water draining implications,
and water companies are statutory consultees to that approval process
when a connection to the sewer is proposed. On that basis, and with
that extensive clarification, I hope the hon. Lady will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000209"></a>

he will be aware that we are not seeking to make the planning authority

10 of the Pitt review could not be clearer. It goes to the heart of the
matter. It is a question of semantics. I am talking about waste water
sewage, foul water sewage&#151;the stuff that comes through the
toilet&#151;while the hon. Gentleman is talking about surface water
sewage. I am not disagreeing with him. There is an element of
agreement, but the recommendation
states:</div><a name="10011494000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
automatic right to connect surface water drainage of new developments
to the sewerage system should be removed.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011494000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon. Gentleman
is saying that we are going further than that, I can point to several
flood issues and incidents in 2007, 2005 and 2000 when the properties
of recent developments were flooded with sewage&#151;foul
water&#151;from existing developments. I take the point made by the
hon. Member for Selby. He expressed it well. We are talking about major
new

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000533"></a>Huw

giving way. The incidents to which I refer concern foul water coming
out of new developments that could not connect to the existing

Although the report is extremely important, it is not necessarily the
be all and end all. If my hon. Friend wishes to propose an amendment or
new clause saying that foul water should be disposed of in such a way,
she is perfectly entitled to do so, regardless of what Pitt said or
meant to say.</div>
<a name="10011494000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000536"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for that.
The hon. Member for Copeland will probably confirm that that was the
case in the Cumbrian floods. We are talking about major new
developments&#151;I did 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>refer to 20, 30, 50 or more houses in a development, so I do not think
the scenario the Minister painted would be accurate. The reason why I
pressed the Committee on this point is that we are trying to prevent
floods from whatever source they come. The most recent
floods&#151;Cumbria in 2007, 2005, 2001 and 2000&#151;clearly
demonstrate that we are talking about a major source of flooding. There
are public health issues and as the Minister knows from his own
experience, with which I sympathise in a heartfelt manner, people are
not allowed to return to their homes&#151;they can only do that if it
is river water or surface water&#151;because of the public health
implications.</div>
<a name="10011494000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
outrageous that the Government are suggesting that water and sewerage
companies should fund the improvements needed to connect the waste
water coming from the new houses, which most people do not want next
door to them, into the existing infrastructure. Frankly, why should I
or my constituents pay, as existing customers of a water company who go
through a five-year review to envisage what their requirements will be,
when in the middle of that review there may be planning permission for
20, 50 or 200 houses of which they had no previous knowledge, and which
the Minister is now saying they should account for? That is plain
wrong. If we are saying that improvements to the infrastructure are
only required in this case because of a new development, that should be
reflected in who pays. If we ask the developer to pay, the cost will be
transferred to the new occupants of those
houses.</div><a name="10011494000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000537"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Will the hon. Lady let us know what
discussions she has had with other stakeholders, including house
builders and so on, about her proposal? I have some sympathy with
aspects of it, but we do not need to fix this in the Bill. We need
properly to take advice and to consult, and then reach a conclusion,
rather than acting in a way that simply says, &#147;Regardless, it is
all going to fall on this.&#148; She may well be right&#151;I am
not saying she is not&#151;but we need to act in a timely way, and we
do not need to do it
here.</div><a name="10011494000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000538"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> With the greatest respect, what are we here for?
We are here to improve the Bill. The Minister has had the required
consultations. It is as a result of those consultations and direct
face-to-face meetings that the Minister is asking water and sewerage
companies to pay. If there was scope for wider consultation on the
amendment before Report stage, I would be happy to concede that. I do
not disagree with him about SUDS, but I believe it wrong in principle
that the existing water and sewerage companies should pay for new
housing that is largely part of Government policy, but not Opposition
policy.</div><a name="10011494000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have mentioned my last area of disagreement with regard to SUDS before,
but the Minister has spelled it out so I would like to explain why I
disagree with him. I do not believe that county councils are the
appropriate authorities for SUDS, other than for those relating to
highways. I disagree with their being the approving bodies for SUDS
relating to major developments, to which he referred. We should write
into the Bill that district councils, which are the relevant planning
authorities, should be the approving bodies. We could then consider the
amendments in which we take that a stage further when the time is
right. I do not want to test the Committee&#146;s patience too
greatly, and I am happy to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>return to amendment 11 and new clauses 15 and 22 at a later stage, but I
would like to press new clause 14 to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000560"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I wish to raise one or two points that it was
not possible to raise in previous discussions on specific amendments.
Clause 11 refers to partnerships. In allowing, accommodating and even
encouraging collaboration, does partnership have a special, technical
meaning in encouraging local authorities to co-operate, particularly in
river catchment areas, as we discussed previously? Different issues
apply: the Minister&#146;s amendments refer to country borders;
catchment managements refer to cross-council borders. I want to
highlight the financing of the obligations arising from clause 11,
because an ongoing concern is whether they will be properly
resourced.</div><a name="10011494000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
subsection 3(a) and (b), is there scope for having regard to strategies
and guidance? Will all the parties to which the Bill refers be formally
consulted and will they have any input into the drafting of the local
strategies and
guidance?</div><a name="10011494000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5)
says:</div><a name="10011494000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order require a specified person to have
regard to the national and local
strategies&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a point of clarification, how would he identify who that specifying
person would be? I want to strike a note that we are concerned that the
decision making is not quite as democratic as we would wish. As has
been noted previously, we want to be sure that the local plans are
consistent with the national plan, but by the same token&#151;while
admiring the role of the Environment Agency&#151;we want to be sure
that the agency may not overrule in any way what the local strategy in
a specific area is planning to do. We would like to think that, as far
as possible, local strategies will be as autonomous as possible for
that area. Could the Minister clarify again how he thinks that the
local plan will be consistent with the national plan, and will he
ensure that the Environment Agency is not too overbearing in that
regard?</div><a name="10011494000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000561"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am pleased to respond to those points.
The clause will give effect to the national flood and coastal erosion
risk management strategy prepared by the Environment Agency and the
local flood risk management strategies prepared by the lead local flood
authorities in England. Under the clause, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>the risk management authorities in England will be required to exercise
the flooding and coastal erosion risk management functions in a manner
consistent with the national and local strategies, as we
discussed.</div><a name="10011494000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only exception to that is the water companies, which are already
subject to a separate regulatory regime. We concluded that they should
not be bound by detailed local strategies. They are therefore required
to exercise their flood and coastal erosion risk management functions
in a manner that is consistent with the national strategy and to have
regard to the local strategies and guidance. The Bill does not identify
any water company functions as flood and coastal erosion risk
management functions, but, for clarification, it does allow for such
functions to be added by
order.</div><a name="10011494000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked who &#147;a specified person&#148; in subsection
(5) might be. Examples might well be Natural England, British Waterways
or others, as time goes by. In addition, the risk management
authorities will be required to have regard to the national and local
strategies and any guidance when exercising other statutory functions
that may affect flood or coastal erosion risk, so helping to ensure
consistent approaches by different
authorities.</div><a name="10011494000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who
will be consulted on the national and local strategies? For the
national strategy, I refer to clause 7(3), and for the local strategy,
I refer to clause 9(6), on which we had some discussion. However, as
was mentioned, to allow for changing circumstances over time, clause 11
allows the Secretary of State by order
to</div><a name="10011494000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;require
a specified person to have regard to
the...strategies&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady asked who should be consulted, and we have rightly had some
discussion on that already. All the risk management authorities will be
consulted, and there will be public consultation on the local
strategies. All those who have to act consistently will be consulted,
and there will be opportunity for people to give input, and by so
doing, to shape the
strategies.</div><a name="10011494000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

McIntosh:</b> I beg to move amendment 13, in clause 13, page

&#145;must&#146;.</div><a name="10011494000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the amendment is clear. Instead of saying that a relevant

that a relevant authority &#147;must&#148; share
information</div><a name="10011494000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;with
another relevant authority for the purpose of discharging its duty

(1).&#148;</div><a name="10011494000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister explained in which circumstances an

<a name="10011494000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that the Bill will allow co-operation and such arrangements in
relation to other amendments. However, we believe that the measure does
not go far enough, and we would simply like to stretch it. Will the
Minister say whether there are circumstances in which the relevant
authorities may choose not to share information and what lies behind
the existing
terminology?</div><a name="10011494000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000563"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Yes, I think that I can explain that
because I certainly exercised my mind on the matter when the hon.
Lady&#146;s amendment was tabled. I have tried to see the
implications on either side. Just to reassure her, we are confident
that the current drafting, which uses &#147;may&#148;, rather than
&#147;must&#148;, and which we have done through parliamentary
counsel and so on, is appropriate for the reasons that I will give in a
moment.</div><a name="10011494000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment uses the word &#147;must&#148; and would therefore
require relevant authorities to share information, but it is not
necessary because the duty to co-operate already entails a duty to
share information if that is part of the co-operation. The purpose of
subsection (2) is also to permit one relevant authority proactively to
offer information to another authority without being asked.</div>
<a name="10011494000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
explored the matter in some detail, so let me practically illustrate
it. If we insert the word &#147;must&#148; into the provision to
give that certainty&#151;I understand where the hon. Lady is coming
from&#151;it could be a retrograde step. Doing so would require all
relevant bodies, including, for example, water companies and highway
authorities, proactively to go through all their paper and computer
records, and find and pass on any information that they thought might
be relevant to another risk management authority&#146;s duties under
part 2.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div><a name="10011494000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would put a huge obligation on such organisations that is probably
beyond the necessary information that is actually required. It would
certainly militate against the idea of encouraging people to work in
partnership and volunteer information that they thought useful. It
would send a lot of people in back offices running around as a result
of their chief executives saying, &#147;We&#146;ve now got this
duty; we must comply. Get out there, find everything we do and pile it
there in front of
them.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000564"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> In a previous answer, the Minister made it
clear that the flood response organisations will be consulted on the
development of the flood risk strategy. Will there also be a duty to
consult after a flood emergency, so that lessons can be learned from
the experiences on the ground to improve the strategy if
necessary?</div><a name="10011494000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000565"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We do that already. The provision is not
within the Bill, but we are doing that in the Cumbria example at the
moment. We have significantly improved the systems over the years to
learn the lessons afterwards.</div>
<a name="10011494000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may seem
an attractive idea to insert the word &#147;must,&#148; but it
would in some ways constrain the willingness of relevant organisations
to work in partnership and provide information that might be considered
useful. The amendment would set in train work for a lot of people in
back offices, take up a lot of their time often unnecessarily and
produce a big burden for no great
result.</div><a name="10011494000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, clause 14 provides lead local flood authorities and the
Environment Agency with a power to request information from any person
and places a duty on that person to comply with the request. There are
therefore sufficient provisions in clauses 13 and 14 to ensure
appropriate information exchange without the amendment. On that basis,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000567"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am grateful for this opportunity to ask a
couple of questions. On the co-operation and arrangements, particularly
the democratic process under clause 13, the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Committee expressed concern that the draft Bill would establish
a rigid vertical structure, which clause 13 will go some way to
relaxing, that could preclude the pragmatic cross-boundary, area-based
approaches that accommodate local people&#146;s views and knowledge.
That Committee&#146;s view was that local people currently do not
have a seat at the table and that the Bill will dilute the ability of
an articulate community to influence decision
making.</div><a name="10011494000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>I am sure that they would wish to be included. At the moment, under this
part of the Bill, I do not see the potential for them to be included;
they are not recognised as one of the risk management authorities. How
exclusive is the provision, and what mechanism is there for such a
democratic consultation process to take
place?</div><a name="10011494000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause

so?</div><a name="10011494000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000568"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> This is a good opportunity to explain what
we are trying to do. I welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s recognition that,
through the clause, we are trying to put some flexibility into the
system. We have put an express duty to promote partnership arrangements
in the clause. That is particularly important, not least for water
companies, which are private companies that exercise public functions.
The duty to co-operate will mean that all relevant authorities know
that they have to engage in local flood risk
management.</div><a name="10011494000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the problem identified by Pitt was that many of the responsibilities
were so fragmented between several organisations&#151;not through the
fault of any individual organisation&#151;that it never got to the
point where the buck actually stopped. Co-operation will be the key to
the delivery of the Bill, and it is crucial to this clause. It will
also give communities the confidence that all authorities are working
together to identify the most effective solutions and minimise flood
risk. In 2007, there was a clear perception that authorities were not
joined up in their approach to flooding. It is important that
partnerships are underpinned by the new duty on all partners to
co-operate and share information.</div>
<a name="10011494000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">On local
influence, we want to make it clear that we still want local input. The
decisions will still ultimately be made by the local authority that
leads on the strategy. The simplicity of putting things at that level,
with the partnership feeding in, is
important.</div><a name="10011494000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
13(5) prevents the Environment Agency and the local flood authorities
from delegating the responsibility for creating the strategy. That is
important. We can delegate some functions and get partnership working
going, but the question to consider is where the buck stops in respect
of the strategy; it does not stop with those others who are asked for
their help in producing the strategy. The clause stops the relevant
authorities from passing on the responsibility and ensures that the
buck stops firmly with the Environment Agency or with the local flood
authority.</div><a name="10011494000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause has done a lot to get away from the rigidity that people were
worried about and to give flexibility while still retaining the
important bit, which says that the buck&#151;the
accountability&#151;stops in a certain place. We want to see the
authorities get on and work in proper collaboration with
others.</div><a name="10011494000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000571"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I shall talk first about amendments
121 and 100, which are in a similar vein, before moving on to amendment
122.</div><a name="10011494000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
parts of the Bill are criticised for being rather woolly, with
responsibilities not clearly defined and so on, but some of the powers
hidden in its depths are pretty draconian. We come across one such
power in clause 14, relating to the provision of information. That
sounds harmless, but it puts a possible obligation on
persons&#151;presumably it is generally envisaged that they will be
landowners, but they could well be ordinary householders who happen to
be riparian owners, or something like that&#151;to provide any
information in any form for any period specified by the flood risk
management authority. That power is without qualification, and if it is
not complied with in exactly the terms dictated by the flood risk
management authority, the poor householder could be landed with a
&#163;1,000
fine.</div><a name="10011494000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to rumour, some local government officials are at times inclined to
gold-plate things and have a slight tendency towards officiousness.
Obviously that never happens in Gloucestershire, and I have never come
across it myself, but it is not impossible to imagine that a local
official who was drawing up and responsible for issuing guidance on the
local flood risk management strategy might be tempted to go completely
over the top and demand information that would make his particular
flood risk management strategy that much better than everyone
else&#146;s. It could be quite a burdensome imposition on local
landowners or householders to have to provide detailed information. The
Bill seems to include no brakes on such requests for information. The
brake that we suggest in amendment 121&#151;and in amendment 100,
which is in a similar vein&#151;is pretty gentle, and I hope that the
Government are minded to accept
it.</div><a name="10011494000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
122 addresses the same issue in a slightly different way. It refers to
the process by which the information is supplied to the flood risk
management authority by an individual, adding a level of reasonableness
to the process. The clause says that information
requested</div><a name="10011494000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
be...in the form or manner specified in the
request&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
what matters is the information. The form in which it is provided does
not really matter. The clause is ridiculously
over-prescriptive.</div><a name="10011494000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment 122, we are seeking to say that what matters is the
information. If it can be provided in a different manner, but in a way
that is equally effective&#151;such as by e-mail, rather than on a
particular form provided by the flood risk management
authority&#151;that should be perfectly acceptable, and the law
should not make someone liable to a &#163;1,000 fine just for
providing the right information in the wrong way. That is reasonable,
and I commend the amendments to the
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div><a name="10011494000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000572"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I rise simply to support the amendments, which
we have signed up to in our own right. It is important to reflect a
level of proportionality, so we endorse the amendments and hope that
they will obtain support from the Committee and the
Minister.</div><a name="10011494000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000573"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I have a lot of sympathy for the points
that have been raised, but I hope that I can give some reassurance. We
do not intend the measures to be unduly burdensome, and do not intend
sanctions to be brought, especially against individuals, because of an
unduly onerous request for information. We agree that it is important
that authorities do not make requests that are unreasonable, either in
terms of what an authority requires, or in terms of the information
that a person is expected to
hold.</div><a name="10011494000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is important that authorities have sufficient powers to acquire
information from those who could be expected to have it so that they
can, in the light of what we are trying to do in the Bill, effectively
manage what are often complex and interrelated drainage problems. It is
important that, where possible, such information is collected in a
consistent way so that costs are managed centrally. The provision might
also encourage data providers to co-operate fully in cases where it is
known that they have data in a suitable format but are not inclined to
provide it in the most appropriate
manner.</div><a name="10011494000311"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000574"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; he is
being very generous with his time. I agree that such information should
be uniform&#151;perhaps a collective bargaining tool&#151;but it is
not right that disproportionate costs should be incurred by
smallholders and tenant farmers who do not have the resources to
compile the information being asked of them. Could he be more
prescriptive in his description of the kind of responsibility that such
people have? What sort of effort should they make? How much time and
what kind of resources are they expected to spend on the
task?</div><a name="10011494000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000575"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is a good point, and one which is in
sympathy with other points that have been made. I quite understand what
my hon. Friend
says.</div><a name="10011494000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to the issue of the individual who does not have an endless
computer system with all of the records in easily e-mailable format.
Such a person might have a map that could be of assistance in finding
out what the assets are on his or her property. There is no way on
earth that the EA or a lead local authority could request the same sort
of information from them that they might anticipate another public
authority holding. We must bear in mind that the authorities talk to
each other. Given that collaborative approach, they should have a
reasonable understanding, on a public authority level, of what each
other holds and what can reasonably be asked
for.</div><a name="10011494000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point about the individual is important. The authority would be acting
unreasonably if it required individuals to provide information at great
cost to themselves. The Bill does not provide for the recovery of
expenses. In general, the person from whom information is required
would be expected to bear reasonable costs. That does not mean that the
authority could say to a tenant farmer or individual landowner that it
expected them to log electronically all the assets on their farm or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>smallholding in exactly the same way that it expected public agencies to
log their assets. That would be completely unreasonable. I will show
why that would not
work.</div><a name="10011494000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to note that we anticipate there being discussion before
any enforcement notice is served. Those notices will not come out of
the blue, and I hope that the authorities will be clear about that.
Authorities will agree reasonable time periods in which any relevant
person should comply. A smallholder might say, &#147;I&#146;m not
interested in working with you. I will not even give you the
map.&#148; I would expect the authority to say, &#147;We understand
that there is difficulty in pulling this together. We&#146;ll work
with you and help you to compile the
information.&#148;</div><a name="10011494000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the person providing the information is unable to comply with the
request, they can make representations under clause 15(2)(c) in respect
of any enforcement notice. There is a right of appeal against any
penalties that are imposed. My hon. Friend the Member for Copeland is
right that the request needs to be reasonable. It needs to reflect who
is being worked with and what sort of information they can reasonably
be expected to
hold.</div><a name="10011494000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000576"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Does the Minister agree that the fundamental reason
we need the information requests to be accessible and possible to
comply with is that if they are not, we will be undermining the
co-operation that we
seek?</div><a name="10011494000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000577"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That is absolutely right. It is a matter
of getting the balance right. People see the Bill coming and soon,
hopefully, it will become an Act. The obligations are clear and the
idea different authorities collaborating, so that everyone knows what
is expected of them in risk management should over time reach the point
when we are synchronising some information. I suspect that
there has been acknowledgment already among many authorities that they
have information that can be synchronised. We do not want to generate
unnecessary costs so, over time, we should be trying to move to a
situation where information among public authorities is easily
accessible.</div><a name="10011494000445"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="10011494000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
importance of reasonableness is a fair point. It is implicit in all
legislation that public authorities should behave reasonably, so the
addition of such wording is unnecessary. In addition, there is
provision under clause 7(6) for the Environment Agency to
provide guidance to authorities on good practice for the exchange of
information. I expect the authorities to make clear the issue of
reasonableness and how the matter would affect different people and
organisations, from the tenant farmer to the major public authority.
What seems like a reasonable request is not necessary and, on that
basis, I ask the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for Brecon and
Radnorshire to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000578"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> In a sense, I am reassured by what the Minister
said. I accept that he wants the requests for information to be
reasonable and believes that they should not involve, for example,
forcing small tenant farmers to maintain asset registers in an
electronic format in the same way that a major risk management
authority might do, or impose undue costs and time penalties on farmers
who are running a small business and who really cannot afford such an
imposition.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="10011494000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman said that it is implicit in the law, in general, that
there is a right of appeal but, of course, that will not be of much
help to small farmers faced with impossible onerous requests for
information because they will not know that an appeal process is
implicit under the law. They will not want to go through even more time
and effort to deal with the right of appeal, which will be even more
onerous than the original request for information. So, in practical
terms, we need strong guidance in the
Bill.</div><a name="10011494000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000579"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I might be able to elaborate on matters
and give further assurance. First, the only information we are talking
about is that needed in connection with flood risk management
functions. Secondly, the Secretary of State will be issuing guidance on
using the power and may, as I said before, direct the Environment
Agency under section 19A of the Environment Act 1995.
Finally, all requesters, as defined, are public authorities and they
have legal duties to act reasonably in making such a request. In fact,
any unreasonable request can be judicially reviewed, so I am convinced
that the hon. Gentleman and others will be hotfooting it to the
Secretary of State&#146;s office to ask what the heck is going on if
unreasonable requests are being made. I must say that my faith in the
Environment Agency to carry out matters properly has increased as the
years have gone
by.</div><a name="10011494000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000580"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have had to take so much on faith during the
passage of the Bill that it is almost becoming a religious experience.
However, perhaps the Minister is an inspiring role model and we should
accept his word on this occasion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000581"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I beg to move amendment 14, in
clause 14, page 10, line 35, at

any reasonable confidentiality
restrictions.&#146;.</div><a name="10011494000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to explain why the amendment is necessary. I also want
to say a few words in the clause stand part debate, so I shall restrain
myself at this stage. While we are keen, for reasons that I have given
previously, to encourage the sharing of information on particular
matters, we are mindful of the fact that we must not breach
confidentiality. Water companies are worried that, while committed to
the multi-agency approach in addressing flooding issues and being
active participants in partnerships, the power in the Bill is
wide-ranging regarding the right, in particular, of local authorities
to demand information. It will be interesting to know what limits the
Minister intends to put on the request for information, and whether he
is minded to accept our amendment.</div>
<a name="10011494000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
transition period prior to the Bill coming forward, the authorities
will hold different standards, formats and purposes for information.
Their main concern is the sensitivity and security of some of the
information that they may be required to share. Obviously, the
Environment Agency is quite reluctant to share some of its information,
but there will be calls on some insurance companies and water
companies, which have done some of these modulations. The
Minister&#146;s regard for confidentiality may be implicit in the
clause but we would request that it be made
explicit.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="10011494000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000582"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I am glad to have the opportunity to flesh
out our thinking on this matter, although I am a little worried that I
may be a reincarnation of some sort of prophet of flood risk management
leading us to the promised land. The hon. Member for Vale of York has
tabled a good amendment that seeks to subject any information provided
under clause 14 to reasonable confidentiality restrictions, and I can
see the logic in what she proposes. The way in which this amendment is
drafted could be understood to put an obligation on the person who is
providing the information. That is unlikely to be appropriate if an
individual is providing the information, and unnecessary if the
intention is to limit what the authority does with the data, since that
will be governed by existing protection, including the Data Protection
Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. There does not seem
to be a strong case for treating flood risk management information any
differently from other information that the authorities hold in respect
of their duties on data protection and freedom of
information.</div>
<a name="10011494000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
rightly raises the issue of personal and commercial confidentiality. In
respect of information related to companies or to other businesses that
are not protected by the Data Protection Act, the intention is for the
Environment Agency, pursuant of clause 7(6), to provide guidance to
protect commercial confidentiality. That will ensure that lead local
authorities and the EA are able to obtain information that is needed
for effective flood management and to share that data while also giving
sufficient protection to commercially confidential
information.</div>
<a name="10011494000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
most authorities will already have policies in place to protect the
commercial or sensitive information that they hold. The Freedom of
Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 have
provisions to prevent authorities from being required to release
commercially sensitive information. Therefore, a raft of protections
are already in
place.</div><a name="10011494000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000583"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister might find that the Freedom of
Information Act protects such information when it is the
authority&#146;s own commercially sensitive information but not when
it is that of a third party. This is a small but significant amendment
because it should extend protection to commercially sensitive
information, which is not covered by the Data Protection Act, and I am
not sure whether the Minister has addressed
that.</div><a name="10011494000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000584"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I hate to contradict the hon. Gentleman,
but I have just described a raft of safeguards. One of the ones that I
covered was the Environment Agency&#146;s development, pursuant of
clause 7(6), to provide guidance that will include protecting
commercial confidentiality in carrying out its role as a flood risk
authority. So the issue is covered there if it is not covered in the
Freedom of Information Act and the Environmental Information
Regulations 2004.</div>
<a name="10011494000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much of the
information might relate to assets that would appear on the register
maintained by the local authority under clause 21, which also gives
both the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers the power to make
regulations about excluding data from the public register or the
record. There are tiers of existing legislation and regulations, plus
additional guidance from the EA, plus powers of Welsh Ministers and
Secretaries of State, if need be, to ensure further
regulations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="10011494000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I have great sympathy with the points being raised, because we need to
protect sensitive information, we also need to ensure that we have the
information that is relevant to carrying out the flood risk management
functions. On that basis, I invite the hon. Member for Vale of York to
consider asking leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000585"></a>Miss

that we do not have. Is he saying that he is minded to address this
issue and come back at a later stage? The Bill is currently defective
because it omits any reference to this matter in the terms that the
hon. Member for Cheltenham and I have set out. It is worthy of some
reference. I would be the first to admit that the amendment&#146;s
drafting is probably far from perfect, but it goes to the heart of
clause 14. Individuals, and certainly organisations&#151;particularly
where there is a commercial aspect to information&#151;will be
reluctant to provide it unless confidentiality is observed. Is the
Minister minded to come back with such an amendment

Irranca-Davies:</b> I would honestly love to say yes, but it
is not necessary to do so. A series of existing measures, and the
enhanced measures in the Bill, allow the complete protection, both of
commercial confidentiality and third party sensitive-nature
information, including, as I have already explained, not only the
existing aspects of the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of
Information Act and the Environmental Information Regulations, but the
current duties on public authorities. The Environment Agency is
bringing forward guidance on this matter that is specifically related
to the information that they would request on flood risk management and
on how to protect commercial and sensitive information in carrying out
that function. In addition to that, whoever is in this seat as a
Minister, or in the Welsh Assembly Government in the corresponding
position as a Minister, has the ability to introduce regulations under
the Bill excluding data from the public register or the
record.</div><a name="10011494000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are strong safeguards here, both in existing provisions and in the new
ones that we have introduced, so the amendment is not necessary. But I
can write to the hon. Lady clarifying all those things if it is
helpful.</div><a name="10011494000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000587"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I would like to take the Minister up on that
offer. We will not press the amendment further at this stage, but we
will keep an open mind and possibly revert. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011494000339"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000588"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> As I indicated, I should like to make some brief
comments and press the Minister on this matter. He knows that we are
fervently in favour of the sharing of data, especially maps, between
the relevant partners and interested parties. That is vital and goes to
the heart of flood risk management and it will also help to prevent
institutional chaos, as seen in the past, and ensure that there is a
more integrated and informed
strategy.</div><a name="10011494000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify that under clause 14 the role of the Secretary of
State is enhanced in terms of stepping in to restructure
responsibilities and give approval to the Environment Agency&#146;s
national strategy? The fear is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>that that could lead to local strategies again being interfered with by
the Secretary of State. For the record, we have stated that we would
like local strategies to be as autonomous as possible. We would regret
any move to see a weakening of the local strategies in that
regard.</div><a name="10011494000446"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10011494000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Select Committee expressed some concerns&#151;they relate more to a
later clause&#151;and it was not particularly strong in encouraging
the data sharing. The Select Committee went so far as to say that the
Department should offer guidance on effective data sharing as well as
safeguards possibly through secondary legislation. I would
like to put on the record that we would prefer that guidance to be
issued as soon as possible while the Bill is proceeding through its
parliamentary stages in this place and the other place. We would like
to think that we have some interesting things to say about the
guidance, so that would be
helpful.</div><a name="10011494000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the Environment Agency supports improved data sharing
and co-operation between all flood and coastal risk management
authorities. I hope the agency will be keen to share the content of
some of its information as well. We also want to stipulate as far as
possible that, within what the Minister has said, the work in liaising
with local authorities and undertaking the data sharing will have a
cost element to it. Has the Department costed it and if increased funds
are needed, will they be provided? Basically, what will the guidance
say on the accepted principles, standards and conditions that will
apply to the sharing of the information?</div>
<a name="10011494000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clause
14(1) the Bill states:</div>
<a name="10011494000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an authority
listed in subsection (2) may request a
person&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister comment on who that person might be? Is it someone from a
water company, a landowner or another
individual?</div><a name="10011494000347"></a>

Irranca-Davies:</b> I will try to respond to those points
promptly. I will return to the issue of a person as a legal entity
because a person in terms of legislation can be several people as well
as an individual. On whether the measure extends interference in the
local strategies&#151;the flexibility we were talking about in the
local strategies&#151;clause 14 does not affect that. We do not want
to see that happen. We expect local strategies to be made locally
without interference but, as we have said previously, that should be in
line with the national strategy setting the overall
parameters.</div><a name="10011494000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of guidance, I can confirm, as I mentioned, that the EA will
provide guidance and I share the hon. Lady&#146;s aspiration to see
that as soon as possible. I do not know the time scale on that off the
top of my head, but in my subsequent write around to Committee members,
I will try to highlight what we know about that. Finally, in terms of
the cost of data sharing, that will be part of the guidance that comes
forward, which makes it even more important to try to get that as soon
as
possible.</div><a name="10011494000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000590"></a>Miss

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000591"></a>The
Chairman:</b> When we reach the appropriate point in our

sure.</div><a name="10011494000021"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
15</h4><a name="10011494000011"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Civil

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000592"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I beg to move amendment 101, in
clause 15, page 11, line 23, leave
out &#145;the Minister,&#146;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0"><i class="I">To
limit important judicial powers of the executive and guarantee right of
appeal to an independent
body.</i></div><a name="10011494000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000593"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 15, in
clause 15, page 11, line 26, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(9A) Any
instrument (regulation or order) under this section may not be made
unless a draft has been laid before and approved by resolution of each
House of
Parliament.&#146;.</div><a name="10011494000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000594"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Having said that there were draconian measures
hidden in the depths of the Bill, this clause is more Orwellian, so it
is rather appropriate that the proposed amendment to it is numbered
101. The clause sets out that in the penalty procedure a Minister can
establish a procedure for a right of appeal, perhaps to an independent
court or tribunal, or to himself if he fancies it. That sounds almost
like the model promoted in the famous British comic, <i class="I">2000AD</i>, in
which Judge Dredd is law enforcer, judge, jury and, if necessary,
executioner. That is not the kind of holy role model for the Minister
that we were looking at earlier&#151;perhaps it is more appropriate
for the Whip.</div>
<a name="10011494000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
obviously walks on water, but how would a less popular Minister fare
if, say, he belonged to the same political party as the lead local
authority pursuing a particularly individual for a civil sanction, or
perhaps had a very close working relationship, as one would hope they
would have, with the Environment Agency, which is another possible
authority that might pursue someone for a civil sanction? How could an
appellant be expected to believe that a Minister was truly independent
in that situation? It is pretty unwise to put through Bills conferring
such quasi-judicial powers on Ministers&#151;it is neither desirable
for the Ministers, nor healthy for our democracy. The onus is on the
Minister to explain why an independent court or tribunal would ever be
insufficient or inappropriate for hearing such an
appeal.</div><a name="10011494000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000595"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> On amendment 101, we would like to see a
specific appeals procedure introduced, because some of the powers are
far-reaching and prescriptive, particularly in clause 15. We have some
sympathy with the amendment, but we believe that a better way forward
would be to introduce reference to an appeals procedure in the Bill. I
understand that there are appeals procedures as a matter of
course&#151;for example, regarding actions by the Environment
Agency&#151;so we simply want to give parties that might be caught
under the civil sanctions some reassurance that that will be open to
them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div><a name="10011494000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any instrument
drafted by the Minister should be scrutinised and reported to the
House, so in amendment 15 we are requesting that any instrument
referred to under clause 15 will not be made unless a draft has been
laid before Parliament, scrutinised, voted on and approved by
resolution of both Houses. I hope the Minister will look favourably on
the amendment. The clause will give the Minister substantial powers,
and we think it only in order that such secondary legislation should be
scrutinised in the normal way. I hope he will give us that
assurance.</div><a name="10011494000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000596"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Again, the hon. Members for Cheltenham and
for Vale of York have tabled two good amendments, but I hope that after
I explain the matters to which they refer they will be regarded as
probing amendments. Even though I feel aggrieved that they are trying
to remove any reference to me from the clause&#151;I do not feel
aggrieved at all, because I understand the sense in what they are
saying&#151;this is, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham said, a
quasi-judicial issue, as opposed to one whereby a Minister would
actually hear appeals in any normal course of action. An appeal would
be against a penalty notice issued by a lead local flood
authority&#151;perhaps the Environment Agency, or even Welsh
Ministers&#151;to a person who has failed to comply with the request
for information by that authority. That is what amendment 101 seeks to
do in clause 15.</div>
<a name="10011494000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
information request could be made under clause 14, and it would have to
be in connection with the authority&#146;s flood and coastal erosion
risk management functions. A penalty notice could be issued only on the
failure to comply with an enforcement notice in the event of an initial
failure to provide the information requested.</div>
<a name="10011494000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
it is important to ensure that a person is able to have the appeal
considered by an impartial and independent body, and I understand the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s reservations. In England, there is no reason
why Ministers, in a quasi-judicial role, as well as courts or
tribunals, should not be regarded as impartial and detached, as
penalties are not imposed by Ministers. They will be imposed by the
Environment Agency or local authorities, and not by the Government. It
may not be appropriate for Welsh Ministers to hear appeals if they have
imposed the penalty, and a decision would need to be made taking human
rights considerations into
account.</div><a name="10011494000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
any event, the inclusion of the Minister as a person who can be
entrusted with hearing appeals is a standard way of providing for
appeals. In practice, the Minister generally delegates those powers to
an independent person. That is the case, for example, in the Pollution
Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 in respect
of pollution, prevention and control permits. Such delegation also
happens under the Water Resources Act 1991 in respect of discharge
consents, the Water Resources (Abstraction and Impounding) Regulations
2006 in respect of abstraction licences, and the Environment Protection
Act 1990 in respect of waste management licences. Those are a few
examples; there are many more.</div>
<a name="10011494000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
standard way of doing things. In practice, in all those instances, the
Minister delegates the powers to an independent person, usually from
the Planning Inspectorate. I recommend that the reference to
ministerial power be retained, primarily so that the Government have
the standard flexibility to delegate it to another party, should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>it be required in specific circumstances&#151;for example, if the
expertise or experience of another party is better suited to hearing a
particular case or type of appeal. Clearly, we have no intention of a
Minister ever hearing an appeal, either here or in Wales, if there is a
conflict of interest. On that basis, I also urge against introducing an
inconsistency between this and other legislation and between similar
provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="10011494000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000597"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> Much as we have to be careful how Ministers&#146;
powers are used, may I urge a note of caution? All the people whom I
deal with say that it is not a question of the excessive use of power.
In this area, what is often remarkable is the failure&#151;I pinpoint
the Environment Agency&#151;to take sufficient action and to impose
fines. It should be made clear that the behaviour of some riparian
owners is completely unacceptable. Everyone else loses out, so I would
not want to dilute those powers in any way, even if the reference to
Ministers is a fall-back
position.</div>
<a name="10011494000447"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="10011494000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000598"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We are arguing to retain what has been
described as a quasi-judicial role in order to make an effective appeal
to the right person if any sanction has been put. However, my hon.
Friend makes a good point. When necessary, the sanctions will need to
be used. That is why they are there.</div>
<a name="10011494000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 15
would require the affirmative resolution procedure for any regulations
made under clause 15. The Minister must by regulations provide a right
of appeal against penalties in respect of a failure to provide
information to an authority. The regulations will be important in so
far as they will confer jurisdiction and make provision about the
procedures. However, the details of the regulations are less important
here because we are focused on the fundamental right of people to
pursue an appeal. The regulation-making power makes it clear that a
right of appeal must be available at all times. Changes to the value of
the penalty may be needed from time to time to reflect inflation, if
nothing else, and it would be an inefficient use of parliamentary time
to require a debate every time that
happened.</div><a name="10011494000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there are concerns, either House of Parliament can call a debate and
vote to annul the secondary legislation, as they can on other matters.
Again, this is not unusual. In the unlikely event that proposed changes
to procedural details cause concern, the Merits of Statutory
Instruments Committee can draw the legislation to the attention of
Parliament to assess whether a debate is needed. The National Assembly
for Wales will have the same rights in
Wales.</div><a name="10011494000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of that answer, I urge the hon. Member for Cheltenham to
withdraw his amendment. I want to consign amendment 101 to room 101,
because removing the reference to the Minister would go against a clear
precedent in environmental legislation and, potentially, make it harder
to ensure that a person can get an appropriate hearing. I urge him not
to move amendment 15, on the assurance that Parliament can none the
less intervene if any concern were to
arise.</div>
<a name="10011494000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000599"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am not sure that the fact that &#147;the
Minister&#148; is in lots of other legislation is a strong argument
for having it in the Bill. If it was wrong in all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>the other legislation, it would be wrong here as well. I
worry about phrases about judicial functions being attached to
Ministers, but, as with the other amendments today, I am realistic
about the prospect of this one getting through the Committee. I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000603"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I want to take the opportunity to question the
Minister on the discretion written into the clause. The Minister spoke
about some of the money not being raised by the Environment Agency or
some not being raised by the local authorities. Subsection (1)
says:</div><a name="10011494000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Environment Agency may make grants in respect of
expenditure&#148;.</div><a name="10011494000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
whom would the grants be extended and from what budget? Is that part of
the funding to which he referred in response to an earlier amendment?
Is the money going to come from that allocated to the Environment
Agency? A little more background information would be helpful.
Subsection (3)
says:</div><a name="10011494000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
grant may be subject to conditions&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011494000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">What type of conditions
does he imagine would be
attached?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div><a name="10011494000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000604"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am also interested in the context in which the
clause will operate and the context of the budget. I anticipate
something of what the Minister will say&#151;that the grants should
come from the main Environment Agency flood risk management budget,
which we have debated in Parliament on a number of occasions, for
example.</div>
<a name="10011494000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many
years, the Liberal Democrats have called for the funding of that budget
to be increased faster&#151;and by hundreds of millions of pounds
more, over a period of years, than the Government were prepared to put
in. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The Government have indeed
increased the budget, but we were asking for it to be increased faster.
We had a great deal of support, not least from the insurance industry,
in trying to push that forward.</div>
<a name="10011494000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now that the
money has gone, in a sense, and we do not have the flexibility to
increase funding in such a way, can the Minister say whether there is a
backlog of projects that have been approved by the Environment Agency
but that are waiting to be implemented? The rumour is that the backlog
is considerable. I would be interested to know whether that is the case
and, if so, how long the backlog is. At the current rate of work, how
many years will it take to clear that
backlog?</div><a name="10011494000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be nice if we could look forward, perhaps even beyond the next
Parliament or so when public finances will be extremely constrained,
towards the more long-term future to which the Association of British
Insurers and others have asked us to look. Flood risk management
spending is going to be substantially increased, not least as an
adaptation to the threat of climate change, which will increase the
risk of flooding considerably. Climate change will probably increase
storm surges in the North sea and the risk of coastal erosion. On
current trends, it will certainly increase the level of precipitation,
paradoxically&#151;not only snow, but heavy rainfall leading directly
to
flooding.</div><a name="10011494000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
only hope that we do not have an example of flooding later on tonight
or over the next day or so, with large amounts of snow melt descending
into towns such as Cheltenham, Tewkesbury and elsewhere, providing us
with an immediate example of exactly how well our flood risk management
is working at the moment. That, however, seems something of a
possibility.</div><a name="10011494000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
context of the budget and the funding available for flood risk
management at the national level is critical to our constituents. Flood
defences are expensive operations. The flood defences in Cheltenham
cost something like &#163;23 million and were in place just in time
to prevent flooding in 2007 being even worse&#151;although they have
also needed work since, which has been a further expense. The context
is very important, so I shall be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
words on the
subject.</div><a name="10011494000390"></a>

Irranca-Davies:</b> Let me first respond to the hon. Member
for Vale of York and clarify that the funding we are talking about will
generally, as now, come from grand in aid, which is provided by DEFRA.
One of the good, beneficial aspects of the clause is the increase in
the flexibility about where that grant can go&#151;the idea of local
flexibility. IDBs or other partners on the ground could be involved in
making good use of that funding. The Secretary of State and I have been
trying to develop that theme, to allow such use to happen more
often.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div><a name="10011494000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The agency can
make grants, subject to conditions. In response to the hon. Lady, I
should say that those conditions could, for example, include conditions
for repayment or interest. There could be others. The grants may go to
any third party in connection with spending on flood or coastal erosion
risk management. In Wales, the policy is that the powers under the
clause will be vested in Welsh
Ministers.</div><a name="10011494000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can actually give some assurance about funding in the long term. I hear
what the hon. Member for Cheltenham is saying, but I shall repeat until
I am blue in the face that the measure of our having an agreement with
the ABI and its members is because of their recognition that the
Government have made an unprecedented investment. It is never going to
be enough, but the Government have made an unprecedented investment in
both flood and coastal erosion risk management: more than &#163;2.15
billion over three years, which, if we track back only a few years,
dwarfs what was being spent
before.</div><a name="10011494000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are currently spending &#163;780 million in the 2010-11 financial
year, with &#163;20 million of the original &#163;800 million
brought forward into the 2009-10 budgets, to provide early protection
for 27,000 homes. The Environment Agency&#146;s funding for flood and
coastal erosion risk management in 2010-11 will reach almost
&#163;660 million and the ABI is aware of that. I could go on, but
let me talk a little about the long term. I will not exhaust your
patience, Mr. Martlew, late in the sitting as we
are.</div><a name="10011494000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
funding that we have announced for 2010-11 is consistent with the
recommendations of the Foresight Future Flooding report. Of course,
flood risk management is not short-term, as we have acknowledged; it is
a long-term business. So we have asked the Environment Agency to
develop the long-term investment strategy, looking at flood and coastal
erosion risk management over the next 25 years. That should provide
some more certainty and clarity about what improvements are required
and when they will be made. So our commitment is absolutely
clear.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000606"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Would the Minister like to share with us the
numbers for 2010-11 and 2011-12 as envisaged by his friend, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer?</div>
<a name="10011494000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000607"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> As I just said, the amount to be spent in
2010-11 will be almost &#163;660 million. I cannot talk about the
following year at this moment, because I do not have the figure for
that year available to me and I suspect that we might have to wait and
anticipate what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor might say about
future spending.</div>
<a name="10011494000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, our
commitment has been made clear in an upward trajectory of spending on
flood defence. Our position as a Department is that we need to ensure
that that spending is maintained. However, we have made it quite clear
that we also need to ensure that contributions from other sources,
whether private sources or local contributions, maximise the added
value that we can obtain from flood defence and from flood risk
management generally.</div>
<a name="10011494000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000608"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am puzzled. The Minister said that the spending
trajectory is quite clear, but it seems to have gone from more than
&#163;800 million in 2008-09 to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>&#163;780 million in 2009-10, then to &#163;660 million for 
2010-11&#151;the coming year. He is not even sure about the year
after that. That trajectory seems to be downwards. Surely he wants to
see that reversed.</div>
<a name="10011494000399"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000609"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I explained to the hon. Gentleman that
what we have done is to bring forward some spending from future years,
first, to keep people in jobs at this moment and secondly, to bring
forward flood defence measures for people to protect them in their
homes. I think that that is a very good thing. However, we cannot spend
the money twice. On that basis, I have no hesitation in saying, yes, we
have actually brought forward spending to protect more homes now. That
is a good thing, but unfortunately I cannot magic money out of the air
twice.</div>
<a name="10011494000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
amounts&#151;even the lowest amount&#151;are significantly higher
than where we were not only a decade ago, but five years ago. We have
made clear the commitments that we have made and that we must maintain.
We have also made it clear that there needs to be more investment. I
look forward to when the hon. Gentleman puts an exact figure on what he
will commit any future Liberal Democrat Government to spend on flood
defences, because that would indeed be very
helpful.</div><a name="10011494000401"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="10011494000404"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011494000610"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> We had a little discussion earlier about the
purpose of levies in our consideration of one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>of the earlier clauses. The Minister said that the regulations may vary.
In 2004-05, the rules about how the money could be spent were changed.
Instead of the local regional Environment Agency being able, if you
like, to hand out the grants or carve up the funds, from 2004-05
onwards the national Environment Agency took such decisions. In clause
17, we now have the opportunity for a local levy to be
raised.</div>
<a name="10011494000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="10011494000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem that I have is that it is the same people&#151;technically,
the landowners&#151;who will be asked to pay towards the local levy
who are already paying their contribution towards the internal drainage
boards. Perhaps another way would be through council tax payers;
essentially, the same people would be asked to take this on.
Furthermore, concern has been expressed that, to maintain the maximum
flexibility in public accountability, the levy should be made available
to fund all sources of local flood risk. It is really a case of whether
that should encompass all sources of local flood risk in the
area.</div><a name="10011494000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main concern in asking the Minister to clarify clause 17 is about the
local levy. Would the local levy fund against a localised flooding risk
or the areas that we have just had an exchange about, in respect of a
downward trend in the funding? Are we being asked for local levies to
be raised so that they can plug the gap if no funding is immediately to
hand through the normal sources of funding? I am raising our concerns
about how the levy will be raised, from whom it will be raised, and
what type of risks the funding will be used
for.</div><a name="10011494000407"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,</i>
That further consideration be now adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">(David
