                  </strong> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements. Given the sunny, warm weather Members may remove their
jackets during the meeting if they wish. I remind all Members to ensure
that mobile phones, pagers and suchlike are turned off or switched to
silent mode during Committee sittings. Also, as a general rule, I and
my fellow Chair do not intend to call starred amendments—those
which have not been tabled with adequate notice. The required notice
period in Public Bill Committees is three working days. Therefore
amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on Monday for
consideration on Thursday and by the rise of the House on Thursday for
consideration on Tuesday. There is a money resolution in connection
with the Bill and copies are available in the room.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000008">&#160;</a>

is familiar with the procedure in Public Bill Committees so I will
briefly explain how we will proceed. The Committee will first be asked
to consider the programme motion, for which debate is limited to half
an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence.
Then we will begin line-by-line consideration of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000009">&#160;</a>

am sure that we will all enjoy serving under your chairmanship over the
coming days and weeks, Mr Brady. There are two main strands
to the Bill—a change to the state pension age designed to take
account of the changes in longevity, and refinement to the process of
auto-enrolment into workplace pensions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000011">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The topic of
state pension age has attracted most attention and is clause 1 of the
Bill, so it is inevitably our focus this morning. However, we hope that
proper

			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                  </div>attention will also be given to issues of auto-enrolment, which were
thoroughly and helpfully debated in another place. The Committee will
be aware that we will require new things of judges; that was less
contentious at this end of the corridor than the other end of the
corridor. I am sure Mr Brady would prefer us to spend most of the time
today talking about the Bill and its measures rather than the programme
motion, so I commend the motion to the

               <p class="tabbed">While I welcome
some aspects of the Bill, the purpose of this group of amendments
should be clear. Collectively, they seek to amend the Bill’s
acceleration of the equalisation of the state pension age for men and
women and ensure that there is no rise to age 66 before 2016 for men
and 2020 for women, as in the coalition agreement, but allow for a
faster increase to 66 between 2020 and 2022. Clause 1 preserves the
existing timetable set out in the Pensions Act 1995, which means that
women will reach pensionable age at 65 if born after 5 April 1955. For
women born between 6 April 1950 and 5 April 1955, state pension age
will gradually increase over a decade—and indeed, has started to
do so—rising one year in every two. Our amendment brings forward
the increase for men and women to 66, accelerating that by four years
to between 2020 and 2022 rather than between 2024 and 2026. That will
ensure that a decent notice period is given, that men and women are
affected equally, and that no single person has their state pension
delayed by more than a year. This amendment brings to the table changes
for which so many people have campaigned tirelessly over the last few
months. I would like to express my gratitude to Age UK, which organised
a mass lobby of Parliament for those women affected, and to Saga, which
organised an online petition and has done so much lobbying. Age UK has
also published an excellent yearbook that puts names and faces to the
statistics and numbers that we shall be debating today.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendments
make no specific proposals to change the current timetable for
increasing the state pension age to 67, and then to 68, as legislated
for in the Pensions Act 2007, although we accept—as do the
Government, I believe—that increasing longevity will eventually
cause those to be revisited. I welcome the Green Paper and the outcome
of the consultation of a more systematic mechanism for uprating the
state pension age in the future. As I am sure the Minister will agree,
the state pension age needs to rise in order to pay for a more generous
basic state pension, linked to earnings. That principle was established
by the Labour Government in 2007, as part of the implementation of the
Turner review, and is one that we continue to support.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We do not
challenge the life expectancy projections that the Government have used
to underpin their policy changes, and we understand that life
expectancy has increased, even since the Turner report. Average life
expectancy for those who reach 65 in 2026 has increased by 1.5 years
for men and 1.6 years for women. It is therefore reasonable that the
Government took the state pension age to review when assuming office
over a year ago. However, in the coalition agreement the Government
were clear that they would review the state pension age, but that it
would not start to rise to 66 before 2020 for women and 2018 for men.
Yet the timetable set out in the Bill, as hon. Members know, sees
women’s state pension age start to rise to 66 in 2018. What new
evidence has the Minister seen since the coalition agreement was
signed, that has caused this
U-turn?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
know that the timetable proposed in the Bill will affect some 4.9
million people: 2.6 million of them are women, 2.3 million are men. But
most worryingly—this is the cause that so many people have taken
up—500,000 women will have to wait more than a year to receive
their state pension, and of those, 300,000 women will have to wait 18
months or more. Thirty-three thousand 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                  </div>women unlucky enough to have been born between 6 March 1954
and 5 April 1954 will have to wait exactly two years longer before they
receive their state pension. A delay of two years translates to a loss
of income of over £10,000 for all recipients of the basic state
pension. For those in receipt of pension credit, that figure is nearer
to £15,000.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000027">&#160;</a>

tell me whether she has also included, in the figures on the loss of

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Of
course, it is not only women who will lose out because of the increase
in the state pension age. At the moment, passported benefits track the
women’s state pension age, so the free bus pass is available to
men and women in accordance with the women’s state pension age.
Both men and women will lose out on some of the passported benefits
that my hon. Friend mentioned because of these changes. My hon. Friend
mentioned bus passes, but there are a whole range of benefits,
including help with council tax, housing benefit and the winter fuel
allowance. An answer to a parliamentary question shows that as a result
of these plans, for
example—<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000029">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am unsure whether the hon. Gentleman was there
for the entire debate, or has read <em>Hansard</em>, because I set out
Labour’s alternatives very clearly, as did the shadow Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions. They are backed by Age UK and Saga. The
Opposition propose that we stick with the current equalisation
timetable—equalise men and women’s state pension age to
65 in 2020—but then increase the state pension age for men and
women to 66 between 2020 and 2022, bringing that forward by four years.
The Government’s proposals save £30 billion; our
proposals save £20 billion. As hon. Members from all parts of
the House have said, however, there is also the possibility of bringing
forward the increase to 67 and 68, which we asked the Government to
look at. Answers to parliamentary questions show that that would save
significantly more than the Government’s
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000031">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Let me just finish my point. The Government have
set out to eliminate the Budget deficit within this Parliament; the
Opposition have set out to halve it. Neither proposal has any impact on
eliminating the Budget deficit, because none of these savings kicks in
until 2016 at the earliest, and they cover a 10-year 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                  </div>period between 2016 and 2026. We must ensure that state pensions are
sustainable, but the changes that we have proposed will make savings
over time, and they start to kick in just two years later. Critically,
our changes mean that nobody has to wait for more than a year longer
before they receive their state pension; they affect an equal number of
men and women; and they mean that people get at least nine
years’ notice of any changes to their state pension
age.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The proposed
changes in the Bill will kick in in 2016 when the state pension age
changes. For that reason it is right to look specifically at the
500,000 women who will have to wait for more than a year longer before
they receive their state pension, as Members from all sides of the
House said on Second Reading. Yes, we need to make savings, but I would
like to see that done in a fairer way that impacts men and women
equally, gives people fair notice and does not require anyone to wait
for more than a year longer before they get their state
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000034">&#160;</a>

Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and the

at. We would like to see those arrangements, but the Government have
not tabled any amendments for us to consider in Committee. I do not
think that that was the expectation of many Members, from all parties,
when we discussed this on Second

                  </strong> We will hear from the Minister on the points that
the hon. Lady raised in due course. I would like to make two points.
First, with regard to halving the deficit, I am delighted that she has
at least started to talk about that, or reducing part of it. It would
be very interesting to hear in another debate, perhaps from the shadow
Chancellor, exactly which areas the Opposition are talking about
cutting. We have not had that spelt out, so it will be interesting to
hear.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
returning to the cost of her proposals, the hon. Lady made it
absolutely clear that on Second Reading we talked about the
Government’s proposal to save £30 billion and the
Opposition’s proposal to save £20 billion. There is a
£10 billion hole, and in all that she has said I do not think
that the hon. Lady has explained how that shortfall will be made
up.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000037">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The £20 billion is a saving compared to the
current Budget, as is £30 billion, but neither meets the target
of eliminating the Budget deficit in this Parliament. We are willing to
look at proposals that cost less money. My hon. Friend the Member for
Erith and Thamesmead has proposed amendments that cost less than the
amendment that we are currently debating. We have not, however, had any
proposals from the Government about how they can support these 500,000
women. <em>[</em>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Life
expectancy has increased, but as I said earlier, it has increased by
1.5 years for men and 1.6 years for women since the state pension age
was last examined. Thirty-three thousand women are being asked to work
for two years longer and 300,000 women are being asked to work for 18
months longer. Why are 500,000 women being asked to bear so much of the
burden for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                  </div>this policy, and why are they being asked to work for longer than the
increase in their life expectancy? I am not saying that change is not
needed; I recognise, as the Turner report set out, that the state
pension age must increase as people are living longer. I want to work
with the Government on fairer proposals, but we have not seen the
transitional arrangements. We are proposing an amendment that is
fairer, makes £20 billion of savings, and affects an equal
number of men and women. It also gives people that nine-year notice
period. In the absence of the extremely disappointing absence of any
firm proposals from the Government, this proposal is a way of saving
money, but also treats people fairly.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000039">&#160;</a>

Bill, but this is outside the period of the comprehensive spending
review and the budget deficit reduction plan. As I have said, we are
willing to look at other proposals, but the Government have not tabled
any. We are also willing to look at increasing the state pension age to
67 and 68, which if brought forward by one year—I will come on
to some of these numbers later today—will save £7
billion, and if by two years, around £13 billion. So there are
other ways of addressing increasing longevity that I believe are
fairer, but will also save money.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000043">&#160;</a>

million people are affected by the Bill—2.6 million women and
2.3 million men. Of that 4.9 million affected, 500,000 people are
having to wait more than a year longer, 300,000 for more than 18 months
and 33,000 for exactly two years longer. Everybody believes that people
need to work longer to have an affordable state pension. That was set
out by the Turner report and I continue to support that, as do all

women and I am curious to understand. The Bill is in effect about

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am sorry; I understand the point now. The
proposals that we have put forward are: no further change until 2020 to
keep with the current equalisation timetable, then between 2020 and
2022 increase the state pension age between 65 and 66 for both men and
women. I have the impact assessment here and I can check the exact
numbers, but I think 1.3 million fewer people are affected
by that timetable. Crucially, an equal number of men and women are
affected. Nobody has to wait more than a year longer before they get
their state pension, so obviously no one has to wait two years longer.
Those changes also give people nine years’ notice, so they
affect fewer people. Nobody has to wait for more than a year and it
gives people a notice period which enables them to adjust their
financial and working plans to adapt to the changes. Did the hon. Lady
want to come in
again?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000050">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> No. The hon. Lady is not correct on that. In the
impact assessment, the Government set out two different ways in which
they could increase the state pension age. The first is the way that
the Government are pursuing, which, as I say, impacts 4.9 million
people, 500,000 for more than a year. The second proposal that the
Government put forward in their earlier consultation would mean, as I
am proposing, that there are no changes before 2020 and we stick with
the current equalisation period. The reason that women are having to
wait for more than two years longer is that two things are happening at
the same time: bringing forward equalisation and increasing the state
pension age all within the same period of time. That is why people will
have to wait up to two years longer and more than a year
longer.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000052">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">If you kept
with the current equalisation timetable then increased the state
pension age from 65 to 66 between 2020 and 2022, 3.6 million
people would be impacted by that change—1.3 million fewer than
under these proposals—and nobody would have to wait for more
than a year longer before they got their state pension. An equal number
of women and men are affected.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
crucial points is that that would give people an adequate notice
period. Lord Turner, in his report, recommended a 15-year notice
period. The Pensions Policy Institute recommended a 10-year notice
period. These changes kick in in five years, and the women most
impacted—those who have to wait for two years longer—have
seven years’ notice. Most experts believe that that is not
sufficient time. We can come on to some of the details about the
working patterns of women in their late 50s and early 60s, but many of
these women have already taken on caring responsibilities, either for
elderly parents or young grandchildren. Some of these women, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg) and the hon.
Member for Chippenham (Duncan Hames) said on Second Reading, have taken
redundancy pay, particularly perhaps from local government, in
anticipation of their state pension kicking in at 63 or 64. They have
done all the financial planning around that and then they have seen the
goalposts moved again.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Critically,
under the proposals that I am putting forward, nobody has to wait for
more than a year longer before they receive their state pension,
although of course people would still be affected by these changes, as
they were by the changes that the Labour Government legislated for and
the previous Conservative Government legislated for in 1995. They are
the right things to do. As longevity increases it is right that people
work longer and wait longer before they get their pension. As a result
they get a more generous pension, certainly under the Turner
recommendations, than they would have done previously. However there is
a specific issue about those 500,000 women and asking people to wait
for more than a year longer with such short
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000055">&#160;</a>

will give way. The earnings link was to be restored in 2012. So there
was automatic enrolment, the earnings link, and the state pension age
was to be increased to 66 between 2024 and 2026; then to 67
between 2034 and 2036 and to 68 between 2044 and 2046. They were the
three components of the Turner report that the Labour Government
implemented. It did not happen within our time in office but was
legislated for and was to happen before the increases in the state
pension age and at the same time that automated enrolment was
introduced. It is right that people wait longer for their pension,
particularly if that pays for a better pension when they get
there.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000059">&#160;</a>

£15,000 difference is the difference between the triple lock and
keeping with the old inflation index. It is not a difference between
what would have happened under a Labour Government and what is
happening under the coalition agreement. It is the difference between
inflation uprating—which was in no party’s
manifesto—and the triple lock. I do not accept the point that
pensioners are £15,000 better off under this Government. They
are better off with the triple lock than with the old inflation
linking, but continuing with the inflation linking was not in
anyone’s manifesto
commitment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also say to the hon. Gentleman that it is not really much consolation
to the 500,000 women who will be without their state pension for a
year, and particularly not much consolation to the 33,000 women who
will be without their state pension at either the earnings-uprated or
inflation-uprated level. The poorest women, on full pension credit,
will miss out on £15,000 if they lose their state pension for
two years, and that is before the passported benefits that my hon.
Friend the Member for Nottingham South mentioned earlier are taken into
account. For those two years, many of these women have very few savings
to draw on. The average woman aged 57 has £9,100 pension savings
and 40% of these women have no private pension savings, so they are
very reliant on the basic state pension and in many cases, the pension
credit as well.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is very
difficult to know how those women will get by for those two years. Many
will continue to work but some are not in a position to do so. Many
have already made decisions about their working hours, cutting them
back to care for elderly parents or young grandchildren. Many have
taken redundancy payments based on financial calculations. What I
particularly object to in the Bill is the fact that people have had so
little notice. With all the will in the world, there is no way that
those women can make up what they will lose within that six or
seven-year period. They might get a better pension in the long run,
compared with the inflation link rather than compared with the previous
Labour Government, but that is not a huge consolation for women during
that period of
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000062">&#160;</a>

benefit from the restoration of the earnings link? Why are we asking

everybody? To pay for a better state

                  <em>]</em> It was a
point made on Second Reading and it is about putting faces to some of
these statistics. We know that these women are in a number of different
situations. Many women have written to us about caring for elderly
parents, supporting their sons and daughters going back to work while
taking on child care responsibilities for them. Other women have
written to us saying that they took redundancy payments from work. I
have received letters like that, and clearly those two Members who
spoke Second Reading had as well. Those women have done their financial
calculations based on when their state pension would kick in, and when
their occupational pension—if they were lucky enough to have
one—would kick in.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The central
point is about the time we are giving people to prepare for these
changes. If people are given 10 years’ notice, they can adapt
their plans. They can build up savings, adjust their hours at work or
adjust their caring responsibilities. But to make these changes that
kick in in 2016 with just five years’ notice—seven
years’ notice to the people most impacted by these
changes—is unfair. The hon. Gentleman, and Members from both
sides of the House have received the yearbook, “Class of
53/54” from Age UK, which sets out six or seven accounts of
individuals affected. Everyone has their own story to tell; I could
give some stories from constituents of mine, as I am sure all hon.
Members can. The point is that with just five or seven years’
notice to plan, it is very difficult for that group of women to adjust
their plans, whatever those plans, set in motion, were. If people are
given more notice, it is more likely that they can adjust those plans,
and that is why Turner recommended 15 years’ notice, as the hon.
Gentleman knows.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000069">&#160;</a>

again, but not with sufficient time to enable them to adjust their
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000074">&#160;</a>

that we are living longer, and changes are being made to the pensions
system that were made under her Government, and will be made under this
Government. I would like to take her back to what was said to the TUC
in September 2004 by the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,
the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan
Johnson). He categorically said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000075">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brevIndent">“This
Government will not raise the state pension

               <p>Yet,
in 2005, Labour’s own pensions commission said that the age
should go up, and in the Pensions Act 2007, as she said herself, Labour
legislated to increase it for men and women. Does she think that it was
unfair that Labour changed the goalposts at that
time?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000076">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not have the benefit of seeing the
information that the hon. Gentleman has seen, but I think there is a
consensus across the House that the state pension age needs to increase
as people live longer. I want to build consensus, as Labour did in the
Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008, because that is the right way to approach
pensions policy. We can all look for division, which is what the hon.
Gentleman is doing, but I want to build consensus. Labour, in 2007 and
2008, built a cross-party consensus to implement the Turner review, and
as a result we had changes that made the system fairer and more
sustainable, and will bring more people into pensions savings through
automatic enrolment. I would like this Government to approach pensions
reform in the same manner, because if we do that we can build a fairer
policy, and a sustainable system. But consensus is, and was, hard won.
There were negotiations to be had with business about automatic
enrolment, and with the trade unions about the state pension age.
Labour took on those arguments, and built a consensus across the trade
unions, who recognised the need to increase the state pension age, and
with the business community, who by and large supported automatic
enrolment. I believe that the Government are beginning to unravel that
hard won consensus. They are doing so by trying to bring forward
changes at a rate that does not allow people to prepare, and
particularly penalises a group of women who I think we all believe will
be unfairly
impacted.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000077">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> First, I do not believe that the article is
correct in the assertion that these women are impacted by the same
amount of time as other people. As we all know—though I am
unsure if the journalist recognises it—those 500,000 women have
to wait for more than a year longer, which nobody else will have to do.
That is a key point that the journalist perhaps failed to take on
board. I will expand my answer, and if the hon. Lady still has
questions then she can come back.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We know that
many of these women have already shifted their hours to part-time work.
That was in the impact assessment. Many of these women are already
working part time, and have made that decision based on assumptions
about when their state pension, or any occupational pension, would kick
in. They have done the financial planning, and the letters that we
received back up the evidence that we saw in the impact assessment. As
Age UK says, women start working part time, in anticipation of
retirement, much earlier than men. This is because, as the hon. Member
for Arfon mentioned, it is predominantly this group of women that takes
on caring responsibilities. I am sure that we all have examples from
our own families of women in their late 50s or early 60s acting as
carers for their parents or grandchildren. I do not accept, therefore,
the idea that these women can just carry on working. They are
continuing to work, not just in paid roles but looking after families
as they age, as the Dilnot report recognised on Monday. These women are
working, and probably working harder than many of us, but not always in
paid
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000081">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The point here is the gender effect. I am
subject to the whims of the electorate of Arfon and might lose my job
in a few years’ time, although I hope not. A large number of
women, however, have long-term caring responsibilities and do not have
the ability to change their responsibilities in that way. For example,
of the estimated 662,000 carers who combine part-time work with caring,
89% are female. There is a gender effect; that is the point that I wish
to make and that I am sure the hon. Lady will make very ably as

longevity has policy implications—we do not deny that and we did
not deny that in Government—but the timing and proportionality

disproportionate impact on these 500,000 women—the point that I
and other Opposition Members have been making. Yet this morning,
Government Members have not so far recognised the disproportionate
impact on this group of women or any understanding about how difficult
it will be for this group of women to adjust to those
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000085">&#160;</a>

years’ notice of changes to the state pension age and that

to absorb what the hon. Lady has, but also an additional year or more
with just five to seven years’ notice of that change. I did not

the proposals the hon. Lady is making are going to cost
£10 billion. Is £10 billion, through the

fully admit that I am a newcomer to this subject, but that is one
reason why I seek some simple facts. She is making an alternative
proposal that she admits herself has a price tag of £10 billion,
so it is incumbent on her and her hon. Friends to provide the evidence
that the number of people who genuinely need that help is sufficiently
large to justify her proposal and its massive cost.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
refers to the numbers in all our constituencies. My constituency is not
a particularly rich constituency. It is not in west Oxfordshire or
Surrey, but Lincolnshire, and I have to tell her that of the 1,300
women who she says will be affected by this proposal—and I have
no doubt that she is right on that number—fewer than 30 have
actually written to me. I am sure those 30 are just the tip
of an iceberg, and that many have not written to their MP because they
have not thought of it, or they do not think it will make any
difference. Nevertheless, is that iceberg the full 1,300, or are some
of those 1,300 perhaps in full-time work and therefore the prospect of
extending their working lives—though not great, not
welcome—is not impossible to imagine? Maybe some of them are
married to people who are in full-time work and who have other pension
arrangements, so the right thing to look at is their entire family
pension arrangements not their individual pension
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000097">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
On pages 64 to 65 of the equality impact assessment that the Government
published in November 2010 in relation to these proposals, it sets out
labour market activity as a percentage of the population. Then it sets
out the reasons for inactivity. I will take the hon. Gentleman through
this information, which I am sure he has read. Of the population aged
from 55 to 59, 71.3% of people are employed, compared with 78.4% of
people aged from 50 to 54. Of the people aged 55 to 59, 3.8% are
unemployed and 24.9% inactive. So 24.9% of people in their late 50s are
inactive. If you look at that across men and women, 18.1% of men aged
55 to 59 are inactive, while 31.5% of women aged 55 to 59 are inactive.
The employed includes part-time and full-time workers because the
impact assessment does not break down what proportion of these women
work full-time and what proportion, of the 66.1% in work, work
full-time or part-time.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As for the
reasons for inactivity: to recap, 24.9% of people aged 55 to 59 are
inactive; 18.1% are men and 31.5% women. Of those who are inactive in
their late 50s if you look at the population as a whole, 47.9% are
sick, injured or disabled; 18.1% are inactive because they are looking
after family and home; 20% are retired and do not want to work.
However, if you focus separately on men and women you see very
different statistics.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Among men aged
55 to 59, 55.8% of those who are inactive are sick, injured or
disabled; 7% look after home or family and 22.8% are retired and do not
want to work; whereas among women in the same age range, of those 31.5%
who are inactive, 43.5% are sick, injured 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 18<a class="bkMark" name="Column18">&#160;</a>
                  </div>or disabled; 24.2% look after family and home; and 18.5% are retired and
do not want to work. So 24% of those look after family and home,
compared with 7% for men of the same age. We see big gaps. I
agree that this is not all the information; it would be good to see
more when making important decisions like this. However, we see from
these limited statistics that there is a difference, as the hon.
Gentleman mentioned earlier, between men and women in terms of the
caring responsibilities that they take on and the differential
difficulties that men and women might face adapting to these changes at
short notice. There is also a difference in how they will
balance—as I was saying to the hon. Member for West
Worcestershire—the different types of work, not all of it paid,
but work none the less, that these women take on, at home, in the
family and in the workplace. I give
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000101">&#160;</a>

my close family members that she would have to wait an additional two
years for her state pension. She told me, “No I won’t. My
state pension has already been adjusted. Those changes have already
gone through and I have to wait until I am 64.” She gave me
short shrift. The next day she phoned me up again, said she had looked

point. I have received a large number of letters. I have fewer women
aged 56 and 57 in my constituency than the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford does, but I have received a large number of letters about it.
In my role as shadow Pensions Minister I receive a lot of letters from
people across the country, but that is the tip of the iceberg, not
because people do not think that they can make a difference, or that
their MPs are interested, but because they just do not know.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Age UK
evidence backs up that experience. It did a survey of women who were
particularly impacted—more than 1,000 of them, in a focus group.
Very many of them did not know about the changes. In fact, many of them
did not know about the changes that were legislated for in 1995. That
is a failure of Governments from 1995 until now. The reality is, giving
people just five or seven years’ notice of the changes is
certainly not sufficient when we are making such big changes to a
person’s state pension
age.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000105">&#160;</a>

general thrust. On the other hand, she said earlier that all these
people, many of whom have taken 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </strong> There are 500,000 women affected by these changes.
The Age UK evidence suggested that around 20% of them are not clear
about what their retirement date is currently. Many of them are, and
the people who are making plans for their retirement, adjusting hours
and taking on family responsibilities, are doing the calculations.
There will be very different circumstances for all of the 500,000 women
and the Minister will have had many letters, with very different
scenarios. The people writing to us are the people who do know about
the impact, but the Age UK evidence suggests that some people are not
aware of the changes. That points to the need, as Lord Turner set out,
to give people adequate notice of changes in their retirement age. At
57, most women—Age UK evidence backs this up—do know what
their retirement date is. To change it so close to the time is
particularly
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000107">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady was very helpful in reading out some
of those figures. If I have remembered them rightly, she said that
about 31% of women between 55 and 59 are economically inactive, and of
those, roughly 40% fell into the category of sick or disabled—I
cannot remembered exactly how it was defined. Does she agree that there
are other arrangements—I am glad to say—in our welfare
state for looking after people who are sick and disabled? If they
continue to be economically inactive for a longer period of time
because the pension age has changed, there is no reason to think that
those women will not continue to be supported by the same arrangements,
which may or may not be more or less generous, but which will hopefully
be adequate to look after them.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also mentioned that 20% are retired or not working out of choice. One
can hazard a guess that they have family or personal circumstances that
mean they are able to support themselves without support from the
state. That will continue to be true; it will not suddenly change just
because their state pension age has shifted. We are therefore narrowing
down to a figure of around 40% of her original totals. When one
suggests a change that costs £10 billion, it is worth being
absolutely sure that this is the best possible way of helping the
population group who actually suffer—not who are affected; we
accept that the figures are right in terms of being affected—as
a result of these changes. Is this really the right way to help these
people?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000109">&#160;</a>

55 and 59 who are employed will be working part-time. The impact
assessment does not subdivide that percentage. There are statistics
that show the breakdown of part-time and full-time work for that cohort
of women. Many of them will be working part-time. Many of the 66.1%
will also be affected negatively and find it difficult to adjust to the
plans set out in the Bill. We cannot just consider the inactive ones.
Over half of the inactive women, 67.7%, are either sick, injured or
disabled, or looking after family and home. Many of those will, I
believe, be very adversely affected financially.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000110">&#160;</a>

why these issues are important, and the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford also highlighted that for some people this will mean a
particular hardship. I am not detracting from that argument. However,
is there not a basic issue of fairness, which is that in changing the
state pension age because of increased longevity, we should all pay a
share of that additional cost? I have still not heard any explanation
from coalition Members why this particular group of women should pay a
bigger share than everybody else. Does my hon. Friend agree that there
has to be an explanation, if one is possible, why this particular group
of women should be asked to pay, perhaps, twice as much as many other
people?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000112">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That really gets to the heart of the issue.
Everybody is living longer, but there is no evidence that women aged 56
and 57 have had something special in their water that enables them to
live much longer than anyone else. However, they are the group of
people who are being asked to bear the burden of this policy. The
amendment sets out a way of making changes that will affect an equal
number of men and women, mean that no one has to wait for more than a
year longer, and give people sufficient notice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I believe that
any changes to the state pension age must be fair and must give people
notice. I clearly support the amendment. However, there may be other
ways that the Government can meet those criteria. I had hoped, from
Second Reading, that the Government would set out what the transitional
arrangements would look like for the women most impacted by these
policies. I was disappointed—as I am sure many hon. Members
were—that no amendments have been tabled by the Government, or
by Government Back Benchers, about the transitional arrangements,
because it was very clear at Second Reading that the Government did
want to listen and come up with changes. It would be interesting to
hear from the Minister what has happened since Second Reading to cause
those transitional arrangements not to be forthcoming.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would argue
that the particular women impacted by these changes have suffered years
of inequality in the workplace. Many of them have worked part-time,
balancing working life with family life. Many of them were prohibited
from joining a company pension scheme. Hon. Members will know that
until the mid-’90s many occupational pension schemes did not
have to allow part-time workers to join, so many of those women missed
out on years of pension savings, and therefore have very little private
saving to fall back on. In fact, the average pension savings of a
56-year-old woman are just £9,100, which is nearly six times
less than that of a man. The average 56-year-old man has pension
savings of £52,800—a vast difference. In fact, 48% of
women aged 56 and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 21<a class="bkMark" name="Column21">&#160;</a>
                  </div>57 have no pension savings at all, so changes to state
pension age will have a huge impact on those women, not just because of
the balance between working and caring, but because that group of women
have much fewer resources to draw on during that period than even men
of the same age do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Certain groups
will receive an especially strong impact. As my right hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon North pointed out, those with a lower life
expectancy will lose a greater proportion of their state
pension—which was also set out in the impact
assessment—as will those who depend more on their state pension
because of a lack of other savings, and those who are more likely to
suffer from health problems. We have already discussed some of those
issues this morning. With significant differences between different age
groups, a woman born in March 1950 will have started receiving her
pension at age 60, while a woman just four years younger will have to
wait six years longer to receive her state pension. I do not believe
that is fair.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
mentioned the notice period. When the Conservative Government
legislated in 1995 to equalise the state pension age for men and women
at 65, they gave 15 years’ notice from the beginning of the
change, and indeed, 25 years’ notice before the end, as it was
staggered over a 10-year period. When the previous Labour Government
legislated to increase the state pension age to 66 in 2007, they gave
17 years’ notice to the start of the process; 27 years’
notice to the start of the process of the increase to 67; and 37
years’ to the start of the increase to 68.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the Bill,
the coalition Government give just five years’ notice before the
changes kick in. These changes kick in from 2016, just five years from
now, giving much less notice than the 10 years’ notice that Age
UK and the Pensions Policy Institute recommended, and less than the 15
years’ notice that the Turner Report recommended. It was also
interesting that the PPI said that women probably need more time to
prepare for changes in their state pension age than men, because women
start to work part-time earlier than men, often to balance—as
previously discussed—work and family life.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is not just
Opposition Members or the Members who spoke on Second Reading who
believe the impact of these changes to be unfair and the notice period
unacceptable. Dr Ros Altmann from Saga said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">“Over
the next ten years, women's state pension age will increase by six
years, from 60 to 66. Over that same 10 years, men's state pension age
will increase by just one year, from 65 to 66. Is this fair? I am not
quibbling with the concept of equalising men and women's state pension
ages, but the speed of change is very harsh for women. After much talk
of men's pension age rising by one year in 2016, the reality is that
Government has given men a reprieve, but it is women who are paying for
that by a more rapid rise in their pension age”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Age UK has
expressed grave concern that:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brevIndent">“Women
worst affected by the Bill's proposal—that is those who need to
wait two years extra—would see a loss on average of around
£10,000 of state pension income. The proposed speeding up of the
state pension age will start in 2016. Therefore it will affect those
women who would previously have reached state pension age in above five
years time. Those worst affected, who will have to wait a further two
years to reach state pension age, are just seven years away 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 22<a class="bkMark" name="Column22">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from their current state pension date, and many of them are unaware this
is happening. Age UK considers that 10 years is the minimum period of
notice required for those affected to make changes in their pensions
planning”.</p>
               <p>Indeed, a recent survey
carried out by Age UK suggests that women tend to drop out of the
labour market and struggle to return to it. In 2010 quarter 1, 68% of
women were economically active, which dropped to just 35% for women
aged 60-64. That is set out in the impact assessment, underlining the
importance of adequate notice. Only two thirds of the working-age
population between 45 and 59 say that they have plans in place for
funding their retirement. That will be made harder by the changes and
particularly hard for the women, 40% of whom have no private
pension savings.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Bill's
timetable would mean that a woman born in April 1953 will be able to
get her pension at 62 years and 11 months. Yet a woman born in April
1954 will have to wait until she is 66—three years and one month
difference. Many women and men affected by these changes would already
have plans under way for hitting what they thought was their state
pension age. I have heard from many women up and down the country who
have reduced hours or given up work and taken on caring
responsibilities. Those women are well on their way to retirement
plans. The women hit by these changes are the backbone of our families.
They are the mums who took time off work to bring up children, the
daughters who are helping their parents as they get older, and the
grans who are providing child care for their grandchildren to help
their children balance work and family life—something which we
all support. I want to ensure that Members hear and understand today
what this really means for people—not the numbers and statistics
that we have spent a lot of time on already, but for real
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000123">&#160;</a>

the Minister about the increases in the state pension age to 67 and 68.
Bringing forward the increase in the state pension age by one year, to

£13 billion. If the Government wanted to look at
those changes then, as I set out in my letter to the Minister, we would
be willing to see how we could work together to make fairer changes
that do not have a disproportionate impact on one group of people. The
changes that I proposed today save £20 billion over 10 years,
compared with £30 billion, but—again—there are
ways to save more money. Ros Altmann from Saga has set that out, as
have other people. I do not believe that the Government have looked at

in this Parliament. Yes, we need to increase the state pension age as
people live longer, and the changes that I set out this morning would
do that. Other changes could be brought in that would save as much as

so much of the burden of this policy falls on this group of 500,000

where are the jobs going to come from? There is a regional effect. For
example, in Wales there are many more people seeking jobs than there
are jobs available. Increasing the number of people in the labour

complicated ways. I do not think this has been given particular

went on to say that he heard the specific concerns about a relatively
small number of women—although I am not sure 500,000 is that
small—and that he was willing to work to get the transition

reading of that was that the Government were considering transitional
arrangements, and would come back with amendments at Committee stage,
which is the right point to do so, so that they could be scrutinised by
us. We have 10 Committee sittings to consider the Bill. We saw from
Second Reading that the most controversial aspect of the Bill is the
changes to the state pension age, and I would have thought that this
was the time when we would go through the Bill line by line, and look
at the parts that Members on both sides of the House had difficulties
with on Second Reading. I am surprised—as, I am sure, are many
Members, including those who do not have the privilege of serving on
this Bill Committee—that there are no Government amendments on
those transitional arrangements. As I said, I wrote to the Minister on
22 June. I faxed the letter, phoned his office, and sent it by post as
well. At the end of the letter I said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000144">&#160;</a>

earlier, when the last Labour Government commissioned Lord Turner,
along with John Hills and Baroness Drake, to sit on the Pensions
Commission, we felt the need to build consensus with business, the
unions, and on both sides of the House, because pensions is a long-
term issue, on which we should foster consensus if we are to have
sustainable plans set in place. I am disappointed that this Government
are not continuing in a similar vein. As I said earlier, consensus is
hard won, but easily lost. I really do want to be, and have tried to
be, constructive, and the unwillingness of the Government to engage
with the Opposition is disappointing. It is also disappointing that no

question was addressed to me, so I will have a go at answering it, if
that is okay with the hon. Gentleman. If he would like to be the shadow
Pensions Minister, I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will
listen to his request. In answer to my right hon. Friend, this does go
to the heart of the issue. Yes, we do need to reduce the budget
deficit, and we need to ensure that pensions are on a sustainable
footing, but it still comes back to this point: why should 500,000
women bear so much of the burden of this policy and this cost-saving
measure? I believe that there are ways to do this that are fairer, that
give people the adequate notice period, that affect an equal number of
men and women and do not require anyone to have to wait more than a
year longer before they get their state pension. Saga, Age UK and
others have set out ways to save money that do not have these
disproportionate impacts. That is what I believe all hon. Members were
asking for on Second Reading: for the Government to go away and have a
look at it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000148">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North said, it does not seem right
that this group of women should bear so much of the burden,
particularly when they are so ill-equipped to deal with it. Average
private pension savings of £9,100, compared with £52,800
for a man the same age; 40% of them with no pension savings at all.
These women are relying on the state pension, more perhaps than many
other groups of people. Not only are they being disproportionately hit,
but they are a group of people who are ill-equipped to bear this
additional burden.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000149">&#160;</a>

relevant to the Pensions Bill, but it was one that he had asked before,
and one that I have answered already. I will do so again and maybe he
will listen—with all due respect, as they say. First, we have
set out proposals all outside the comprehensive spending review period.
The Government have set out savings of £30 billion over a
10-year period; we have set out savings of £20 billion over a
10-year period. This, though, is for a comprehensive spending review
period that has not even started yet. It is not a shortfall in that we
are asking to spend additional money. We are saving £20 billion
compared with £30 billion. So there is a difference between
them, but it is not a shortfall in the sense that we are asking for
additional money to be spent on something.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Saga has set
out proposals that save more than the £30 billion that the
Government’s proposals would save. I know that all hon. Members
have received that briefing from Ros Altmann at Saga. Those proposals
look at further increases in the state pension age and they and others
could save as much as the Government have set out to save, but
critically give people the notice period, affect an equal number of men
and women and not require anyone to wait for more than a year longer
before they get their state
pension.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000156">&#160;</a>

proposals that are fairer. I come back to the point that my right hon.
Friend the Member for Croydon North makes: yes we need to increase the
state pension age because of increasing longevity, but we need to do so
in a way that is fair and gives people an adequate notice period. There
is nothing being set out today by coalition Members, in all the
questioning that I have taken, that explains why 500,000 women should
have to wait for more than a year and why that is fair.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000157">&#160;</a>

he came back with transition plans—something to mitigate the
impact on this group of women. We all agree that we need to make
pensions sustainable and to address increasing longevity, but I believe
we can do that in a way that is fairer than the Government’s
proposal. I hope that answers the question because it addresses how the
amount that the Government have set out can be saved in a fairer

men and women, and no one will have to have an increase in state
pension age of more than a year. In terms of intergenerational
equity—a key criterion as set by the Government in their
assessment and measured as a proportion of adult life spent in receipt
of a state pension—the timetable we propose has a smoother
transition to the long-term trend of 32.5% for men and 34.8% for
women.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000161">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Our
amendments would still yield £20 billion of savings. Yes, that
is £10 billion less than the Government’s proposals, but
we are talking about a post-deficit world. Let us remember
that this is £10 billion not as an annual hit, but over a period
of years and when we get to 2016-17, GDP will be in the order of
£2 trillion a year. Of course we must be fiscally responsible,
but we must make balanced, informed and fair choices too. We need to be
clear that the timetable for these savings will have no impact on the
Government’s plan to eliminate the deficit within five years, as
the savings are realised much
later.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000162">&#160;</a>

all agree that sustainability of the pension system is also core, but
not at the expense of moving the goalposts for 500,000 women just as
they are about to hit the goal of state pension age in just six or
seven years’ time. These amendments present a
realistic compromise: they generate savings, improve the sustainability
of the pension system, provide a reasonable amount of notice and do not
penalise any one cohort of people.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000163">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Brady. I hope that I do not go too far beyond the
scope of the amendment, but I want to address the question of the
£10 billion hole that it has been suggested we might encounter
as a result of different proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds
West has provided an answer to that within the ambit of the expenditure
on pensions. When we are dealing with such matters, if we want to do
something slightly differently we do not always have to find an instant
answer. Government is about priorities and making choices, and the
Government have chosen to make this saving in this way. One could come
up with a whole number of different ways in which a sum of this nature
might be found, but I would go well beyond the Committee’s remit
if I started to suggest those. It is not good enough constantly to say
that we have to implement these proposals, because the alternative
would involve finding a certain sum of
money.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposals alter an understanding and an expectation that has been in
existence for a considerable time. The hon. Member for West
Worcestershire explained how she, like many people, started her working
life with the assumption that her retirement age would be 60, but that
has changed. The difference, however, is the much shorter time scale,
which means that people have much less time to make arrangements to
deal with the change. That is the crux of the issue. Since the phasing
in of the increased state pension age was agreed in 1995, many people
have had a considerable portion of their working lives to work towards
that understanding of when they would retire.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some of the
people whom we are discussing might not be working; they might already
have had to stop work or reduce their working hours because of family
or caring responsibilities. We know that the vast majority of carers in
this country are over the age of 50, and many are already over the age
of 60; they are caring sometimes for a partner, or sometimes still for
a parent. For many of us in that age group it is precisely the time
when caring responsibilities for parents kick in, because people are
living into their 80s and 90s. Many people find that they have new and
different caring responsibilities that they might not have anticipated.
Many people describe that pressure; just as their children have grown
up, a whole new set of caring responsibilities comes to light. That is
something that will increase.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000166">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">It has been
suggested that it is all right if people in that category are unable to
work as a result of sickness or disability, because other state
benefits will come into play and they will still get support. We have
to be aware, however, that plans are afoot to change a lot of those
benefits. If, for example, a woman was unable to work at that point
because of sickness, she might claim and be granted employment and
support allowance, but if she is placed in the work-related activity
group rather than the support category she might find that her
employment and support allowance ceases after one year, because the
contributory benefit will stop after one year. If she has a partner
with an earned income of more than £7,500, she will not be
entitled to the means-tested form of that benefit. Indeed, if she has
savings that she has made for her retirement, which she has put away in
anticipation of either enjoyment in retirement—there is nothing
wrong with that—or for future care needs in retirement, which we
are being encouraged to do, then she will not qualify for that sort of
benefit. She will lose it in other things that are happening. We also
have to look at the wider picture, which is often more difficult for
someone who has not necessarily built up the same level of pension
contribution, as my hon. Friend mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Women in the
past—and I do not think it has entirely changed—have
often found it much more difficult to build up the kind of pension
entitlements that we would all like to see. That is partly because they
have taken career breaks, which many did at some point to look after
their children, or because in returning to work or working throughout,
they worked in the kind of jobs that suited their other
responsibilities. Many of us do that. At the same time, those are often
the forms of employment that in the past—and it is not so far in
the past—were not even included in pension schemes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Until more
recent legislation, some of it inspired by Europe, brought employment
rights to part-time workers, there was not the opportunity to be in a
scheme even if one was in employment. One did not get the chance to
join, so one does not have that form of record. That is why the pension
pot that many women have is so much less than the average pension pot
of many men. Many of these women find themselves in a difficult
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While it is
easy to say that it is only a small change and does not necessarily
alter the position dramatically since we shall be equalising pension
age anyway and everybody knew that at some point we would move on to
increasing pension age to 66, it is nevertheless a double whammy to a
lot of these women, who had certain expectations and understandings and
who bear the brunt of this. With the relatively small adjustment
suggested by this amendment that problem would be overcome. There would
still be substantial savings over a period to be made from the increase
in the pension age to 66 being accelerated. We have heard a lot about
the difference between £30 billion and £20 billion, but
it is not as if we were suggesting that we stop that altogether and do
not attempt to find a substantial bit of that saving directly. However,
there are other ways of dealing with this question without making it
particularly difficult for that group of women.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to say
a little about the notion that we should concentrate on those who have
the greatest degree of need. We have not heard whether there will be
transitional arrangements, although they were much referred to on
Second Reading. Some of us felt that a number of 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </strong> Indeed, I do remember. It would be interesting to
see exactly what these might be. When we begin to make that the way out
of a difficult problem, there are issues. Exactly how much would that
cost? How would we identify those who would fall into this category?
What sort of hoops will people be put through to make such
applications, if they have to establish that they are a special case?
Is it, first, worth it and, secondly, is it something that we really
want to do? We have heard a lot in debates on welfare reform about the
need to make things simpler and easier, more straightforward and
understandable, as well as about the disadvantages of complex
applications, for example, for certain types of means-tested benefit
when people have to provide a whole range of information about
themselves so that they can be assessed. Do we really want that? Is it
an adequate response and is there not a danger in that situation that
some women, who all seem to agree are particularly disadvantaged by
such matters—perhaps more than the raw numbers—might not
apply for certain concessions, might not know to do so, and might not
receive that form of assistance? We are back facing the criticisms that
many on the Government Benches have also made about such
applications.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
submit that it is not necessary to go down such a complex road. To make
such a relatively minor change within what is a substantial Government
budget overall as well as a substantial pensions budget would be
fair. Even when we are trying to find savings, fairness and
proportionality must be taken into account. It is not all simply about
adding up the numbers. Many people who have written to me and have been
campaigning about such matters ask the same question. They are all well
aware that the Government have choices and are able and willing to
spend money on many things. I am not saying that we can pit one against
the other, but it would not be impossible to achieve fairness and
proportionality within a Government
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000174">&#160;</a>

longevity and fully accept that we must deal with the
consequences. We must all say that before we start putting forward our
thoughts. I agree with the amendments; a particular group of women are
hit unfairly and the Government should be thinking about developing
transitional arrangements. Women will face particular problems
resulting from disrupted planning. I referred earlier to the effect on
carers, and especially the lack of awareness among a large proportion
of people who will be hit by the changes and who will also be facing a
potential loss of income. There is also the difficulty of finding
employment at any age when faced with a lack of jobs, particularly on a
regional and, speaking as a Welsh Member, on a national basis. Certain
matters worry me in that respect.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000175">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Leeds West; such matters are unacceptable and I
look forward with interest to hear what the Minister has to offer us
later in our proceedings. I also agree with the right hon. Member for
Croydon North about the consequences for different social classes.
After all, we have known for a long time that there is a class
variation for both men and women in respect of longevity and the age of
effective retirement, which is also known as economic inactivity to
some people. He has an interesting proposal that we shall no doubt
discuss later, so I shall not stray into that territory
now.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a member of Plaid Cymru, I want to draw attention to the regional and
national variation in longevity for women and whether such matters have
informed the Minister’s thinking in respect of transitional
arrangements that he might announce. The conjunction between
class, gender and location within the United Kingdom and the
effect of local job markets and the size of the public sector is
complicated. A host of different factors come
together. I have no particular answer to the problem. I have not
cracked it myself. I see that the Minister is hugely disappointed,
though I do not think he is surprised that I am not going to offer him
any particular
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have known for a long time that there are regional variations in
longevity, for women as well as men. I do not want to burden the
Committee with too many figures, but let me give some examples of life
expectancy. The much quoted figures for Kensington and Chelsea show
that the life expectancy of women at 65 is 26.5 more years,
and in Westminster it is 24.1. At the other end of the scale, for
Liverpool it is 18.4, for Salford it is 18.5 and for
Blackburn it is 18.2. My particular interest is in the Welsh figures.
For example, for women in Rhondda Cynon Taff life expectancy at 65 is
18.8 more years, very much in the Blackburn, Liverpool and Salford
field. In Blaenau Gwent it is 18.5, and even the best figure for Wales
is 22.3 years. If one looks at the life expectancy for women at 65
broken down between England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, one
gets figures of 20.6 for women in England; 20.1 for women in Wales; 20
for women in Northern Ireland; and 19.1 for women in Scotland. The
figures for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are all below the UK
average of 20.4. That is also reflected in the figures for men. Very
briefly: 18 years for England; 17.4 for Wales; 17.2 for Northern
Ireland; and 16.5 for Scotland. The UK average for men is 17.8
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000178">&#160;</a>

interest. He mentioned the figures for Kensington and Chelsea, and
alludes to Westminster. Would he also accept that within many of our

social
class?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000179">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point, and I
agree with him entirely. The gradient of change on a very local level
is huge. With these particular figures I am drawing attention to the
fact that there also seems to be a regional/national effect, which has
been there, consistently, for a long time. By simple inference that
will affect the debate around pensions. Life expectancy in poor
localities is lower than in richer localities; that is intuitive, but
also backed up by the figures. This is also 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 33<a class="bkMark" name="Column33">&#160;</a>
                  </div>true in terms of gender and class. With respect to the amendment, the
particular interest is in the variation among women, to which I have
already
referred.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also referred in an intervention to the employment question. There
seems to be an assumption that people will work longer and that their
jobs will be available. If we accept that people will work longer there
will always be implications for employment. My particular problem with
the Government’s proposal is that that will be accelerated for
this group of women, who will be looking for jobs in areas where they
are not
available.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Again,
I will not burden the Committee with lots of figures, but say a woman
was looking for a job in the Prime Minister’s constituency of
Witney—having lost hers, or perhaps having given up caring
responsibilities at the age of 59, or whatever it is—I
understand that there are currently three people seeking work for every
one job advertised locally. If one looked at the Rhondda, and believes
the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant), it is 84:1. If you prefer
to believe my figures, taking the number of economically inactive
people in the Rhondda to every job advertised locally the ratio is
152:1. Those are huge figures, but I will not go into the detail of how
they come about as I am sure that you would interrupt me, Mr Brady. All
I am saying is that there are particular regional effects. Such
regional and national effects are a question that my party has been
dedicated to answering since 1925. We are not much closer to finding
answers, to be frank. Our answer, applied with varying degrees of
success and failure for much of that period, has been regional and
national policy, implemented from here and then devolved and
implemented from Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast during the past 12
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right hon.
Member for Croydon North proposed tentatively, as we shall see later,
that class differences in working life and life expectancy after
retirement might be factored into pension provision. No one is
suggesting—I certainly am not—that we should do the same
sort of thing on a regional and national basis. A phrase used in
American politics is “the third rail”. Government policy
trundles along happily on two rails, but anyone who touches the middle
rail, which carries electricity, is dead. The devolution of pensions is
a third rail for anybody with any common sense. However, if one is
considering transitional arrangements, there are some things that might
be done. Events in Scotland have a certain momentum, of which—to
be kind—not everyone in this place is fully aware. I do not know
whether that will affect the pensions debate or the benefits debate in
general, but substantial changes might or might not come
about.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
formulating the proposals, to what extent did the Minister take into
account national and regional differences in longevity, particularly
for women, and the consequences of local employment markets? Did they
influence his decision at all, particularly if he announces anything
vaguely like transitional arrangements? Were they put aside as being
too complicated? Are they matters to be decided by others, for instance
with responsibility for economic development or the devolved
authorities?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
transitional arrangements are being considered, the National Assembly
for Wales has developed a detailed index of deprivation, ward by ward,
which has allowed the Assembly Government to target ameliorating
measures at particularly deprived wards. One might speculate 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>about the possibility of doing something specifically about the
employment of women in areas where there are lots of them having
difficulty finding jobs. Perhaps one could target information at areas
where the lack of knowledge about the changes is high. A number of
things are

interesting point. I will not pursue it now, but Merthyr stands out in
terms of limiting long-term illnesses, particularly respiratory and
heart problems. There seems to be an assumption that people after the
age of 55 or 60 will be able to work and will find jobs, and that those
jobs will be commensurate with their ability to perform them. The lady
working in the dry cleaners comes to mind. That is a physical job, as
is the job of the lady who worked in a funeral parlour. Will people
aged 60, 62 or 63 be able to do that sort of thing? One rhetorical
question that stood out when I read the background material was,
“Are we happy to see our children being taught by someone of
67?” Being close to 67—well, not that close, but
closer—I am very happy to teach children, but there are
questions about people’s ability. The effect of limiting
illnesses is very pertinent.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000188">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a pleasure to serve under your

of the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000190">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As I said in
an earlier intervention, I find it somewhat difficult to imagine where
the Government propose to take transitional arrangements and what sort
of scheme—we may hear later—will be outlined. It would
have been more helpful to have had the opportunity to see Opposition
amendments and Government amendments in advance, in order to compare
and contrast, and perhaps look at securing a way forward on a
consensual basis.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000191">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
constituents who have contacted me from Kilmarnock and Loudoun estimate
that some 1,200 people are affected by the proposals. A
range of women, some of whom have been working since they were 16 years
of age, some in the same jobs or in the same companies, genuinely
believed that they could plan for their retirement. They have described
the proposals as a double whammy, having already had to contend with an
increase in the state pension age, and are now being expected, in some
instances, to work for another couple of years. Others 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 35<a class="bkMark" name="Column35">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have had career breaks, or have had to give up at various stages, either
to look after children or elderly relatives. Many are now uncertain
about what will happen. Much as I have real concerns about the
direction of travel of the Bill, many of my constituents say that they
would not be against transitional arrangements if they felt that they
were fair and would help them in this particular circumstance. The
difficulty that I have at the moment is that I have nothing to say to
them about what the Government are putting forward.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Opposition
amendments are reasonable, rational and proportionate. They suggest a
practical solution and give the opportunity for a fairer approach to
ensure that the burden—there is a burden; let us not get away
from that—is shared more proportionally, over a period of time,
by a greater number of people. On Second Reading, we heard,
consistently, speaker after speaker after speaker from a range of
political parties, not just from the Opposition Benches, identify this
relatively small group of women who will be disproportionately
affected. I think that there was a general view across the House that
something ought to be done about that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This morning,
I have heard some hon. Members suggest that the issue should be fairly
straightforward, in the sense that people can simply work longer. I
have also heard, however, that it is not as straightforward as that,
particularly in the current economic climate and jobs market. Many of
my constituents are being made redundant. They might reasonably have
expected to continue working for another 10 years or so. They are not
just in the public sector, although there are a number of those, but in
the private sector too. There are people who will simply not have the
option of working for longer in their jobs. The types of part-time
employment available in constituencies such as mine, which is not
dissimilar to other constituencies in Scotland and across the UK, and
particularly the types available for women, have tended to have
difficult working hours or involve some form of manual
labour—even the care sector involves lifting, handling and other
things. It is not reasonable to expect people either to transfer from a
job they have had for many years into a new job without training and
support or to take on such responsibilities and forms of employment at
an age when they could reasonably have expected not to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We heard about
longevity. Some might argue that some of the health problems that
affected constituencies in the west of Scotland were self-inflicted
given the higher number of smokers and the higher rate of heart disease
and so on, but so many of those health issues have been and are being
addressed. We should welcome the fact that people are living longer,
but we have to ensure that they have a reasonable quality of life. One
of the issues that I feel most strongly about is the notion that when
we plan pensions or look at supporting people in their later years it
should be treated as a burden. Those who will draw their pensions when
they get to retirement age have paid into the pot over the years. It is
not something for nothing. We must change the language and stop
treating it in this way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A number of
questions have been posed so far, and there were suggestions from
Government Members that the number of people who would be adversely
affected was very small because some might take redundancy

                  </div>payments or not be in work in any event. There were suggestions that my
hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West should have had the facts,
figures and all the information. I take the view that when issues such
as transitional arrangements and the others mentioned on Second Reading
are raised, it is incumbent on the Government to go away and look again
at the information they have to ensure that all bases are covered. It
is for them to come forward with both the required information and the
potential changes. I hope the Minister can respond to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000196">&#160;</a>

this time, it would have been helpful to have more information from the
Government about what their plans for the transitional arrangements
are, so we could have had a much more informed debate at this stage.
Given that there are Opposition amendments on the table, they should be
supported. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I
hope that some of the notes he has been passed this morning will allow
him to illuminate us later in the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000197">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am pleased to speak in support of the
amendment, but I must confess that, like my hon. Friends, I am somewhat
surprised and disappointed that I need to do so. Given the comments of
the Secretary of State and the Pensions Minister on Second Reading, I,
like many others, had expected to discuss a Government amendment to the
clause. I thought the Minister understood the concern expressed on both
sides of the House about the disproportionate impact his proposed
changes to the state pension age will have on a particular cohort of
women, now aged 56 and 57, who, under the proposals, will have to wait
for more than a year extra before they can access their state pension.
They have precious little time to adjust to the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Whip for our shadow team, I was unable to speak on Second Reading,
but as I have taken an interest in pensions over several years, I am
pleased to have the opportunity to address a number of issues today.
The first is on why the proposals are unfair and in need of amendment.
First and foremost, there is a lack of adequate notice. I know that I
do not need to tell the Pensions Minister how important it is to get
people thinking about their pension many years ahead of their
retirement. I am sure that he agrees that when we ask people to plan
years, and indeed decades, ahead, it is vital to provide them with the
stability and certainty to do so. He said as much himself in October
2009:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Pension
policy needs to be stable and predictable years ahead, not made up on
the back of a cigarette
packet.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>He
was actually commenting on the Conservative plans then in place to
bring forward by a decade the raising of the male retirement age from
65 to 66. He does not seem to be following his own advice. Instead, he
is springing these changes on women in their late 50s without giving
them a realistic time scale in which to make preparations for the loss
of pension payments that they had earned and expected over many
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My constituent
Angela Woolley expected to have to work to 64 years and nine months
after the 1995 changes. She accepted the extra four and three quarter
years as bad luck and the result of being born at the wrong time. At
least, though, she had plenty of notice of the change. Now she will
have to wait until she is 66 to receive her state pension—an
extra 15 months. She describes that extra year and a bit as “a
liberty too far”. She said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000201">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>For her, the claim that
we are all in this together rings hollow. As she
says,<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000202">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Angela is
right to feel aggrieved, because she had done exactly what we want
everyone to do: she had saved for her retirement, making contributions
to a small private pension scheme. What sort of message does it send to
younger women or men when they see people such as Angela, who have done
the right thing, having the rug pulled out from under them by this
Government? Angela is not the only one in such a position. There are
probably 2,500 women in Nottingham affected by the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000203">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I have listened with interest
to what the hon. Lady says about her constituent who has that extra
time to work. Do not Opposition Members understand what damage was done
to the value of constituents’ private pensions by the removal of

fill in that

                     </span>
                  </strong> If my constituent had wanted to raise concerns
about her private pension, I am sure that she would have done so.
However, that is not the issue that she is concerned about. She is
concerned about the extra 15 months that she is being asked to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me now
talk about my constituent, Lorraine Smedley. As I say, Lorraine took a
part-time job when she moved towards her expected date of retirement.
She had worked out that she could supplement her part-time wage until
her retirement. She told
me:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
thought I was close enough to my retirement age to know where I
stood.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Now she says she does
not know what to do. Working an extra 15 months before she receives her
state pension is not a prospect that she relishes. Her job as a
community care assistant is physically and emotionally demanding, and
she is not sure that she will be able to continue. The prospect of
claiming state benefits is anathema to Lorraine. She has been
determined to pay her own way all her life. Having left school at 16
and paid into the state pension pot all those years, she feels that she
should not have to rely on benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some of the
women in Nottingham face even longer than 15 months’ wait for
their pension. Patricia Webber is among those who are the hardest hit
by the proposals. Born in June 1953, she is among the 33,000 women who
will have to wait two years extra to get her state pension. She
understands why things have changed over time. She was in favour of
equalisation. She understands that the population is ageing and that
changes need to be made, but she rightly asks why just one small group
is being singled out. Patricia
says:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I

intervention. Frankly, I do not know the answer to that question. I
certainly hope, given the Secretary of State’s comments on
Second Reading, that he intends to implement transitional arrangements,
but sitting here in Committee, with the amendments before us, we do not
have any Government amendment that aims to do that, so I am somewhat
perplexed. Patricia and her colleagues in the class of ’53 have
quite rightly made a fuss and have gained support from across the
House, and I shall return to that in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second reason why the proposals are unfair and require amendment is
because they lead to one group being asked to bear an unfair share of
the burden. According to the Department’s impact assessment, the
proposals in the Bill, under which the state pension age for men and
women will increase from 65 to 66 between December 2018 and April 2020,
will affect around 4.9 million people—2.3 million men
and 2.6 million women. Around 300,000 women will have to wait an extra
one and a half years or more, while no man will have to wait for more
than 12 months. The impact assessment considers a second option, which
is exactly what the amendment is calling for. Option two would affect
3.8 million people in total, but women and men would be affected in
equal measure. No one would have to wait more than a year to receive
their pension, and everyone affected would have longer to prepare for
the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
assessment explains the decision to reject option two, saying that it
is<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“hard to justify
in view of the significant upward revision in the life expectancy of
those reaching age 65 over the next decade, and the consequential
fiscal pressures. Those benefiting from increased longevity should
share in the associated
costs”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
do not disagree that as we live longer, we need to pay more towards our
income in retirement and/or work longer. Like many other people, when I
was in my previous pension scheme, we made revisions to our
contributions rate and changes to the length of time that we would have
to work before we could receive our pension. People accepted that,
because they understood that we are living longer, which places a
greater burden on our scheme. The women who have written to me do not
disagree either—they understand that they may need to work
longer. The key phrase, surely,
is<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“share

               </p>
               <p>and
the key issue is how we ensure that those shares are
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has simply not explained—he will have
the opportunity to do so later—why 300,000
women have to pay a bigger share than anyone else, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 39<a class="bkMark" name="Column39">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
third reason is that the proposals break a promise made by the
Government just 12 months ago. The women affected by the proposals have
already seen their state pension age go up by three, four or five years
under the Pensions Act 1995. They had more than 15
years’ notice of that. As many have commented, they also had
time to adjust their retirement and saving plans to cover the extra
period. Now the Government want to hit the same group again, but this
time much harder and with woefully inadequate notice, having said in
the coalition agreement that while they agree
to<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000218">&#160;</a>

I suppose the reflection is that past Governments’ decisions
about how to raise the pension age and move towards equality between
the genders have met with remarkable acceptance because of the long
time scales, whereas there was rioting in France about the inalienable
right to draw one’s pension at 60. The worry now is that that
consensus will give way to conflict because of the way in which the
Minister wishes to rush the measures through for that group of
women.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000220">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank my right hon. Friend for that
intervention. He is absolutely right. When we look at
pensions—or indeed any long-term planning changes, such as those
regarding care for the elderly, which we are looking at—it is
desperately important that we try to build
consensus.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000221">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to turn to why the unfair burden on women will be hard for them to
bear. We have heard that women’s pension age is rising by more
than men’s—up to two years in some cases—and that
they are being given less notice, with as little as six years’
warning of a two-year change. The women affected are much less
financially secure than men, and therefore much more reliant on their
state pension. Department for Work and Pensions figures show that 40%
of them have no private pension wealth, and if women do have pension
savings, they are likely to have far smaller amounts than men. The
gender pay gap has narrowed somewhat, but on average women still earn
significantly less than men and are therefore much less able to save.
If women have been fortunate enough to be in an occupational scheme,
even a defined-benefit one, their pension will be lower because their
benefits will be based on their
salary.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
women in this group will have taken years out of the labour market to
care for children, and that will have affected their contributions
record. They might have worked part time, and as a result may not only
have earned and saved less but perhaps, until the mid-1990s, been
excluded from occupational pension schemes. The Department’s own
figures confirm the impact of such factors: men have on average eight
times more valuable pension assets than
women.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Women
are also less likely to be able to make changes to cover the extra
delay. They are much more likely to have already retired, perhaps to
care for a partner or for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 40<a class="bkMark" name="Column40">&#160;</a>
                  </div>parents, as many of my colleagues have mentioned, and 37% of women aged
between 56 and 60 are not working and will therefore find it hard, if
not impossible, to be in work. If some of them did return to work,
assuming they could find a job—many Members have already spoken
about the difficulties they would have in doing so, particularly in
certain areas of the country—it is likely that the Government
would have to pick up the even bigger cost of the caring duties the
women were no longer able to carry out. Perhaps the Minister can say
more about why he believes that it is fair for this particular group of
women, who are ill equipped to cope with additional financial demands
as they approach retirement, to be asked to pay a greater share than
everyone
else.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to ask the Minister about a couple of other groups. The first,
which I think has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds
West, was raised by the hon. Member for Chippenham on Second Reading.
He expressed the view that the Government have a particular
responsibility to former Government employees who have recently taken
early retirement—he said “instead of redundancy”,
but it could just as easily have been redundancy—and now find
that they will not have access to a state pension, even though such
access might have been part of their plans when deciding to leave their
employment. When my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West raised the
issue, the Minister asked her how many people were affected, whether it
was 10 or hundreds or thousands. I do not know the answer, but no doubt
he is in a good position to tell us how many civil servants have taken
early retirement or redundancy in recent years, how many of them fall
into this category, and how many are women aged 56 and 57. I would be
grateful if he could give us those figures in his response. We all
know, from our constituencies, that many other workers, particularly
but not just in the public sector, have recently taken early retirement
or had to accept redundancy because of the downturn, and have done so
taking into account the existing state pension
age.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
group for which carrying on working might be difficult is public
servants working in local government. This is something of a niche
area, but the issue has occurred to me, so I will mention it. The
majority of local government workers—probably about
75%—are women, and the age profile in the sector is skewed
towards workers in their 40s and 50s. All local authorities have been
reviewing their pay and grading structures in recent years to ensure
compliance with equal pay legislation, and after any such exercise,
some employees go up the grading structure, some go down and some stay
in the same place. Experts in such matters might tell us that usually a
third of the workers are in each category. In my experience, one of the
biggest concerns for local authority staff, particularly those who are
approaching retirement, is the protection of their pension scheme if
their job is downgraded. Local authority staff are usually members of
the local government occupational pension scheme. Normally, they would
have some reassurance, because the final salary on which their
occupational pension is based is an average of the three best
consecutive years in the last 10. Therefore, as long as they are within
a few years of retirement, they will not suffer a significant loss of
pension, even if they take a drop in pay.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am concerned
that many women will be in that group. They will have had their job
downgraded and will have a pension protected for up to 10 years. They 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 41<a class="bkMark" name="Column41">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will be affected by the change in state pension age, but they will need
to retire as they had planned to protect their occupational pension;
otherwise they will face a gap before they can claim their much-needed
state pension. Given that the average occupational pension for women in
local government is less than £4,000, they clearly will need
their state pension to protect them in retirement. What account has the
Minister taken of those women in his
proposals?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to return to my disappointment that the Minister has not tabled
his own amendments to the clause. On Second Reading, we heard many
Government Members raise concerns on behalf of the 33,000 or 300,000
women who will be hit particularly hard by the proposals, and who will
have to wait 18 months or two years extra for their state pension. The
hon. Members for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing), for North Wiltshire
(Mr Gray), for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid), for Cardiff North
(Jonathan Evans), for Cardiff Central (Jenny Willott), for Mid Dorset
and North Poole (Annette Brooke), for Ipswich (Ben Gummer), for
Gloucester (Richard Graham), for Salisbury (John Glen), for South
Dorset (Richard Drax) and for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) all
expressed concern and hope that the Minister would think again. It is
disappointing and perhaps a little surprising that none of the hon.
Members who made such thoughtful and interesting interventions and
speeches on Second Reading are Bill Committee
members.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000228">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Indeed, many of them did not just express a
wish that Ministers would address the issue, but were confident that
they would. Particular faith was expressed in the Minister responsible
for pensions. The hon. Member for Cardiff Central
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000230">&#160;</a>

               <p>I wonder
how she feels today as she looks at the list of amendments tabled and
sees nothing from the Government to address those concerns. Does she
perhaps feel that her trust was misplaced? Why have the Secretary of
State and the Minister, who made such reassuring noises on Second
Reading about considering transitional arrangements, not tabled any
proposals for us to discuss? When the Minister summed up, he noted that
the Secretary of State had recognised that the implementation needed to
be fair and smooth and was willing to work 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 42<a class="bkMark" name="Column42">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to get the transition right. The Minister said that he was committed to
doing the same. When will he explain how he intends to do
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I want to highlight that when we talk about the state pension, we are
not just talking about the weekly pension of £97.67 per
week—although I appreciate that by the time the changes take
place in 2018, that will be somewhat higher. As I said earlier, when
someone reaches state pension age, they also receive a number of
passported benefits, including winter fuel allowance, free bus travel,
free eye tests, free dental work and free prescriptions. All of those
are contingent on reaching state pension age. One might anticipate that
a woman—or indeed a man—waiting an extra year for their
pension would lose out to the tune of around £5,000 a year, but
the actual cost will be much higher. Of course, those who have no
savings—we know that is 40% of the women whom we are talking
about—will also miss out on access to state pension
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
2009, the Minister said it was typical of Tory policy to hit the
poorest hardest. I know that the Lib Dems would like to paint
themselves as a moderating influence on their coalition partners, so
perhaps the Minister can show that he is a moderating influence today
by accepting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107068000233">&#160;</a>

be unfair to suggest that the Government side of the Committee is
