Stephen O&#146;Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): I beg to move
amendment 152, in clause 34, page 32, line 38, leave out
&#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;must&#146;.</div><a name="09062586000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000477"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
clause stand
part.</div><a name="09062586000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000478"></a>Mr.
Stephen O&#146;Brien:</b> It is good to be back under your
chairmanship, Mr. Key. With amendment 152 and clause 34, we
are dealing with the private patient income cap. Under the amendment,
the Secretary of State must, rather than may, by regulations make
provision. I shall happily withdraw it if the Minister withdraws his
intent&#151;signalled by the unselectable amendment 199&#151;to
remove the clause altogether, or if he promises to introduce an
equivalent replacement on
Report.</div><a name="09062586000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me be clear from the outset: the issue is not fundamentally about
private health care or private patients; it is about better functioning
of foundation trusts, better care for NHS patients and better value for
UK taxpayers. The private patient income cap is iniquitous, limiting
foundation trusts arbitrarily to the proportion of private to public
income that they received in the base year&#151;2002-03, the year
before the first foundation trusts were authorised. For some, that
means 30 per cent.; for others, it is 5 per cent. For all mental health
trusts, it is  0 per cent. The cap also prevents specialist
hospitals such as Great Ormond Street&#151;I would be very surprised
if any hon. Member had the guts to say that they thought that hospital
should not be allowed to expand and to continue its
services&#151;from becoming a foundation
trust.</div><a name="09062586000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is very relevant to the Committee. Many members of the Committee
have foundation trusts in their constituency. In fairness, the hon.
Member for Stourbridge made a declaration near the beginning of our
proceedings because she has in her area the Dudley Group of Hospitals
NHS Foundation Trust, and I think she mentioned that her husband is a
governor of that trust, so she has an interest in the issue, as does
the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West in respect of the University
Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, and the Government Whip in
respect of the South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,
which she visited last September. I shall remind her when she comes
back into the room. The hon. Member for Romsey has in her area the
Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, to which her constituents are often
sent and which just happens to be in your constituency, Mr.
Key.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div><a name="09062586000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062586000479"></a><b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that if
a Member of Parliament has in their area a foundation trust or an NHS
trust seeking foundation status, that represents a pecuniary interest
that should be
declared?</div><a name="09062586000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000480"></a>Mr.
Stephen O&#146;Brien:</b> I certainly am not saying that.
When I say &#147;interest&#148;, I mean an interest on behalf of
constituents&#151;a political, representational
interest&#151;because foundation trusts are now widespread across the
country, as is well known. I wanted to make it clear that this is not a
theoretical issue. The private patient cap will make a real difference
to the ability of foundation trusts to progress and to ensure that they
deliver better care for patients. I also wanted to underscore this
point. It is so easy, because it is called a &#147;private
patient&#148; cap, to think that the issue is about private patients
versus the NHS. On the contrary, it is not about private health care;
it is about the better functioning of foundation trusts, better care
for NHS patients and, above all, better value for UK
taxpayers.</div><a name="09062586000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government Whip has come back into the Room. I was just covering those
hon. Members who have foundation trusts in their constituency. The
Government Whip, who is the hon. Member for Wakefield, has in 
her area the South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,
which I know she visited last September. That, along with the others
and, indeed, the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust,
would potentially be adversely affected if the signal victory secured
in the upper House was not
maintained.</div><a name="09062586000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the cap is iniquitous, and I gave the example of Great Ormond
Street, which will be injuriously denied the chance to grow and sustain
itself if the clause that the upper House has handed to us is not
maintained. The private patient income cap is ultimately political,
rather than practical. On Report, Lord Warner, who was genuinely a
Labour Minister and not just a GOAT&#151;a member of the Government
of all the talents&#151;said that the cap was &#147;a bit
anachronistic&#148; and that it was</div>
<a name="09062586000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sops to parts
of the Labour
Party&#148;.</div><a name="09062586000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
explicitly repented his &#147;sins&#148; over the issue.</div>
<a name="09062586000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">More importantly, the
cap&#146;s stated purposes are achieved in other ways, including
through Monitor, the terms of authorisation, the mandatory
services schedule, contract variations with PCTs, boards of governors
on significant decisions, the asset disposal locks and
consultation.</div>
<a name="09062586000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, and
most importantly, the cap is detrimental to the NHS and patient care.
On Report, Lord Warner said that</div>
<a name="09062586000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is
potentially a source of income for trusts that they can use for the
benefit of NHS patients&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i>  6 May 2009; Vol. 710, c.
656.]</div><a name="09062586000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Third
Reading, he said:</div>
<a name="09062586000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are moving into a financial climate where the NHS...will need
every penny that it can get to meet public

May 2009; Vol. 710, c.
936.]</div><a name="09062586000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As such,
the cap also impacts adversely on UK plc, hampering our provision of
health care to non-UK residents and our research base, which depends on
funding.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div><a name="09062586000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Baroness
Thornton said, the Government have accepted</div>
<a name="09062586000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the issue
needs attention&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
6 May 2009; Vol. 710, c.
659.]</div><a name="09062586000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 12
May, at column 939, she also accepted that it needed &#147;wider
debate&#148;. As Baroness Meacher said in the upper House, this
is</div>
<a name="09062586000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the direction
that the Government want to go&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 12 May 2009; Vol. 710, c.
940.]</div><a name="09062586000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the
proposal would merely be an interim measure while they hold their
review.</div><a name="09062586000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to let matters rest on that argument. I have more that I can
develop, but it would probably be helpful to hear what the Minister has
to say on this incredibly important clause. I fear that unselected
amendment 199 signals that we are about to have the kind of debate that
I had hoped the Government would not force on us. As I hope that I have
made clear, the words &#147;private patient&#148; in the
cap&#146;s title seem to have excited people and given the wrong
impression about the substance of the argument. The essence of what the
upper House has handed down to us&#151;even if it is regarded as an
interim measure&#151;is better for patients and better for the NHS,
and it is not about supporting private health care over public,
accessible health care in the NHS. I hope that members of the Committee
will think about the issue in an independent way, rather than feel that
they have to be led down a political route.</div>
<a name="09062586000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062586000481"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I support the hon. Member for
Eddisbury. In my area, I have another foundation trust, the Hampshire
Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which covers a range of
constituencies in southern Hampshire. It is a mental health trust and
it has the kinds of problems that he alluded to. I met representatives
of the trust on Monday, and they are keen to develop other services.
They were keen to impress on me the fact that, as the legislation
stands, they are quite shackled and unable to move forward with some of
their ideas.</div>
<a name="09062586000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062586000482"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): I also support my hon.
Friend the Member for Eddisbury. I praise the comments by the hon.
Member for Romsey, on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, because mental
health is a massive issue in this regard.</div>
<a name="09062586000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was not
aware of how much of an issue this was until I came on to the Front
Bench and visited hospitals around the country. I was very moved when I
visited Great Ormond Street hospital&#151;no one could remain
unmoved. If any members of the Committee have not been there, will they
please go, not just because of the lovely little babies, but because
the work that goes on there is fascinating. When the chair and the
chief executive sat in front of me and said, &#147;We could do much
more, but we are held back by the fact that we cannot have a foundation
trust because of the cap,&#148; I thought, &#147;Perhaps that is
just Great Ormond Street.&#148; Then, however, I went to the Royal
Marsden, one of the great cancer hospitals in this country, and they
said exactly the same&#151;that they could do more, especially in the
area of research.</div>
<a name="09062586000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">What worries
me, as I said a moment ago, is that this is not about private patients.
This is about money coming into an NHS facility. I would like to put
this on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>the record. They say on a regular basis that that research, which is
often privately funded, benefits our constituents. That is being held
back because of the arbitrary cap. I understand, as the then Minister,
Lord Warner, indicated, that the cap was put there so that the original
legislation could get through. We do not need it now, however. We know
that foundation trusts work. There are great hospitals like Great
Ormond Street that would like to and need to become foundation trusts.
There are others that need to move forward in the area of cancer
research and other research. We have heard this morning about the
limitations in treatment of cancer. Surely everybody that is
represented on this Committee and in this House wants the very best for
the constituents. That is being held back because of this arbitrary
cap.</div>
<a name="09062586000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
what the other place put into this Bill stays, so that these excellent
facilities within the NHS can go forward and help our
constituents.</div><a name="09062586000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000483"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> I agree with the hon. Member for Eddisbury in
some respects and disagree with him in others. This is about the place
of private health care in the NHS. It is not iniquitous to limit trusts
and the amount of private funding they are able to access. The question
is how that limit should be put in place and where it should
be.</div>
<a name="09062586000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
significant disagreements, therefore, between the Conservative Front
Bench and this Front Bench on this issue. However, that being said, we
accept that there is an issue here, and it is right that we should
address it. This clause is not some kind of interim or quick-fix
solution to the problem. An exemption-based system would not remove the
cap&#146;s underlying rule that an NHS foundation trust in private
income should be restricted to levels set in 2002-03. Any regulations
created using clause 34 would only provide for a simple exemption from
the cap. That could not be used to such an extent that the underpinning
primary legislation is nullified.</div>
<a name="09062586000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short, it
is the underlying rule itself that we need to look at. Clause 34 does
not allow that to happen. Instead, allowing exemptions is likely to
introduce a level of uncertainty for the NHS and increase claims of
unfairness, as one hospital says, &#147;I&#146;ve got to change, so
why doesn&#146;t another hospital?&#148; There will be lots of
debates if such exemptions are allowed. It will create a degree of
uncertainty in NHS financing. It will not resolve the problems
identified by the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead; it will potentially
exacerbate some of those issues because there will be a level of
uncertainty about what the rules are and how they should be applied. We
need to avoid that.</div>
<a name="09062586000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
dispute, however, that the current situation is far from ideal. Rather
than trying to create a uniform system of rules for all NHS foundation
trusts, clause 34 would maintain a system based on historical activity
that appears increasingly arbitrary. Any new system must therefore
deliver two things. First, it must remain true to the intention behind
the current cap. That is that all NHS providers must not be distracted
from their core business providing health care to NHS patients. That is
non-negotiable.</div>
<a name="09062586000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, any
new system must be workable. The second point can only be addressed by
developing a new system in partnership with those that will implement
it in the NHS.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div><a name="09062586000441"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09062586000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reforming
the rules so that they are clear and work well will not be
straightforward. It is clear that opinion as to how the cap should be
reformed is divided. There are very strong differences of opinion among
those who work in the NHS. A lasting and fairer system for NHS
foundation trusts can be achieved only by having a broader and public
debate. That is why the Government have a clear commitment to
conducting a comprehensive review of the cap, following the outcome of
the current judicial review.</div>
<a name="09062586000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review
will enable the Government to develop fully the most appropriate policy
solution before we legislate&#151;which we will do at the first
opportunity, once a clear approach has been determined&#151;and will
involve all those who are affected and who have a direct interest in
the policy, namely, NHS foundation trusts, aspirant foundation trusts,
the staff, the patients and other stakeholder organisations.</div>
<a name="09062586000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
consult fully on the proposals and hope to be able to move from looking
at that review to implementation. We do not disagree that a change is
needed; this is the best way to achieve it. We do not think that it can
be done here, certainly by this clause. The clause that we inherited
from the other place cannot do it and needs to be removed. The issue
needs to be examined thoroughly and fully; that is the appropriate way
forward.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000484"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Let me take the Minister back to the
point of picking up on the question of a broader and public debate;
that is what he felt needs to happen now. I am thinking very much on
Baroness Thornton&#146;s words in the other place, when she
said,</div>
<a name="09062586000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
made clear the Government&#146;s desire for a wider debate on the

Vol. 710, c.
658.]</div><a name="09062586000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">She did
not say, as the Minister has, that that needs to take place after the
current judicial review. Is the Minister indicating, by what he just
said about that judicial review, that whatever emerges from it, the
Government would not wish to take any implementing action or, indeed,
respond to any injunctive relief, to the extent that they could resist
that, rather than simply entering into a broader and public debate as a
way of postponing the issue, which is clearly urgent? As he has already
identified, there is a need to address this serious
issue.</div>
<a name="09062586000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000485"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The difficulty in trying to address this
issue before the judicial review is completed is that anything a
Minister says, including this one in this Committee, can be prayed in
aid in relation to the judicial review. If we tried to carry out a
broad-based consultation while a judicial review was in progress,
discussion of the issues would play into an interpretation of the
clause that is the subject of current judicial examination.</div>
<a name="09062586000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
get that completed&#151;completion is due in the autumn&#151;and we
want to then look at its outcome, which may well give us some views
from the courts about how this should be looked at and, after a full
and thorough examination, which issues are in need of addressing from
the courts&#146; point of view. We will then be in a position to be
able to set out our strategy for a proper discussion and
review.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div><a name="09062586000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
dispute that there is an issue that needs to be appropriately
determined, but we are certainly not convinced that the approach being
taken here by the Opposition is the right one, and we do not accept the
amendment agreed in the other place as the better way forward. We need
to look at this issue in the round. We need to examine it properly. We
need to take a view on how the NHS should proceed with regard to
private income, and we need to do so with the freedom to have a full
and proper discussion about it, after the judicial review
concludes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000486"></a>Mr.

taken, the Minister has accepted that a problem needs to be addressed,
but he does not like the way that it is currently addressed in what the
upper House has handed down to us, nor in any other measure at this
stage. His position is, rather: let us go back to the existing
unsatisfactory position where the amount of the cap is, in effect,
arbitrarily set in stone from the amount of private patient income that
happened to exist in 2002-03. That has an absolutely venal effect on

nightmare: the hon. Member for Romsey made that point.</div>
<a name="09062586000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting that to some degree, the Minister in the upper House also
sought to pray that point in aid, as part of the way the Government
were seeking to see the point off when the issue was debated there. Of
course, the Government were defeated in the upper House when the issue
was pressed. It was Baroness Meacher who
said:</div><a name="09062586000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have been given assurances that there are people in the Government who
do not have a problem

say:</div><a name="09062586000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
the Government are able to institute a review, we would all hope to be
involved in it, contribute to it and support it. Then, if possible, a
consensus can be found through a good consultation

the issues are too important to leave for an unspecified opportunity in
the future. NHS foundation trusts up and down the country are
struggling with this. In my view, having the principle in the Bill will

Stephen O'Brien:</b> As they say, Mr Key, see you on
Report.</div>
<a name="09062586000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 35
moves on to a different subject: the disclosure of information by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs. I will deal with three amendments
and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead will deal with
amendment 161.</div>
<a name="09062586000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 84
seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate level of accountability
and public scrutiny included in the information-sharing practices of
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Department of Health,
by mandating HMRC to publish details of the recipients of the
information it discloses to the Department of Health and the reasons
behind those disclosures. The amendment would help ensure that the
Government do not share information for reasons other than those
expressed in the explanatory notes and debates on the subject to
date.</div>
<a name="09062586000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
85, 161 and 86 all seek to ensure that the provisions of this clause
cannot be exploited to share information for any reason other than the
intended purposes. During Second Reading, the Secretary of State deftly
tiptoed around the fact that for the last four years, his Department
has been complicit in an information-sharing practice which is illegal.
The Secretary of State could not quite bring himself to use the word
&#147;illegal&#148; during our last debates. Rather elegantly, he
referred to it as giving the practice a &#147;firmer legal
footing&#148;. As the Minister and I both know&#151;as will anyone
else who has been trained in the law&#151;that is the ultimate legal
and lawyer&#146;s phrase for saying &#147;I need to make sure this
is legal because it has not been like that to date.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062586000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
understand the reasons behind requiring access to the information. I
was much consoled by Baroness Thornton&#146;s admission in the other
place that she and her colleagues had consulted the British Medical
Association and the British Dental Association about the arrangements
in the Bill. However, I seek an assurance from the Minister that this
process will, from now on, take place in the full light of
day&#151;something that my amendment intends to enshrine in primary
legislation. Amendment 84 does not allow for information on pay to
enter the public domain, but it does enable the process of sharing this
information to be scrutinised widely. There is need for transparency in
every aspect of government. If the Government are honest and up-front
with the public about information-sharing practices, there is less
scope for abuse or misuse of information. Therefore, I need to ask the
Minister what measures have been put in place to ensure that the
information that he obtains from HMRC is not abused, but used
appropriately. How is he ensuring that the Government are accountable
for the way in which they use the information?</div>
<a name="09062586000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment 85, I wish to probe the process by which the disclosed
information will be anonymised and to query why the word
&#147;anonymised&#148; has not been included on the face of the
Bill. The explanatory notes
state:</div><a name="09062586000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
information disclosed will be a summary of anonymised information
relating to the earnings and expenses of these
practitioners.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes contain both the notion of aggregation and the notion
of anonymity as distinct processes, whereas the Bill appears to blur
these two concepts into one.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="09062586000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us examine
the exact phrasing of the paragraph in question. The Bill
states:</div><a name="09062586000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Information
may be disclosed under this section only in the form of a summary or
collection of information so framed as not to enable information
relating to a particular person to be ascertained form
it.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062586000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill directly links
the inability to obtain information relating to a particular person to
the aggregation of information in the form of a summary, but that does
not necessarily include anonymisation. It is true that the Government
may well be able to achieve a certain amount of anonymity through
presenting data in an aggregated form, but we need to be clear about
what &#147;anonymised&#148; actually means. The Oxford English
dictionary defines it as the quality of
being</div>
<a name="09062586000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;made anonymous,
especially by the removal of names or identifying
particulars&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062586000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the word is more precise than the anonymity derived from
aggregated data. It involves the removal of specific identifiers such
as names, addresses or gender, where relevant, so that even if the
information is broken down to the level of a practice or group of
practitioners, the anonymity of specific persons is fully protected. By
way of example, I cite the comments of Baroness Cumberlege in the other
place. She asserted that with aggregated information on a particular
area of the country, the clause could apply to</div>
<a name="09062586000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the disclosure
of identifiable information relating to a specific GP practice with
more than one partner. You would not be able to ascertain the income of
one individual, but you would be able to ascertain the income and
expenses of the partnership.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House
of Lords, </i>17 March 2009; Vol. 709, c.
GC36.]</div><a name="09062586000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
placing the word &#147;anonymised&#148; in the Bill, I hope to
cement the Government&#146;s commitment to sharing information only
where anonymity has been rigorously guarded, even when it is presented
in an aggregate form.</div>
<a name="09062586000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we distinguish between aggregate and anonymised and do
not rely on one to deliver the other if aggregate information would
allow quite a close analysis of the salaries of a particular practice,
for example. As I have already stated, this is a probing amendment, so
perhaps the Minister can shed some light on the process by which
information is aggregated, so that the Committee can be reassured on
that matter.</div>
<a name="09062586000442"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09062586000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall skip over amendment 161 and leave it to my hon. Friend the Member
for Hemel Hempstead. While I am on my feet I shall address amendment
86, which picks up on some of the comments made by the Government in
the other place. Baroness Thornton took issue with a query from the
Conservative spokesperson, Baroness Cumberlege, regarding the ability
of the Government to use the clause as a mechanism to obtain
information on a particular practice. If that is possible under the
proposed legislation, it would be relatively easy to match up pay
details with specific practitioners.</div>
<a name="09062586000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness
Thornton gave an assurance in the other place that details of
practitioners&#146; pay would not be disclosed by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in an aggregate form unless it
related to 30 or more doctors or dentists. She said that the number
would be revised if it was thought that a practice might exceed that
number of practitioners. The Minister may wish to reiterate that, and I
hope that he will.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div><a name="09062586000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">That guiding
principle may be the current HMRC policy, but what is to stop the
Government probing below the guideline of 30 practitioners? What
regulations are in place to prevent such an occurrence? I shall be
grateful if the Minister will point me towards the relevant
legislation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000520"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I want to speak specifically to amendment 161,
with regard to dentists and dentistry. I am sure that the Minister is
aware that if one is a commissioned dentist rather than a salaried
dentist, one&#146;s practice operates completely differently from the
way that other NHS practices work, particularly GP
surgeries.</div><a name="09062586000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment ensures that no information about a particular person could
be ascertained from the disclosure of information. That is important,
given that the information about individuals under these circumstances
would be somewhat sensitive. To tease the Minister slightly, the HMRC
does not have a good track record when it comes to losing data. I am
not making a silly point: that concern exists and people are frightened
by the fact that the details of about half the population were
released, accidentally we assume, by HMRC.</div>
<a name="09062586000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will respond. This is a probing amendment and I do not
intend to press it. However, there is a special case for dentists in
that their role within the NHS is different. They are very much the
entrepreneurs in their field. Under the present system, they are paid
by areas of dental activity. They buy or rent their surgery and they
have all their bills upfront. It is completely different from the way
in which the NHS operates in other areas. With that in mind, I am
concerned that, in a time of openness, private information, which would
be very personal to the individuals involved, could be released under
this clause. Will the Minister address those
concerns&#151;specifically on
dentistry?</div><a name="09062586000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000521"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I appreciate the intention behind these
amendments and I share the commitment to safeguarding taxpayer
confidentiality to the greatest extent possible. Confidentiality is a
defining principle of the clause and the measures in place are there
precisely to ensure that information shared by HMRC cannot be
associated with any particular person, whether a dentist or
not.</div>
<a name="09062586000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
helpful if I clarify what the clause, as currently drafted, permits. It
goes further than simply anonymising the information that HMRC may
disclose. As the hon. Member for Eddisbury pointed out, HMRC must also
summarise the anonymised data and may disclose anonymised information
only in such a summarised form. As the identification of a particular
practice would risk identifying a particular individual, which is
already prohibited under the clause, such data could not be disclosed.
HMRC does not release aggregated, anonymised statistics based on fewer
than 30 cases. That figure would be increased if the resulting
statistics were thought to be potentially disclosive.</div>
<a name="09062586000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Eddisbury asked what &#147;anonymised&#148; means. The
safeguards mean that there is no possibility whatsoever of any details
or information being linked to any individual or practice, whether
dentistry or
not.</div><a name="09062586000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
84 seeks to make HMRC, whenever it discloses any information to any
person providing services to or exercising functions on behalf of UK
Health Ministers, publicise such disclosures, along with reasons 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>for the disclosure. It is right and proper that we are transparent about
the disclosure of information relating to the earnings and expenses of
GPs and dentists. It is currently only the NHS information centre for
health and social care that receives this anonymised and summarised
information from HMRC. If that changed in the future, the information
would still need to be passed to some appropriate body that was doing
such statistical work. In addition, the information could only ever be
disclosed for one reason, as set out in subsection (2), so there is no
need to specify that in each case. The purpose of the disclosures is
clearly understood by the bodies that represent dentists and GPs, as
both they and the UK Health Ministers use the data to ensure that the
pay of practitioners remains at an appropriate
level.</div><a name="09062586000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also worth noting that the tax self-assessment forms, which HMRC
provides to dental practitioners and GPs, clearly state that the
information that they submit to HMRC is subject to being used for the
purposes of the earnings and expenses inquiries. When the earnings and
expenses reports on GP and dentist earnings are eventually published by
the NHS information centre, they clearly state that the source of the
data is HMRC and that only aggregate non-disclosive information is
supplied to the NHS information centre. In a sense, there is a cordon
sanitaire between those who supply the information and those who
receive and use it. I do not believe, therefore, that such publication
would provide sufficiently beneficial information on the activities of
HMRC to justify the amendments proposed. I hope that, with those
reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062586000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000522"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I have listened carefully to the
Minister. He has been categorical in his assurances; he clearly regards
taxpayer confidentiality as paramount to the extent possible. He also
used the phrase &#147;no possibility whatsoever&#148; in relation
to inappropriate information getting
out.</div><a name="09062586000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no purpose in pressing the amendment to a Division, but it is
important to recognise the issue, in terms of any potential problem
that could arise in the future. We all recognise that any manipulation
of and transactions with information always carry some risk. There have
been plenty of examples in which there has been disclosure, on memory
sticks and other things, which can easily get out, or on a laptop
rather foolishly left in the boot of a car and the car gets stolen.
Those things can cause problems, although it never ceases to amaze me
how people get through the password. There is always that terrible
risk. Once information is used or created for any purpose and taken out
of the cordon that surrounds HMRC, there is a risk.</div>
<a name="09062586000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
used the phrase &#147;no possibility whatsoever&#148;. That will
provide genuine reassurance but, most importantly, it will be referred
to by anyone who feels that their information has got out. That
commitment on the part of the Government was a significant statement.
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062586000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="09062586000523"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 195, in
clause 35, page 33, line 24, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) A person
who discloses information in subsection (1) to persons other than those
listed at section (3) or for purposes other than in subsection (2),
commits an offence.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4B) An offence under subsection (4A) may in

Majesty&#146;s Revenue and

employee of any person listed under subsection
(2).</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4C) A person guilty of an
offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine not

to whom the information is disclosed in circumstances under subsection
(4A) has a cause of action for damages, including penalty damages,
against the
discloser.&#146;.</div><a name="09062586000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that a breach of the terms set out in the Bill
by anyone involved in the information-sharing process is regarded as a
criminal offence. It builds on the matter that we have just discussed.
Any person who shares the information specified under the clause with
people other than those listed should be held to account for their
actions. Given that the Government have managed to share
information&#151;we have to use the word
&#147;illegally&#148;&#151;for four years without facing the
legal ramifications of doing so, but now wish to put the matter right,
it is logical to want the Minister to reinforce that assurance by
saying that any breaches of the new legislation will result in
appropriate legal action. In other words, it would show that what is
being put in place by the Committee is earnest and
genuine.</div><a name="09062586000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
employees or other persons in HMRC with information-sharing privileges
feel at liberty to share information in an unprescribed fashion,
knowing that they will not face consequences for their action,
information on doctors on dentists could easily be abused and
exploited. I therefore ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to let
us know what precautions are being taken to ensure that those who
breach the terms of the clause are held to account. Our amendment gives
him the opportunity to ensure that such a provision is both real and
serious.</div><a name="09062586000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000524"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> It is worth noting that section 19 of the
Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 already provides the
sanctions that might be applied for the wrong disclosure of information
by HMRC, including imprisonment or a fine. The clause applies to the
disclosure of information relating to persons whose identity is
specified or can be deduced from the
disclosure.</div><a name="09062586000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the amendment goes much further. As I have said, the information that
HMRC transferred to the NHS information centre comprises aggregated and
anonymised analyses. Importantly, the whole point of transferring the
information is so that it can be disseminated as set out under clause
35(2)&#151;the purpose of the provision. The most important
safeguards are those restricting the type of data that may be
disclosed, which I have outlined, not to whom it may be subsequently
disseminated.</div><a name="09062586000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the NHS information centre published the data in its anonymised,
summarised form in the earnings and expenses report, it inevitably made
it more widely available than to those persons listed under clause
35(3). The amendment would throw into question the whole dissemination
of the information provided by the NHS information centre, which is the
basis of the negotiations on which salaries are conducted between
dentists, GPs and the Government. It would thwart the whole point of
the clause and prevent the earnings and expenses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>report from being made available. Not only would the amendment do
something that I am sure was not intended by the hon. Gentleman, but it
would go too far. We already have safeguards and protections that
prevent non-anonymised data from being disclosed, which include
imprisonment or fine, so the amendment would not be necessary even if
it focused merely on the mischief with which the hon. Gentleman wishes
to
deal.</div><a name="09062586000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000525"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The Minister is right to observe that the
amendment would go beyond what is already in place, but he was
extremely helpful to draw attention to section 19 of the 2005 Act. As I
clearly do not have a copy of the Act on my person, I am grateful to
him for that. The provision contains the sanction that is required. The
amendment is indeed widely drafted, and I accept that it would go too
far. Breaches should have serious consequences and ultimate sanctions
should lie behind the provision to make sure that it keeps
people&#146;s feet to the fire and that they are honest and practice
well rather than sharply or badly. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062586000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000527"></a>Mr.

House, thus necessitating this amendment? My understanding is that
particularly controversial or detailed Bills may start in the upper
House when it is necessary to bring specialist knowledge to amend their

<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>detail. This Bill is neither controversial&#151;we have had some
points of controversy, but in broad terms it is not regarded as
controversial&#151;nor does it contain detail requiring expert
knowledge. It seems strange that the Bill was introduced in the upper
House, thus we find ourselves faced with this Government amendment. I
look forward to the
explanation.</div><a name="09062586000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000528"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The explanation is simple&#151;the
objective of this Bill is to implement the review set out by my noble
Friend Lord Darzi. He was able to lead the introduction of the Bill,
which was a helpful way of ensuring the smooth passage of, as the
Opposition have indicated, a broadly uncontroversial Bill. In the other
place my noble Friend was in a position to set out the case in broad
terms for the implementation of a review that he
championed.</div><a name="09062586000158"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000531"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09062586000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 seeks to bring the law protecting young people from tobacco
into line with the law protecting young people from alcohol. The
Government, supported by myself and the Opposition, have amended
legislation to make it illegal for people under the age of 18 to
purchase tobacco products. That was a sensible thing to do and will
help to discourage young people from smoking. I am sure the Minister
will say that that was in the thoughts of the Government when they
introduced the relevant provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="09062586000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that, unlike the proxy purchase of alcohol&#151;it is a
criminal offence to buy alcohol knowingly to pass it on to a minor, or
an individual under the age 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>of 18, as the legislation states&#151;it is not a criminal offence at
all to purchase tobacco knowingly and willingly to pass it on to a
person under the age of 18. I assumed that this was just a slip of
thought, or a missed opportunity, when the Government introduced the
legislation, so I looked for such a provision when the Bill was
introduced in the other place, but it was not there. I decided,
therefore, that it would be sensible to table an amendment with my hon.
Friend the Member for Eddisbury, to change the law in order to protect
young children.</div>
<a name="09062586000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
has heard me speak about evidence several times during the past few
weeks. The evidence is there: &#147;Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use
among Young People 2006&#148; showed that 89 per cent. of young
people either being bought tobacco products or being given tobacco
products by an older person. Interestingly, that was before the
legislative changes, so it related to young people aged 16 or younger
being given tobacco products by adults.</div>
<a name="09062586000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
assumption that if 89 per cent. of young people are having tobacco
products purchased on their behalf, or sold to them by someone, the
tobacco products are not necessarily all coming through tobacconists, I
would have liked to discuss the whole issue of black-market products,
counterfeit products and &#147;cheap whites&#148;&#151;products
imported into this country and sold very cheaply, mainly from the
eastern bloc. Those amendments and new clauses were not selected, but
perhaps we will be able to come back to that area.</div>
<a name="09062586000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
is a very simple new clause. It will bring our legislation up to date.
It will make it a criminal offence for a person who owns a shop to
knowingly sell tobacco to a minor, and it will make it a criminal
offence to proxy purchase, which is the key to the new clause. That
would make it much easier for the authorities to pick up on those who
are preying on young people&#151;either people selling from an
ice-cream van, which used to happen when I was a young fellow outside
the school, or people selling black-market products or any other
tobacco products, whether legal or illegal. To knowingly do that would
be a criminal offence, and that would make it a recordable crime so
that we could stamp down on this. I hope the Government and the
Minister will support new clause 1.</div>
<a name="09062586000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000532"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I very much support the sentiments behind this new
clause, because it seems odd to me as well that the proxy purchase of
alcohol is a criminal offence, whereas the proxy purchase of tobacco
does not seem to be one. I have not had a chance to check whether the
hon. Gentleman has copied exactly the legislation that covers alcohol,
but I have a slight concern that this new clause may not be tight
enough. Subsection (2B) of the new clause states that a defence is
that,</div>
<a name="09062586000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;he had taken
all reasonable steps to establish the individual&#146;s age, or that
from the individual&#146;s appearance nobody could have reasonably
suspected that the individual was aged under
18&#148;.</div><a name="09062586000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know about the hon. Gentleman&#151;he may be better at these
things than I am&#151;but I find it incredibly difficult to work out
people&#146;s ages, particularly when young girls glam themselves up.
So a defence on appearance seems to be quite an easy
get-out.</div>
<a name="09062586000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000533"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> Of course I am more than happy for amendments to
be made by the Government, if they were willing to accept this new
clause on Report and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>tidy it up, but it is framed around the alcohol legislation. To touch on
the point that the hon. Lady has raised: if someone is fraudulently
going out of their way as an under-18-year-old with fake ID, or
whatever, to actually break the law&#151;whether to purchase alcohol
or cigarettes&#151;it is very difficult for the individual who is
running the business to know that that is a piece of fake ID. Siblings
often exchange ID.</div>
<a name="09062586000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause was designed not only with people who run legitimate businesses
in mind, but also to make sure that anybody&#151;whether they run a
legitimate business or are in a black-market situation&#151;realises
that not only are they breaking the law to do with duty and the sale of
tobacco products, but they are committing a criminal offence if they
sell to a
minor.</div><a name="09062586000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.55

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000534"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I had almost concluded my comments. To sum up, we
have great sympathy for the spirit of these amendments. We have to take
action on this if we are serious about tackling the problem of
under-age smokers because most under-age smokers receive their
cigarettes from black-market, under-the-counter sources. I have some
concerns, however, that in some ways the amendments do not go far
enough.</div><a name="09062586000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000535"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Gillian Merron):</b>
As we have heard, the new clause would create an offence for a proxy
purchase of tobacco. I welcome the sentiments that have been expressed
by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady. I share these sentiments and
welcome the concern. The hon. Member for Romsey asked whether the
amendment was the same as the provision in the Bill in respect of
alcohol. I can confirm that it is not and I refer the hon. Lady to the
Licensing Act 2003, section 149, which provides clarification as to
what the purchase of alcohol by or on behalf of children would do, as
opposed to the amendment before us. This might be helpful to the
Committee.</div><a name="09062586000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is already illegal to sell tobacco to young people under the age of 18.
Last year 200,000 children smoked regularly in England and we have to
ask ourselves where they are getting their cigarettes from. I welcome
the support of the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead for the change in
the law that we have already seen. We have the largest survey of the
smoking habits of children from 2006, before the age of sale was raised
to 18. The survey found that, of children aged 11 to 15, 34 per cent.
usually bought their cigarettes from a shop, and that was the single
largest source of tobacco for people under age. It did not, however,
tell the whole story and the Committee may find it helpful if I set out
other aspects. Over a fifth were given cigarettes by friends and just
over one in 10 by family members; and 18 per cent. said they often
bought cigarettes from other people. That gives us some idea of the
scale and extent of the problem that we are all committed to
tackling.</div>
<a name="09062586000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">In total,
other people were the most usual source of cigarettes for just over
half of children. That is completely unacceptable. The proposed
amendment, however, would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>not address this particular problem. It would apply only when an
individual specifically purchased tobacco on behalf of a child. What
would not be taken into account&#151;I am concerned about
this&#151;are cases where, for example, friends share a pack of
cigarettes. That would not count. Parents giving a cigarette from their
own pack would not count either. Unless it was possible under this
amendment to prove at the time that the person who had bought the pack
intended to sell it on to a child, it would not count as a proxy
purchase offence. While that was not the intention of the amendment,
that is where it takes us.</div>
<a name="09062586000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to place it on the record that I know that the majority of shopkeepers
take seriously their responsibilities to stop under-age sale and I
would like to thank them for their efforts in this regard. We need to
ensure, however, that children cannot get hold of tobacco. Although the
intent behind it is understandable, this amendment in respect of proxy
purchasing would be both difficult to enforce and ineffective. Perhaps
I could explain therefore what I think we should be
doing.</div>
<a name="09062586000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000536"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I cannot understand the logic; perhaps the
Minister could elaborate. If the Government use the logic that the
Minister has just used that such a provision would be difficult to
enforce, my reply is that this part of the legislation is exactly the
same as other parts. If an adult purchases alcohol in an off-licence or
a licensed premises, takes it outside and either sells or gives it to a
person under the age of 18, that is a criminal offence. If that is not
enforceable, why is it on the statute book? All we are asking for is
for that to be duplicated for
tobacco.</div><a name="09062586000446"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09062586000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000537"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> Perhaps I could refer the hon. Gentleman to the
full section 149 of the 2003 Act. I would like to say why the two areas
are different. To reassure the hon. Gentleman, I completely understand
his intent. Perhaps he will allow me to elaborate on where we want to
go with this
issue.</div><a name="09062586000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can deal only with the amendment that is before the Committee, and it
does not replicate the defence in the 2003 Act of proxy purchasing
provision. Instead, the amendment replicates the defence used in the
Bill&#146;s tobacco display provisions, which are more prescriptive
on what a person must do to qualify for a defence. As I said, we can
only deal with what we have before
us.</div><a name="09062586000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Supply
of tobacco to children is a much bigger problem, which is one that, I
assure the Committee, I intend to examine in our new tobacco control
strategy, which will be published later this year. We had some 100,000
responses to our consultation, which will set us up very well to be
able to move forward on the issue. I want to be able to assess how we
can help people to understand how dangerous and addictive tobacco is,
and how important it is to stop children from accessing
it.</div><a name="09062586000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to look&#151;the hon. Gentleman made reference to
this&#151;at what other countries have done to tackle under-age
access to tobacco. For example, we are not aware of any countries that
have proxy purchasing for children as an offence, as we have before us
today. But we know laws against the supply of tobacco to children exist
in Latvia, Italy and Ontario. That means&#151;it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>important for me&#151;that anyone giving or providing tobacco to a
minor is committing an offence. I am keen that we find the right way
forward through legislation, information, education and whatever other
means necessary to tackle the
problem.</div><a name="09062586000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are doing is important because supply of tobacco to children is a
very much bigger problem. It does not matter who is providing it or for
whatever reason, whether it is retailers, friends or family&#151;it
is wrong to supply those under the age of 18 with cigarettes, and we
should act to protect children from that. I hope that with the
reassurances that I have given, and with the expression of
understanding of what we are seeking to do, the hon. Gentleman will be
able to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09062586000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000540"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> What has been missing from the Minister&#146;s
comments is how we got into the position in the first place. The
legislation was changed and it became a criminal offence for the
under-18s. But she seems to have forgotten the proxy purchase issue,
which was addressed&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The
Minister, from a sedentary position, is saying no. The matter has been
missed, because it is missing&#151;it is not on the statute book.
What we are trying to do&#151;I freely admit that it may not be
perfect&#151;is to bring us from a position of nothing to a position
of protecting young people, in a Bill which the Government say is
evidence-based to protect children from starting to
smoke.</div><a name="09062586000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had hoped that the Minister would say in her comments, &#147;It is
not perfect, so we will draft an amendment on Report. We will come back
with that, and we will ban it in the Bill. We will send a message out
there to shopkeepers.&#148; The Minister is right in saying that the
vast majority of them are doing a fantastic job of enforcing the law
and vetting who purchases tobacco. But with one in five in the nation
buying black-market products, and two in five in some parts of the
country&#151;I understand that in some inner-city areas, the most
deprived areas, it is even higher than that&#151;where no one is
taking a blind bit of notice about their age because they are just
trying to make a fast buck, we need to have another criminal offence
similar to that in the alcohol legislation. That is where the Bill
should be.</div>
<a name="09062586000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
says, &#147;We are going to have a review, we will look at the matter
and we will come back in the autumn with a strategy,&#148; but the
Bill could have contained a lot of other things that would have helped,
not least nicotine replacement therapy or the whole issue of the black
market or of cheap whites&#151;loads and loads of pieces of
legislation. The truth, I believe, is that because the new clause is
coming from the Opposition Benches, whether those of the Liberal
Democrats or Her Majesty&#146;s official Opposition, the Government
have closed ranks: &#147;No, we&#146;ll sort this out in good
time.&#148; I would be more than happy to withdraw new clause 1 if
the Minister said to me that, on Report, she would bring back
provisions that tighten up the minor areas&#151;although I do not
completely agree with the way that the Minister referred to
them.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div><a name="09062586000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">For instance,
supplying alcohol to one&#146;s children is completely different in
legislation. One can supply wine to them at 14&#151;it is not illegal
to supply alcohol to one&#146;s children. That is completely
different, which is why it was not in the new clause. The comparisons
do not work. I am really very sad for the young people of this country
who are having their lives blighted by people proxy purchasing for
them. Proxy purchasers can make an awful lot of money by selling to
young people and encouraging young people to start smoking, getting
them addicted. New clause 1 would take a huge leap forward into
protecting the public health of young
people.</div><a name="09062586000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am hugely disappointed that the Minister has not come before the
Committee today, knocked my new clause down but said, &#147;We will
address this on Report&#151;there is plenty of time to address
it&#151;and we will protect young children.&#148; I cannot press
the new clause to a Division in the Committee, because I am advised by
the Clerks that if I do, the House will be restricted from voting on it
on a free vote, which would also be important. I hope that in the
meantime, before Report, both Ministers, the Secretary of State and
their advisers see sense and table an amendment to the Bill that
protects young people from proxy purchase. If not, I shall move a
similar amendment on
Report.</div><a name="09062586000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

Merron:</b> Yes. I am sorry that I was not quick enough off
the mark, Mr. Key. I am sorry to disappoint the hon.
Gentleman, but I shall reiterate some of my points. We can only go on
what the new clause before us says; it would be difficult to enforce
and would not do the job required. I can confirm that I will examine
the full range of effective measures that we can take in the tobacco
control strategy. I feel that we will get a better job done when we
have
that.</div><a name="09062586000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000545"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> This is the second time that the Minister has
said that it would be difficult to enforce measures against the proxy
purchase of tobacco, but the alcohol legislation on the statute book
specifically has such measures. Why would it be more difficult to
enforce measures against the proxy purchase of tobacco than to enforce
the existing legislation on
alcohol?</div><a name="09062586000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000546"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> I had thought that we had talked about the
difference, but I shall have to go through it again. New clause 1,
which is before us and is all that the Committee can deal with, is
rather different from the provisions on alcohol. There has been
reference to alcohol and tobacco being different. There are some
limited legal circumstances in which alcohol can be drunk by under-18s,
as we know if we look at the detail of the legislation, whereas tobacco
should always be out of
reach.</div><a name="09062586000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
very much welcome the zeal with which the hon. Gentleman puts his case,
because&#151;as I have heard in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>the Chamber as well as in Committee&#151;not all right hon. and hon.
Members on the Opposition Benches share his zeal. On tobacco display,
on one of the points on which I had hoped&#151;hope&#151;for
greater support, our proposals are there because we want to protect
children from the addiction of smoking, which damages their health so
badly.</div><a name="09062586000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000547"></a>Mike

way?</div><a name="09062586000202"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000550"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> I am asking the hon. Gentleman to be a little
patient.</div><a name="09062586000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 as drafted does not do the job. I have given an assurance that
we are very keen to tackle this issue, but doing it by creating an
offence of proxy purchase, which does not exist in any other country
and so we have little to draw on, would mean having to prove the
intention to sell it on to a child. That would be the only way to count
it as a proxy purchase offence.</div>
<a name="09062586000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000551"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I will not be long, but yes, I do speak on this
subject with zeal. If the Minister looks at <i class="I">Hansard</i> and at the
time I spent on the Select Committee with her hon. Friends, she will
find that I was much more zealous there, particularly with the
Secretary of State when she tried to bring forward a piece of
legislation that was fundamentally flawed. But the key to being an
Opposition Member is that we have a free vote&#151;a conscience vote.
Why is there not a free vote on the Government&#146;s Benches? If the
hon. Lady wants to talk about zeal, she should let her Back Benchers
have a
vote.</div><a name="09062586000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000552"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> Mr. Key, I am sure you know that these
matters are subject to the usual channels. I am glad to hear that the
hon. Gentleman will be withdrawing or not pressing new clause 1, and I
hope we can make progress.</div>
<a name="09062586000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000553"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> What I am struggling to understand is that the
Minister sounds sympathetic, the Bill has been some time in preparation
and the issues have been raised numerous times in debate on the Floor
of the House, possibly in an Opposition day debate initiated by the
Conservative party, yet we do not have any attempt by the Government to
address a very real problem. Why is that? Why so
slow?</div><a name="09062586000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000554"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> To reiterate once again, I believe that it is
right to draw together all the concerns and we will address them,
whether it is through legislation, information, guidance or a
connection in the tobacco control strategy. I should have thought that
hon. Members would be glad that we will be responding to a very full
consultation, which has included retailers, those who do and do not
smoke, and those who have to deal with the scourge of smoking. I do not
want legislation that does not do the job. I want, as we all do,
legislation that will do the job. If the hon. Lady feels that the
approach taken in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>new clause is the right way, doubtless she will pursue the matter. I am
disappointed that it appears we will not be testing it in
Committee.</div>
<a name="09062586000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000555"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The Minister almost seems to be making a good
argument to defer the whole Bill until we have the tobacco strategy. I
cannot see why the Government have cherry-picked some of the things
that they like and that they think are a quick fix, and yet again
thrown into the long grass measures that would make a real
difference.</div>
<a name="09062586000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000556"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> The new clause would not make the real difference
that we all seek. As I have said, we will address the matter in full on
all levels later in the year through the tobacco control strategy, and
it will be informed by the consultation&#146;s 100,000 responses. It
appears that new clause 1 will not be promoted and  I welcome
that, but I hope that the spirit in which I welcome that is
understood.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000557"></a>The

but not a Division.</div>

Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful for your clarification,
Mr. Key. As far as we are concerned, it has left us with the
option of being able to make sure that that is brought back on Report.
It would have been closed out had we forced a Division&#151;so no one
should read into the fact that we were not pressing it to a vote the
absence of our continuing earnest underlying new clause
1.</div><a name="09062586000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6 concerns an issue that our discussions about pharmaceutical
needs assessments have not yet raised, and that is the provision of
pharmaceutical services for patients living in cross-border
territories. We touched on the subject in relation to other matters in
the Bill. My constituency is widely affected by it; a significant
number of my constituents in various villages such as Farndon,
Shocklach, and Higher Wych, make use of Welsh NHS services. The Welsh
Affairs Committee estimates that there are more English patients
registered with Welsh GPs than vice versa&#151;about 20,000 English
patients with a Welsh GP and about 15,000 Welsh patients with an
English one. In 2007, there was a net flow of 5,354 patients into Welsh
primary care services from England.</div>
<a name="09062586000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
localisation of entry into the pharmaceutical list, through the
pharmaceutical needs assessment, could impact negatively on those
patients. If Wales grants applications to provide services on the basis
of its Welsh population, and an English PCT does the same for its area,
English patients registered with Welsh GP practices could find there is
inadequate provision of pharmaceutical services in their area. My
amendment seeks to ensure that Welsh Ministers take that into
consideration when monitoring the PNA process, so that pharmaceutical
services in cross-border territories do not suffer, and patients in
those areas get a fair deal. The new clause is to probe the Minister
about what provision the Government have made to ensure that residents
of such areas have access to the same calibre of pharmaceutical
services as elsewhere in
England.</div><a name="09062586000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000565"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The provision of general medical services
and pharmaceutical services is governed by powers within the National
Health Service (Wales) Act 2006. Such powers are within the devolved
competence of Welsh Ministers, and if the new clause were accepted, it
would derogate from the devolved competence of Welsh Ministers in
respect of their functions in relation to health.</div>
<a name="09062586000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
the measures do not accord with&#151;and, in fact, run contrary
to&#151;the principles underpinning the protocol for the cross-border
commissioning, which was agreed between the Welsh Assembly Government
and the Department of Health on 1 April and which will continue until
the 31 March 2011. That protocol sets out agreed procedures for
commissioning NHS  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>health care for residents in England who are registered with a GP in
Wales, and for residents in Wales who are registered with a GP in
England.</div><a name="09062586000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the PCT retains the legal responsibility for its resident population
registered with a GP in Wales, local health boards commission such
services on the basis of clinical need, and as a minimum, the Welsh
Assembly Government&#146;s standards for access to health care,
irrespective of the location of the provider. That means Welsh GPs are
required to work to the standards and targets set out by the Welsh
Assembly Government for all the patients that they see and treat,
irrespective of the patient&#146;s place of residence. For those
reasons, Welsh Ministers have confirmed that the new clause would not
be accepted, so I hope that it will not be
pressed.</div><a name="09062586000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have set up, with great care, a relationship with the devolved
Administration in Wales. That has been carefully negotiated and the
arrangements have been agreed up until 2011. This clause would change
everything, without full consultation and with no discussion.</div>
<a name="09062586000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that it is important to deal with these issues appropriately, but I
assure the hon. Member for Eddisbury that if an MP, on behalf of their
constituent, raises an issue with a Minister about the provision of
health care by a Welsh GP to an English patient, the Minister will be
able to pass it to the Welsh Health Minister, and the Welsh Assembly
Government would then respond to the letter in the same way as that
from an MP. There are ways in which these matters can be dealt with but
trying, in effect, to write a new derogation from the relationship with
Wales is really not the way forward.</div>
<a name="09062586000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000566"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> As I said, this is a probing new clause,
so I will not press it. What is important, given that last element of
the Minister&#146;s response, is that I am glad to note that the
Department of Health would, for instance, pass on a complaint that I
might write to him on behalf of my constituent who has a problem with a
GP in Wales with whom they are registered, to the holder of the
equivalent ministerial position in Wales.</div>
<a name="09062586000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for that assurance, because outside the Department of
Health&#151;which I have had no cause to write to on behalf of a
constituent&#151;my experience to date in about 70 cases that I have
taken up over the past decade has been, at all times, for my letter to
be passed to the Welsh Assembly&#146;s equivalent Minister, then, if
I receive a response at all, to hear that I have no rights as an MP and
that they therefore respond to me as to any other citizen in the
country. The quality of response has been extremely poor compared with
the assurance that the Minister just gave, so I am grateful for that,
not least as I rather hope that the rest of Whitehall will note what he
has just said and that for once, after a decade of trying, I might get
somebody in the Welsh Assembly to listen to the enormous issues that
spread right across the Welsh border with Cheshire along the River Dee.
That has been helpful from a more general point of view, and I hope
that the Minister realises the enormous consequences of the commitment
that he has just given, which I will now be able to pray in aid across
the whole of Government.</div>
<a name="09062586000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, I
note the care with which he thinks that the protocol has been
negotiated and the number of years that it is meant to last, but it
does not work in all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>respects. There are significant shortcomings in the way that the
protocol operates, and there have been some real problems, not so much
in primary care services, but certainly in emergency services,
resulting in a number of patients coming across the border from Wales
to access the shorter waiting times at the Countess of Chester
hospital. Meanwhile, we have had a number of English patients wanting
to access the free prescriptions in Wales. The protocol is fairly
frayed, at times, and causes an enormous amount of casework for local
MPs.</div>
<a name="09062586000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000567"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the free
prescriptions in Wales. How much of a factor is that in the disparity?
Are people actively choosing to go over the border and register with a
Welsh GP because of the free prescription charges or are other factors
at work that a good pharmaceutical needs assessment could, potentially,
address?</div>
<a name="09062586000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000568"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> That is an interesting question. I shall be
careful not to stray too far, but it covers cross-border pharmaceutical
services in so far as the needs assessment is taking place within a
village where it is literally 200 ft down to the old Roman bridge to
cross the River Dee from Farndon to Holt in Wales, where they also have
a pharmacy. Those needs assessments have, for these purposes, been
taking place in completely separate countries yet, in truth, the
proximity of those two pharmacies compared with many facilities across
many other, more rural parts of my constituency has shown that there is
a difficulty at these points in how territories are defined.</div>
<a name="09062586000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
importantly, at the moment it is too early to tell; there is not enough
evidence, and it is anecdotal about people with long-term conditions
and who do not get free prescriptions in England. However, particularly
if they are of working age, there is some evidence of attempts to
register with Welsh GPs in order to access free prescriptions. On that
basis, I am happy to withdraw the new clause, but we have had a rather
useful discussion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000569"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09062586000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
new clause is similar to the amendment tabled by my noble Friend
Baroness Tonge in the other place. It seeks to end the situation where
refused asylum seekers, including children, the elderly, victims of
torture and other seriously ill and extremely vulnerable people, can be
denied secondary health care unless they can pay for it. There are many
who regard this policy as inhumane. It puts asylum seekers&#146;
lives at risk and is likely negatively 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>to impact on public health in general. The policy is also very difficult
for health care professionals to administer and
enforce.</div><a name="09062586000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be worth providing some background to this. In 2004, as part of the
National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors)(Amendment)
Regulations, the Government introduced charges for all refused asylum
seekers to access hospital care except for emergencies. In practice
that has meant that treatment in an A and E department is free but all
other hospital and specialised medical care is chargeable; that strikes
many as a blunt instrument. That includes patients on section 4
support, pregnant women, children, cancer patients, diabetics and those
needing treatment for HIV/AIDS. Treatment for most communicable
diseases, except HIV/AIDS, is an exception to this rule and can be
provided free of charge; there seems to be an anomaly in not including
HIV/AIDS. Given how difficult it has become for asylum seekers to
access health care, it is questionable whether they will come forward
for screening or treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis or mental
health problems.</div>
<a name="09062586000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rationale
at the time for this policy seemed to centre on health tourism. That
was something the media were concerned about at the time, but there has
been relatively little evidence that it was a significant problem. The
occasional person will come to the UK specifically to access health
care, but there is no evidence that that is the prime motivation for
most people entering this country. In 2009, the Royal College of
General Practitioners
concluded:</div><a name="09062586000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no evidence that asylum seekers enter the country because they wish
to benefit from free health
care.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also stated that GPs have a</div>
<a name="09062586000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;duty of care to
all people seeking
healthcare&#148;</div><a name="09062586000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="09062586000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should
not be expected to police access to healthcare and turn people away
when they are at their most
vulnerable.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Royal College of Psychiatrists has also
observed:</div><a name="09062586000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
psychological health of refugees and asylum seekers currently worsens
on contact with the UK asylum
system.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
its scrutiny of the Bill, the Joint Committee on Human Rights
noted:</div><a name="09062586000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
remain as concerned as we were more than two years ago when we
concluded our inquiry into the <i class="I">Treatment of Asylum Seekers</i> that
a highly vulnerable group of people in the UK...continue to be
denied access to fundamental
healthcare&#148;.</div><a name="09062586000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the first two years following the introduction of the regulations, the
Refugee Council worked with dozens of refused asylum seekers who had
been denied or charged for the health care they urgently needed. To
give a snapshot of the sort of cases that have fallen foul of the
regulations, 15 women and two girls were charged more than
&#163;2,000 for maternity care and in some cases were denied that
care if they could not pay in advance. I would contend that the unborn
children had a right to care in utero, but others decided differently.
Ten people who needed operations for different medical conditions or
treatment for injuries sustained in the UK were denied treatment, as
were people with cancer. A gentleman with bowel cancer was admitted to
A and E, but his operation was cancelled when he was unable to pay for
it and he was told to come back when his condition deteriorated. There
are many similar examples.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="09062586000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Refused asylum
seekers face considerable obstacles to accessing care, including
confusion about entitlements, GPs using their discretion whether or not
to register or treat them, language barriers and so on. This all paints
a very confused picture. Despite having been refused asylum in the UK,
some of these people have horrendous stories. They sometimes have
health problems linked to torture, poverty in their country of origin
or even mental health problems caused by their detention. The numbers
may be relatively small but the problems are quite specific. I alluded
earlier to the problem women asylum seekers face; if they are pregnant,
they do not get good anti-natal care.</div>
<a name="09062586000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="09062586000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a successful legal challenge to this policy in April 2008, but the
ruling was overturned on appeal by the Government. The Court of Appeal
handed down its judgment on 30 March, finding that failed asylum
seekers cannot be considered ordinarily resident in the UK and are not
exempt from charging, even if they have lived in the UK for a year.
However, the court also found that existing guidance is unlawful as it
is not sufficiently clear on what treatment should be considered urgent
and immediately necessary.</div>
<a name="09062586000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response,
the Department of Health issued interim guidance on the 2 April 2009.
That makes it clear that immediately necessary treatment, including
maternity care, must never be withheld; urgent treatment for conditions
such as cancer, which would deteriorate significantly if untreated,
should not be withheld; trusts should not pursue charges beyond what is
reasonable; and non-urgent treatment that can wait until the person
returns home should not be started until payment has been made. By
contrast, in Scotland, refused asylum seekers receive free health care
until they return home, and in Wales, the Welsh Assembly have confirmed
that they will not charge refused asylum seekers for access to
secondary health care despite the outcome of the appeal.</div>
<a name="09062586000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
interim guidance is welcome, but it does not address the fundamental
concerns relating to the charging regime and the way guidance has been
implemented since 2004. There has been a lot of confusion and the new
clause is an attempt to clarify some problems from the past. The policy
remains burdensome on health care professionals. They may have to
assess when a patient is likely to return home, or whether waiting
until that time would lead to an unacceptable deterioration in the
patient&#146;s condition. This can be difficult and time consuming.
It is also inappropriate to make health care professionals consider a
person&#146;s immigration status when their duty of care should be
their only concern. In addition, there are still likely to be
differences of opinion between clinical and non-clinical staff as to
which cases are immediately necessary or urgent, because hospitals will
not be reimbursed for the treatment they give to refused asylum
seekers.</div>
<a name="09062586000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are moving
into the argument about whether it is a good thing to charge for health
care, but if people do not come forward there are public health risks,
because they may not be screened for treatment or they may not receive
inoculations. The policy is not consistent with the ethos of the NHS
constitution, which we discussed at length earlier in the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000570"></a>Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> How many asylum seekers live in England,
and how many in Wales and Scotland?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div><a name="09062586000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000571"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I do not have that information, but if the hon.
Gentleman is interested we can table a question to the Home Office and
it will provide the
answer.</div><a name="09062586000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
May 2009, the committee on economic, social and cultural rights voiced
its concern over the low level of support for and difficult access to
health care for rejected asylum seekers. The charging structure also
runs counter to other Government policy objectives on public health,
social exclusion, combating HIV/AIDS and TB, and the Every Child
Matters
agenda.</div><a name="09062586000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Restoring
refused asylum seekers&#146; access to free secondary health care
would ensure more efficient use of NHS resources. Treatment that
prevents or cures illnesses is obviously more efficient and effective
than waiting for a condition to deteriorate until it reaches the
thresholds of immediately necessary or urgent treatment, which cannot
wait until the person is expected to return  home. That
conclusion was also reached by the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
which repeated a previous recommendation
that</div><a name="09062586000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;free
primary and secondary healthcare be provided for all those who have
made a claim for asylum or under the ECHR whilst they are in the UK, in
order to comply with the laws of common humanity and the UK&#146;s
international human rights obligations, and to protect the health of
the nation&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062586000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also stressed the
very difficult position of refused asylum seekers who cannot be
returned and recommended that the Government issue guidance to set out
clearly their entitlement to free health care while they remain in the
UK.</div><a name="09062586000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Department of Health issues further guidance before that has been
done, it should help to ensure the proper implementation of existing
guidance and relieve some of the burden on health care professionals by
specifically stating that the decision whether to treat somebody rests
entirely with the commission. That was confirmed in another place by
Baroness Thornton on  6 May
2009.</div><a name="09062586000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Refused
asylum seekers on section 4 should be exempt from charges as the grant
of section 4 support means that the Government accept that those people
are temporarily unable to return home and would otherwise be destitute.
All HIV treatment should be considered immediately necessary. That has
been recommended by the British HIV Association and there is clearly a
public health implication here. The Government should also take steps
to reimburse hospitals in areas where large numbers of asylum seekers
are grouped so they do not have to bear an unreasonable extra cost from
properly implementing the guidelines. There would obviously be a
disproportionate impact on those
areas.</div><a name="09062586000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier,
a comment was made from a sedentary position about how much all this
would cost. The more important question is, how much less would it cost
if we treated early? Community-based health care is cheaper than
secondary health care. Seeing a nurse at a GP&#146;s practice costs
&#163;33 an hour. Seeing the GP costs &#163;116 per hour of patient
contact. Prompt referrals to hospitals for care that is required can be
very cost-effective. For example, seeing a doctor who is a medical
consultant based in a hospital costs &#163;163 per patient-related
hour and out-patient attendance at a hospital for a face-to-face
meeting, non-consultant led, would cost &#163;55 for first attendance
and &#163;71 for the
follow-up.</div><a name="09062586000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Compare
that to the cost of treating someone whose condition is allowed to
deteriorate until care is absolutely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>necessary. The average cost for a journey in an emergency ambulance is
&#163;263, or &#163;344 in a paramedic unit. If surgery is
required, the cost for a surgical consultant to perform an operation is
&#163;388 per hour. Similar arguments can be extended to mental
health issues. In short&#151;<i class="I"> [</i><i class="I">Interruption.]</i></div>
<a name="09062586000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000573"></a>Sandra

for Hemel Hempstead, who has been brief in his comments. In short, the
amendment&#151; <i class="I">[Laughter.]</i>  I could go on for longer
if the Committee requires, but I will not. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.]
</i>Yes, there are a lot more yellow pages of notes, so the
Conservative Whip should be careful before he comments further because
I could probably speak on this matter until 5 o&#146;clock if I so
wished, but other important amendments need to be discussed. He can
have it whichever way he
likes.</div><a name="09062586000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would create fairness in a situation which is unfair on a lot
of failed asylum seekers and does not treat them compassionately. It is
ironic that the Government, in the form of the Department for
International Development, put a lot of resource into improving health
care in some of those countries, yet refuse the same people treatment
if they are in this country. That is not
fair.</div><a name="09062586000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062586000574"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
I congratulate the hon. Lady, who was taking a bit of flak, on bringing
the matter forward. Having said that, it does not sit easily with the
Bill and I am not sure that the new clause is the way to address what
is a complex issue&#151;in several parts, as she suggested. However,
one has to take one&#146;s opportunities where one can. She has done
that and she was right to do so.</div>
<a name="09062586000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
matter of concern to my constituents and  to
me&#151;particularly to refugee organisations in my constituency, my
law centre and other practitioners who represent refugees and asylum
seekers. I am not sure that the original legislation was well conceived
by the Government back in 2004, but we are where we are and the hon.
Lady has indicated some of the problems that have come from
that.</div><a name="09062586000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to highlight three separate areas. The first, which has already
been mentioned, is refused asylum seekers under section 4. This appears
to be entirely anomalous and I do not think that the new clause is
dealing with that. It might deal with it in passing, but the issue goes
much
further.</div><a name="09062586000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall listen carefully to the Minister. I hope that we get some
indication&#151;if not today, then in the near future&#151;of the
Government&#146;s intention. It is a highly anomalous situation
whereby asylum seekers who are due for return are, with the
Government&#146;s agreement, not being returned for good and
practical reasons&#151;often to do with temporary situations in their
country of return. In such circumstances, the Government do not have a
leg to stand on in withholding health
care.</div><a name="09062586000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second problem, which recent legal proceedings have highlighted, is
that the situation is confusing to medical practitioners and to asylum
seekers. That has led either to asylum seekers not receiving the proper

<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>care to which they are entitled, such as primary care or maternity care,
or to the types of care that are available not going far enough. I
agree that the new guidance issued in April 2009 is helpful in
clarifying some of those anomalies, but it shows that there were
anomalies and confusion, and that there is continuing confusion in some
areas.</div><a name="09062586000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Government look at the matter again. It is principally an
issue for regulations under secondary legislation and guidance, rather
than primary legislation. However, the Committee offers an opportunity
to ask the Government to look again at the circumstances in which there
is either a clear humanitarian need or a pressing practical need for
conditions to be dealt
with.</div><a name="09062586000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of those conditions is HIV, which is primarily excluded from treatment.
I cannot see why that condition does not fall under the type of urgent
and necessary care that would allow immediate treatment, with later
charging, if necessary, rather than being excluded from other
contagious and infectious conditions. That is another area that I hope
the Government address. It appears that the Liberal Democrats wish to
go further than simply repealing the legislation
wholesale.</div><a name="09062586000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the Division, I had an opportunity to talk to my hon. Friend the Member
for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who chairs the Joint Committee on
Human Rights, and who, in April 2009, produced a powerful argument
along those lines. The Government should look at it again. The cost
arguments can go backwards and forwards. The costs in terms of overall
health service spending are clearly de minimis, although I am not
saying that they are not large. However, there are substantial
arguments that the bureaucracy, the waste of clinical time and the
delay in treatment that permits a condition to worsen are on purely
practical, let alone humanitarian, grounds matters that should be
looked at again. I am talking of conditions such as cancer, which,
perhaps in its early stages, may not receive the type of secondary
treatment necessary in this respect, but which in later stages clearly
would receive
treatment.</div><a name="09062586000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe, as probably all hon. Members believe, that when asylum
applications have failed and due process has been carried out, it is
right to return people to their country. Indeed, people who abuse the
asylum process in that way do no service to genuine asylum seekers.
However, for those caught up in the process of bureaucratic delay and
who remain in the United Kingdom&#151;we have heard about the
anomalies between the different constituent countries&#151;the system
is not achieving a great
purpose.</div><a name="09062586000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that a large number of people come as bogus asylum
seekers to receive medical treatment or significantly delay their
return for spurious reasons to prolong that medical treatment. In the
end, the Government will need to decide largely to abandon the position
they have taken&#151;on practical as much as humanitarian grounds.
Today, I emphasise the point of detail I have raised, which is
essentially to do with failed asylum seekers not being returned because
of a Government decision or because of conditions where treatment is in
fact urgent and necessary, requiring care that may fall outside the
provisions.</div><a name="09062586000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look to the Minister to explain the Government&#146;s line and to say
whether further announcements or guidelines will be
produced.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000575"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Everything that needs to be said on the
matter has definitely been said. While some important and sensitive
issues lie behind the new clause, as well as those of equity, it does
not show real understanding of cost implications and it would premature
and difficult to include it in a legislative provision at this stage.
Were the new clause pressed to a Division, regrettably, Conservative
Members would be unable to support
it.</div><a name="09062586000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000576"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> I want to make it clear to my right hon. and learned
Friend the Minister that I take the issue seriously and welcome the
contributions made by the hon. Member for Romsey and my hon. Friend the
Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd&#146;s Bush. I will not repeat
what they said, because there is no need to do so. In fact, while the
hon. Member for Romsey was speaking, I had the impression that some
Opposition Members regarded the matter as a waste of time and were more
interested in other things. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;No.&#148;] I do not want to misrepresent anyone, but that
feeling came
across.</div><a name="09062586000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear to my right hon. and learned Friend that that is
not the attitude adopted by many Labour Members. This is not a question
of dealing with such matters as quickly as possible. It might not be
suitable to add such a provision to the Bill&#151;that is fair
enough&#151;but I hope he will acknowledge that he, too, takes such
matters seriously and that there may be an opportunity for him to
consider the issue further on Report, or at least suggest how such
matters might be more properly addressed in the
future.</div><a name="09062586000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remember my right hon. and learned Friend introducing a White Paper
some years ago, when he was at the Home Office. I think it was entitled
&#147;Faster, Firmer, Fairer&#148;. Many improvements have been
made to the immigration control system, some parts of which are faster,
but people can still exercise appeal rights and some will not be
returned for other reasons, such as the country of origin being deemed
unsafe and no safe third country being identified. Genuine issues
should not be treated or dismissed
lightly.</div><a name="09062586000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000577"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I begin by being clear that the Government
recognise and respect the fact that their duty is to ensure that the
provision of health care is fully compliant with human rights
principles. That is important, and we want to ensure that it is firmly
on the
record.</div><a name="09062586000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two distinct parts of the new clause, both of which seek exemption
from charging for NHS hospital care&#151;an addition to the existing
category of refugees and an extension to those refugees and other human
rights applicants to include those whose applications have been
refused, generally referred to as failed asylum
seekers.</div><a name="09062586000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the addition to the existing category of refugees, I should make it
clear that the definition in the regulations is intended to cover any
person seeking refuge or protection, whether under the 1951 UN
convention&#151;in other words, an asylum seeker&#151;or through
any other route, including the European convention on human rights. The
trigger, therefore, is not whether a person is designated an asylum
seeker, but whether they are deemed to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>seeking refuge&#151;that is an important category. That means that, in
addition to asylum seekers, others may be
included.</div><a name="09062586000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition, in practice, already captures most human rights applicants.
As such, they are entitled to free health care while their claim is
being considered. A small number may seek leave under the articles of
the ECHR relating to family life or marriage. That is a separate
category, as they are not seeking refuge but are seeking entry in
relation to family life and marriage. We would not extend full rights
and benefits unless, or until, leave to remain was granted, as is the
case with any other foreign national who seeks to remain in the UK.
That exception is important, but for those seeking refuge the position
is clearer, although I am not saying that it is entirely
clear.</div><a name="09062586000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing regulation is therefore sufficiently broad to cover genuine
humanitarian needs and does not require amendment. However, the
Department is looking at the issue with care and wants to update its
guidance on charging. For the avoidance of doubt, we will certainly
ensure that the intended meaning of the definitions is made fully clear
when the guidance is
published.</div><a name="09062586000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the proposal to extend free hospital care to failed asylum seekers, the
issue of whether they should receive free and unrestricted treatment
must take into account a range of complex health conditions, in
particular balancing migration strategy with the need to support human
rights and public health. Hon. Members will be aware that a review of
access to the NHS for foreign nationals is looking at that issue and
will report shortly. It would not be appropriate for me to prejudge the
outcome of that review. The issue is being looked at, and it is right
that it should
be.</div><a name="09062586000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should set out some of the key rights that people have. I want to look
at the human rights of the people mentioned, many of whom are here
because of their circumstances. We are aware that failing an asylum
test does not mean that a person&#146;s human rights are somehow
invalidated&#151;that is not the
case.</div><a name="09062586000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
any course of treatment that commenced before an asylum claim was
refused will continue free of charge until a clinician considers it
complete. Only new courses of treatment will incur a
charge.</div><a name="09062586000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
treatment in a hospital A and E, or any emergency treatment at a GP
surgery, is free of charge. Treatment for many infectious diseases and
sexually transmitted diseases&#151;I will come back to HIV&#151;is
also
free.</div><a name="09062586000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
urgent hospital treatment must not be denied, delayed or restricted.
Hon. Members may be aware that a recent Court of Appeal judgment found
that the Department&#146;s guidance on that was not entirely clear.
The Department has fully accepted the court&#146;s judgment and
welcomed the opportunity to act further to ensure clarity on the rights
to treatment and their being
enforced.</div><a name="09062586000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
issued immediate interim guidance to the NHS to clarify matters related
to urgent treatment, which is what clinicians judge cannot wait until
the patient is likely to return home&#151;whether or not some
treatment can genuinely wait and that not exacerbate a condition seems
to be the real issue. That urgent treatment should always go ahead even
if payment has not been received. If the patient genuinely has no funds
or resources, a hospital may decide not to ask for deposits or may
write 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>off any debt. We expect hospitals to act reasonably when asking for
payment or seeking to recover any
costs.</div><a name="09062586000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also committed to a full redrafting of the guidance on the urgency
of treatment&#151;in the autumn, after assessing the impact of the
interim guidance. We want to see what the guidance we have issued so
far has done and then look at how it needs to be changed. We want to do
that in reasonably good time in the
autumn.</div><a name="09062586000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000578"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister is saying that
the guidance will be reviewed or that new, revised guidance will be
produced in the autumn. When does he expect new guidelines to be
produced?</div><a name="09062586000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000579"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I am saying, in effect, both. We want to see
the impact of the interim guidance&#151;how it deals with the
problems that have arisen, some of which were outlined by the hon. Lady
and others&#151;but we also want to review how the guidance can be
further developed. A review of the guidance and a review of how the
interim guidance has operated&#151;we want to ensure that we do both.
In that context we want to consult the key stakeholders to ensure that
the final guidance is clear, operable and compliant with the Court of
Appeal
judgment.</div><a name="09062586000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000580"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:</b> I am pleased to hear what my right hon. and
learned Friend says about looking at such matters again, including
charging. He will consult with no doubt better qualified people, but
will he also consider meeting me and other hon. Members who are
interested in the
issue?</div><a name="09062586000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000581"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I shall be happy to meet my hon. Friend and
others to discuss the issue. Let me add that the Government are
committed to re-examining the case for exemption from charges for those
failed asylum seekers whom the UK Border Agency accepts have a
legitimate, temporary barrier to leaving the UK&#151;of the sort he
identified&#151;and who are given section 4 support. I confirm that
the review of access is actively considering
that.</div><a name="09062586000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
take the issue seriously in relation to not only human rights, but
people&#146;s most basic rights and the principles of the NHS. I
assure the Committee that the Government want to deal effectively with
the issues of accessibility to health care for refugees, as shown by
our actions and commitments on the definition of
&#147;refugees&#148;, the urgent treatment guidelines and those
failed asylum seekers covered by the section 4
provision&#151;legitimate temporary barrier to leaving the
UK.</div><a name="09062586000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
those safeguards and commitments, the Government do not feel that a
more explicit and extensive exemption from charging is appropriate now.
We want to see what the impact of the interim guidance is. We want to
have a look at the issue in the round and we do not deny that there are
related issues. There is no Government denial that the issue is
sensitive and needs to be resolved with a degree of care and concern
for people who may well be vulnerable. On that basis, I hope the hon.
Member for Romsey will not press her new clause to a
Division.</div><a name="09062586000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000582"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I am inclined not to press the new clause to a
vote. I do not think that I would receive support from Conservative
Members. Interestingly, I might receive some support from Labour
Members, but I shall not push it at this
stage.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div><a name="09062586000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000583"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> That is not because of the issues that
lie at the heart of this. I hope I made that clear. Indeed, it needed
to be made clear to the hon. Member for Bedford, who cast completely
unfounded aspersions about the motives of Conservative Members.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Completely unfounded, and he should withdraw the
remark.</div><a name="09062586000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to recognise that there is a real issue here, because what
is contained in the new clause is a very large spending commitment,
which at the moment is not costed, making things very difficult for
anyone looking at the deployment of resources either in the NHS or in
any other Government budget. A much better cost assessment would be
needed in order to proceed to support what lies at the heart of the
issue&#151;the substance&#151;on which the hon. Lady made some very
fair points. However, without costings, the measure presents
difficulties, of which I dare say she might be aware, for her own
party&#146;s economic
policy.</div><a name="09062586000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000584"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.
I can assure him that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr.
Cable) would have my guts for garters if I proposed an unlimited
spending commitment. However, neither of us knows the truth of the
matter at this stage and I accept that the hon. Gentleman supports the
sentiment behind the new
clause.</div><a name="09062586000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am reassured that there is an active review of section 4 payments,
because it struck me that this area is particularly unclear. I retain
some concern over the public health aspects, but there seems to be
quite a lot of work going on. At this stage, therefore, I think it
better to withdraw new clause and to review what is happening, prior to
consideration on
Report.</div><a name="09062586000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
may be produced at that time, but it would be helpful if the Minister
wrote to me on any other points of clarification, because significant
numbers of people working in the health service find the guidelines
difficult to work under. They are not exactly clear and the sooner we
have clarification on this matter, the better it will be for the people
who are suffering as a result of the policy. It will also be better for
managers and clinicians, who are sometimes caught, having to make
difficult decisions. We need greater clarity. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="09062586000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000585"></a>Sandra

time.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div><a name="09062586000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will be relieved to know that this will be a somewhat shorter
explanation. Earlier in Committee, I raised concerns about the
accessibility of the NHS constitution in formats for people with
different disabilities, and was not entirely reassured that this was
covered under the Disabilities Discrimination Act 2005. We have had
that Act for some time, and the figures I produced previously showed
that a lot of people&#151;particularly partially sighted
people&#151;are not receiving information in a useable and useful
form.</div><a name="09062586000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have talked a great deal about the importance of
information: we have the NHS Choices website and NHS Direct. They have
been very committed to providing the public at large with information,
and I welcome that. However, people working in government and in trusts
have a duty to ensure that as many people as possible can access that.
Therefore, this clause asks that trusts should publish, as part of
their reporting on their disability equality duty obligations, details
of the number of documents they have provided to disabled people in
formats other than standard print. Again, it is all very well having
the legislation, but if it does not require people actively to do
something which can be monitored, it is very often forgotten or, worse
still, ignored. With that, I withdraw my remarks to a
close&#151;sorry, draw my remarks to a
close.</div><a name="09062586000307"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062586000586"></a><b class="B">Mr.</b><b class="B">
Stephen</b><b class="B"> O'Brien:</b> I was just trying to work out what
withdrawing the remarks meant, and whether I was going to have an
opportunity to stand up and support the spirit of the new clause. I
would, however, have preferred subsection (2) to say &#147;patients
or members of the public with
disabilities&#148;.</div><a name="09062586000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) seems valid; subsection (3) is more bureaucratic, which I think the
hon. Lady accepts, and I am not sure whether accountability could not
be exercised in other, somewhat less bureaucratic, ways. Without costs
being properly identified and attached to this, it would be difficult
to gain the Opposition&#146;s support, but at the same time I welcome
the spirit in which it has been presented and
moved.</div><a name="09062586000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062586000587"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Mike </b><b class="B">O'Brien:</b> The hon. Member for Romsey
shares common ground with us in wanting to ensure that people who need
access to this sort of information get access to it. The only
difference between her view and mine is that I think that the
legislation is covered, in the sense that provisions are in place to
enable access to such facilities. We would do no good in putting on the
statute book something that is already there, merely because the
provisions have not yet had the impact that she and I want.</div>
<a name="09062586000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">Repetition
does nothing. We need to ensure that existing legislation is used
effectively. Governments and the House can put on the statute book
provisions enabling those with disabilities to get the access and
information that they need, but those powers need to be used and
enforced. Sometimes that requires individuals taking cases; more often,
it requires authorities and organisations to comply better.</div>
<a name="09062586000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
problem sharing the hon. Lady&#146;s ideas, but we already have the
Disability Discrimination Act 2005, which came into force in December
2006 and is working its way into place. It placed a new statutory duty,
the disability equality duty, on public bodies to promote 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>greater equality of opportunity for disabled people and required public
bodies to make reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of people with
disabilities. At the time, the Department of Health published
&#147;Creating a disability equality scheme: a practical guide for
the NHS&#148;, which included sections on monitoring within such a
scheme. Further to that, in June 2009, the Government published the
revised single equality scheme setting out how we intend to meet our
duties under equality legislation, including the DDA. I will be happy
to circulate those documents to the Committee so that members can be
satisfied about the
policy.</div><a name="09062586000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for implementation, the Government are aware that the NHS can
demonstrate examples of good practice, but we certainly acknowledge, as
the hon. Lady observed, that there is still some way to go in order for
equality to be mainstreamed and sustained. In other words, there is
still a lot of work to be done. To address those practical issues, the
Government put in place a number of initiatives, often working in
partnership with the NHS and other key stakeholders. Of central
importance will be the new equality and diversity council, which aims
to improve the NHS&#146;s equality performance for both patients and
staff. Furthermore, as part of the pacesetters initiative, the
Department of Health is working with six strategic health authorities
and 34 trusts to trial different approaches to deep-seated
inequalities, including those arising from disability. Evidenced good
practice will then be disseminated widely in the NHS.</div>
<a name="09062586000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year,
the Department, with support from the Equality and Human Rights
Commission, trialled legal compliance workshops. A model workshop is
now available for strategic health authorities to use, and NHS South
West has already used the model to run its own regional event. As
subsection (3) of the proposed new clause highlights, good equality
data are needed so that the NHS can better draft and understand its
equality schemes, plan, commission and monitor service delivery and
plan and monitor work force developments. In November, a new equality
monitoring guide covering all equality strands, including disability,
will be issued. The guide will confirm the codes that the NHS should
use when monitoring for equality and give good practice examples of
equality data collection and use.</div>
<a name="09062586000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words, we have the law, and I do not think that we need to repeat it.
What we need to do now is to find better ways of ensuring that it
happens in practice for those affected and those with disabilities.
That needs to be the objective.</div>

Gidley:</b> The Minister is well intentioned, but alarm bells
start ringing when I hear the words &#147;we have good
practice&#148;. I contend that there is a best practice for almost
everything in the NHS&#151;world leading in many cases. Since joining
the Select Committee on Health, I have travelled to various places only
to find that there is something just as good or better on our doorstep.
In the past the NHS has been spectacularly bad at spreading that best
practice; I wish the Minister success in improving that. Were all
trusts to adopt best practice in everything, we would have a health
service that was second to
none.</div><a name="09062586000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000589"></a>Mr.

practice in the NHS are the quality accounts in this Bill. Ensuring
that we spread information and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>emphasise the quality of the different components of the NHS does not
only mean raising everything to a minimum standard, which we still have
to do, but also making sure that best practice is more effectively
spread across the
NHS.</div><a name="09062586000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000590"></a>Sandra

announced are fairly new. I welcome the fact that the Department is
working with the SHAs and the trusts, but&#151;again there is a
health warning&#151;they need to ensure that best practice is more
widely implemented. It would only be fair to allow some of that a
chance to bed in, to actually have an effect. I hope that, with the
coming financial pressures, this is not one of those things that is
quietly shunted to the sidelines. For many people, this is fundamental
to the optimal use of the health service. I shall be watching closely,

Gidley:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09062586000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause has effectively been referred to as a plain packaging
amendment; there were attempts at this in the other place. The clause
provides the Secretary of State with powers to make regulations to
restrict the use of branding, including the shape and colour of tobacco
products and their
packaging.</div><a name="09062586000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have introduced this new clause because we have a slight problem with
the Government proposals that were discussed on Tuesday afternoon,
which sought to remove all tobacco products from display. We are
talking about an adult product that should be sold only to adults. The
evidence base for the effect on children is limited, which is a shame
because the Bill has been touted as introducing measures to reduce
smoking by children. There is a need to curtail further the impact of
cigarettes; this new clause seeks to do that.</div>
<a name="09062586000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pack
would retain the brand name of the product, which would be displayed in
a standard font, the volume of the product, for example 20 cigarettes,
and features required by statute, including health warnings, tar and
nicotine yields and the duty stamp. Committee members have been
provided with examples of plain packs. Tobacco manufacturers have
suggested that these would be easy to forge, but it seems to me, having
seen forged packs, that existing packs are also easy to forge. The
problem of smuggling needs to be resolved in a completely different
way; there are ways that that can be
achieved.</div><a name="09062586000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000592"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> European legislation allows the free movement of
products from other European countries to this one. We all know about
the border problems with smuggling and other issues. If we do this on
our own without our European partners, European legislation would still
allow those products to be in this country. How will that be? We would
have products sold in this country that would be in plain packaging,
while everything else that is floating around would be in other
packaging. How is that going to balance out? Is it
legal?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000593"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The tobacco manufacturers would say that it is not
legal. There is another body of opinion that says it is. That is
probably a lawyers&#146; charter&#151;I do not know; it is up to
the Minister to decide all that. Both the lawyers have gone, so perhaps
we can make some
progress.</div><a name="09062586000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause
states:</div><a name="09062586000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
making any regulations...the Secretary of State shall
consult&#148;</div><a name="09062586000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
affected. The regulations would be subject to affirmative
resolution.</div>
<a name="09062586000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
explaining why the measures are necessary. Currently, branded packaging
constitutes a highly effective form of tobacco advertising. I had the
dubious pleasure of serving on the Committee discussing the Tobacco
Advertising and Promotion Act 2002, which was my first ever Bill. I was
totally dismayed that it took us all day to define a tobacco
product&#151;that was baptism by boredom, I think, rather than by
fire. Certainly, the intention of that Act was to try to prevent those
visual triggers and icons, and the ways that products could be used and
sold, from subtly reinforcing certain brand
images.</div><a name="09062586000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result of the 2002 Act, all the emphasis has gone to tobacco display.
Some of the display material produced by the large tobacco
manufacturers is not in the spirit of that Act. The boundaries have
been pushed so far that there are some large, flashy displays at point
of sale. Although measures in the Bill seek to remove everything
completely, there may be a compromise in restricting what is on
display. It has been shown by numerous people that tobacco branding is
particularly potent in the recruitment of young people into smoking
habits. Design features, including colour coding, give them misleading
and illegal impressions that one type of cigarette is less harmful than
another. In fact, they are all fairly, or completely,
harmful.</div><a name="09062586000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause seeks to make plain packaging mandatory for all tobacco
products, removing all branding and leaving the health warnings and the
name of the product. Current branded packaging is a form of advertising
and misleads smokers about the safety of the product.</div>
<a name="09062586000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the
advertising ban, the pack has acquired even greater importance as an
advertising tool. The tobacco industry uses it to recruit smokers to
replace those who have quit or died. The industry saw early on that the
pack would acquire even greater importance. In 1991, some time before
the ban, the trade magazine &#147;Tobacco International&#148; wrote
that</div><a name="09062586000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
traditional cigarette pack will not be good enough for the selling job
it will have to do. If it cannot be shown and marketed in advertising
as before, it must carry the whole message
itself.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many

a speech much quoted in the Lords, the global brand director of
Imperial Tobacco boasted that it had used pack design to undermine the
advertisement ban and increase sales. I
quote:</div><a name="09062586000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
effect was very positive. Already the number 1 brand, our share grew by
over 0.4 per cent. during this period&#151;that may not sound a lot
but it was worth over &#163;60 million in additional turnover and a
significant profit improvement. Often in marketing, it is difficult to
isolate the effects of individual parts of the mix. But in this case,
because the UK had become a dark market, the pack design was the only
part of the mix that was changed, and therefore we knew the cause and
effect.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div><a name="09062586000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Branding is
especially effective when it comes to young people. The great majority
of smokers start smoking before they are 18 and the longer they smoke,
the harder they find it to quit. Research conducted by the university
of Nottingham has shown that young people found branded packs much more
attractive than plain packs, demonstrating the appeal of packaging and
branding independent of the appeal of the tobacco product itself. There
is much anecdotal evidence that if young women in particular see a
glitzy pack they want one. It is almost like an accessory. Professor
Gerard Hastings from the Institute for Social Marketing describes
cigarettes as,</div>
<a name="09062586000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;badge
products&#146; which are conspicuously consumed, particularly by the
young, to make public statements about the user&#146;s self-image and
identity&#148;.</div><a name="09062586000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that goes the design of the pack.</div>
<a name="09062586000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Branding can
also be used to mislead smokers about the relative safety of brands.
The use of colours or livery can mislead smokers into thinking that
their favoured brand or brand variant is a safer product than others.
Some have shades of a colour so that the strongest cigarettes are
darker. People smoking cigarettes from a lighter coloured pack will
think they are less dangerous when in fact they are just as dangerous
in the long run.</div>
<a name="09062586000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
were tabled and debated at Committee and on Report in another place.
They have been reintroduced here because there is new evidence,
including research that stresses concerns raised in another place,
which shows that the tobacco industry has advanced legal arguments
knowing them to be unsound, including arguments promoted to Members of
this House. The Bill has also been amended in response to Lord
Stoddart&#146;s objection at Committee stage that it should provide
for an affirmative instrument. Greater clarity has been provided by the
Minister on the forthcoming tobacco control strategy, which could
include a planned review of the
evidence.</div><a name="09062586000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
stage in another place coincided with the world conference on tobacco
and health. On the very day that Members debated plain packs, new
research was being presented at that conference. The new research was
on previously secret internal tobacco industry documents that showed
that not only are industry claims about international law incorrect,
but tobacco industry advocates knew that to be so at the time they made
the claims. The study confirms that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000594"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Lady is taking us through a lot of
background material, much of which is understood by colleagues on the
Committee&#151;indeed, much of it is shared. Would it be helpful if
my hon. Friend the Minister were to set out the Government&#146;s
position on this, because it would enable her to focus on the key issue
that she wants to remedy rather than having a general canter through
all the issues?</div>
<a name="09062586000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000595"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I do not think I was cantering. I appreciate we
have limited time left, but this is important. While the Committee may
feel it is fully conversant with all the detail because we have all
been bombarded with information, nevertheless there are those outside
who have not necessarily seen everything. I can assure the Minister
that I could be speaking at greater length. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The
hon. Member for Eddisbury casts aspersions by suggesting that people
will not read reports 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>of our deliberations. Some people do. He has quoted at length what was
said in another place and used that for much of his material, so it
must have some
use.</div><a name="09062586000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be worth moving on to a summary of the arguments against plain
packaging that were made in another place. Some raised concerns that
health warnings would be removed. The amendment does not do that. It is
clear that the legal warnings that currently stand will continue. There
were concerns that information on nicotine and tar levels, required by
law, might not be on the packs, yet the amendment does not alter that
requirement. There were also concerns that the colour on the packs is
required by Government, but I am not sure why that was such a concern.
I have a concern about the white packs that have been sent round,
because white often looks like a healthy colour. Brown might be a
better colour&#151;to match the colour of one&#146;s lungs after
smoking such products&#151;but it is worth mentioning that the plain
pack will enhance the prominence of the health warnings.</div>
<a name="09062586000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
said that plain packaging would not reduce youth smoking. It is fair to
say that it is not possible to prove that a change to plain packaging
would reduce youth smoking&#151;it would need to be
trialled&#151;but it can be demonstrated that branded packaging
increases the appeal to young people, and that is what the industry
does all the time with its constant renewal, the designer packs and the
collector&#146;s item packs, which are all designed to get people
buying more packs of cigarettes. I do not think they care whether the
cigarettes are smoked as long as the money is handed
over.</div><a name="09062586000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern is that plain packs constitute an infringement of trademark.
According to Sir Richard
Buxton:</div><a name="09062586000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
grant of trademark confers the right to stop others using that mark. It
does not confer on the trademark owner a right to use that mark in all
circumstances and irrespective of public policy
considerations.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
complain that plain packs are an infringement of the trade-related
aspects of intellectual property rights agreement. The industry was
advised by BAT's head of corporate affairs, David
Bacon:</div><a name="09062586000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Current
conventions and treaties offer little
protection&#148;.</div><a name="09062586000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Others
raised concerns that there would be
an</div><a name="09062586000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unlawful
interference with the human right, established by the European Court of
Human Rights, to free speech between the manufacturer and the consumer
of a
product.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">EU
directives already provide for restricting misleading branding and the
insertion of health warnings on tobacco packaging. In his formal
opinion, the former appeal judge, Sir Richard Buxton,
asserted:</div><a name="09062586000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
my view any court would take very seriously the views of health
authorities that see plain packaging as an effective and necessary
means to a public health
end&#148;</div><a name="09062586000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="09062586000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would not expect an English court, or for that matter the Strasbourg
Court, to get into arguments with the British Government about the
lawfulness of its adoption of advice recommended by the WHO and given
to it by its Chief Medical
Officer.&#148;</div><a name="09062586000348"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000601"></a>Sandra

not sure that he is aware of what point he wants to make, so I shall
move on, if that is okay with the Committee. I have almost
finished.</div><a name="09062586000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a measure that the tobacco industry fears more than anything,
because if we introduce something similar in this country and it is a
success, it will be emulated around the world. Even if products are put
under the counter, the plain packaging amendment means that there is no
pack appeal. All the efforts of the tobacco manufacturers have been in
trying to promote smoking&#151;and the packages themselves&#151;as
a sexy product. The aim of that pack design has one purpose: to
increase sales. That has the knock-on effect of increasing
smoking.</div>
<a name="09062586000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">People who
are trying to give up often say that seeing a pack of their favourite
brand can act as a real trigger to that yearning. That may be lessened

strong.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000602"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> I am sympathetic to the points that the hon. Lady
made. The Government certainly do believe that more needs to be done to
develop our understanding of how the packaging of tobacco products
influences smoking by both adults who seek to quit and young people,
and we will keep tobacco packaging under close review.</div>
<a name="09062586000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my brief
remarks, I should like to focus on the issue of evidence. There is some
evidence that branding on cigarette packs may increase brand awareness
among young people but it is not conclusive. It is also difficult to
separate the impact of large, brightly lit tobacco displays from that
of brand packaging. Both can convey, incorrectly, that smoking is
normal, popular and attractive. While there is also evidence to suggest
that branding on packs may mislead customers about the relative safety
of different tobacco products, that too is very limited. No studies
have been undertaken to show that plain packaging of tobacco would cut
smoking uptake among young people or enable those who want to quit to
do so. Given the impact that plain packaging would have on intellectual
property rights, we would undoubtedly need strong and convincing
evidence of the benefits to health, as well as its workability, before
this could be promoted and accepted at an international
level&#151;especially as no country in the world has introduced plain
packaging.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div><a name="09062586000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we
consider it premature at this stage to take these powers, we are
committed to developing the evidence that is necessary to see whether
this policy could change behaviour and protect young people from the
tobacco industry&#146;s marketing and zeal. The Government policy
will develop further and the necessary changes will be made if and when
appropriate. I hope that, in light of the commitment I have given on
the Government&#146;s behalf&#151;to develop the evidence on plain
packaging and keep the issue of tobacco packaging under
review&#151;the hon. Lady will feel able not to press new clause
10.</div><a name="09062586000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000603"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> That was quite a brief reply. There was not much
to get my teeth into. It occurs to me that somebody has to be the first
and if we all sit around waiting for somebody else to do it, we will
never get anywhere.</div>
<a name="09062586000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
made an interesting point when she said that it is difficult to
separate the impact of large, brightly lit displays from the impact of
pack design. By implication, the Minister seemed to be admitting that
the displays are part of the problem. Obviously, it would be useful if
there were an all-party consensus with regard to measures the
Government will take. On the Opposition Benches, we have raised
concerns about a complete under-the-counter supply of tobacco products.
Is there not a case for a compromise that further restricts the way
that products can be displayed and addresses some of those concerns,
but also addresses the concerns of businesses, such as small
newsagents, who fear a rapid overnight change? They do not fear the
changes in the longer term; they are quite happy to see the sales die
out then, but will find it hard to cope with the sudden
change.</div>
<a name="09062586000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000604"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> The hon. Lady has raised the point, so perhaps I
might give an assurance that it will be a number of years before
smaller shops have to comply. Bigger shops will have to comply first,
and we are working very closely with the representative organisations
to set minds at rest. I also wrote recently to all Members of
Parliament with all this information, and am happy to provide further
information.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000605"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I thank the Minister, but in the short term is
there there not a case for putting an end to some of the flashy
displays that act as a promotion device in themselves? I shall withdraw
the proposed new clause now and reflect on what might be a different
approach on Report, but there is an interest in the House in discussing
as many ways as possible of tackling this problem. We may disagree on
some of the fine detail, but most people are committed to reducing
smoking and, ultimately, to saving lives. I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000606"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second time.</div>
<a name="09062586000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause proposes to decriminalise pharmaceutical errors, so that single
dispensing mistakes are treated in the same way as errors in other
medical professions. It is grossly disproportionate that errors
committed by pharmacists are automatically deemed criminal offences,
when those of doctors and other medical professionals are
not.</div>
<a name="09062586000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reasons
for moving this clause are twofold. First, the criminalisation of
pharmaceutical errors stems from antiquated legislation that bears
little relevance to modern pharmaceutical practices. The Medicines Act
1968 has not been adjusted to accommodate the progress made in
pharmaceutical services over the past 40 or so years. Secondly, the
legislation fits rather uncomfortably with the Government&#146;s
intention to expand the role of the pharmacist to include enhanced
services such as smoking cessation clinics. If pharmacists are to take
on increased responsibilities that extend their contact with patients,
they should be entitled to the same safeguards as the medical
profession.</div>
<a name="09062586000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that the Minister will be well aware of the history and background to
all this&#151;the representations to the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society, in particular in the case of Elizabeth Lee who, despite doing
all the right things in trying to atone for her mistake, none the less
ended up with a prison sentence. Most dispensing will take place where
humans have to make the final decisions about the counting and handing
out of medications, so human error will be a factor.</div>
<a name="09062586000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, the
Minister will be aware that early-day motion 1561 has been tabled and
has attracted a number of signatures. Therefore, in the context of the
positive role of pharmacists, I hope that the Minister will be able to
look favourably on this proposed clause. I think the Government are
already signalling that they want to move in this direction, and we
have long had the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
While the Government are consolidating and reviewing the legislation,
this clause&#151;with these positive signs of potential
change&#151;gives the Minister an opportunity to take prompt action.
I hope that he will therefore support it.</div>
<a name="09062586000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000607"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I need to declare an interest, being a pharmacist
by profession. This proposed new clause is well meant, and I do not
envy the Minister having this issue on his desk. It is useful that so
many Members have signed EDM 1561, showing general support for this.
Elizabeth Lee now has a suspended sentence; she did not go to jail. She
made a single error; the problem was not so much that it was
catastrophic but, more fundamentally, that having discovered that she
had made an error, she got in touch with the patient and found that
they had been taken to hospital.</div>
<a name="09062586000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court
case found that there was absolutely no interrelationship between the
dispensing error and the patient&#146;s ultimate death. Nevertheless,
due to existing legislation, the judge felt duty-bound to give the
woman a suspended sentence. Not to put too fine a point on it,
Elizabeth Lee has withdrawn from the pharmaceutical register and will
never practise as a pharmacist again. Her career is in ruins.</div>
<a name="09062586000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, at
the heart of the matter is also a patient safety issue. When a mistake
is made or nearly made, that mistake can be learned from. Mistakes are
often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>picked up before they do any harm or the patient takes the medicine, and
most chemists have some mechanism for reporting such errors. I can
recall working for a company that introduced error reporting. Everybody
was suspicious at first, but it then became apparent that there were a
couple of common errors that everybody was making, and changes were
made that had a big impact on reducing the number of
mistakes.</div>
<a name="09062586000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the case of Elizabeth Lee is that it has made every pharmacist
frightened of admitting to an error, so we stand to lose such learning
experiences. There may be occasions in future when products become
mixed up. People in such situations are only human. If the current
anomaly is allowed to continue, we will go back a stage, because people
will not be open and honest. That is ultimately a bigger danger to the
patient than the potential consequences of amending the legislation,
despite the concerns in some quarters about doing
so.</div>
<a name="09062586000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000608"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> There is a problem, but the clause is not
the place to resolve it. The Government recognise the concerns that the
provision in the Medicines Act 1968 could lead to the criminal
prosecution of pharmacists who make a single error in dispensing
medicine to a patient, and I know that the issue has caused concerns to
pharmacy professional
bodies.</div><a name="09062586000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are, however, circumstances in which sanctions should be available when
the requirement to sell only medicines that are</div>
<a name="09062586000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of the nature
or quality demanded by the purchaser&#148;</div>
<a name="09062586000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">is seriously and
knowingly contravened. The sanction may, for example, be used to
protect against the sale of medicines to the public that are clearly
counterfeit or have been adulterated. We must ensure that the Act
provides sufficient enforcement powers and sanctions to deal with such
serious risks to public health, so I cannot accept the new
clause.</div>
<a name="09062586000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, some
change to the law is necessary to ensure that cases of genuine clinical
error, such as dispensing the wrong medicine without a degree of
culpability, are dealt with proportionately. A full review of the
Medicines Act 1968 is already under way by the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency, the Department of Health agency responsible
for medicines regulation. The review will include consideration of
possible changes to the law to clarify the issue. The MHRA is working
closely with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and other stakeholders to
ensure that the law provides the necessary safeguards for the public
while being proportionate in dealing with instances of clinical
error.</div><a name="09062586000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
chief pharmacist appeared before the all-party pharmacy group on 16
June to discuss that very issue, as did the presidents of the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society, the Pharmacists&#146; Defence Association and
the National Pharmacy Association. They all agreed that a detailed
examination of the legislation was needed, coupled with an exploration
with the Crown Prosecution Service whether guidance could be issued in
the interim on how to proceed with potential cases. Indeed, the
president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said
that</div><a name="09062586000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
should not rush to replace poor regulation with on-the-hoof
regulation&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062586000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">The review of
the Medicines Act 1968 provides the opportunity to work with the full
range of stakeholders

it absolutely clear that a change in the law is needed. I take
seriously the view that moving from poor legislation to on-the-hoof
legislation could carry more risk. I am sure that the fact that he has
made that commitment will be of some comfort to pharmaceutical
professionals as well as those who represent them and those who signed
early-day motion 1561. I would simply urge the Minister to proceed with
speed in the area. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

new Minister said they will come forward with that later in the year,
and nicotine replacement is a very important part of that. A lot of
nicotine replacement is on prescription now, and I want to ensure that
much of that is generic, so that the taxpayer gets value for money. I
also want manufacturers to address nicotine addiction with the strength
of the replacement. All too often I hear of people on nicotine
replacement having, it seems, to chew gum all day to get anywhere near
the level of nicotine addiction that they have from their smoking
habit.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000611"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I am slightly confused by the amendment. I believe
that a lot of nicotine replacement therapy is already available. There
are a number smoking cessation schemes around the country that were
introduced by the
Government.</div><a name="09062586000386"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000612"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> Yes, there are a number but they are
scattered&#151;a scattergun approach is probably the best way to
describe it. Certain parts of the country get a lot of help and others
get very little. There needs to be national strategy. There also needs
to be a self-help element. I was dismayed recently when I spoke to one
of the large retailers. It wanted to put nicotine replacement items up
next to cigarettes in case people went in to buy cigarettes
but&#151;on impulse&#151;thought, &#147;I should really give
up.&#148; The retailer was precluded from doing that, and the
Minister should address such matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div><a name="09062586000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nicotine
replacement is an expensive&#151;but a key&#151;part of smoking
cessation. We should encourage as many people as possible to give up
smoking. I want the Minister to bring together the key stakeholders
before 21 July 2009, as the new clause states. If that date is not
suitable, will she give me an idea of when that might
happen?</div><a name="09062586000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000613"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> It has been a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Key. I appreciate that the hon. Member for
Hemel Hempstead has made it clear that this is a probing new clause. I
can confirm that the Government already have a code of practice in
place for consultation. They already provide guidance on how to conduct
consultations on policies, so I am glad the hon. Gentleman has
indicated that the amendment is not
needed.</div><a name="09062586000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is true that much progress has been made, but many respondents to our
consultation indicated that they want to see nicotine replacement
therapy made more easily and cheaply available. I can confirm,
therefore, that we are considering our future approach to the matter
and how we can support people to quit smoking, more broadly, as part of
our tobacco control strategy. We are consulting with experts on smoking
cessation about the range of policies needed, and that will include
nicotine replacement therapy. I hope, with that reassurance, the hon.
Gentleman will confirm that he will not press new clause
12.</div>

certain written evidence already reported to the House be appended to

to the
House.</div><a name="09062586000395"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000615"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I thank you, Mr. Key, and
Mr. O&#146;Hara, for your expert chairmanship of the
Committee. I also thank our phantom Chair, Mr. Bercow, who
disappeared off to higher and greater things. It has been a good
humoured and constructive Committee and I thank the hon. Members for
Eddisbury, for Hemel Hempstead, and for Romsey. May I also particularly
thank my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln who has so ably taken
through a number of clauses&#151;especially on tobacco? I also thank
my Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for
Coventry, South and the officials. On a number of occasions, as we
began to speed through the proceedings, I was getting to areas that I
had not fully read before, shall we say, and I was able quickly to
grasp the essential arguments and deal with them, I hope competently,
due to the extremely competent and good briefing that I got. It was
clear and concise, and I thank the officials
concerned.</div><a name="09062586000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Clerk of the Committee, Mr. Stanton, and our Whip,
who has kept everyone, at least on the Government Benches, in order,
and also attempted to encourage Opposition Members to stay in order on
occasion. I am sure that the Conservative Whip deserves congratulation
on the speed of delivery too, on occasion.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>I also thank <i class="I">Hansard</i> Reporters and the Attendants. We have a Bill
in good state, and I am grateful to members of the Committee for
delivering
it.</div><a name="09062586000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000616"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I will be brief in reinforcing the thanks
that the Minister has given. I also thank him, because he had to pick
up the Bill and master it at great speed. He sought to answer our
questions with courtesy and clarity, and I think we have had a
constructive
discussion.</div><a name="09062586000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank all the outside bodies that have helped to inform our
deliberations, and in particular I pay tribute to their energy and
attempts. I wish to place on the record the tremendous support and work
that I have had from my researchers, Mr. Sam Barker and Ms
Jo Rossiter. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead
has had tremendous support from his researcher Mr. Paul
Harrison.</div><a name="09062586000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think all the members of the Committee need to be thanked for their
dedication to the Bill, not least my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel
Hempstead, who assisted me in leading on the Bill for the official
Opposition, our Whip, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Reading, East,
my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington for his experience and my hon.
Friend the Member for Isle of Wight for his insights.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div><a name="09062586000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">We thank the
Clerk, Mr. Stanton, as well as the Official Reporter, who I
know has had the most monumental struggle sorting out the
O&#146;Briens. I hope that she might be able to take the message back
that while the House style means that once the Christian name and the
surname have been put together, it should just be plain
&#147;Mr. O&#146;Brien&#148;, it might be helpful in
future that reference is to either &#147;Michael&#148; or
&#147;Stephen&#148;, depending on who is
speaking.</div><a name="09062586000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Doorkeepers and the Badge Messengers and above all, I thank
you, Mr. Key, and your predecessor last week, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. We realise now that we have had the benefit of you, that
it was perhaps not unhelpful that there was a Speaker&#146;s election
during the course of our
Committee.</div><a name="09062586000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062586000617"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> Very briefly, I would like to repeat all those
thanks. Without going through them all again, may I just say
&#147;ditto&#148;?</div><a name="09062586000403"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
put and agreed to.</i></div>
