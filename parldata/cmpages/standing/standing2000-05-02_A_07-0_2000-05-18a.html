<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. It might be convenient if the Ministers occupied the seats that are not immediately opposite the window. You will recall, Mr. O'Brien, that last Tuesday was a brilliant day outside. When I spoke to or was addressed by Ministers, it was impossible to see them—they appeared as black silhouettes, which was rather unpleasant because I like to see the person to whom I am talking or who is speaking to me. If it were convenient for Ministers to move seats, that would help all of us. I am sure that there would be no problems with passing notes from the desk. The problem occurred even when the curtains were lowered.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We shall pull the blinds down. I cannot tell Committee members where to sit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> On another point of order, Mr. O'Brien. You are an old hand in this place and I seek your guidance. Amendments to a clause can be scattered through 50 pages of the amendment paper and it can be hard to find the amendment to which one wants to refer. It would be much easier if I could load the amendments on to a lap-top computer—I could bring up the amendments when I wanted, which would save my, and the Committee's, time. We are now in the year 2000 and the Government are, I seem to recall, committed to modernisation. Will you, Mr. O'Brien, authorise Committee members to use such appliances, purely in pursuit of our agenda?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not in my power to give such an authorisation. The matter has been discussed and it was decided that the use of such equipment in Committee Rooms would not be allowed. This is a matter for the Modernisation Committee, which will no doubt consider it again. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it can be difficult to find one's way through the amendment paper. The Clerk can assist us in that regard, if we ask him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I am sorry for being difficult. I believe that the Chairman of the Modernisation Committee said that no electronic devices would be allowed in Committees. In light of that ruling, what is the status of pagers?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We shall have to make inquiries about that. We should make progress.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Discharge of functions:</center></H4>
mayor and cabinet executive
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 9, line 12, at end insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (v) by a committee of the authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 82, in clause 14, page 9, line 42, at end insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (v) a committee of the authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 83, in clause 15, page 10, line 43, at end insert,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (iii) by a committee of the authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> When my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) said that you were an old hand in the House, Mr. O'Brien, I am sure that he meant to be flattering and was referring to your experience of running Committees. The amendment, and those that are grouped with it, refer to clauses 13, 14 and 15—my right hon. Friend referred to such confusion in his second point of order.
<P>
In view of the Government's response on the committee system, which we discussed earlier this week and last week, I do not have great expectations for the amendments. However, I shall have one last go at showing that there is merit in some of the committee systems that councils operate. In his book on local government, Harold Laski, wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The committee system of English local government is a crucial safeguard against the easy tendency to centralisation which is the paralysis of effective self-government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Alas, as we found out, Ministers do not believe that committees are modern enough and, in most cases, want to do away with them.<P>

<P>
The amendments would add an additional option for the discharge of functions in the three models that are contained in clauses 13, 14 and 15. That would enable local authorities to take some executive decisions through existing committee-style arrangements or a committee of the whole authority. They will be subject to sections 15 to 17 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989.
<P>
The Minister for Local Government and the Regions, who is not with us today, cautioned on Second Reading that part of the reasoning for operating the proposed executive structures was the ability to take emergency decisions quickly and that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>some emergency decisions are taken by an officer without people receiving any prior knowledge. Such decisions do not receive scrutiny and they are not accountable. In future, emergency decisions will be taken by an executive, and they may need to be taken quickly on the day that a problem arises. In those circumstances, it would be difficult and might threaten the safety of children or other people if executives were not able to take decisions without having to give the three-days notice that is in the current arrangements. The aim is to achieve more open and accountable decision making—[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 211.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would still allow that, but would also allow executive decisions to be devolved to a committee structure if appropriate. That is not compulsory and is not being forced on councils; it merely gives them an additional option.
<P>
We have had great discussion about the role of back benchers, who will become second-class councillors. The beauty of the amendments is that they would give greater weight to back-bench councillors left outside the executive. It also gives an opportunity to bring in opposition parties who may not be represented by the normal executive models. Since the Bill already allows the mayor or leader of an authority to delegate certain functions to a committee of the executive, there is no reason in principle why they should not be delegated to a committee of the whole authority. If the Minister does not go along with the amendments, why does she object to that additional option—I stress that it is not a replacement, but an additional, option. A beneficial result of offering local authorities more discretion would be to obviate the need for the detailed and confusing regulations in which the Government propose what functions are or are not executive ones.
<P>
The amendments are helpful and merely offer additional choices—and hopefully greater importance to those poor back-bench councillors who are not deemed worthy of being part of the operative structures that the Government now want to impose on councils, whatever their reputations, up and down the country.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> The hon. Gentleman began his introduction of the amendments by being helpfully honest and straightforward and admitting that the amendments seek a reversion to a traditional committee system, or an option that would allow a reversion to such a system. He said—I am glad that he has got the point—that he did not expect the Government to accept that because he now understands why we want to change from the traditional committee system. It is all to do with transparency and accountability.
<P>
The amendments would again defuse and muddy the waters on where responsibility for particular decisions would lie. They would also pose a challenge to one of the basic principles of the Bill: the separation of executive decision-making and scrutiny roles. Under the Bill, members of the executive—in whatever form—can delegate their functions to area committees or joint committees, for example, but not to a committee that consists of both executive and scrutiny members or to a committee of the whole authority. The amendments would seek by stealth to drive a clear wedge between the executive and scrutiny functions and strike at the heart of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman does no service to councillors by describing their scrutiny functions under the Bill as second class. We have tried to make it clear that the executive decision-making and scrutiny roles are equally important: one role is an essential counterweight to the other. As for representing the views of local people and standing shoulder to shoulder with them, the scrutiny functions and holding the executive to account are as important as executive decision making, if not more so. The hon. Gentleman would be well advised to stop portraying those functions as second class.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): When the Under-Secretary talks about a member of the executive and a member of the scrutiny committee being the same, it is like her saying that a Minister is the same as a member of a Select Committee. They manifestly are not.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> That intervention was revealing. I did not say that the functions were the same. I said that they were equally important. They are clearly different functions, but in terms of the main objective of good governance—making good decisions and ensuring that they are clearly accountable and rigorously scrutinised— both roles are equally important and valid for local people. Clearly, the Opposition's intention is to strike at the heart of the separation of the executive and the scrutiny committee. We therefore cannot accept the amendment and I ask Opposition Members not to press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am not surprised by the Under-Secretary's answer. However, I still cannot understand her logic, which is that a small clique of executives is good, but that a larger number of councillors who may want to ask more questions and scrutinise delegated powers in a full committee is bad. ``Second class citizens'' is not a phrase that I have come up with; it is used repeatedly by councillors from all parties throughout the country who are, or who are about to be, not part of the executive. The hon. Lady is stretching incredulity by suggesting that they are equal in all respects.
<P>
Back benchers are not equal to members of the executive in terms of pay, or of the access that they will have to papers before their meetings. It is unclear whether back benchers are equal to members of the executive in terms of their access to officers of the council. Back Benchers are unequal in all respects. I am not saying that they are worse than members of the executive. They are not, but they are second-class citizens in terms of the powers and the resources available to them to undertake their job.

<P>

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, while those roles are different, he is confusing difference with inequality? It is feasible for members of a council to have different roles and functions and for those roles and functions to be equally valid and important in the whole structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not accept that. Members of the executive are being set on a higher plain in terms of pay, accessibility, resources, access to information and executive actions and availability to take emergency decisions. There is a world of difference. I am not the only one who has that feeling. I am one of only two members of the Committee who has not been a councillor, but experienced councillors throughout the country share my feelings.
<P>
If the amendments sought to replace the discharge of functions options—if amendment No. 81 were designed to wipe out the fourth option and replace it with the proposed new sub-paragraph (v)—the matter would be different. They do not; we merely seek to add a fifth option to clauses 13 and 14, and a third option to clause 15(2)(b). We want additional choice and additional ways whereby back-bench councillors can be put to more use if that is deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances of individual councils. That in no way seeks to strike at the whole ethos of the Bill—or whatever words the Under-Secretary used—of dividing the executive and scrutiny functions.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Where feasible and desirable in certain local circumstances, and as in existing structures, there should be a facility for the whole council to make executive decisions. For the first time in some councils, members from all parties would be able to have an input into executive functions. Councillors who have no role other than to sit on scrutiny committees would have some input into executive functions if the members of the executive deemed that appropriate at the time.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman forgotten that all councillors will have a role through the full council in determining policy and ensuring that it is implemented effectively?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> By the time matters come to full council, decisions have long since been made, so it all too often acts as a rubber stamp. Too often, deals are cut and dried by executives behind closed doors. I fear that the powers of full council meetings will be little more than a side show, and they will often be the only side shows to which press access is allowed. The great majority of Labour-controlled councils for areas that members of the Committee represent have chosen to hold their executive meetings in secret, which is telling.
<P>
We shall not press the amendment, as we are realistic about the mind set that the Government have imposed on additional choice in the Bill. It is a shame to see yet another example of the Government restricting choice rather than allowing it, simply because it happens to be part of the old committee system that they are so set against. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

leader and cabinet executive
<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 10, line 27, leave out second `executive'.
<P>
This is a technical drafting amendment that merely brings the wording in subsection (9) into line with the rest of the Bill. Following amendments to clause 12 in the other place, the Bill should no longer use the term ``executive functions''. The amendment merely ensures consistency.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Discharge of functions:</center></H4>
mayor and council manager executive
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 10, line 39, leave out `executive' and insert `council manager'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 129 to 135.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The amendments simply change the drafting of clause 15. They bring the way in which a council manager framework would work more into line with the policy stated in ``Local Leadership, Local Choice'' and other documents than was achieved by the original drafting. The purpose of that form of executive is a clear separation between policy development, which is for the mayor and the council, and implementation of policy, which is the responsibility of the council manger.
<P>
The council as a whole would appoint the council manager. He or she would be expected to be responsible for appointing all the staff, as well as being responsible for delivering the policy framework and the budget that has been agreed by the council. Amendment No. 130 makes it clear that he or she must have regard to the directly elected mayor's political steer. The mayor is the only other member of the executive, and his or her role is to give broad political guidance to the council manager. However, the council manager will be responsible for all the day-to-day decisions to implement that framework. The amendment would achieve that clear separation.
<P>
The mayor and the council manager are accountable for discharge of executive functions—the mayor is accountable through the ballot box, and through overview and scrutiny, while the council manager is accountable through overview and scrutiny and directly to the full council. The amendments would also ensure that the council manager could discharge functions himself or herself and delegate executive functions to another officer or, for example, to area committees, as in other forms of executive arrangements. In addition, he or she may choose functions to be discharged collectively by the executive—the mayor and the council manager. However, we would expect that to happen only in relation to the drawing up of the policy framework for submission to the full council, when, clearly, the mayor's political input would be necessary.
<P>
Such an arrangement operates internationally, and is a proven way of developing and implementing efficient and accountable delivery of services. The amendment would merely clarify the separation and the way in which the framework would work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her explanation. I want to return to a general point, which I have made before: such a model may operate in other countries, but conditions may be different there. That underlines the good sense of piloting certain options, although, in the context of this option, that may be academic.
<P>
As we have heard, the option under discussion relates to the discharge of functions by an executive—a mayor and a council manager. Currently, most authorities seem to regard the options in the Bill as a toss-up between a cabinet with a directly elected mayor and a cabinet with an indirectly elected council leader. The fact that local authorities have not yet shown interest in the council manager model does not mean that it should not be scrutinised closely by the Committee.
<P>
If I range slightly outside the amendments, it is on the basis that a clause stand part debate would not be necessary. In effect, the executive power will be concentrated in the hands of two people—the directly elected mayor and the council manager, who is appointed by the authority but is otherwise wholly unelected. He or she will be able to wield huge influence over a local authority's conduct, but has only a limited and indirect democratic mandate. One can imagine an authority that had such a structure—assuming that an authority would choose it—with a mayor of one political complexion and a council of another. As senior members of am authority tend to know which officials are friendly towards them, it is not unrealistic to envisage council members choosing as a manager an official who would act as a brake on the mayor. I appreciate that the situation, at the moment, belongs to the realm of fantasy. We would have to imagine that a total maverick became the directly elected mayor of a major city—someone who was completely outwith the control not only of the Government of the day but of one of the largest party groups on the elected body. That is a far-fetched scenario, but it could happen.
<P>
The guidance published by the Government suggests that the roles will be divided between policy and development, which will be exercised by the mayor and the council, and implementation, which will be the council manager's responsibility. The mayor's role would be—I quote from the second consultative draft—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to give broad political guidance to the council manager—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or, to use the Minister's words, to give a ``political steer''—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in line with his or her manifesto commitments and the policy framework agreed by the council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The council manager would be responsible to the full council, so there is a real danger of conflict of which the Bill does not take account. I refer back to the unlikely scenario of a mayor who was, politically, wholly out of sympathy with the rest of the elected members. What sort of invidious position could the council manager be placed in, given such a situation?
<P>
The regulations published last week offer some guidance to authorities on how to deal with that sort of conflict resolution problem. However, in the case of the council manager model, that fails to take account of the fact that the executive itself may have difficulty reaching agreement, as it will comprise two people. It is difficult to understand how a resolution could be reached if they fell out. As the mayor would be directly elected, he or she could not be removed; during debates on the Greater London Authority Bill, that was called the Mayor Barry scenario. If the council manager enjoyed the support of the authority as a whole, he or she would also be impervious to dismissal. Such problems may be academic because authorities do not seem terribly interested in the model that we are discussing. That underlines the restrictive nature of the choice offered to most authorities, which, in most cases, is a choice of one option. The question is also academic because it is so far-fetched that there could be such a maverick mayor, who was out of sympathy with the rest of the elected members.
<P>
I hope that the points that I have made are helpful. Although some of them are a little wide of the amendments, it helps the Committee not to make them again later.

<P>

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It is probably worth mentioning to the hon. Gentleman, although he dismisses the experience of other countries, that the system that we are discussing is not rare. It is universally and successfully used in New Zealand, whose legal system is similar to our own. The hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford) may wish to attest to that. Yes, he wants to speak—he cannot resist it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): The temptation was too great. I was sitting behind my hon. Friends on the Front Bench, thinking that the scene described was familiar. Time and again in New Zealand the public vote for a mayor of one political complexion and a council of the other. The scene is not as politicised there, because the country is smaller—the total population is only about three million—so to claim a similarity is stretching a point to the nth degree.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I expected the hon. Gentleman to give a more generous endorsement to a system that works well.
<P>
The main point that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) raised concerned the potential conflict within the system, which might be more difficult to resolve because the executive would consist of only two people. The Opposition seem to have difficulty handling the idea of political diversity in arrangements for councils. They seem mistrustful of the extent to which people of different political parties can be expected to work together constructively to take good decisions for those in their area. Councils will go in that direction as a result of the changes. It will be a sign of increasing political maturity. I have no great fears about the scenario referred to by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Clearly, it will raise issues of difference. The guidelines require each council to set out a mechanism in its constitution for resolving conflict or differences if they cannot be resolved through normal channels. We expect such mechanisms to be developed under the proposed framework.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We are back to the guidance. Can the Under-Secretary give us a more practical illustration of the way in which she would like the mechanism to be developed? If a conflict occurs, especially one that boils down to two individuals—it is not as if one would go for the majority view—what mechanism could apply? How could it work in practice?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> That is for local councils to determine. I should have thought that they would establish in advance in their constitution a mechanism involving other members of the council in order to try to work towards resolution. The hon. Gentleman dismisses the guidance as if it were not valid, but councils have much welcomed its extensive detail and the fact that we consulted on it so much, and have taken cognisance of the arguments. In chapter 2, page 13 of the guidance, there is an illustrative example of such a mechanism and how it might work. I am loath to read out something that the hon. Gentleman can read for himself; if he looks at the guidance, he will see that there is an example of a process involving other members of the council and the council itself that might be applied. There may also be other variants. I hope that he will accept that we have given thought to such matters. There are some examples and pointers in the guidance about how councils can develop local mechanisms for determining conflict resolutions. I hope, therefore, that he supports the amendment to allow a provision that extends choice and options to councils.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 286, in page 11, line 17, leave out

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The amendment brings us to the interesting matter of area committees, their functions and, more importantly, how their powers will be delegated to them. It would enable a council that has decided to set up area committees as part of the development of its constitution to determine their powers.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that, under clause 34, we shall be debating the development of a constitution for the local authority. It begins with the inspiringly grammatical phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A local authority which are operating executive arrangements—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
no doubt, amendments will be tabled in due course to correct the provision's grammar—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>must prepare and keep up to date a document (referred to in this section as their constitution) which contains . . . such information with respect to the discharge of their functions (including functions which are the responsibility of the executive) as the Secretary of State may direct.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is simply that the council's constitution will require it to set out the delegation of functions, such as decision-making powers, to bodies. That includes the issues that we debated under earlier clauses. The council as a whole, rather than the executive, will vote on and agree the constitution. That is appropriate. If the council determined to have area committees under the constitution, it would be fitting for the council as a whole, rather than the executive or its individual members, to decide what functions should be delegated to those committees. Many functions can be passed on to individuals as we have debated.
<P>
A council might decide that it wants to have area committees as part of its constitution. The mayor could say that that was good, but that he had decided that the committees would be given nothing to do. That situation strikes me as nonsense. If we believe—rightly, in my view—that the establishment of the constitution and the delegation of functions should be in the hands of the council as a whole, it should also be for the council as a whole to decide what functions are to be conducted by area committees.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will use her response to say more about the Government's thinking on area committees and the inter-relationship between them and the area bodies that will be responsible for aspects of planning. There was confusion on that issue in our deliberations during the second sitting on Tuesday. Unfortunately, because Hansard is not yet to hand, I have not been able to check the precise words. It might be helpful to have something further on the record on that issue.
<P>
The broad principle of the amendments is clear. I could see that the hon. Member for Mole Valley was working himself up to intervene and was continuing to give him a chance to do so. He is now taking the opportunity.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am falling back on the discussion on the previous group of amendments and the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. I am tempted to wonder whether a wooden spoon has been used with the amendments. One can envisage there being a mayor of one political complexion, a council of another and, as there was in Tower Hamlets, a mixture of area committees. There could be disaster and stagnation in important areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman tempts me to go back over deliberations on the earlier part of the Bill. The Conservative party would have found considerable support from the Liberal Democrat Benches had some of the amendments been moved. We have moved on, but at least we have one opportunity to ensure that the complication described by the hon. Gentleman is avoided by ensuring that the council as a whole—with the balance of political complexion that the electorate has determined to give it—decides what area committees should and should not do. In doing that, councils may take into account the political complexion that the area committees might have.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's intent. He has relentlessly pursued the issue of area committees, area forums or whatever they might be called.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister implied that area committees and area forums are different names for the same thing. Anyone who reads the record of our deliberations will gain the same impression. She will be well aware that they are very different and have the different functions that are laid out in the Bill. Those functions are also extensively described in the guidance, which I was reading with great enthusiasm late last night.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I understand that they are different, but I also accept that the nomenclature that is given within a particular local authority constitution may be different simply because the authority wants to express its difference. I know that the hon. Gentleman would approve of that. I understand what he is seeking to achieve, but I am sure that he will not be surprised when I say that he should think again.
<P>
Area committees will be able to discharge both executive and non-executive functions because those functions are dealt with in the same committee at an area level. However, the purpose of the amendment runs contrary to the fundamental principle that underpins part II, which is that local people should know who is responsible for the decisions that affect their lives. A separate executive must be accountable and seen to be accountable for all decisions taken in respect of functions for which it is responsible by virtue of the legislation.
<P>
I am sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman that his amendment would cut across that principle. If the council could decide to delegate executive functions to area committees against the executive's wishes, how could the executive be said to be accountable for those functions? How would those dealing with the council know whom to hold to account for those decisions? On the one hand, legislation would say that those functions were the responsibility of the executive, while on the other hand people would be told that the executive had little or no role in the exercise of the functions. Such a situation would cloud accountability and create confusion.
<P>
The amendments also fail to take account of real circumstances on the ground, which we are all trying to explore and imagine. In the great majority of councils, the executive will consist of leading members from either the majority group, the ruling coalition—I am not sure whether we should call it that, but I am referring to a situation in which there is no overall control—or, where there is no formal administration, from each of the main parties reflecting the political balance of the council. The members of the executive will, therefore, be the main policy makers in the council. If council policy is to have area committees, it is likely that those members will have been instrumental in forming that policy, so they will want to delegate particular powers to area committees. However, it is right that when the legislation says that the executive is responsible for particular functions, it should include responsibility for how those functions are discharged. I hope that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of those comments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) mentioned area planning committees earlier in our deliberations, as he pointed out. I am happy to restate what I said then: nothing other than existing statutory limitations prevents councils from delegating to area committees any functions that are not the responsibility of the executive, including development control. Planning, including development control, is outside the issues in question and such functions will continue to be subject to exactly the same statutory framework as they are now. I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds those remarks helpful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response on planning. I hope that we may have the opportunity to return to the subject when I have had the chance to reflect on what she said.
<P>
I said from a sedentary position that I was shocked by the Minister's decision not to accept the amendments. That was said tongue in cheek. It would have been disingenuous for me to have meant it, because that is what I expected her to say. At one point I was a little confused, but I understand the broad thrust of what the right hon. Lady suggests. I am firmly of the view that the council as a whole should decide what functions and responsibilities should be delegated to area committees. The Minister prefers to leave that in the hands of a relatively small number of people—the executive—or even in the hands of one individual. I believe that to be wrong.
<P>
If the council as a whole is to be allowed to establish area committees, but one councillor can decide not to give those committees any responsibilities, that is nonsense; it is not local democracy. The Minister will have to live with her decision. I assume that we are likely to return to the subject. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 11, line 26, after second `committee' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or sub-committee'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 137 and amendment No. 56, in page 11, line 28, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and which satisfies other conditions as may be specified,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Amendment No. 136 is a technical amendment, which ensures that regulations made under clause 17 may make provision to enable the executive to delegate to area committees, which are sub-committees of the council rather than full committees. I hope that the Committee will agree that there is nothing particularly controversial about the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 completes the definition of area committee, to make it broadly the same as the definition in existing legislation. The additional conditions to be included in the definition are as follows: first, the area covered by the area committee should be not more than two fifths of the area of the authority; secondly, the population of the area covered by the committee, as estimated by the authority, should not be more than two fifths of the population of the authority, also as measured by the authority; and, thirdly, the members of an area committee are members for electoral divisions or wards wholly or partly contained within the area covered by the committee.
<P>
I stress again that this provision is the same as the current legislative definition of an area committee. Amendment No. 137 merely tidies up the provision in subsection 17(3). As the full definition will be included in the Bill, the amendment would remove the ability of the Secretary of State to specify further conditions in regulations. Amendment No. 56 would remove the Secretary of State's ability to specify further conditions, but amendment No. 137 makes it unnecessary. I ask the hon. Member for Eastbourne not to press it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I appreciate that the Minister seeks to incorporate existing provisions into the Bill. However, we are moving to a different scenario in terms of political geometry. It is therefore worth reflecting on whether the provisions are sensible and whether they relate to local circumstances.
<P>
We are talking about estimates of population being made by the local authority, which ought to know how many people live within its boundaries. The number should not have to be estimated, for heaven's sake—the local authority should know pretty well how many people live there. In fact, they do not seem to. I have been seeking information for the past half hour from Harrogate on the distribution of population within its boundaries, but the non-availability of immediate electronic measures makes it difficult for me to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman remotely surprised that he is having difficulty obtaining information from Harrogate given his remarks about the town only two weeks ago?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I do not recall the remarks I made, but I expect they were born of my long experience of dealing with the local authority. Indeed, the local authority has dealt closely with me in expressing its hostility to the legislation. Harrogate is a strongly Liberal Democrat council and is wholly opposed to the Government's proposals, as the hon. Gentleman will know.
<P>
What concerns me is that the provisions may not correspond to the actual geography and characteristics of an area. I return to the example of my own part of the world, Craven. Craven is a tiny authority with a population of just over 50,000. Fourteen thousand people live in Skipton, which is about 27 per cent. of the population of Craven. Several thousand people live in the area between Skipton and the Bradford metropolitan borough boundary, toward Keighley. A large part of the population live in rural areas. There is a wide rural hinterland in the Pennines from Skipton to the Cumbrian border—a significant part of which is national park. The characteristics of that area north of Skipton are homogenous: upland territory, characterised by farming and tourism. There are no basic differences between the activities in Gargrave, Settle and Bentham, for example.
<P>
If Craven decided on a system of area committees, there would be some logic in making one of Skipton, which already has a town council—a parish council in legislative competence—and perhaps adding the area down to the Bradford met boundary because that has many of the characteristics of Skipton. The rural area of Craven could be treated as another. That would be logical, particularly as Craven is a small council. The wards are large, however, the characteristics of the rural area are fairly consistent throughout the district's area. That would not be possible under the legislation. I do not think that makes sense.
<P>
If local authorities are to have area committees, they should be allowed to decide on a rational area either in terms of population, economic characteristics or geography—particularly in my constituency, which is a bit like Belgium in the sense that we have the Pennine area. Effectively, there are two constituencies in my constituency: the Craven area that is west of the Pennines and the area looking toward the Vale of York. Communications are predominantly north-south in both. I know to my cost that crossing the Pennines in winter is sometimes hardly fun.
<P>
What about the fact that area committee members must be representatives for that area? Again, I do not think that that makes sense. Use must be made of the available expertise, especially on a small council. One Craven councillor has long experience as a livestock convenor for the National Farmers Union, so he knows intimately the problems that farmers face at the moment, which are serious on the uplands. Would he not be able to sit on both area committees if two area committees—one Bentham-based and one Settle-based—were created in Craven? His expertise would be extremely useful on both. What about someone who is an expert in small tourist businesses? You will know, Mr. O'Brien, that in my constituency small tourist businesses are important.
<P>
Another sector, which is perhaps a hidden industry in the countryside, is the care of the elderly. In all the larger villages in my constituency, two or three of the larger 19th century houses are in the business of caring for the elderly. That industry has its own particular difficulties, which require a particular understanding and expertise. Would not a councillor, who genuinely understands that industry's problems and is able to relate them to council business, be able to sit on more than one area committee if his or her ward is not contained wholly within an area or does not straddle an area? There are some serious difficulties because the provision might defy common sense. I hope that the Minister will understand that because I am sure that her constituency shares many common characteristics with mine, which is a widely scattered rural area. The right hon. Lady even though there are strong local particularities, the economic and social underpinning across a large part of a constituency is similar and does not necessarily lend itself to the 40 per cent. definition.
<P>
The other potential difficulty is that it would be possible for an area committee to have an entirely different political complexion to the main council. Craven, for example, has no Labour councillors, so the problem does not arise there. There are now a large number of independent candidates, most of whom have fled from the Liberal Democrat party. That happened in Tower Hamlets, which covers an extremely urban area, where there were acute problems.
<P>
The Minister says that this is a technical measure, which simply transposes into new legislation provisions from older legislation, but will she set that against a wider background of what the new legislation seeks to achieve, which is to make area committees more competent and to give them a wider range of responsibilities? That is a much stronger version of devolution than the somewhat half-hearted area committees that have been established until now. It might be worth while considering whether the Minister is constraining a necessary flexibility on the part of the council with measures that she claims are technical. Strictly speaking, they are technical because they transfer one set of rules into a new statute but, in practical terms, I wonder whether they really contribute to helping local authorities to be flexible, sensible and pragmatic in running their areas.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. However, I believe that the legislation suggests that 40 per cent. of an area can be represented on an area committee. If we move much further than that, the main purpose of the council will be substituted and the strength of the area committee will be lost. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that it will be possible to co-opt on to the committee experts without voting rights, who can share their experience and add to the committee. Those councillors, of whose knowledge and understanding the hon. Gentleman was extolling the virtues, would be able to contribute in that way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Instead of having the double 40 per cent., would the right hon. Lady consider having 40 per cent. defined by area or 40 per cent. defined by population, whichever is the more convenient and sensible for the council?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Throughout the Committee, we have been pushed to do things that people understand and representations to that effect have not been made by local government. Local government representatives seem to think that they can live with the current regulations for area committees. The right hon. Gentleman's population estimates were a little churlish. The population is reasonably stable in constituencies such as that of the right hon. Gentleman, and in my own. Yesterday in my constituency, a couple of people died and I am sure that some were born, which might have evened things out. That is going on every year. Our population knowledge is based on periodic counts that end up as estimates. We do not go around counting everyone in an area. The Bill refers to estimates because that is how population is counted. Population will vary from day to day—although perhaps not by much—but we do not want to complicate matters.
<P>
I have been handed a note and I want to ensure that I properly represent what has happened. One representation was received last week at official level from someone in Yorkshire. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has been encouraging people from Craven to lobby the Department on this matter. I apologise for saying that we received no representations.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I may commit many sins, but I am not an agent provocateur. I have encouraged no one to make representations, partly because I know from long experience that they are unlikely to receive a positive response.
<P>
I am aware of the population patterns in my constituency. A small council, such as Craven, that has a mixed political complexion with a lot of independents, will find it difficult to make the Bill work. It would help if we could add some flexibility. For example, a local authority could have a coherent region in its district that was suitable to form an area committee but which was 5 per cent. over the 45 per cent. threshold. Would the Minister entertain such an exception if a local authority could make a sensible case?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I would certainly be prepared to consider that. This is not about being fundamentalist or ideological. I would, however, resist a council that wants to use other means—such as area committees—to bring back a committee system instead of holding to the spirit of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> May I assure the Minister that my remarks are not intended to undermine the Government's purpose? I am simply considering the practicalities of a large, widely scattered rural area that has a handful of concentrated urban settlements. If the Minister will say that she will reflect on this matter—I have seen the first glimmer of a concession—and table an amendment that will allow a local authority to make representations when circumstances show that the alternative would artificially slice the area, that would be a small gain. Indeed, it would be a sensible and pragmatic approach. I acknowledge that I am capable of sinister plots, but this is not one of them.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I thought that I had a reputation for being flexible. I will consider the one representation that has been made to the Department. Although I would say that all parts of my constituency in the north Pennines have similar characteristics, I know that local people think that the upper end of the dale is very different from the lower end. That is probably true of all our constituencies. The important consideration is how we get area committees to mean something to local people and not just to the politicians on the authority. Once again, we are trying to enable people at local level to feel that their locality is properly understood by, and reflected in, the council. If councils are to move towards an area-based system, they must take that into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If I may adduce another argument to help the Minister in her struggle towards flexibility, she will know that the Government have introduced various regional bodies, the most obvious of which is the Regional Development Agency. However, in several major policy areas, the emphasis is placed on rural development plans. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is contemplating closing several of its regional service centres. We shall have to look more strategically—a word consistently used by the Government—into how policies are applied.
<P>
When rural development programmes are being considered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Regional Development Agency and other bodies, an area such as the north Pennines will be viewed as a whole. Similarly, the rural area covered by the Minister's constituency will be viewed as a whole. Surely it makes sense for local authorities to design structures that are most compatible with the application of policies. The Minister should not confuse local particularity or local character with the broad economic underpinnings of an area, which are likely to display similarities. That is another reason for her to exemplify the characteristic of flexibility, which she has recently revealed to us.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman tempts me back into the discussion, though I had finished. His point takes him further away from the flexibility that I was offering, because it would grant area committees a role that is not intended in this or previous legislation. The council has to act strategically, represent and take decisions relating to regional bodies. Despite the right hon. Gentleman's churlishness, I am not going to follow that line. I am prepared to examine it further, but his most recent argument has not helped his case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister misinterprets what I said. My argument is that a local authority can put in place the geometry that most accurately reflects the characteristics of the district. My point about rural policies was not to attribute executive functions to these committees but to ensure that they are able to identify the areas and matters that would lend themselves most readily to a regional strategy. That could best be done if areas are rationally defined according to topographical, geographical, demographic and economic characteristics rather than arbitrarily defined because of limits incorporated in the legislation. My argument is nothing more complicated than that.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 164, 165 and 167.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I thought that the amendments would be uncontroversial, but in the light of the previous comments made by the hon. Member for Bath, I am not sure that he will agree with them. The amendments will ensure that the drafting of the Bill is grammatically consistent throughout, and that the term ``local authority'' is always treated in the plural. The hon. Member for Bath felt that that was the wrong approach and wanted ``is'' instead of ``are'', but the amendments will use ``are'' consistently throughout the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary is right to suggest that it is appropriate to have consistency throughout the Bill. Nevertheless the Committee would be interested to know whether she is happy with the bowdlerisation of the English that she wants us to support. If she is, does she agree that all references to councils in the guidance material that she has prepared should be in the plural? Does she believe that all references to an executive and a committee should be made in the plural? I agree with her on consistency, but is she happy with what she is doing to the English language?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The problem that we face is that there is no consistency in the statute book on whether collective nouns such as ``authority'', ``people'' or indeed ``government'' should be singular or plural. The hon. Gentleman will be familiar with the fact that Hansard uses the plural for ``Government'' and other collective nouns. In that sense, we have taken ``authority'' to be similar to ``Government'' and have adopted the conventions in Hansard. The guidance is a completely different matter. Local authorities will clearly not want us to go through the guidance and change all the verbs. They will be much more interested in the content. We have had to make a decision to achieve consistency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Lady drew our attention to the fact that there is inconsistency throughout rafts of legislation over many years. She has a choice to make. She can either have ``a council is'' or ``a council are'', but she cannot claim that consistency is being applied to legislation going back aeons. She is merely talking about consistency in this Bill. My question to her is simple. Is she happy with what she is doing to the English language?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I tried to make it clear that, in the light of the situation that we face in statute, we must make a decision and present the Bill in the best possible way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Is the hon. Lady happy with it?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I am coming to that. These amendments suggest a way forward that makes the Bill internally consistent. I am, therefore, happy that this is the best way forward. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> When I got up at some ridiculous hour this morning, I had no intention of participating in this debate. However, this is a classic instance of the minutiae that obsess the Liberal Democrats. For once, I think that the Under-Secretary has got it right. She is doing her best. There is the famous story of Winston Churchill scribbling in the margin of an official briefing document, ``This is the sort of English up with which I will not put''. We all know that there are pedants in our midst—there are even one or two on this Committee—but, unusually, on this occasion I support the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Speaking as a pedant, I am astonished by all this. The Bill was produced and went through pre-legislative scrutiny, all its stages in another place and Second Reading. It comes here and what are the Government doing? They are amending ``is'' to ``are''. The Bill has survived all this time with that internal inconsistency, so the sudden mania for grammatical Stalinism is astonishing. It is also a pity, because I thought that the Bill was all about flexibility and different systems for different circumstances. I am wholly happy with a Bill that uses ``is'' and ``are'' interchangeably. As a journalist, I am much happier saying, ``the Government is'' and ``the council is''. The Ripon Gazette and Boroughbridge Herald does not say, ``Harrogate council are'' or ``Craven council are,'' and I do not understand why we do not use the language of most ordinary citizens.

One must draw distinctions. It would stretch the point to say that the guidance uses ordinary language. Some people would rather wait for the film version. However, I find the amendment curious. Why does one need internal consistency? Does it make any difference to a lawyer? Will anybody initiate a judicial review because the Bill contains ``is'' instead of ``are''? What on earth is all the hoo-hah about? Let us get on with the serious business and leave the Bill as it stands.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 140 and 141.

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I hesitate to say that these are technical amendments, but they are. Amendments Nos. 139 and 140 ensure that regulations made under the clause can include provision similar to that in section 101(2) of the Local Government Act 1972. The amendments allow a joint committee to which executive functions have been delegated to further delegate down to its own sub-committees or officers. Joint committees can do that under current legislation, and the amendments will retain that capability for the future.
<P>
Amendment No. 141 will ensure that a committee of the executive, as well as the executive or a member of the executive, cam appoint persons to represent the authority on a joint committee. The amendment brings subsection (2)(f) in line with the rest of the clause—not least subsection (2)(e)—and corrects an omission from subsection (2)(f).

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I hope that you, Mr. O'Brien, are happy with my intention to make general points while dealing with the amendments, to try to avoid a stand part debate, and I hope that that helps the Committee.
<P>
Clause 20 is an important part of the Bill, because it deals with the overview and scrutiny of the executive. The Government have tried to argue that the present Committee system does not afford adequate scrutiny of council decisions. On Second Reading, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no opportunity within the status quo legitimately to pursue scrutiny.—[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 208.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Two issues should be flagged up. That comment signals the rigidity of the Government's approach to the Bill from start to finish, or from top to bottom, in the patois we use in Committee. It simply does not allow for flexibility. Whether it constitutes Stalinism in the use of the word ``is'' or ``are'' or in a more serious sense, that remains true. It is wrong to suggest that existing structures provide no proper scrutiny and that the proposed new structures would guarantee good scrutiny.
<P>
We heard briefly about the system in Wiltshire. I am indebted to Councillor Peter Chalke CBE, leader of Wiltshire county council, for explaining in various recent articles—[Interruption.] I do not know why that causes hilarity among Ministers. Wiltshire has what might be regarded as a version of the traditional committee system, but scrutiny, too. In a recent article in the Conservative councillors' magazine, Input, which I recommend to Ministers, Peter Chalke says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government wants to force us into a different model where the majority of elected councillors would play no part in executive decisions outside meetings of the Council itself. That would be a change for the worse.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We agree. He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It might deter people from standing for election as councillors. It could close off public access to County Council affairs. The result would be a poorer quality of democracy rather than the improvement for which the Government hopes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also explains how Wiltshire currently operates:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The key is a clear separation of roles for County Councillors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All councillors will continue as now to fulfil a role as a community leader and representative. All councillors will also have an opportunity to participate as decision makers in one or possibly two committees. But some councillors will also become scrutinisers in a far more meaningful way than ever before, for the Government is right in identifying this area as in need of strengthening.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, someone who is experienced in local government and leads a substantial county council recognises that we need to do more about scrutiny, which is the Government's declared aim, but believes that it is perfectly possible to meet that aspiration in the existing committee system.
<P>
Mr. Chalke points out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Wiltshire has . . . created two new Scrutiny sub-committees. Their members will be responsible for scrutinising decisions in which they were not involved . . . One of the sub-committees scrutinises Social Services and Education committees; the other scrutinises Policy and Resources and Environment and Transport committees. The members who serve on Scrutiny sub-Committees are not eligible for membership of the committees whose work they are scrutinising.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister is clearly aware of the Wiltshire experiment, because she referred to it in one of our earlier debates. Given that the Government entirely oppose piloting, I would hope that as others have taken it on themselves to carry out perfectly sensible experiments in local government, the Minister would at least have deputed some of her officials to talk to Councillor Chalke and investigate how the experiment is working in practice.
<P>
Before I move on from the general point that washes through almost all the amendments to the clause, I refer to a letter in ``Local Government First'' from Councillor Lesley Whittaker, an independent member of Devon county council. She says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I read with dismay the interview with Hilary Armstrong about the local government bill . . . She remains profoundly out of touch with the experience of those who have tried to implement the new structures. To concentrate power in the hands of a maximum of 10 people in any council area however ``efficient'' it may be, is profoundly undemocratic.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If this bill goes through unchanged, after our elections next year 44 of our 54 councillors will have no function. It wouldn't be surprising if they chose to resign when they have ascertained that they are not to be among the 10 executive decision-makers. Why bother to remain?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>How much more honest, economical and efficient it would be to save the cost of the election and for central government simply to appoint the 10 people they wish to run local government in this area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the view of an independent councillor in Devon.
<P>
However, not far away in Wiltshire, a scheme or experiment is going on that would meet the real concerns of that councillor. Will the proposed system be any better? Hammersmith and Fulham council comes up quite often in our debates and rightly so, because it seems intent on providing ammunition for its opponents on almost every aspect of the Bill. I think that we heard the statistic that, in the time that the council has had a cabinet, it has taken some 607 cabinet decisions, only one of which was overturned through the scrutiny process. The Minister may wish to comment on that.
<P>
The vast majority of people who have experience of dealing with the committee system—even when they have some dissatisfaction with it and want to change it—are none the less capable of seeing some good in it. The opportunity for scrutiny of decisions is perhaps foremost in that. It beggars belief that the Minister should claim that there is no opportunity legitimately to pursue scrutiny within the existing system.
<P>
That is a monumental insult to the thousands of councillors from all parties, who devote large chunks of their spare time to sitting in committee meetings to hold the leadership to account. Are they all wasting their time? What does that say about the contribution to local government by Labour Members? Obviously, it was a complete waste of their time as well.
<P>
One of the Minister's Back Benchers, who is a former committee chairman—or chair as I suspect she would have it—on Birmingham city council, took a different view. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I do not accept the idea that the committee structure does not provide opportunities for scrutiny . . . I urge the Government to consider mechanisms that will reduce patronage and provide genuine opportunities for back-bench members to participate in decision-making processes. If necessary, they should consider retaining the committee structure.—[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 272.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the words of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Dr. Jones).
<P>
However, the Minister seems to have the mind set ``committee system bad, executive arrangements good'', as if there is no scope for debate anywhere in the middle—no-man's land. Anyone who has the temerity to advance into no-man's land to try to find a middle way—I might say a third way—between the two concepts is promptly machine gunned. The Minister's attitude is a sort of Orwellian mind set. Opposition Members think that that is unhelpful, damaging to local government and means that the Bill will continue to lumber down the runway and eventually become airborne, only to crash in due course—that is enough of that analogy.
<P>
If scrutiny is to be effective, it needs to be as wide-ranging as possible, and non-executive members must be as free as possible to decide for themselves how they can best hold the executive to account. However, the Bill sets out to constrain them in that activity. Subsection (4)—this is the point behind amendment No. 275—states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An overview and scrutiny committee of a local authority may not discharge any functions other than its functions under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That immediately puts a limit on what the committee can do by way of scrutiny to make the executive subject to prescription.
<P>
The powers conferred on scrutiny committees by the Bill should be kept to a bare minimum. Authorities should be free to design arrangements that give them significantly more power and that suit local conditions and local needs. In some cases, the authority should perhaps have the power to block executive decisions where they run contrary to the authority's policy As I understand it—the Minister may put me right—no such power currently exists in the Bill. The famous guidance published by the Government, to which we keep returning, states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It will be for the council's monitoring officer, chief finance officer or chief executive . . . to advise councillors . . . on whether or not in legal terms a decision is likely to be considered contrary to the policy framework or contrary to . . . the budget.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key phrase is ``in legal terms''. Does it mean that even though the full council is responsible for drawing up the policy framework, it does not have the power to determine how its own policy is to be interpreted? Is that ultimately a matter for the courts to decide, given that a sub-theme running through all our deliberations is the avoidance of legal challenge? There is a danger that senior officers will be placed in an invidious position, acting as a referee in disagreements between the executive and the council.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our amendments would remove the restrictions on the powers of scrutiny committees, giving the authority as a whole the power to extend their remit as it sees fit. They would also give local authorities greater freedom to decide who carries out those functions, permitting scrutiny functions to be carried out by committees, sub-committees, individual members or even full-time officers. That would grant local authorities considerable flexibility in dealing with their local circumstances. The Government have given no consideration to the idea that a different type of executive may best be scrutinised by different scrutiny arrangements and powers. Again, this is a ``one size fits all'' scrutiny system.
<P>
The Government amendments will allow overview and scrutiny committees to participate in best value reviews—a process that, under the terms of the regulations published by the Government, may, but need not be, the role of an executive. The fact that the Government have thought it necessary to table amendments to make that possible is symptomatic of a deeply flawed approach to the whole process of scrutiny.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister told us that the full council would continue to be the forum for policy decisions and that the overall policy of the council is the responsibility of the whole council and not of the executive. It stands to reason that a best value review will have a bearing on policy if, as the best value legislation makes clear, the scope of such a review is to include consideration of whether the function should be exercised, of the level at which and way in which it should be exercised, and of the objectives in relation to its exercise. That is specified in section 5(4) of the Local Government Act 1999. It is difficult to envisage how that can be done without reference to the policy-„making body.
<P>
The Bill and accompanying draft regulations hold out the alarming prospect of best value reviews being carried out entirely by a small number of executive members, or, in the case of mayor and council manager, by just one elected representative and an officer. At least the Government amendment makes it clear that scrutiny committees can be involved in the process, but there is no obligation for them to do so. It will be up to the executive to decide whether to involve them. That is a worrying matter, given the importance that the Government place on the best value process in securing improvements to public services. If the scrutiny arrangements promised by the Bill were adequate, the Government amendments would not be necessary. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall respond mainly to the amendments, but I would like to deal with an issue that was raised by the hon. Gentleman and was mentioned in an earlier sitting. The hon. Member for Mole Valley asked me the other day about a council in which 600 decisions had been made, only one of which had been taken up by the scrutiny panel. I said that I did not regard that as effective scrutiny—and I do not. However, he is now alleging that of the 600 decisions made, only one was overturned, not taken up. If Conservative Members wish to continue to pursue that matter, they are saying effectively that our work in Committee is irrelevant and not useful, which I reject. We are scrutinising the Bill. We are considering amendments that enable us to scrutinise it. Although the Government generally win votes on amendments, that does not mean that we are not listening to and taking account of the arguments that are presented. That is a large part of what scrutiny is all about.
<P>
The council is responsible for agreeing the overall policy framework, and the executive is responsible for making decisions on specific issues that reflect that framework, and put it into action. It is not surprising that the scrutiny panel will carefully examine the impact of implementing those decisions, but that does not necessarily mean that it will overturn them. Scrutiny does not necessarily mean overturning decisions; it means giving the executive ideas before it takes decisions, examining those decisions carefully, and working through, in a mature way, their implications for the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the Minister accept that her analogy with a Standing Committee is irrelevant? Local authorities do not legislate in the sense that the Government legislate. If she is seeking a parallel, a Select Committee would be more appropriate. Perhaps we could examine later whether those Committees are as effective in checking the Executive as they might be.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was somewhat misled by Opposition Members earlier. I wanted to clarify the point that scrutiny is not simply about overturning decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is churlish of the Minister to accuse us of misleading her. I do not believe that anyone suggested that only one out of 607 decisions had been considered. We simply want to know whether she thinks it a little curious, in a vigorous, red-blooded scrutiny system, that only one of those 607 decisions has been adjudged not to pass muster and has been overturned. Is that not disturbing?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not find it disturbing. I believe that we all have to learn to scrutinise measures more effectively, and that that applies as much to Members of Parliament as to councillors.
<P>
I should like to say a few words about the Wiltshire model. I met Peter Chalke when he came to see us. Some officials are going to Wiltshire to see what is happening there, and will maintain contact afterwards. The council has an interesting way of doing things. It has four committees, which are ostensibly the policy-„making arms, and two scrutiny panels, each of which has only six members. Every member of the council takes part in decision making, but only 12 are involved in scrutiny. I need to examine the system to see how it is working, but that seems to imply an imbalance.
<P>
When I met Peter Chalke, he said that the chairs of committee, with him as leader, meet regularly to work out how matters should be organised before they proceed to the next stage. That procedure acts as the executive of the council. Few people are aware of that, although we have now made public the fact that those meetings take place. That is the norm. It has been said that Wiltshire is acting without an executive. It may not be called an executive, but it is a quasi-executive. That means that no one is examining the executive's actions—for example, no papers are being circulated. I do not suggest that that approach is wrong, but it does not open up local government to the scrutiny and accountability that the public expect. I do not seek to diminish the work that is being done in Wiltshire, but we cannot say that there is a scrutiny system—the situation is more complicated than that. Six members who are in the decision-making process scrutinise others who are also part of that process. That situation is too complex and does not produce the most effective scrutiny.
<P>
I was fascinated by the arguments of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, who suggested that councillors do not have a real role in scrutiny. I obviously come from a different tradition to that of Opposition Members. One reason why John Wesley split from the Anglican Church in the 18th century was because he believed that the Bible said that there was a priesthood of all believers. As a Methodist, I grew up with that belief—
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am a Primitive Methodist. The Minister should be rather careful.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have another believer. I come from the Prim sector, too, although we lost the Prims in 1924, when we became one Church. The basic theology of the Methodist Church—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not discussing the theology of the Methodist Church. The Minister should stick to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am getting there. We are all of the same worth, although we all play a different role. Ministers in the Church get paid—a pittance, but at least they get paid—and they have a pension scheme and housing. They are therefore different from those of us who are lay people. However, in the sight of God, if I may put it that way, we are all of equal worth. That is the way in which I view councillors—they are all of equal worth and of equal value, although they may have different roles. One role cannot be performed effectively without the other.
<P>
I shall return to the secular world. Having revealed my background, I may get greater support from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, who may now understand more clearly what we mean when we say that every councillor will have a place in the council. Conservative Front Bench Members may need to do more thinking about the wider aspects of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Minister ensure that God communicates with the chief executive officers, who will have a large role to play in determining what comes before a scrutiny committee?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not want to discuss the relationship between the administration, the executive and the Methodist Church.
<P>
The Government cannot—surprise, surprise—accept amendments Nos. 28 and 271 to 284. I shall speak to Government amendments Nos. 142 and 143.
<P>
Our arrangements will put in place a separation between the discharge of a council function and the review and scrutiny of that function. For the first time, councils are formally being asked to build into their structures arrangements for the review of policy and decision making.
<P>
To ensure that that separation is maintained, we firmly believe that overview and scrutiny committees should not also be responsible for discharging functions. However, amendments Nos. 142 and 143 allow for one technical exception.
<P>
The new structures will give councils the mechanisms to deliver services of the highest quality, which links with our policy of best value. There is a natural home for best value reviews to be carried out by overview and scrutiny committees, which will be able to build up expertise in particular areas and review services independently. Many councils are already discovering the value of having overview and scrutiny committees carry out such reviews. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall respond to the hon. Member for Eastbourne on best value. We expect the scrutiny committees to look not only at an executive's decisions on a particular service, but at the impact that those decisions will have on the public. The public will be able to engage with members of the executive through the scrutiny process to discover what impact a service is having on their lives. The best value review is a formal part of the process. It would, therefore, be perverse to expect scrutiny committees to examine best value generally, through their scrutiny of the executive, or specifically in a particular service area, without also being able formally to take responsibility for the best value review. The Government amendments have been tabled to deal with that issue.
<P>
The conducting of a best value review is a specific function conferred on a local authority by section 5 of the Local Government Act 1999. For that reason, we want to ensure that the overview and scrutiny committees will be in a position to carry out best value reviews. The amendments will give councils the opportunity to put in place the executive arrangements that best suit their local needs, and also give them the flexibility to ask the overview and scrutiny committees to carry out the reviews.
<P>
The Government cannot accept amendment No. 28, which would allow overview and scrutiny committees to discharge any function that the council might wish. It would be inappropriate to allow the committees to discharge functions other than overview and scrutiny, because their function will be to hold executives to account, both in terms of what they have done and what they plan to do. They will examine how council functions are being discharged. Accountability would be blurred if they carried out other functions. The only exception is the carrying out of best value reviews. Amendment No. 28 would undermine the idea of proper accountability for the discharge of functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am not sure whether I should disclose any religious interest during an intervention. However, I would like the Minister to comment on a potential conflict of interest that has arisen in Cardiff, where the chairmen of the scrutiny committees are paid £22,950 a year. The Cardiff Post has said that those chairmen cannot dispute cabinet decisions as they might lose a lucrative position. Does the Minister agree that that represents a conflict of interest, despite the supposedly watertight scrutiny committee system of which she is so fond?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman's information is out of date. Changes have been made to the system in Cardiff. We can debate the issue more fully when we reach the subject of allowances.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 271 to 284 appear to go even further. I admire the persistence of the hon. Member for Eastbourne. He has lost the argument about retaining the committee system, which we debated on clause 9. In a sense, the amendment is an ingenious attempt to bring back the status quo. The hon. Member wants to blur the executive-scrutiny split, which would take away the Bill's strong intention of accountability.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon referred to officers, as do the amendments, We are anxious to have a proper system for officers. We have discussed the issue fully with the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers and others to ensure that we get the right support for scrutiny and for the executive. However, the officer corps will be greatly concerned if we split it in the way suggested by some hon. Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne was keen quote to us from a Local Government Information Unit research report by Pam Fox and Steve Leach entitled ``Officers and members in the new democratic structures''. One would have thought from what he said that the report was against everything that the Government sought. The report was launched by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and we were happy to be involved with it, because it has been another good way of examining the purpose of the Bill. The report says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Local Government Bill should not seek to prescribe appropriate officer structures, nor to protect familiar roles associated with the current unified system. To do so would be to inhibit the capacity to assess how far the unified officer structure is compatible with the demands and processes of the cabinet or mayoral government system as it develops.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are real potential advantages in the avoidance of a set of cabinet portfolios which exactly match the responsibilities of chief officers. This may help to overcome the potential danger of the blurring of member and officer roles and responsibilities at this level and help to overcome the tradition of ``silo cultures'' of some local authorities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is much work to be done and the officer corps is giving the matter much thought. However, the amendments will not help officers or members, but will simply take us back along a circuitous route to the committee system, which would not even allow the amount of choice that the hon. Member for Eastbourne argued for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The population of Harrogate town is 47 per cent. of Harrogate district, so under the Bill it would be impossible for the council to have an area committee serving Harrogate town. Will the Minister reflect on that figure, which has been communicated to me by electronic means?
<P>
As you have indulged me in that, Mr. O'Brien, I shall not give a dissertation on Methodism, but my family on my mother's side, who were called Tyerman, apparently used to put Mr. Wesley up in Osmotherly in the 18th century when he was passing through the North Yorkshire moors. Therefore, I claim some pedigree in that as well, although I have lapsed in many regards, particularly in relation to alcohol.
<P>
I do not begin from the assumption that the split between executive and scrutiny is necessarily wrong. My concern is to make the scrutiny effective. My real concern, and here I am extrapolating from my experience as Chairman of a Select Committee, is that we do not do it well because the volume of business discharged by a Government and a council is disproportionate to the time available for the scrutiny. Therefore, given that scrutiny committees are manned by volunteers and councillors who often do other jobs as well, they will not even scratch the surface of many of the decisions taken by the executive.
<P>
Let us consider the matters that the scrutiny committee might want to do scrutinise. I have tried to put them into four categories. The first includes matters of immediate concern or interest—things which, as Macmillan said, go bump in the night. That category covers proposals to close local authority homes, which have been commonplace over the last few years, or proposals to close schools to overcome the problem of surplus places. They are matters that evoke an immediate response from the community, which a scrutiny committee might wish to examine quickly.
<P>
The second is the way in which a council spends money. The primordial object of any scrutiny is the discharge of public money, not merely to the council but to any bodies to which it gives assistance. For example, in North Yorkshire and, I am sure, in the Minister's county, subventions are given to the citizens advice bureaux and a number of voluntary organisations. As they receive public money, they should be scrutinised as part of normal scrutiny procedure, just as Select Committees scrutinise quangoes and Government agencies.
<P>
The third category might be council decisions with a medium term impact. An analogy is the possibility that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will close some of the regional offices. My Select Committee is looking at the background to the regional offices and at the available options. That is a medium-term strategy.
<P>
The fourth is to provide a forum to find new solutions to old or new problems. This is where rural development policies will apply. The relationship between the various structural funds and links with the regional development agency would be a legitimate matter for scrutiny.
<P>
That is an enormous burden of work. How on earth will a scrutiny body be able to tackle more than a fragment of that? That is my first difficulty. How will we ensure that there is proportionality between the executive function and the scrutiny function? The second difficulty is the role of the officers. I know that they are concerned about it, and I appreciate that the Minister is trying to find ways in which they can be at ease with the dual function.
<P>
Officials in this Committee service the Minister; and rightly so: that is their role. If they also serviced the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee, they would have a difficult job, because officials instinctively gravitate to where decisions are being taken. Their function is to provide the information and the options on which decisions are based. It is difficult for officials to provide that information to another body equally, because as our system functions, particularly in the non-political civil service at Government and local authority level, their role is to serve the decision taker. That is the whole principle of our system, and I am glad that it is, because in places where the system is much more politicised, the result is less good administration. That is my second concern.
<P>
I am also concerned about the scrutiny committee's ability to get to the bottom of issues, Will it be able to travel in the district if it calls evidence? Will it be able to summon evidence? Will it have sight of people and papers? Will it be able to call expert witnesses? Will it be able to dispose of a budget if it wishes to examine issues in its own district? How will it operate to collect information from outside, even if it can find time to do so? The problem then arises of scrutiny in local authorities that consist predominantly of one party. At one stage, the Government planned to have annual elections, so that council leaders would be unable to sleep peacefully in their beds and the Secretary of State retains the power in the Bill to implement such a measure. However, the Government have not embraced the measure that would ensure that most effectively. I do not advocate proportional representation, but if that were the Government's intention, the simplest way to achieve it would be by proportional representation.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am not advocating proportional representation; I am merely making a statement on the political mathematics of the system.
<P>
If a local authority consists predominantly of one party, it will be difficult to persuade people that the mentality of scrutiny is as important in local government as in central Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): The right hon. Gentleman is listing the difficulties of operating a scrutiny process, but he started by saying that he had no objection to the principle of splitting executive decision making and such a process. I hope that he will give his ideas of how a scrutiny process might work positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I pointed out at the beginning of my remarks that the Government have embarked on a process in which local authorities will be governed largely by executives. The overwhelming likelihood is that they will choose a cabinet system, so it is important to build in a scrutiny function as a counterpart to that. My argument concerns the practical problems of a one-party state. The Minister acknowledges that if scrutiny in some Labour local authorities had been more effective, some of the recent difficulties—for example, in South Yorkshire—might not have occurred.
<P>
The local authority in Liverpool is predominantly Liberal Democrat and it told me recently that it will probably be able to make the system work, but there are difficulties at the moment because Liberal Democrats on the scrutiny committee are instinctively supportive of the executive and have not developed a scrutiny culture. That culture has not yet become rooted in the council and that is a difficulty.
<P>
What is needed is, first, an obligation on the officers to ensure that they serve the council and the scrutiny committee effectively. Secondly, the scrutiny committee must be given extensive powers to investigate what it wants to investigate, so that it is in control of its own agenda. Thirdly, it must be given resources so that it is not beholden to the people it wishes to investigate for the means to conduct that investigation. If we could move in that direction, there would be some merit in the system.
<P>
The Bill will become law and many local authorities are anticipating it and moving towards an executive system. Case law will have to be worked out, but my concern is based on my experience in the Select Committee and I am conscious of the inadequacy with which we scrutinise Government. Government can delay and defer scrutiny with ease. I have no doubt that the Minister does it and I did it when I was a Minister When a Select Committee calls a Minister—it cannot summon a Minister—they can negotiate for weeks to find a convenient date, by which time the immediacy of the matter may have passed. It is very easy to play for time and I know that Ministers with whom I deal do it.
<P>
Unless a scrutiny committee can summon the executive while an issue is hot, the immediacy of the events will slide away and it will find itself engaged in inquiries that may be intellectually stimulating, but not immediately relevant to scrutinising the actions of the executive. I hope that the Minister can assure us that she is conscious of these issues and that there will be, in effect, a best value analysis of the scrutiny process itself.

<P>

<B>Ms Margaret Moran </B>(Luton, South): The right hon. Gentleman draws some important analogies with the work of Select Committees. Does he accept that resources that are used to support committees, which impose a huge and often disproportionate burden on many authorities, could be used to resource the scrutiny function? He listed the scrutiny committee's functions, but he perhaps inadvertently omitted to mention that the committee could consider issues in advance. In that regard, there is an analogy with pre-legislative scrutiny, which will be another important function of local authority committees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I certainly accept that to my list of four functions should be added—looking over the hill, as it were—pre-scrutiny. However, that would increase the burden of work and might require a different form of servicing from officials than the scrutinising of decisions in progress. By definition, the situation has not arisen, and we may find that a different form of servicing and resource are required. I accept that money devoted to servicing the committee may well liberate money for scrutiny.
<P>
The one advantage of the committee system is that an enormous amount of ordinary business tracks through it. Members who are alert and wish to keep track of events have a panorama of issues flowing across the committee. Under a scrutiny process, that cartoon strip of business will not constantly unfold. The key to these issues is where selections are made and the way in which important matters are identified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): There is much in what the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon has said that will perplex people in local government. For many of the reasons that he has given, there is another aspect to scrutiny—making councillors feel that they have an important role to play.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne read out a letter from Lesley Whittaker, the independent, which was published in the Local Government Association magazine. I know Mrs. Whittaker quite well. She is an intelligent local councillor who was elected as a Liberal Democrat and remains a party member. However, there was no room for her in the executive committee—which was open to members of other parties, not just Liberal Democrats—created by Devon county council. Perhaps a lack of a role in scrutiny for her talents and experience led her to take a step back and become an independent.
<P>
I fear that many other councillors throughout the country will also discover that there is no room for them in small executives. Unless there is an important, fulfilling and useful role for them to perform on a scrutiny committee, many will drop out of local government. A prime aim of the reforms—making local government more attractive and encouraging people with talent to participate—will not be met. In fact, the reverse could happen. Lesley Whittaker's experience is a warning that, unless some of the matters that were mentioned by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon are addressed, there will be many more Lesley Whittakers in future, of all parties and of none.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I want to support my hon. Friends on the Front Bench. They may take that as a mixed blessing, but I hope that they will view it positively. At the beginning of the debate, much was said, by Government and Opposition Front Bench Members, about Hammersmith and Fulham. I feel that some of those comments require clarification.
<P>
Hammersmith and Fulham is, as its leader, Councillor Slaughter, told the Joint Committee, a very strongly whipped council. To decry the fact that it has reversed only one out of 607 or 609 decisions, following examination and agreement, belittles the way in which it is politically engineered. According to Mr. Slaughter, the council's decisions are made in the Labour group. They are then ratified by the executive, in that the executive makes the decisions before it hands them to the group, or vice versa, or a mixture of the two. When those decisions finally surface from the secret committee, the papers are, in effect, rubber-stamped. There is no proper or full scrutiny, because the scrutiny committees are politically controlled.
<P>
In his evidence, Mr. Slaughter accepted that it would be very difficult to remove whipping, some of which is fairly open, while some is more subversive. He also made it plain, perhaps inadvertently, that the system of fees and payments—to which my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) referred—leads, in the Labour group, to de facto whipping in the form of patronage. On the reasonable assumption that the Bill is passed, we are concerned that it will not provide true scrutiny. Hammersmith and Fulham is a classic example of that.
<P>
Another council, to which I referred earlier—I think that it was Waltham Forest—is in the process of setting up some 37 scrutiny committees. That will create another interwoven web. Rather than a panorama of issues flowing across the committee—as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon put it—there will be a confused web of scrutiny committees overlapping each other. The end result will be that no decisions are properly scrutinised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister will not be surprised to hear that I found her answer disappointing in many respects. These are major and serious issues, and my right hon. and hon. Friends have gone into some detail about the aspects that we should like the Government to address.
<P>
I thought at first that the discovery that the Minister is a Methodist might explain a lot, but in fact it has the opposite effect. I believe that one of the principles of the Methodist church is devolution, on a grand scale, of power and decision making. Speaking as a Roman Catholic, we take entirely the opposite view. The ex cathedra pronouncements that we keep hearing in Committee give the impression that the Minister is more Catholic than the Pope. Nevertheless, as we all know, God is a Tory.
<P>
I shall deal with the role of officers when we discuss the final group of amendments. I am delighted to welcome the proposed visit by officials to Wiltshire, so that they can see at first hand how the system is progressing. As I said earlier, if other people are going to the trouble of laying on a pilot scheme—something that the Government have set their face against—the Government should go to see how it operates. It would be interesting to see what comes of that.
<P>
Our old friends, the Labour campaign for open local government, have briefed us all. They share our concerns about the Government's proposals for scrutiny. Presumably, all their chums were thrown that side of the Committee before it had even got started. They made the point that, at the recent conference on local governance—what a wonderfully new Labour word—the judges had some difficulty making a best practice award for scrutiny. The winner was Hartlepool, which has an improved committee system that includes scrutiny. It is difficult to see where local governance is going in the Labour party. Echoing a comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), the campaign for open local government says that it does support the Government's aim that scrutiny powers should not be whipped—that is interesting—but it goes on to say that it has heard that secret whipping of scrutiny members is practised in some local authorities.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, I'll say that again. I think that we know what it means. Of course, the Roman Catholic Church has stopped all that sort of thing in recent years, I am delighted to say.
<P>
I cannot understand why the Minister rails and rants against the committee system. She will not accept that there is any merit in it whatsoever. She is like a religious zealot on the subject; she thinks that all the people who have been operating the committee system should be burned at the stake. That is very non-Methodist. It is no good for the Minister to say that we have lost the argument; we intend to carry on making it. We have lost the votes in the Committee, but out in local government, among all parties, we have not lost the argument. We shall continue to make it.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 13, line 18, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or other action taken,'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`prior to their enactment,'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 19, in page 13, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) to advise the executive on the future discharge of its executive functions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Bill is unclear about the powers of scrutiny bodies to subject executive decisions to scrutiny before they are taken. Clause 20(3) refers to the powers of scrutiny committees
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to review or scrutinise a decision made but not implemented<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to recommend that the decision be reconsidered.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not make clear whether, in practice, scrutiny committees will be able to require that further consideration be undertaken, before any action is taken on the basis of that decision.
<P>
To that extent, these are probing amendments.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Amendment No. 57 would give overview and scrutiny committees the power to review or scrutinise decisions before they were implemented.
<P>
Clause 20(3) gives overview and scrutiny committees the power to call in executive decisions and recommend that they be reconsidered. In the draft guidance issued last week, we suggested that decisions should not be implemented until five working days after they were taken, to allow the overview and scrutiny committee to call in the decision—only two councillors need ask an overview and scrutiny committee to consider a decision. We also suggested that councils should take a sensible view of the types of decision that they will allow to be called in. I stress that they are suggestions—such matters are a matter for local choice. We should not delay the implementation of all decisions until the overview and scrutiny committees have decided whether they want to scrutinise them. According to a report by the Audit Commission, one of the problems with the committee system is that it slows down decisions, but we are seeking to deal with that problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 19 would ensure that overview and scrutiny committees have the power to advise the executive about the future discharge of its executive functions, but that power is unnecessary. Subsection 2(b) already provides that overview and scrutiny committees will have the power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to make reports and recommendations<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
about the discharge of executive functions, which obviously includes the future discharge of functions. I am not sure what the amendment was meant to achieve. However, the hon. Member for Eastbourne said that it was a probing amendment.
<P>
We have issued draft guidance that clarifies our intentions in this regard. It sets out the way in which the executive should make its forward plans known. Such matters will be set out in mandatory standing orders and regulations. The overview and scrutiny committees will therefore be informed of any key decisions that the executive intends to make, and they will have the opportunity to comment on those decisions in advance. They will be able to feed in their views and those of their constituents, and recommend other stakeholders who should be consulted before the decision is taken. That is a considerable advance on the current situation.
<P>
I am anxious to ensure that making more demands to secure full access to information and to the decision-making process does not impose an overly bureaucratic system on councils. We want councils to be efficient, but they also have to get on with their work. We believe that we have found the right balance.
<P>
I trust that Committee members are reassured about the fact that overview and scrutiny committee members and others will be able to feed into the decision-making process in advance. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will withdraw the amendment and not press amendment No. 19.

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 242, in page 13, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) to require that the implementation of any such decision as is referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection is deferred until a decision has been made whether or not to exercise the power conferred by subsection (3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 287, in page 13, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Unless the matter is certified by the authority's monitoring officer to be urgent, no decision by an executive, a member of an executive or a committee of an executive, under its executive arrangements, shall be implemented within less than five working days after the decision is published.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 27, in page 14, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where a member of a relevant overview and scrutiny committee finds that a decision by or on behalf of the executive ought to be subject to immediate review he may, with the agreement of two members of the relevant overview and scrutiny committee, cause the decision to be delayed until that overview and scrutiny committee has considered the matter'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The amendments would allow scrutiny bodies to submit executive decisions to scrutiny before they are made when those bodies feel that it would be appropriate for the executive to draw on their advice before taking such a decision. That is known in the trade as pre-scrutiny.
<P>
In a sense, that arrangement would mirror the decision to subject certain Bills, such as this Bill, to pre-legislative scrutiny in Westminster. That decision was broadly welcomed in principle. However, when this Bill was considered by a Joint Committee that was comprised of the great and the good from both Houses, including my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, some pretty important recommendations were ignored by Ministers.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They were not ignored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> One of the Joint Committee's key recommendations was, in effect, to place a fourth option in the Bill. I do not see it there—although Members of the House of Lords put it there, the Government took it out again. However, I do not want to reopen that debate. I believe that it was the hon. Member for Torbay who referred to this approach as option 3A rather than as a fourth option. Even that is being unnecessarily generous to what is a pretty pathetic attempt to provide another option—it is hedged around with restrictions, it maintains the executive structure and it has not found favour even with the Labour-dominated Local Government Association. Let us hear no more nonsense about that approach being a fourth option.
<P>
Before I got diverted, although it was a useful diversion—

It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
