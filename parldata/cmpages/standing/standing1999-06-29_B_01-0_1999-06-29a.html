<H3><center></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome members of the Committee to what I am sure will be smooth and courteous proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Food Standards Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays, at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past One o'clock.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are happy to discuss the clauses and schedules in the order set out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): May I first say how pleased we are to see you in the Chair, Mr. Gale. We look forward to serving under your chairmanship and that of Mr. Hood for however long the proceedings take. I am also pleased to see the panoply of Government stars in Committee. We shall soon find out whether that means that the Labour party feels that it needs strength in numbers. I am slightly puzzled about what will happen on Thursday. While I am delighted that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland is here today, I understand that, from Thursday, he will cease to have responsibility for food issues because they will be taken over by the Scottish Parliament--an issue that we shall debate when we reach the appropriate stage in our proceedings.
<P>
As we said on Second Reading, we approach the Bill with good will and welcome the consultation that has been undertaken by the Government. We have tabled several amendments, some of which are exploratory in the hope of establishing exactly what the Government want to achieve. We shall also look behind some of the wording to establish the effect of the Bill. I draw attention to the work of the Special Select Committee, which undertook a good and diligent job. I hope that the Government accept that that Committee did not scrutinise the Bill in the same way as we shall be scrutinising it. It did not examine its provisions line by line; its role was slightly different from that of this Committee and the fact that it undertook such work does not negate the need for our work.
<P>
We shall be considering issues relating to the membership of the Food Standards Agency, its accountability, its independence and its link with the Meat Hygiene Service and issues relating to charges and imports. We shall also be challenging the Government to explain why they rejected some of the amendments recommended by the Special Select Committee, in particular those in respect of the Meat Hygiene Service. Our proceedings will be fairly technical; many of the issues that relate to such an important subject are scientific. We shall do our best to ensure that the Bill is scrutinised fully and we are happy to agree to the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): I, too, am pleased to be a member of such an important Committee under your Chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I have a few concerns about the sittings motion, however, although not about the overall time that has been allocated to the Bill. It makes sense to meet on Tuesday mornings and Tuesday afternoons and to meet for about five hours on Thursdays. I am concerned, however, about the proposed timing of our sittings on Thursdays, which is a 9 am start and 11.30 am finish and a 1.30 pm start which, depending on what progress is made, will be followed by a flexible finishing time. If hon. Members consider those times awkward and inconvenient, I hope that the usual channels may be prevailed upon to table an amendment to the sittings motion.
<P>
I do not blame the Minister of State, but the Government have got themselves into a rather diabolical mess over Thursdays. Although we have not suffered the problem before, I believe that we would need to table a special motion in the House if we wished to meet at slightly different times. The Whip indicates that he disagrees; however, I served on another Standing Committee recently that wanted to meet at slightly different times, and a special motion had to be tabled in the House, which was nodded through at 10 pm.
<P>
My worry is that some people complain that debating Bills at midnight or 2 am makes for bad law. I find, however, that it makes for exceptionally bad law if I have to wrestle with it at 9 o'clock in the morning, before I have had breakfast. On principle, I never eat breakfast before 9 am; it is quite uncivilised. Some hon. Members may find it more convenient to meet at 10 am on Thursday mornings. We could still have a full five hours of debate if it was necessary or, if an agreement was made between the usual channels, we could make up the time on other occasions, perhaps on Tuesdays, and be slightly more flexible on Thursdays.
<P>
I appreciate that it is not possible today to table a different sittings motion, but many of us now find Thursdays totally confusing. We do not have a clue what is going on when. Committees seem to meet at all sorts of funny hours of the day or night, and the House's business starts at odd hours. Goodness knows what will happen when, in the next Session, the alternative House of Commons Chamber starts meeting in that poky little room above the policemen's cafe. It will not be convenient for Members to have always to remember where and when we are meeting.
<P>
Although I am generally content with the sittings motion, my simple plea to the Minister of State is that if my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), who speaks for the Conservative party, and the Liberal Democrat spokesman find that Thursday sittings would benefit from an adjustment, I hope that neither side will be afraid to come along with an amendment to the sittings motion that can be made quite simply. If we have to go through the palaver of tabling a new sittings motion in the House, I hope that the usual channels in the Committee will feed that through to the bigger usual channels, so that the procedure can be changed to allow Committees to meet at hours convenient to their members.
<P>
Finally, Mr. Gale--I realise that this is not directly to do with the sittings motion--the Committee has only 19 members, yet we are meeting in a large Room and those in the Strangers Gallery seem quite far away. It may be possible for those who are interested in our debates, and those who wish to give advice to hon. Members on either side, to be brought into the body of the kirk if a suitable area can be roped off. Those genuinely interested in our debates would thus not be at the back of the Room.
<P>
Room 10 is not so bad, but if the Committee was meeting in Room 14 the strangers in the Gallery would seem to be 10 miles away. It may be only for their benefit, Mr. Gale, but it would not disrupt the Committee's business if you considered the possibility of roping an area off should the Strangers Gallery become crowded. In these days of television, no one is particularly interested in what we do unless there is a little sexy punch-up on the Floor of the House. However, if members of lobby groups, those who have vested interests or even members of the public who have strayed into the Room are taking an interest, we should treat them as decently as we can. They may be the only people in the country who are taking an interest in the Bill; we should treat them as nicely as we can.
<P>
With those comments, I conclude my remarks on the sittings motion, of which I am generally supportive.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right that the Committee Rooms are not entirely suitable for a large public attendance. In the past, that has caused difficulties. I remember that, when one of the broadcasting Bills was in Committee, we found it necessary to bring members of the public and press into the body of the kirk. I give the Committee an undertaking that Mr. Hood and I will consider the matter and, if it becomes apparent that we are not serving the needs of those who wish to hear the debates, we shall seek either to move to another Room or, if possible, to alter the layout of this Room. Sadly the Rooms were not designed to cope with the number of people now likely to attend.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Food Standards Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past One o'clock.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, Mr. Hood and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
I am acutely aware, as, I think, are all Chairmen, that a Bill's opening debate is likely to be fairly wide ranging, especially when, as in this case, the first clause sets out the Bill's purpose. I am prepared to allow a reasonably wide-ranging debate on the first group of amendments, on the understanding--of which I hope hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will take note--that if such a debate takes place, I will not allow a clause stand part debate. hon. Members cannot have it both ways; they can have it either at the beginning or at the end.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Food Standards Agency</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 1, line 10, leave out subsection (2) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2) The main objectives of the Agency in carrying out its functions are--
<P>
(a) so far as is reasonably practicable, the protection of the public from microbiological and chemical dangers arising from the consumption of food; and
<P>
(b) advising the public on the microbiological and chemical risks associated with the consumption of foodstuffs.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 92, in page 1, line 11, after "from', insert "the major'.

No. 1, in page 1, line 12, after "including', insert "all'.
<P>
No. 2, in page 1, line 12, after "is', insert "grown'.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The amendment is designed to define the Food Standards Agency's principal functions. Subsection (2) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The main objective of the Agency in carrying out its functions is to protect public health from risks which may arise in connection with the consumption of food (including risks caused by the way in which it is produced or supplied) and otherwise to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a rather vague definition, perhaps intentionally so. It is difficult to specify the main food safety risks with which the agency will be involved, which results in a rather wide definition. What are consumers' interests in relation to food? The Bill deals with consumers' food safety interests and food standards in relation to microbiological risks and chemical dangers to food. In some ways those aspects the split between the two departments involved. The Department of Health previously concentrated on microbiological dangers, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concentrated on chemical and other dangers. By pooling those functions both principal dangers in the consumption of food should be dealt with.
<P>
The Bill includes the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and otherwise to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of consumers' main interests is price. Is it suggested that the agency will be interested in the price of food and consumers' interests in relation to that aspect? The agency is intended to deal with risks associated with food safety. Nutrition and the dangers of excessive indulgence in the wrong types of food are different matters on which I shall touch, and with which we shall no doubt deal later. Although nutrition should be either included or not--the Minister has said that the agency will have a role in giving advice on nutrition, which I may oppose--I have no qualms about the clauses covering aspects relating to nutrition. However, I am worried that the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise to protect the interests of consumers"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is far too wide. Consumers' interests in relation to food go much wider than food safety. One of consumers' principal anxieties is the price of food. Many consumers are worried that food is overpackaged, or, in some cases, underpackaged. Consumers have many interests that have nothing to do with food safety.
<P>
During food safety scares, when one asks 100 people what they are most concerned about in relation to food, the prevalent answer will be food safety. However, the Minister's advisers may confirm that when food scare levels are not in the news, often most people state that they are worried about price. Whether that is rational or not is another matter. All studies show that the average amount of time that it takes people to earn the cost of a daily shopping basket is getting less and less in real terms every year, yet the price of food is a major concern for consumers.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Consumers have other interests in relations to food that are nothing to do with the agency. As long as the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise to protect the interests of consumers"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is present, the agency has far too wide a brief. It would have the legal right to stray into matters that are not its concern, such as the environment. The interests of consumers in relation to food cover not only price, but packaging, presentation and, in my area, distribution outlets. My constituency is the largest in England. If some of my constituents were asked what was their main concern about food, it would be that they could not buy food unless they travelled 15 miles, because the little rural shops and delivery vans had gone. Consumer interest in food does not relate to standards only.
<P>
The Minister of State may say that the group of amendments is not technically legally correct, and I suspect that all other amendments that I shall table will also be legally imperfect. I hope that the Minister of State will explain that problem once only and not on every amendment. I am interested in exploring the principle.
<P>
My drafting in the amendment is much more straightforward than that in the clause, and I hope that it does not have large lacunae in it that the Minister of State will say would make the agency feeble. The amendment is more specific in dealing with exactly what we were led to believe that the Government wanted to do. It states that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"objectives of the Agency in carrying out its functions are . . . so far as is reasonably practicable".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that that is a limitation. At the moment, the agency has been set the impossible task of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"carrying out its functions...to protect public health from risks which may arise"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is the objective, the agency will fail within 10 seconds of being set up. No matter how good it is or how brilliant the MAFF and Department of Health scientists and Ministers are, it cannot meet an objective of protecting public health from risks associated with food at all times. It can try its utmost and may succeed 90 or 99 per cent. of the time, but there should be a sensible qualifier such as "so far as is reasonably practicable", or "so far as practically possible" that would not diminish what the agency will do. I know that the terminology of BATNEEC--best available technology not entailing excessive costs is used for environmental protection, but that may not be appropriate in this case.
<P>
The public expect the agency to protect the public so far as it reasonably, sensibly and practicably can.  If the Government go ahead with the words in clause 1(2), I suspect that the agency will quickly be subject to criticism because it will be perceived as having failed. My suggestion would not weaken the agency's purpose and is not designed to undermine the agency. It is designed to add some common sense, which is the standard that the agency will have to operate under. I suspect that the Minister of State's reply will be that we do not need such a phrase in the Bill, but common sense tells us that the agency will protect the public health only "so far as is reasonably practicable". The amendment also states the objective of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"so far as is reasonably practicable, the protection of the public from microbiological and chemical dangers arising from the consumption of food".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I appreciate that one could add other dangers to complete that list, such as radiological dangers. I presume that the agency will also deal with radiological dangers, such as the few radioactive lambs left on the high fells in Cumbria
<P>
I have divided the possible risks into microbiological, chemical and associated risks, so that we avoid the clause's general and over-wide terminology of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and otherwise to protect the interests of consumers".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The agency needs more specific guidelines on its core functions of dealing with microbes, chemicals, veterinary products, residues and so on. There are better experts than me in the agency and in the Minister's team who can tighten up my inept outline.
<P>
The final function proposed by the amendment is that of 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"advising the public on the microbiological and chemical risks associated with the consumption of foodstuffs".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I deliberately left out nutrition. We may cover that  subject under another clause, but my definition covers advice to the public on food safety risks, such as bugs or chemicals, inherent in foods, rather than general nutrition and diet advice. Some of the most dangerous foods, such as mushrooms and  toadstools, are natural; some mushrooms, which I collect and bottle, are delicious, but others will kill quickly. As I said on Second Reading, I believe strongly that apart from certain foods that have toxins built into them, the food on our shelves is generally safe to eat. The problem is that too many British people and even more in the United States and other wealthy western countries, eat too much of some foodstuffs, such as  sugary or fatty foods, do not take enough exercise and do not have a balanced diet. The agency should confine itself to problems inherent in food--microbiological, chemical, radiological or other contaminants--and not get into the business of nutrition advice, which should be lift to the Health Education Authority, an organisation that will continue to be funded by Government.
<P>
Giving advice on nutrition will give the agency a bad reputation early on. The Minister will know from his experience that as soon as the Government start advising the public on what they think people should eat, howls of anguish rightly emerge from the press that the Government are nannying and nagging. The press and the public are always keen to hear the mythical, so-called, independent experts, which the Government would love to have and perhaps one day will, give advice on food safety. Yet as soon as they give unwelcome nutritional advice they are no longer regarded as independent experts and are to be treated as no more than the Minister's poodles. The press and the public love Ministers to say that something is dangerous, if contaminated and is being taken off the shelves, but as soon as they start saying, "We think you should have such and such a diet; we think you should have such and such a lifestyle; this is how you should cook beef, without too much fat on it" and so on, they will be accused of poking their nose where it is not wanted.
<P>
An organisation such as the Health Education Authority may give such nannying, nagging advice on food but, provided it is coupled with advice to take exercise and do all the other things that are supposed to be good and healthy for us, that is legitimate. However, if the Food Standards Agency does that, it will give itself a bad name, whereas if it restricts itself to dealing with food poisoning outbreaks and food contamination it can develop a good reputation, and will build on the already excellent work done by staff at both MAFF and the Department of Health. If it brings advice on diet and nutrition into its remit, the media--which, whether we like it or not, are powerful--will start turning against it. The agency could also be proved wrong ifit gives such advice and that would further undermine its case.
<P>
I shall not reminisce, but much of the advice that I and others issued in the 1980s about how much wine was good for one was contradicted three or four years later by the same eminent scientists who gave the original advice. If the agency starts to advise on diet, nutrition and what is good for us, it will certainly contradict its advice in a few years. That will be seen to undermine the credibility of the agency. The public and we as politicians will say, "They have had to admit that they have got the amount of wine that we should drink in a week and the effect of salt or sugar in the diet wrong. If they cannot get that right, why should we believe them when they say that blue-green algae, or whatever, are contaminating shellfish? Why should be believe their risk assessment on beef on the bone?" That will undermine the scientific advice based on microbiological or chemical contamination, about which the quality of research and advice in this country is second to none.
<P>
In amendment No. 89, I suggest that the agency's nutrition advice tasks should be removed, but nothing would stop the agency working with the HEA. Let the HEA give advice on nutrition; let the Food Standards Agency concentrate purely on microbiological, chemical and, if necessary, radiological contamination and advise the public on those risks so that the public can make up their own minds. I hope that the Minister will find my suggestion satisfactory--or, at least, find some elements of it to be non-contaminated food for thought.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I hope to be more brief than the right hon. Gentleman. I have a problem with amendment No. 89, mainly because it would knock out the whole concept of food standards as opposed to food safety. The HEA can do an excellent job if its advice is authoritative. We lack an authoritative body to give the broad advice on nutrition that people need. If people had such advice, they could decide how to run their lives. That is a question not of nannying but of giving good information. I am sure that we shall discuss nutrition during the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
I must take issue with the amendment because, if it were accepted, the agency would be restricted to microbiological and chemical risks only. The risk of radiological contamination has been mentioned. Of course, the use of isotopes in preserving food should be a matter for the Food Standards Agency. However, the big issue of today--genetically modified foods--is not covered by the definition used in the amendment and, therefore, I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, for the second time in Standing Committee. I hope that you will be as indulgent as you were in the previous Committee if I make any procedural goofs.
<P>
I had the honour to serve on the Special Select Committee that considered the Bill in the spring. When that Committee began, I was sceptical about the value of a food standards agency. Although the proceedings were rushed, I thought that we achieved some results in that Committee. I am pleased that the Government took on board many of our recommendations--not the biggest one, sadly, but I am sure that we shall discuss our concerns about the Meat Hygiene Service in great detail. However, I realised that food safety was less of a problem than the public's confidence in the ability of politicians to handle food safety matters.
<P>
It does not take long with a calculator to work out that 59 million people eating three meals a day results in 64,605 million meals eaten in the United Kingdom each year. Many public health interest groups seem keen to push the line that this country has a massive health problem that is increasing, grotesque and out of control. However, having contacted the Library about it, I find that the figures show a different position. In 1997, more than 311 people died from food poisoning: 48 people died from salmonella, 249 died from other food poisonings and 14 people died from listeriosis. That is awful and I acknowledge how tragic it is for the families of those who died, but let us put that figure against the 3,278 people who died on the roads in 1997.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, let us consider the figures for 1996 in respect of two other horrific causes of death: 3,499 people were killed as a result of accidents in the home and there were 3,445 suicides that year. Deaths from food poisoning represent about 9 per cent. of deaths from those other causes, which leads me to ask whether we will be spending public money to the best advantage and save the greatest number of lives?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Gentleman is advancing a wonderful argument for including food standards in the sense of nutrition in the Bill. Many more lives could be saved if people were encouraged to eat less cholesterol and to eat the right sort of food that contains fibre and so on to avoid cancers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I doubt whether the state can make such an impact, however. I sympathise with the aim; we want to reduce the number of deaths, but I doubt whether the state itself can regulate and achieve such ends. That is why I consider clause 1 to be flawed fatally. It is unimaginable that a state agency will affect 64,605 million meals. Returning to my comments about public confidence, we need an independent agency that dispenses advice and which stands aside from all interests, including commercial interests, and interference from the Government.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) considers that there should be advice on nutrition. That is fine; I am relaxed about an independent agency collating and dispensing the latest information, and finding out, for example, why the figures for salmonella poisoning decreased last year. There was a major drop and no one knows why. That is ludicrous. An independent agency studying all the reports throughout the world and disseminating information to the industry and consumers would be benign.
<P>
Having been a member of the Special Select Committee, I fear that the Government are trying to put in place a central institution that takes direct responsibility for each meal that is sold in this country. I endorse the argument of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean); mistakes will be made. Someone will make a mistake this afternoon. We do not know, for example, how much food poisoning is caused not by incompetent processing or preservation, but by domestic incompetence such as poor cooking or refrigerators being kept at the wrong temperature.
<P>
The Government are taking direct responsibility under the clause for the temperature of each domestic refrigerator. They cannot do that; there will be a compromise because, sadly, food poisoning cases will continue and, as drafted, clause 1 will mean that the public will lay the blame for any food failures at the door of the agency. That is tragic. If the agency is to go ahead, it must have integrity and be seen by the public to be wholly independent and to be dispensing information that is not only valuable, but up to date. The Special Select Committee found that a lot of information given to the industry was out of date.
<P>
I am sorry to disagree with the Government on clause 1. I wholly endorse my right hon. Friend's comments and his amendment, although I think along the same lines as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight on the question of nutrition. Any information given to the public would be good, but it must come from an independent agency. As we shall see from further clauses of the Bill, the agency cannot possibly be independent. It will be compromised immediately by the enormous regulatory powers that it will take on and the large number of staff that it will effectively employ when it takes on the roles of some other agencies.
<P>
The key words in amendment No. 89 are "advising the public". The agency that I would like to be created would be kept away from regulation. If the agency is not kept from telling people how to act, we shall fall over the first obstacle in our path. As drafted, the agency will be far to ambitious and will be let down by a food failure that is happening somewhere in the country as we speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> You have selected two of the Opposition's official amendments in the group, Mr. Gale, but before I speak to them I shall speak to those tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. He had responsibility on this subject in a previous Government and therefore has a great deal of knowledge on it. I do not disagree with the gist of what he proposes, although in a purely legalistic and technical sense, his amendments and ours could not work together at the same time. He is right to point out that the agency should advise the public so that they can make judgments. That is essential.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend reminded us, there are countless natural toxins in all sorts of fruits, vegetables and other food products. I have often heard it said that if one went to the relevant Committee to try to approve the release of Brussels sprouts on to the market, one would not get permission a month of Sundays because they contain some natural toxins. Such toxins are part and parcel of the plant world. Over the years, we have learnt that most foods do someone good rather than harm if taken in reasonable and not excessive quantities.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, it is also important that we avoid giving the impression that it is possible to protect people from all risks, which the clause as drafted does. Last week, we read of a tragic case in which a young athlete died suddenly from an allergy to peanuts. I do not know whether he knew that he was allergic, so I shall not comment any further on the case. Suffice it to say that it has provided tragic evidence that people cannot be protected from all the risks arising from food, because some of them relate to individuals and their circumstances and lifestyles.
<P>
I am tempted to point out that smoking is a known suppressant for appetite, although I am sure that the Minister for Public Health will jump down my throat if I do so. In that respect, one could argue that it does some good. She would argue strongly, and I would probably agree with her, that the downside of smoking is a lot worse. However, that depends on individuals. Smoking can clearly cause major problems for some people, although others appear to be able to go through life smoking non-stop without problems, and probably having good figures as a result of suppressing their appetites.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member of Penrith and The Border referred to wine, but over the years we have been advised that virtually every imaginable foodstuff is wrong for us. The only conclusion that I have ever reached is that if we listened to all the advice, we would die of starvation--because we would not eat anything.
<P>
I am always hesitant to regale the Committee with personal experiences, but some years ago my doctor put me on tablets to keep my cholesterol down because he was worried about how high it was, and I took them for several years. Some time later I went to see my doctor and he had to take another blood test, which showed that my cholesterol levels had gone up even further, but he said that I could stop taking the tablets because they were not worried about cholesterol any more. That demonstrates how advice moves on. I had been taking tablets unnecessarily for years. The amendment is, therefore, relevant and important.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight said that food standards are essential because they deal with nutrition. I do not equate food standards with nutrition. Food standards are about quality and wholesomeness of food, not the nutritional balances necessary for a good diet. I hope that the Minister of State will not think that I am speaking out of turn, but I understand that the Bill might not have its report stage until the House returns after the recess in the autumn. If so--obviously I have no input into that--I hope that Ministers will accept that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said, while the technical wording of some amendments may be faulty, they make a valid case. I hope that Ministers will use the two or three month interregnum to ponder the proposals so that the Bill is amended, in a legally acceptable way that meets some of our objectives. All members of the Committee wish to achieve a Bill that fulfils the principles on which we are agreed and no hon. Member opposes the Bill in principle. I, therefore, hope that Ministers will accept our constructive approach.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr Paterson:</B> North Shropshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I apologise. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) raised the issue of independence. Having considered the matter carefully, I believe that we should try to reproduce the experience of the Food and Drug Administration in America. There must be a reason why America does not have the huge range of food scares that we have had over the decades. As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said, it is largely because in this country we do not trust politicians of any hue. The independence of the Food Standards Agency is, therefore, crucial, and we need to examine ways, as we will later, of ensuring that it gains credibility. As my hon. Friend also said, it will not achieve public credibility by trying to do what it cannot possibly achieve. The clause appears to imply that the impossible is achievable.
<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 is not to negate the earlier comments on other amendments but to ensure that what we regard as a lacuna is filled. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight mentioned the highly topical issue of genetic modification, which is why we tabled the amendments. That issue is of enormous and widespread public concern, occasionally whipped up by the media, desperate for sensation, using ridiculous language--
<P>
<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North) : And Opposition parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I can assure the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) that we have not tried to use hysterical language, but have tried to inject a sense of reason into a shambolic Government position, with individual Ministers making different statements. The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, makes statements that imply sympathy for GM--although I do not doubt his honesty in trying to realise his objective--which are usually rather at odds with those of the Minister for the Environment. In the past few days, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, has formed yet another committee to encourage public acceptance of the Government line.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In proposing the insertion of the word "all" before the word "risks" and of the word "grown" to refer to how food is "grown, produced or supplied", we have tried to ensure that the concept of genetic modification is included. No Minister has yet said how the matter of genetic modification would relate to the Food Standards Agency if the agency were already established. Who would make policy? Who would deal with crop trials? Where would the balance of division of responsibility be struck between the regulatory work of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and that of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food? It is not clear.
<P>
Widespread public anxiety has been expressed about the cross-pollination of ordinary commercial crops that are not genetically modified or organic crops. It is generally agreed that it is important that the consumer have the right to choose. It is therefore important to know whether foodstuffs may be contaminated--a word that I do not like to use because it is pejorative--that is to say, whether non-GM crops may contain a level of GM crops simply because of proximity to and being pollinated by them. Whether that level be 1 per cent. or 5 per cent. its relatively immaterial, but the principle is crucial. If the Food Standards Agency is going to advise the public about food and to ensure that food produced is wholesome, it must have an input into how crops are grown in order to minimise the risk of contamination by cross-pollination.
<P>
Arguments have been advanced about the distance involved. Years ago, when I was a seed crop inspector, it was 6ft for many crops, including cereals. Some advisers, such as the Soil Association, now suggest 6 miles. I have no idea what the proper distance should be, but it will vary from crop to crop. The FSA should have a role to play in deciding on and advising the public about such issues. If it is to advise on risks as perceived by itself or by the public, it must know how a crop is grown, the chances of cross-pollination, and the possible contaminant level that could result in a food that is, notionally at least, GM free--which the public, rightly or wrongly, now want.
<P>
Our amendments would also allow the consideration of other issues. The use of sewage sludge on agricultural land and its possible impact on crops grown on such land and on livestock that graze on such land is subject to much debate. The FSA must be involved in such issues in order to fulfil its objective, and that is why we have tabled the amendments. The matter creates a conflict, because most people would say that sewage sludge is about as organic as one could possibly get, as it recycles natural materials. Nevertheless, scientists advise us that heavy metals and other materials in sewage sludge can be dangerous. The FSA should study such key issues.
<P>
Over the past few years, supermarkets have tended to adopt the role of the consumers' mentor and express what the public want to buy. However, I am not certain whether members of the public have ever been asked. I have seen in my constituency how producers of food are controlled by the supermarkets over certain residues and the way in which food is produced. Supermarkets are becoming involved in a raft of aspects of food production, yet such aspects cannot be assumed necessarily to be independent, because they are obviously involved in the marketing of food for commercial reasons.
<P>
If we can enable and encourage the FSA to become credible with the public about how food is produced, without being extremist, it will lift from the supermarkets the role that they have assumed for themselves. There might then be more objectivity about how food is produced.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): The Opposition are advancing two arguments. The hon. Gentleman says that they want the scope of the Food Standards Agency to be restricted, yet he is also saying that he wants it to play a wider role, such as monitoring supermarkets and so on. What do the Opposition think should be the functions and scope of the FSA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Lady has misunderstood me, although I may not have explained myself clearly. I am not suggesting that the Food Standards Agency should have the role of monitoring supermarkets. I was talking about how supermarkets have stepped into a role that would be better suited to the FSA, which could examine objectively GM crops, the use of sewage sludge on farm land and other issues about which, at present, only supermarkets are expressing a view. A more objective approach to food standards and production might then be taken than is presently taken by what are ultimately commercial organisations whose aim it is to make profits.
<P>
The hon. Lady suggested that there was a conflict between the views of Opposition Members. That is not so. I share the views of those who are concerned about the FSA going too far down the road of nutritional advice--the gist of the speech and amendments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border. I am suggesting that the role of the FSA should be to advice the public and to be involved in the growing of crops.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I wish to correct what the hon. member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) said. I am calling for an agency that has the widest possible remit to distribute information. When my hon. Friend the Member for South-east Cambridgeshire referred to sewage sludge, he raised exactly the sort of topic that should be examined. It is bizarre that we have stopped dumping sewage in the sea, which means that fish do not have enough to eat, yet we are now dumping it on the land, which may result in health problems. I should like an independent agency to have the widest possible remit to investigate such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend explained his earlier comments remarkably well. There is no lack of continuity between my comments and those of other Opposition Members.
<P>
I come now to the most recent issue of dioxins in some food from Belgium. If we are to understand how the FSA is to work, we must take some real examples and consider what would have happened if the FDA had been in existence to deal with them. The answer is unclear. In the Belgian case, therefore, who would have made the decisions about banning imports or advising the public and what would have been the channel of communication from the Belgian Government? I suspect that there was not one and that the problem was found out by accident. Indeed, who would be responsible if it transpired that information had been given to the Government long before any public statement was made? I hope that the Minister can use that recent example to describe how the Government view the distinction between the roles of Government and the FSA in addressing such problems.
<P>
My last point is on the MHS report that I believe the Minister has kindly sent to all members of the Committee. It includes an extract from the White Paper of over a year ago. "A Force for Change". It says--this comes back to the point about worrying about nutrition advice--that the agency should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"secure expert scientific advice on the relationship between diet, nutritional status and health to support the definition of a healthy diet and to inform policy from the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA)".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It should also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provide the definition of a balanced diet, based on COMA's scientific advice".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the report of the Special Select Committee on which two Opposition Members, at least, sat, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Committee is concerned at the quality of advice given by these advisory committees and recommends that the Agency monitor the quality of such advice."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The previous sentence in the report specifically identified COMA. In support of my right hon. Friend's contentions about nutrition, the Government have not explained the conflict between the fact that they seek to give COMA a high status in providing information to the FDA, while the Special Select Committee questioned the quality of the advice in the first place. That is a clear example of the way in which we could end up with advice that is far from correct or genuine. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that while the amendments may not have been tabled in the most effective or technically correct way, they have been tabled in a genuine attempt to refine the Bill in a way that is acceptable to most hon. Members. I hope that the Minister who responds to the debate will do so understanding the spirit of constructive criticism that we shall adopt throughout the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I have had a lifelong history in the agricultural industry, including current farming activities, and have made a declaration on that in the register. I therefore have some experience in that field. It is good to return to agriculture, after a sojurn in financial matters. I welcome participation in the Committee because the establishment of a food standards agency, with what I hope will be a worldwide reputation for excellence, could be a significant factor in re-establishing the public's confidence in wholesomely-produced UK food. If the agency achieves that, the Committee will have done a worthwhile job.
<P>
Clause 1 is the key clause, establishing the functions and powers of the agency. We do not oppose it in principle, but I am worried that the agency will be a huge chimera. Into how many Departments will its tentacles reach? If it does not focus on what it is trying to achieve, it will fail. We must set it clear tasks in the Bill, because if its tasks are too wide, it will fail.
<P>
We have had a huge number of food scares. Salmonella in eggs really got the business going. Then there was listeria in cheese and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in beef. The most recent scare involved dioxins. The agency is intended to res-establish public confidence in food, and that is what it should do. If it goes too wide however, the public will become totally confused. I worry about that because there are two possible outcomes: either the public will start to ignore the agency's advice, which is undesirable, or their diet will become so narrow and so focused on foods that can be guaranteed as safe--if anything in this world can be--that a poor diet will become established.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have seen such things before. Those whose memories go back to during and just after the war will know that public health started to suffer when food was rationed and the public diet was not as varied as it should have been. As food was gradually derationed--it was completely derationed only in about 1956--public health started to improve and, mercifully, life expectancy began increasing. That is what I want in this country.
<P>
We should not have too much nutritional advice from the agency. When that happens, Governments tend to have food fads and to react to the latest research, whether it is established or not. A typical example, which will appeal to every member of the Committee, is the question of whether red wine is good for one. I enjoy red wine, as I am sure that most members of the Committee do. For a long time, it was thought to be good for reducing heart diseases. I certainly take that view and will continue to do so. All things are good in moderation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): In moderation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Indeed. I would not expect members of the Committee to indulge to liberally in the vine, and I am sure that they never have and never will. I advise everybody to imbibe in moderation, and we were told for a long time that it was good to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Will my hon. Friend give the Committee his view of moderation?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Not at any great length.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. We are allowed to drink only water in Committee, which is a great pity. In the interests of diet and food safety, those responsible might consider allowing members of the Committee to drink at least coffee or tea. I am sure that that would improve the Committee's workings enormously. If that happened, of course, we would not be allowed to have any sugar because of the obesity factor. I support the dairy industry, but even milk might be bad because of the cholesterol. We must, therefore, be careful.
<P>
There is a serious point in all that. My comments show how difficult it will be for the Government to give nutritional advice through the Food Standards Agency. I am a great believer in giving individuals information and letting them make their own decisions. That is the role of the Health Education Authority. If the authority does not work effectively, its remit should be altered so that it does. In that way, school children or adults at the health surgery or the hospital can be given the right advice, and it will be up to them to take it. When people remove their food from the fridge, however, the Government will be able to do nothing about it--the choice is the individual's.
<P>
On the whole, individuals make pretty good choices. They can assess risks. The other purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the Food Standards Agency puts across to the public in a way that they understand the risks that they are taking.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I will just finish this point because it is important. When the Government banned beef on the bone, they sent the totally wrong signal about its dangers. After all, when Sainsburys halved the price of its stakes at the height of the BSE scare, the public took the risk into account and Sainsburys sold out of those stakes by the end of the day. The public should be given the information so that they can assess the risk and make the decision.
<P>
As for beef on the bone, I understand that there are only 35 cases a year of new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We do not know what risks we are storing up for ourselves in total, but one is a thousand times more likely to be struck by lightening than to die of new variant CJD contracted from eating beef on the bone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It would be catastrophic if the message went out from the Committee that there is possible infectivity in meat. There is not, but that is the impression that the hon. Gentleman gives about steak. Beef on the bone is a separate issue and involves the nervous tissue. There has never been any risk or any evidence regarding the blood, muscle and the milk. I have to make that absolutely clear because the implications of the hon. Gentleman's remarks are totally wrong. He also throws around figures about the number of deaths that have occurred. There have been 42 deaths from new-variant CJD in total--not 35 a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am delighted that the Minister has clarified a number of points in his intervention. First, he misrepresented what I said. I did not say that there was infectivity in beef. Secondly, he has clarified to an even greater extent the folly of banning beef on the bone. If there have been only 42 deaths in total from new-variant CJD, and there is more risk of dying when crossing a road or from smoking, it is nonsense for the Government to ban beef on the bone. The sooner the Government end the ban on beef on the bone, the better it will be for producers and consumers. I know an awful lot of consumers who would like to eat it, and I believe it to be folly, and completely unnecessary, to continue the ban.
<P>
The agency has a key role to play in the important issue of risk. The amendments are eminently sensible. They may not be technically in the best order, but I hope that the Government will consider them carefully, and consider the role and remit of the Food Standards Agency.
<P>
The element of risk must be properly and easily understood by the public. In our debate, the Minister has been trying to clarify the issue, but whereas members of the Committee understand terms such as "nerve ganglia" because we are more expert in the subject, I doubt whether the average member of the public would have a clue. So the agency has a remit to put over clearly what risk is involved in eating beef on the bone, or even beef not on the bone. In my view, the risk is incredibly small. We should get back to normality and the senible eating of beef as soon as possible.
<P>
This is an extremely important Bill. The upside of creating the agency is huge, but if it becomes too bureaucratic and too wide in its remit, it will cease to be as effective as it might be. I hope that the Minister will carefully consider the amendments, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> May I join other members of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr Gale. I look forward to the expeditious examination of this Bill under your chairmanship.
<P>
I suspect that it will come as no surprise to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border to know that the Government cannot accept amendment No. 89. All the amendments in the group would distort the agency's main objectives. The tone of this debate has been good-natured, with an intelligent examination of the realistic scope and limit of the agency's role, and I should like to respond to some of the points that have been made.
<P>
Amendment No. 89 would substantially reduce the scope of the agency's main objectives by excluding nutrition and food standards from its brief, so that it would be an agency for food safety only. However, the policy that we carefully developed in preparing the Bill makes it clear that the role is that of a food standards agency--that is why we are considering a food standards Bill.
<P>
Hon. Members have raised the issue of nutrition, articulating the cases for its inclusion in, and exclusion from, the Bill. That reflects the debate that took place in the course of drafting the White Paper. My hon. Friend the Minister of State and I dealt with those points when we appeared before the Select Committee. Nutrition is not a single issue--it is an umbrella term that comprises some 21 different functions. In our judgment, there is broad support for the kind of division of responsibility that we have proposed. The functions that are concerned with the composition of food, the nutrient balance of food and information on what constitutes a balanced diet should play a role in the agency's responsibilities in relation to nutrition. Other functions regarding nutrition are central to the major health promotion responsibilities of the Department of Health. The White Paper, "A Force for Change", made it clear that in some areas the agency and the Department of Health will work together. We made a judgment about the way in which, and the extent to which, nutrition should be included in the Bill. Having subjected the proposals to extensive consultation, we believe that we have the balance about right.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The question of whether the agency has a role in nutrition goes to the heart of its function. How would the Minister's Department react if she commissioned a piece of research that showed a particular way of providing knowledge, while the agency--which I understand is to be independent of the Government, although we may have some debate about that later--commissioned a different piece of research that showed a different result. What would happen in that event?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> What the hon. Gentleman describes may arise at any time. Ultimately, having accepted a risk assessment, it is for Ministers to make the judgment, and the existence of the agency will not change that. The agency will seek advice from the expert committees that work to it and provide advice to Ministers arising from the considerations of those expert committees. It will then be for Ministers to accept or reject that advice as they see fit. The situation that the hon. Gentleman suggests is not a new dilemma created by the agency: it already exists. As Ministers, we have to make judgments about what may be competing scientific evidence. We are careful to do everything that we can to ensure that the scientific evidence that forms the basis for policy is robust, rigorous, peer-reviewed and broadly supported by the relevant part of the scientific community. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Will the right hon. Lady reflect on the words that she has just used? As I understand what she said, it will be for Ministers to decide. The agency will provide Ministers with advice, and Ministers will decide whether to accept it. That goes to the heart of the whole issue of the role and function of the agency. Who will actually make the decisions and provide advice to the public? If Ministers are to make the decisions--as they did on the beef-on-the-bone issue, for example--we have not taken any steps forward.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman raises a slightly different point from that raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). The agency will have the power to publish its advice--directly to the public if necessary. The agency will advise Ministers where there is an implication for legislation.
<P>
Where the issue concerns providing information to the public--for example, providing more lucid labelling to ensure that the public better understand the nutrient content of food--that will clearly fall within the agency's remit. Where the issue concerns advice on the nature of the causal relationship between cancer and diet, for instance, such advice will be provided to both the agency and Ministers by COMA. If the agency then wanted to provide further advice to Ministers in the light of COMA's deliberations, it would still be for Ministers to make judgment. In such circumstances, Ministers would also be able to seek the view of the chief medical officer.
<P>
Let me emphasise that those arrangements will not be changed by the existence of the agency. Receiving advice and making judgments on it are, as the hon. Gentleman will be well aware, matters that Ministers must deal with every day. The debate has clearly reflected how, especially in the matter of food, the public can be confused by what appears to be conflicting or contradictory advice. I fully accept that that is a problem, but it is to some extent beyond the reach of the Government.
<P>
However, what both the agency and Ministers can do is ensure that where a public view is formed about a particular food health scare, the evidential basis on which conclusions are reached is sound and reliable--and, where it is not, that that fact is made clear to the public. That is where confusion arises, and that is why, to return to our mechanisms for receiving scientific advice and acting on recommendations of expert committees, we set such high standards for those who are recruited to sit on those bodies and for the quality of advice that they provide.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): This is a crucial point about whether the Bill will improve public confidence in food safety. I draw to the Minister's mind the decision taken on beef on the bone, where the scientific body presented the Government with three options which were made public knowledge, and the Minister then plumped for one. The gap between the range of options and what was finally chosen has done nothing to improve the level of public confidence in the decision that was taken. How will that be altered by the way in which the agency will operate?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> hon. Members have dwelt on the way in which risk is assessed, managed and communicated. Clearly, the communication and management of risk are key issues in public health and are of increasing importance. They will be a significant part of the way in which the agency will address its role and function.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Meriden can contain herself, she will see in the new health White Paper that is to be published shortly clear statements about the principles governing the management of risk in this area. Essentially, those principles rely on decisions being based on the best available scientific evidence--excluding the possibility of a health scare--and the often tricky assessment of whether the risk in question is one that individuals should be free to take in the knowledge that a risk exists, or whether, as was rightly the case in relation to beef on the bone, broader public health protection is required in order to protect the public from, for example, new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, with its largely misunderstood nature of transmission. New-variant CJD is a dreadful disease. Little is known about its epidemiology. The decision to ban beef on the bone for a period--not forever--was taken as part of the Government's broader range of measures to protect the population as comprehensively as we could from new variant CJD. When it is clear that that risk has reduced as a result of the measures that we have taken, the ban will be lifted. The beef-on-the-bone ban should not be seen in isolation, but in the context of a range of measures to protect the public from what in some cases--for example, the leukodepletion of blood--is a theoretical risk of transmission of new-variant CJD.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> It is clear that scientific evidence is important. However, we should be clear that, most of the time, scientists do not have black and white answers. It would be helpful if, when they gave evidence, scientists were prepared to say that they just do not know. Many are prepared to do that. There are still people who do not think that prions cause BSE; others think that the AIDS virus does not exist and that something else causes AIDS. That is the nature of science.
<P>
It is, therefore, right that final decisions lie with Ministers, who will consider the public perception of the risks and the scientific evidence--whether consensual or not--but will then make a political decision based on public safety and the long-term effect of the risk in question. This provision strengthens the agency's independence so that it can make decisions and give evidence without feeling compelled by politicians to come to a decision. All the other factors must be in the political domain.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> No, I must make some progress, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me.
<P>
I accept the general principle of the amendments--the agency can do only what is reasonably practical. However, including a requirement for reasonably practical action is unnecessary because clause 23 requires the agency to act proportionately, considering risk, cost and benefits in the discharge of its function. Including giving advice to the public in the main objective is also unnecessary because that task is already covered in the general functions of the agency. Doing that would also give the wrong emphasis--the public want an agency that can take necessary action within the framework of the general functions to protect consumers. Giving advice is just one part of that work.
<P>
Amendment No. 92 would restrict the agency's role to major risks; that would represent a limitation on the agency's main objective and could undermine its ability to act effectively in protecting public health. Amendment No. 1, however, would have the opposite effect--it would add all risks, including irrelevant ones, to the agency;s core remit. The agency should rightly devote its main energy to dealing with major risks. The amendment implies that the agency should take less seriously risks that seem insignificant; however, when better understood, they may turn out to have been serious. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is surely a case in point.
<P>
It is important to recognise that it is sometimes difficult to identify major risks. For example, foods containing peanuts or extracts of other nuts may present a life-threatening risk to some people, but are harmless to the majority. The agency should not try to give advice except in situations in which the impact of such advice would be on the majority. It would be wrong to qualify the agency's main objective in that way because it should not have to wait until major risks become reality. As the Bill makes clear, it should be free to take timely and proportionate action.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 2 and 90 would not add to the meaning of the clause--it already covers risks caused by the growing, storage and use of food.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I do not want to complete our conversation of the group of amendments without having one further try to see whether, with the Minister, we can clarify the role of the agency. Unless that is absolutely clear, the agency's message will be blurred and its effectiveness will be less.
<P>
I offer the Minister the example of a bottle of water so that we may consider whether nutritional advice should be included in the agency's functions. The function of the agency should surely be to say whether the water in the bottle is safe to drink, and whether it contains dioxins or other poisons. Its function should not be to say that one should drink a certain quantity of water each day--that is a different function, one of nutrition, and should not be included in the agency's role. If the two functions are lumped together, the agency's message will be blurred and the public will not understand the agency's purpose.

<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that the agency's role should be to ensure that the details of mineral content on labels are accurate and easy for the public to understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister has failed to understand what I said. Whether water in a bottle is safe and the contents of that water is absolutely the concern of the agency; it should not be involved in questions of nutrition, or in telling us how much we should drink or whether we should drink carbonated water. Those functions are different; if we lump the two functions together within the role of the agency, the public will not understand the agency's purpose.
<P>
<B>Ms. Jowell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a meal of the matter--[
Interruption
]--or a drink of it. Yes, the agency's function will be to ensure that labelling concerning mineral content or other matters is clear and effective. Yes, there is a general duty to ensure that water provided for sale is free from risk, although I hope that the debate has exposed the extent to which one may never say never in this context. If risk is identified, mechanisms will be in place to ensure that contaminated water is removed from sale. Yes, the agency will have the role of providing information about a balanced diet. However, I entirely agree with the point made by several Conservative Members that, if the agency is perceived as nagging, intrusive and bossy, removing from people responsibilities that they want to exercise on their own behalf, it will fail in its purpose.

<P>
It is important to be clear that clause 1, which we have debated at some length, is the mission statement for the agency, setting out the broad framework within which it will operate. However, the guiding principles are, as it were, threaded throughout the Bill. In the area of public health, success relies on the Government being clear about the extent and limit of their action--acting where only Government can act and staying out of matters of personal choice. However, success also relies on effective local enforcement and implementation in a range of areas beyond the specific remit of the Food Standards Agency. Getting that relationship and the relationship with the public right will be essential to the agency's credibility. To return to where we started, we have sought to include in the bill a balance of responsibility, so that the agency will attract public support by having credibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I want to challenge what the Minister said about amendment No. 2. She said that it was unnecessary because the current phraseology of production and supply includes how food is grown. I am obviously happy to accept that assurance, but I had hoped that she would answer my question about genetic modification. What role will be played in that matter by the agency and Ministers? My amendment was intended to draw that out from the Minister, and I should be grateful if she would spend a moment explaining that to us.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The agency will be the United Kingdom regulatory authority in relation to food. In relation to genetic modification, it will take on the functions presently carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The reason that we do not accept the amendment is that, as I said in my opening remarks, it would add nothing to the clause as drafted. "Grown" is already contained within the meaning of "produced".
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I said at the start that the amendments were exploratory, and did not necessarily represent the view of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, but were based on my own observation and experience. That will also be the case with future amendments. I am slightly disappointed by the Minister's reply, although I am ambivalent about it. [Interruption.] I shall explain that in a moment. My observations have the balance that we must have in our diet.
<P>
My concern is that the Food Standards Agency should achieve its primary purpose, which I still consider to be ensuring food safety. The agency will perform no better a job than do the present MFF directories and the Department of Health individually.
<P>
As the Minister has said on many occasions, they do an excellent job, as far as it is reasonably practicable, in protecting the public from the known risks, be they chemical, microbiological, radiological or genetic.
<P>
One of the agency's purpose is a presentational one. It will be distinct from MAFF, thus ending the perception that MAFF is in the pocket of the farmers, and from the Department of Health, resulting in an independent, freestanding agency that will be perceived as doing a better job. That may be the case, and it may succeed. Nevertheless, the scientific base will be no better and no worse than that which both Departments have now. The quality of advice will continue to be excellent, and among the best in the world.
<P>
The scientific base will continue to be excellent, and I am sure that the Food Standards Agency will develop a reasonable reputation, and try to be in the forefront of protecting the public from safety risks in food. However, it will be slightly undermined if the agency goes down the nutritional route, although I shall be happy to be proved wrong. When, as Minister, I received food safety advice from MAFF or advice on microbiological contamination from the Department of Health, it was excellent as science--it was as good as it could possibly be, although the usual caveats would be built in that one should never say never, and that one can never prove the negative. I apologise to the Minister for Public Health for insulting her Department, but when the Department of Health gave nutritional advice it went slightly off the wall. Perhaps it was overly influenced by some of the fanatics outside, who all had different views on nutrition, diet and health.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister of State, like you, Mr. Gale, studies Good Housekeeping;  it is important for a Minister with responsibility for food. The quality of nutritional advice available in that magazine is second to none. I suspect that is lifted mainly from McCance and Widdowson, and is based on MAFF and Department of Health research. I learned 10 years ago that it is important to peruse Cosmopolitan--for food safety advice of course--New Woman, Company Magazine and a range of other publications, but, because of trends and fads, the advice has become slightly less scientific. It is a long time since I read some of the teenage magazines aimed at 15, 16, 17 and  18-year olds; I read them 10 years ago only for ministerial purposes. If they are any worse now than they were then, those writers must be giving youngsters crackpot advice about what they should eat and what is good for them.
<P>
On the one hand, we have expert  scientific advice from MAFF and the Department of Health, which the agency will have. We shall have some expert nutritional advice, but still with all the caveats, because the nutritional advice is not nearly as certain as the microbiological advice--not by a long chalk. There is still an awful lot of doubt. That nutritional advice will be influenced by outside people and bodies, some of them vested interests but others will be obsessed with certain views on food.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> How does the hon. Gentleman rate my friend Delia Smith on cooking and eating, and all that stuff? She could change the world with one statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is correct. It is a long time since I was officially involved, but I rated her quite highly, as she advocated a sensible, balanced diet. I have no criticism of her food safety techniques, not that I studied them closely.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me for my view. I read Delia Smith's latest cookbook and I think that her nutritional advice is sensible.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> How long does it take to boil an egg?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> A good point. To my satisfaction, it would take seven minutes, because I like really hard boiled eggs.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gibson:</B> Exposed!
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a limit to the amount of culinary advice to which I shall allow the Committee to be subjected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The hon. Member for Norwich, North raised an interesting facet of food. He may prefer soft boiled eggs or medium boiled eggs. I hate soft boiled eggs and have a row with the canteen every time I get them, but that is my preference. One can consider any plate of food from a safety point of view even if one is merely preparing mayonnaise. Food safety advice is reasonably scientific in that scientists know the minimum temperature to remove all traces of salmonella--I think that 70 deg for two minutes is roughly correct. Food safety advice on eggs and other products can be specific, but nutrition is a personal matter that is influenced by outside trends and fads.
<P>
I do not want the food safety professionalism of those in the agency to be undermined by its taking a nutritional route too heavily. However, I am afraid that it will not be able to resist issuing advice on a range of subjects, and it will be perceived as a nagging nanny and as wrong. It is possible to be wrong about food safety. On the nutrition side, it is 10 times easier to be perceived as having given wrong advice or for there to be equally good alternative advice.
<P>
I would be happier if the FSA were given a remit to give advice on our life style as well as our diet, in addition to giving food nutrition advice. However, I do not think that it will be. It will therefore be obsessed with dealing with the food side of our bad life styles rather than the fact that we do not take enough exercise. Part of the problem that we have at the moment with obesity is that more and more people do not exercise as much as in the past, so there is a search for the holy grail of a magic foodstuff that will allow us to sit on our backsides for the whole day, enjoy a good meal and sufficient wine and not get fat.
<P>
The FSA will be able to concentrate on only the part of the equation related to the foods we should eat to try to prevent heart attacks, cancer of the bowel and other illnesses and ailments regarded as associated with diet. However, it will not concentrate on the main risks of heart attacks, obesity and such problems, which are the lack of exercise and the stress in our life styles. The agency will merely add to the perception that the way in which we shall make ourselves live happily and healthily for ever is to change our diets and do nothing else.
<P>
I appeal to Ministers that if they are to add the subject of food nutrition to the FSA and persuade people of the need for a balanced diet, somehow they must also beef up the subject of healthier life styles and try to make everyone in the country a few stone lighter. Perhaps the agency is not the right body for that. I said that I was ambivalent about that subject. For the sake of the FSA, I hope that the Government leave out the nutritional aspect. For political purposes, I hope that they include it. If the FSA has a nutrition brief, it will be unable to resist advising on everything, and very soon, it will take a rather fanatical approach to telling the public what is right and what is wrong, and it will nag us to death. I intend to make as much political capital out of that as possible. I shall not regard it as the independent FSA's doing but will say, "I told you so. It's this Government, nagging us to death about food."
<P>
The Government may be making a political mistake. That is why I am ambivalent and why I shall not press my amendment to a vote. Having made my point in trying to defend the integrity and scientific base of the FSA, I am happy to allow the Minister to take all the bad political repercussions of nagging us into an early grave before the obesity does it first. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 91, in page 1, line 13, leave out from "supplied', to end of line 14.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 77, in page 1, line 13, after "to', insert "promote and'. 
<P>
No. 93, in page 1, line 13, leave out "the interests of'.
<P>
No. 3, in page 1, line 13, after "of', insert "the public and'.
<P>
No. 98, in clause 2, page 2, line 10, leave out "interests of consumers' and insert "associated risks'.
<P>
We have already had a wide-ranging discussion. I hope that the Committee will now feel able to concentrate strictly on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I can be reasonably brief in speaking to these amendments. I apologise for having strayed on to them in my opening remarks on the first group of amendments. We have already covered their general principle. I apologise for having mentioned consumers' interests in my opening remarks. I mixed up my amendments; we started more quickly than I had anticipated.
<P>
What are consumer's interests? I touched on them earlier. One important interest is the price of food. Will the agency play a role in the price of food? Many of us would be happy if it did.
<P>
The agency will also be responsible for wine and drink, which constitute food. Consumers' interests in relation to food in terms of alcohol and wine are often different from food safety interests. Of course we want to ensure that wine is safe; we do not want the French to put too many chemicals in it, and we do not want alcohol to contain other toxins apart from alcohol. Nevertheless, some of our anxieties about wine and alcohol relate not to food safety but to distribution or supply. At the moment, anxieties relate to illegal imports flooding the market and undermining retail outlets. That is a legitimate interest of consumers. The Minister may say that the fact that people are bringing in hundreds of tonnes of illegal booze through customs and selling it in pubs or shops, under the counter, is not a food safety matter. Nevertheless, it deeply affects consumers and--one of their interests--to acquire alcohol at a reasonable price.
<P>
The Minister frowns slightly. Including a phrase to provide that the agency should consider consumers' interests does not limit it purely to food safety. I have tried to limit it to other consumer interests associated with food safety. That would prevent the agency from being, perhaps unwillingly, dragged by the media and the great and the good, who examine the terms of reference and have a bee in their bonnet about the price of food or about alleged supermarket cartels, into taking an interest in such matters.
<P>
The agency's terms of reference are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
--in relation not to food safety or associated risk but to any aspect of food. That phraseology could result in the agency's having a remit that goes much wider than food safety, food standards or nutrition, and becoming involved in matters relating to the packaging or wrapping of food, the pricing of food or supply outlets for wine and alcohol, for example.
<P>
The Minister may try to reassure me that that is not the case, but unless he can give me firm, legal advice that the phraseology of the subsection cannot be more specific than a reference to protecting consumers' interests on food safety risks or to the nutrition brief, the clause deals with too wide a remit.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Following the good example of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, I also wish to declare an interest that stands in the register: I am a non-remunerated director of an agricultural and biotechnological consultancy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> An expert.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Fifteen years' worth of experience.
<P>
Clause 1 is a very important clause which sets out the scope of the Bill. We are grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for giving us time to examine the clause closely because it will set the parameters for much of the ensuing discussion. I shall speak to amendment No. 3, which deals with that scope. We had some discussion of that under the previous group of amendments, but I wish to return to several points that were made. The point of inserting "the public", as well as "consumers", has all to do with giving the agency a paramount preventative role. We have supported the concept of the FSA because, in common with the Government we want a reduction in the incidence of food poisoning, which is statistically proven to have risen, and for the agency to be effective. However, we do not want it to be confined to the firefighting role of simply addressing incidents as they occur, learning lessons from mistakes. We want it to be pre-emptive--hence the emphasis on the public and on consumers, because they take several decisions before food is consumed. Each of those decisions should be guided by and fall within the remit of the agency. Shoppers in supermarkets face many choices. Long before the food is consumed, a shopper will look at a pack of meat, for example, examine the label, try to find out--often in vain--the country of origin, which is pertinent to food poisoning, of which there have been a number of very sad cases. A shopper is often unsure about whether to take a product off the shelf, buy it and take it home to cook and about whether it will be safe.
<P>
The amendment therefore ensures that the agency will have a preventative, pre-emptive role. Provision on labelling is very weak in present legislation; the country of origin is particularly important and needs to be tackled, as does the question of how a product has been produced. At the moment, shoppers and consumers have incomplete information on methods of production. For example, well-known, high-quality food retail outlets sell processed products such as chicken kiev that state that the product was made in Britain. That is true in a limited sense, but the meat has often been imported from countries that use substances in the production of meat that are banned here. At the moment, a shopper in a British supermarket is not privy to such information. That is the kind of role that we would like the agency increasingly to take on.
<P>
I was particularly interested to hear the Minister say something that is of extreme interest to consumers because it deals with a topical and important technological development. The agency will become the new regulatory authority for genetically modified food. During our proceedings, we shall explore the subject in more detail, but my immediate worry is how the agency will relate to the existing bodies--the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the new Agriculture and Environment Commission, which includes the members of the public. How does the Minister envisage that relationship working out? It might have some bearing on the amendment that deals with the interests of the public even before they reach the stage of consuming food.
<P>
As for the scope of the agency in protecting the interests of the public, I refer to the example of the dioxins in Belgian products that was cited by my hon. Friend for South-East Cambridgeshire. Will the Minister consider the limitations of the agency under the Bill? Will it be able to avoid the difficulties that surround the Belgian dioxin scare and the imported food that posed a threat to British public food safety? Will its remit cover similar cases of imported contaminated products?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon. Lady mentioned the possibility of chicken kievs containing substances that were used in the production of chicken abroad. If she was not thinking specifically of the Belgian dioxin problem, can she explain exactly what pollution she meant? I assume that she was talking about Thai or south-east Asian chicken. What risks do such products pose to people? Health scares often come about because of insufficient evidence.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am willing to allow the hon. Lady to reply but we shall be discussing imported foods at some length under a new clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I was thinking of the growth promoters used in the production of Thai chicken and the fact that they have been banned from being used by producers here.
<P>
The Belgium example is different for supermarkets here, but it is a useful analogy. When public information was issued about that contamination, it was unclear which products might have been at risk and whether Belgian egg products had been incorporated into the produce that shoppers might buy, and whether the meat itself was contaminated. There were rumours within the industry of problems on the Belgian production side as early as March, yet the guidance and the Minister's statement was not issued officially until the end of May.
<P>
In the interests of protecting the public, will the agency be able to do a better job by tracking down the evidence for such a rumour in a production line in a foreign country? If not, would not the confidence of shoppers in supermarkets be undermined if the FSA's remit was so constrained? We feel strongly that, unless we learn from such examples, as we did from the Belgian example in a reactive way, we will not be successful in crafting an agency that can prevent accidents from happening that, sadly, sometimes lead to fatalities. The amendment would widen the scope of agency to make sure that it is really effective and an improvement on what we already have.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): It is a pleasure to be serving on my first Standing Committee, Mr. Gale, under your chairmanship. I have taken on board your advice about speeding up our proceedings. I shall do my best to contribute to that process, because I have done a little calculation. The Bill contains approximately 1,450 lines, and at our present rate we would finish our deliberations in about 43 and a half days. Even if we sat on Saturdays and Sundays we would not get there in time. [Interruption.] I do not know whether verbal diarrhoea is contagious. If it is, I shall find out in a moment whether I have caught it. I hope not.
<P>
The amendment would require the agency to be proactive rather than reactive with regard to public safety and nutritional advice. The agency's main objective should be strengthened to include the active promotion of public health. Protection of public health is not enough: the agency should anticipate and champion the needs of good health and good nutrition. Nutritional advice is advice only--it is not regulation. We are not in a nanny state, and people can take such advice or leave it. That is not the same as banning beef on the bone, about which Liberal Democrat Members take a different view from that of the Government. However, we have already had that argument.
<P>
Many young parents--some of whom would have been in primary school at the time when the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border was reading the nutritional advice that was available in magazines--require nutritional advice. They get advice from companies saying, "Your baby needs our product", but they do not get much in the way of independent nutritional advice at a critical stage in their child's life. It would be appropriate for the agency to promote good health and good nutrition, and I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.

<P>

<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I shall deal briefly with the amendments, and at a little more length with some of the substantive points that have been raised. 
<P>
We cannot accept amendment No. 91, which would substantially reduce the scope of the agency's main objective by omitting food standards matters. Amendment No. 98 is similar in that it would restrict the description of the main objective in clause 2, which deals with appointments to the agency. The agency cannot take effective action to protect consumers unless it is able to act on food standards as well as food safety. For example, labelling matters such as ingredients listing and nutritional information are important in helping consumers to make informed choices about food. There was overwhelming support for a food standards remit in all three rounds of public consultation. Changing the main objective in the way that has been proposed would be unjustified, and unwelcome to the many people who responded to the consultation process.
<P>
Amendment No. 98 would change clause 2 by limiting the skills and experience required of members to food safety and associated risks. It is vital that the membership of the agency contains a good mix of skills and experience, and the appropriate authority must consider those when appointing members of the agency. Having said that, members will not be appointed to represent the interests of particular sectors.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 deals with the important matter of the promotion of food safety and public health. It would have the opposite effect to that of amendment No. 91 in that it would draw the main objective more broadly than we believe to be necessary. The way in which the agency's main objective is defined in clause 1 provides a sound legal basis for it to carry out the role of health promotion with regard to food as described in the White Paper. The agency's main role is to protect the interests of consumers in food safety, nutrition and other food standards matters. That does not preclude the agency from being involved in health promotion matters but it is not, in itself, a health promotion body. 
<P>
The agency will work with other health promotion bodies such as the Health Education Authority, the Health Education Board for Scotland and the National Assembly for Wales to run publicity campaigns on food safety and nutrition matters, all of which are important ways of protecting public health. However, the key health promotion body is the Department of Health.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> May I have some clarification as to whether the current promotion activity of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has a substantial promotional budget to go round game fairs and country fairs giving advice on how to cook food, will continue under the agency, and is that not promotion?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall discuss that later in the Bill, but if the Minister wishes to respond briefly, she may.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> The priority is one of protection. That is why it is stated as part of the main objective in clause 1. However, it does not exclude any involvement in promotion. On that basis, we believe that the wording strikes the right balance.
<P>
The agency will have a clear role on nutrition, providing factual information on the nutrient content of individual foods and on what constitutes a balance diet. The agency will also be able to give advice on the nutritional aspects of the food chain, including production and monitoring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I accept that under the present wording of the clause, nutrition would be included. Can the hon. lady confirm that the term "the interests of consumers" would allow the agency a legal right to become involved in issues relating to the price of food to consumers if it wished to do so?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> No, I do not accept that. The important point to which I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention is that the interests of consumers of food should be read in the context of the main objective, which sets the broad scope for the agency's remit. That makes it clear, as do the rest of the functions in the Bill, that the agency's responsibilities will be for matters related to food safety and consumption of food rather than the state of the consumer's pocket.
<P>
Amendment No. 93 would essentially add nothing of substance to the Bill. If the agency's main objective includes the protection of consumers, it can be taken as read that that includes their interests as consumers.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 would also broaden the agency's objectives and is inappropriate. It would bring in the economic and environmental interests of consumers, which are not intended to form part of the agency's remit as agreed in the responses to the White Paper. 
<P>
In concluding what has been a very full debate about the extent of the agency's remit, I underline the importance that the Government attach to the remit being clearly focused on food standards and safety. Broadening the agency's scope would run the risk of confusion with the health promotion responsibilities of the Department of Health and, as a number of right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned, of the Health Education Authority.
<P>
Before I sit down, I want to deal with the question of the hon. Member for Meriden about dioxins, because it is important to make it clear how the agency would handle such a hazard. Essentially, the mechanism and responsibilities that led to MAFF's prompt response in that case would be transferred to the agency.
<P>
Success in such instances relies on the agency not only establishing good communication and working relationships with other members of the commission, but ensuring that, when a section 13 order is required, information about potential hazards is gathered quickly and advice is prepared for Ministers at the earliest possible opportunity. As MAFF and Department of Health officials did in relation to dioxins, so the Food Standards Agency will do in the future.
<P>
The agency will advise on the preparation of emergency orders and then liaise with the enforcement authorities to ensure that the letter of the enforcement order was followed through in practice. All those steps were taken in relation to the handling of the recent dioxins food scare. The responsibilities that were exercised by MAFF then will be taken over by the agency.
<P>
<B>Mr.  Maclean:</B> Again, we have had a worthwhile debate. I too welcome the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) to his first ever Standing Committee. I appreciate the difficulty under which he labours as a member of the Liberal Democrat party. He complained about potential verbal diarrhoea in the Committee, but, as I am not guilty of that, I thought that I would explain the difficulty that the hon. Gentleman faces.
<P>
On the one hand, as the Liberal Democrat party has a pact with the Labour party, on the Floor of the House unquestioning and unthinking adulation amounting to thorough brown-nosing is the order of the day. However, once the hon. Gentlemam is on a Standing Committee he must wear a different hat. He must caution the Government--at length if necessary--to try to winkle out some of the deep concerns that we may have about aspects of the Bill.
<P>
It is not worth pressing the Minister on this matter, but the hon. Member for St. Ives was wrong when he said that there was a dearth of nutritional advice for young parents. I do not suppose that the Government would have reduced dramatically the nutritional advice that the Department of Health or MAFF may be giving, nor do I think that on 2 May 1997 the Minister automatically shredded all MAFF's and the Department of Health's leaflets on nutrition.
<P>
There is not a dearth of nutritional advice. Both Departments have issued a tremendous amount of such advice. The hon. Gentleman may say that it may not be perceived as being independent and that no one reads it, but I always think that part of the problem with nutritional advice that is issued by Government Departments is that words of wisdom recommending a balanced diet and warning about certain issues can be grossly misinterpreted by various food writers with bees in their bonnets. Such advice can be confusing when it gets in to the hands of end users. I suspect that the Food Standards Agency will be in no better position; people will be no more inclined to believe its advice than the advice that they get in the back pages of some newspapers or magazines.
<P>
That was by way of reply to the hon. Member for St. Ives; I did not want to press the Minister on that.
<P>
I am disappointed with the Minister's response to the main thrust of my amendment. I am not happy that she gave me the correct legal interpretation of the phrase
<P>

because I suspect that it goes much wider than the Minister said. Of course, the agency's main objective is to protect public health from risks arising from the consumption of food, but I remain unconvinced by the Minister's explanation of those words. I do not want to criticise her legal advice, but it could be subject to question in another place and we may have to come back to the matter on Report. I want to take further legal advice myself. I suspect that the words

<P>
widens the clause beyond giving advice on food safety and food standards. That might allow the agency to concern itself with any interests that consumers have in relation to food, key among which being the price of food. Today is not the day on which to pursue the point, but I give notice that I may wish to return to it.

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I sense that the right hon. Gentleman is about to utter the magic works "seek leave to withdraw". Saying that would prevent my answering a question from the hon. Member for Meriden which I would like to put clearly on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was not about to withdraw the amendment--I assume that the Minister might want to reply briefly to my points. Without further ado, I conclude my remarks for the moment.

<B>Ms Jowell:</B> I simply add to my earlier remarks in relation to the agency's responsibility for genetic modification. It is important to be clear that there will be three new regulatory bodies--the Human Genetics Commission, the Agriculture and Environment Commission and the Food Standards Agency. Once the agency comes into being, it will carry the responsibility currently being held by the putative Agriculture and Environment Commission for genetically modified food. I think that that completes the answer, but perhaps it does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I hope that the Minister will expand on that response a little. Her earlier remark, which she seems now to be qualifying or expanding--
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> Explaining.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I do not want to bandy about such pedantry. The Minister said earlier that the Food standards Agency would be taking on the current roles of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regarding genetically modified food. She has now referred to the three bodies that will come into existence. I am still unclear about the hierarchy of responsibility between the Food Standards Agency and the new Agriculture and Environment Commission, and about who will make decisions on issues such as the labelling of genetically modified crops, or whether a particular new food involving genetic modification should be licenced for sale. The consumer and the housewife need to know, while drawing their scribbles, the division of responsibility and who will ultimately carry the can for actions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It may help--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I wish to try to answer briefly the point of the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and to refer to the documents that we published on the same day as we published the report of the chief medical officer and the chief scientific officer.
<P>
We published a document as a result of our overseeing of biotechnology issues across Whitehall through the Cabinet Committee announced on 17 December. There are currently more than a dozen advisory committees, crossing over issues of medicine, food and the environment. In that document was the proposal for three commissions although, unfortunately, the term "commission" is not used consistently throughout. The Human Genetics Commission will deal essentially with medicines. The Agriculture and Environment Commission will be overarching stakeholder body. Adverts will appear this week asking for members of that body. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment will remain the scientific advisory committee on releases to the environment--there will be no change. However, the Agriculture and Environment Commission's overarching view will come from a wider spectrum because many non-scientist lay people will sit on that body. What might be called the board of the Food Standards Agency--the name is not in the Bill for legal reasons--will form the commission on food in respect of biotechnology.
<P>
The Advisory Committee on Novel foods and Processes remains in place to give regulatory approval, and the Food Advisory Committee remains. They will pass from MAFF to the Food Standards Agency and will form part of its scientific input. The first advertisements appeared on Sunday for members of the agency. It will contain public interests, and will not be a scientific body. It will be like the two other commissions. That is the pattern that we set out at the end of May, when we published the document.
<P>
It is unfortunate that the Bill will set up the agency, while different procedures, which do not require legislation, will set up the two other commissions. Obviously, the agency is a different ball game because MAFF's powers on food safety and on food, environmental and animal health are being passed to it. None the less, its board will play the same role as the Agriculture and Environment Commission and the Human Genetics Commission. However, the scientific advisory committees will remain, and the agency will be able to change, merge or abolish them, create new committees, or change terms of reference. That is an important distinguishing feature of the agency's as the overarching commission.
<P>
We may return to that. I hope, however, that I have set the issue in context. We have added nothing to what the Government have already announced.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I had better set theCommittee in order. I ruled the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border out of order on the understanding that the Minister for Public Health had given way. The Minister of State then spoke, however, so she had clearly resumed her seat. The official record will need to show that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border asked whether the agency could deal with the price of food. We have made it clear that the agency's objectives in clause 1 are intentionally broad. As we progress through the Bill, we will clarify how they are to be translated into more specific functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> No, I shall just finish this point. 
<P>
Clause 22 puts an obligation on the agency to prepare a detailed statement of objectives.
<P>
The titles of the Bill and the agency refer to food standards, which means that they deal expressly with the safety and standards of food. The agency will not deal with issues such as price, which are irrelevant to its considerations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was concluding my remarks before we had our interesting little interlude. As I draw to a conclusion, I invite colleagues who have any other points to make to be quick about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way because I was trying to intervene on the Minister. I am concerned by the Minister of State's reply. New commissions are sprouting by the day. The potential for chaos and confusion in the food industry is becoming ever greater. Will my right hon. Friend press the Minister hard when he considers what to do with the amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I came to the same conclusions when I listened to the Minister.
<P>
My experience of MAFF tells me that civil servants are experts at producing organograms, and it might help the Committee if both Ministers looked into that. Perhaps there was one in the report that was published recently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is in the Vote Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I shall check that carefully. However, I was especially interested to know where the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate would fit into the structures that the Minister announced. They are not part of the Food Standards Agency and will presumably be responsible to one of the other commissions. However, I note the Minister of State's observation that the relevant information is in the Vote Office, and I shall check again. It was not in the papers that I studied during my seven-hour train journey last Thursday night. If I find that it is all there, I shall happily apologise to the Minister. If not, an organogram of the new structure may be helpful in future. We are slightly rusty on which advisory committees and scientific bodies fit into executive bodies and the ministerial decision-making process.
<P>
I am an avid reader of Liberty briefs, and have quoted from them extensively on the Floor of the House, especially on Fridays. I am sure that my friends in Liberty will be worried about the Minister's statement of intentions. He effectively told us, "the main objectives are deliberately defined as broad, and we shall fill in the details and explain and delimit the functions of the agency as we go." That is a little worrying. If a broad and general definition is given in law, it does not matter how much Ministers, the Opposition or any Back Benchers try to define more closely what the agency is expected to do on a good day. If the agency is given such broad powers, it may use them or be expected to use them. I shall not pursue that point now, but hon. Members may have to return to the definition of the agency's full powers in respect of its duty

Having registered those observations on the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
The Chairman: I am of the opinion that the matters arising from the clause have been considerably, if not exhaustively, discussed.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. It is extremely helpful to group amendments, but the group that we have just considered contained two quite contrary amendments. The amendment just withdrawn sought to restrict the activities of the agency, while the other would encourage it to take on extra functions. Would it not have been reasonable to ask the hon. Gentleman who tabled the contrary amendment whether he was prepared to ask leave to withdraw it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is a point of order for the Chairman. It is up the hon. Gentleman to let me know if he wishes to propose an amendment formally. If the hon. Gentleman--whom I understand is new to Committee work--wishes to do so, he may. There may be no further discussion of it, but he may press it to a vote. Does he wish to do so?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> No
<P>
<B>The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 and Standing Order No. 89, that the clause stand part of the Bill:</B>--
<P>
Question according agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Betts.]
