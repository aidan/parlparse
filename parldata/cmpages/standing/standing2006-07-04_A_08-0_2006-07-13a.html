proceed, I understand that having decided not to sit on Tuesday evening

the Committee is now considering sitting later this evening. That, of

course, is entirely in order and I am perfectly happy to take the

Chair, as I am at the service of the Committee. Mrs. Humble,

however, is not available. That being so, if we run past a certain

point&#151;and it will be the Chairman who will decide when that

point is&#151;I shall suspend the Committee in the interests of the

comfort of both the staff and, dare I say,

myself.</div>

Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): It is a great

pleasure to see you in your place, Mr. Gale. Let us hope

that we will not see you there for long.</div>

<a name="0607145000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last words I used before we

broke for lunch, although lunch is only a fleeting hope in the minds of

most members of the Committee, were &#147;10 pence&#148;. I

apologise; I should have said 10 per cent. Boots has a standard

rake-off&#151;or return&#151;to charities of 10 per cent., but that

varies hugely from outlet to outlet.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 284</div><a name="0607145000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to say that during

the break I was able to discuss with the Parliamentary Secretary the

purport of the amendment. He has assured me that clause 67(4) has the

effect of tightening the law currently set out in section 60(3) of the

Charities Act 1992. The 1992 Act states that &#147;any commercial

participator&#148;&#151;I had not understood that that meant a shop

such as Clinton Cards&#151;that makes any representation

that</div><a name="0607145000493"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;charitable

contributions are to be given to or applied for the benefit of one or

more particular charitable

institutions,&#148;</div><a name="0607145000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">is obliged

to make a statement, which is broadly in accordance with the effect of

my amendment. I am deeply concerned by the apparent failure of even

respectable outlets such as Boots, Tesco and Marks and Spencer to

recognise that duty under the law, but I am pleased that the Government

propose to tighten the provision.</div>

<a name="0607145000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now move on to what

might have been a stand part debate on clauses 67 and 68, which again

has benefited from discussions over lunch. I have received

representations from the Association of Fundraising Consultants that

the existing law, particularly section 60(2) of the 1992 Act, is not

working effectively. The association&#146;s solution is to reduce the

impact of that law and to set aside the changes that the Government

propose to make to that section of the Act.</div>

<a name="0607145000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">People are genuinely concerned

about how much of their money is spent on fundraising. A lot of people

say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s all charity money,&#148; and&#151;to

revert to an earlier debate&#151;in law, of course, it is all charity

money, because it is there for the charities to dispose of in whatever

way it wishes, as long as it is for the general charitable purpose.

None the less, people are concerned about fundraising and the amount of

money that may be devoted to it by certain charities. Some charities

spend as little as &#163;300 to raise &#163;10,000, whereas some

spend in excess of &#163;900 to raise the same sum. On average, it is

the largest charities that have the worst return on money spent on

fundraising, and the smallest charities that have the best return on

the money that they invest. That offers a lesson: people are entitled

to know how much of the money is being spent on what might be described

as a job creation scheme for professional middle classes, and how much

of it will genuinely help real people at the front line, which is,

after all, the purpose of most people&#146;s charitable

giving.</div><a name="0607145000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a lot of

sympathy with the suggestion of the Association of Fundraising

Consultants that the amendments to the 1992 Act proposed in the Bill

would not have the effect that the Government desire, because they

would not be sufficiently robust to stand up against the wide range of

different ways in which professional fundraisers are funded. However,

the principal point made by the AFC is that charities, and charity

trustees in particular, should have a clear responsibility for deciding

how effectively money is spent on fundraising. That is my position,

also.</div> <a name="0607145000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to

the association for the information it has provided. I fear that

neither the existing provisions, nor the proposed provisions will be

good enough for what the Government want to achieve and, I suspect,

what most people want to achieve, which is to ensure a high rate of

return on money spent on fundraising. We are not getting that from the

largest charities at the moment.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 285</div><a name="0607145000061"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000574"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair,

Mr. Gale. Some of the statements that have just been made by

the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) contained so

many red herrings that he could open a fish shop. Despite my

background, I shall not take his pejorative statements personally,

especially his comments on fundraising by the larger charities, which

the Parliamentary Secretary described from a sedentary position as an

outrageous slur. I have to

concur.</div><a name="0607145000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman was wrong about many things. The ratio of expenditure to

income is important and it is dealt with properly by most of the larger

charities. According to the type of fundraising pursued, those ratios

sometimes look worse and sometimes look better. The areas that benefit

from a large volunteer input, which is, in effect, free naturally

achieve a good ratio; that is often true of small charities, as the

hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out. However, some small charities

indulge in special events fundraising of the type that is relatively

inefficient, such as large gala dinners that make only a little more

than they cost to put on. Such issues are a matter of detail and

variation throughout the whole charities sector and his wild

generalisations were pretty wide of the

mark.</div><a name="0607145000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have

huge sympathy for the case putby the Association of

Fundraising Consultants. The importance of the clauses designed to

strengthen section 60 of the 1992 Act arises from the fact that

weaknesses have been identified in the application of that provision.

The hon. Gentleman was right to mention charity Christmas cards. The

issue is not the costs that are taken by the charities, but those

commercial participators&#151;the organisations such as supermarkets

and other retailers that help charities to fund raise, but are not

themselves professional fundraisers&#151;that represent themselves as

raising charitable funds for a benevolent or philanthropic purpose but,

in practice, do not ultimately give much money to the charity in

question. That is a legitimate concern. In recent years, I have been

worried about the fact that, although section 60 of the 1992 Act was

well drafted and well intentioned, it has been pretty widely ignored.

When walking down an average high street, one sees many examples of

things that purport to be charitable or imply that they are for a

charitable purpose that simply ignore section 60 of the 1992 Act. I

therefore broadly welcome clauses 66, 67 and 68.</div>

<a name="0607145000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right that we seek to

tighten protection for efficient, legitimate fundraising. The onus is

on the Parliamentary Secretary to take on his responsibilities as

Minister for the third sector. He should consider the enforcement and

the practical application of the provisions and ensure that the Charity

Commission and others concerned with enforcement find a mechanism to

make it easy for people to report breaches. I suspect that many

breaches are inadvertent and quite innocent. The hon. Member for Isle

of Wight mentioned businesses such as Tesco and John Lewis, which

contribute a great deal to charity. Perhaps I should declare an

interest as the director of fundraising who managed to secure the

designation of Tesco charity of the year for the Alzheimer&#146;s

Society. I worked closely with Tesco and I think that its record on

corporate responsibility and support for charity is very 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 286</div>good. If it has inadvertently breached the law, I am sure that it was

not with the intent of deceiving the public.</div>

<a name="0607145000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, the fact the

breaches occur fairly routinely clearly opens the door for less

scrupulous individuals to make a healthy profit out of apparently

charitable sales and activities that do not benefit charities very

much. So broadly speaking, I welcome the

clauses.</div><a name="0607145000066"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000575"></a>The

Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Edward Miliband):</b>

This had been a good-tempered Committee until the hon. Member for Isle

of Wight launched a scathing attack on the hon. Member for Cheltenham

(Martin Horwood) through his comments on the professional middle

classes, but I am sure that good humour will prevail

eventually.</div><a name="0607145000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

talk briefly to amendments Nos. 128 and 131. The first seems like it

was discussed a long time ago by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. I

hope to reassure him by pointing out that there is an offence

suchas the amendment proposes under section 60(9)

ofthe Charities Act 1992. The commission is not a prosecuting

authority in that or any other respect, but his amendment would make it

so by giving the commission the ability to initiate criminal

proceedings. That would constitute a significant change in its role. As

I said, the criminal offence exists and it is for the commission to

draw offences to the attention of the police and for the Crown

Prosecution Service to authorise a prosecution where

appropriate.</div><a name="0607145000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000576"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> Is it within the capacity of trading standards

authorities to prosecute such

cases?</div><a name="0607145000069"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000577"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> It is. But let me say more generally&#151;this

relates to amendment No. 131 as well&#151;that I take the points made

by the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Cheltenham. There is

concern about the failure to enforce the existing regime adequately.

Clause 67(4) strengthens that regime and makes clearer the requirements

on commercial participators to provide information on the destination

of moneys derived from the sale of goods and services. However, I

acknowledge that the commission needs to investigate breaches properly

and to make it clear that it is happy to do so, and to draw attention

to the ability of members of the public to take up issues with them. It

will not be for the commission to decide to prosecute, but it has a big

responsibility.</div><a name="0607145000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight is reassured about the

strengthening of the provisions. Let us hope that it will make a

difference in practice. With that, I hope that he will withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="0607145000071"></a>

with an income of less than &#163;100,000 costs &#163;311 and every

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000579"></a>Martin

Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 would require a degree of proportionality in

the Secretary of State&#146;s activities. I am concerned about

regulation being introduced through the back door. However, it is

likely that I shall accept suitable assurances from the Parliamentary

Secretary in that

respect.</div><a name="0607145000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 49 and 50 deal with how Governments&#151;not just the present

one&#151;sometimes feel the need to set up a charitable vehicle to

undertake part of their activities even though there might already be a

suitable vehicle to undertake the work. The example I have in mind is

the Experience Corps, the purpose of which was to encourage more people

to get involved in charities, particularly people close to or beyond

retirement age. I had a conversation with the director of one

organisation who questioned whether her organisation would not have

been equally capable of doing exactly the same job, without the

establishment of an organisation that began to look like a Government

vehicle rather than a genuine charity and that cost a huge amount of

money.</div><a name="0607145000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a

parliamentary answer to me on 12 September 2005, the hon. Member for

Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins), then a Home Office Minister,

told me that the Experience

Corps</div><a name="0607145000495"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;received

approximately &#163;20 million from the Home

Office&#148;</div><a name="0607145000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that

its</div><a name="0607145000496"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;target was to recruit

250,000 new

volunteers&#148;.</div><a name="0607145000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as

of December 2003, it had

only</div><a name="0607145000497"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recruited over

153,000 volunteers&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 12

September 2005; Vol. 436, c.

2633W.]</div><a name="0607145000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even my arithmetic is up

to calculating that that works out at &#163;130,000 per volunteer.

Sometimes we ought to ask the Government whether they could not have

acted more efficiently. That is the purpose of amendments Nos. 48 and

50.</div><a name="0607145000094"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000586"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I sympathise with the intentions behind the

amendments, but I hope that I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman that they

are unnecessary.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 289</div><a name="0607145000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments Nos. 47 and 49, the

compact of good practice, which was agreed between the Government and

the voluntary sector and with which the hon. Gentleman will be

familiar, is important because it covers precisely the issues that he

discussed, including proportionality in monitoring requirements. He was

right to raise the matter, because the interaction between the

Government and the voluntary sector is important and we must get our

practice right in that area. I do not think that the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s amendments would add all that much to what already

exists, but I am sympathetic to the intentions behind

them.</div><a name="0607145000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal

briefly with amendments Nos. 48 and 50. Again, I agree with the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s view, but the distinction that I would draw is that

the Government are often not best placed to disburse funds. It should

not necessarily be the job of the new Office of the Third Sector to

spend lots of time filtering grant applications. For example, V, a new

charity for young people, will distribute resources on an arm&#146;s

length and independent basis to organisations that encourage

volunteering opportunities for young people. It is better to use the

voluntary sector&#146;s expertise to do that sort of thing than to do

it within

Government.</div><a name="0607145000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

that does not detract from the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. When the

Government consider setting up new vehicles and institutions, we must

be careful not to duplicate existing bodies that could do the job

better. The compact is designed to cover that, too. I take his point in

both cases, but hope that on the basis of reassuring words and firm

intentions on my part, he will withdraw his

amendments.</div><a name="0607145000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607145000587"></a><b class="B">Peter

Bottomley</b> (Worthing, West) (Con): May I ask the Minister

to help the Committee on a couple of points? Subsection (6) says that

the Secretary of State</div>

<a name="0607145000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may make arrangements

for...assistance under subsection (1) to be

given&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607145000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is,

financial assistance&#151;or he may delegate the matter. Could the

hon. Gentleman give the Committee one or two illustrative examples of

hypothetical or actual cases in which the Secretary of State might want

that power?</div><a name="0607145000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

(10)(b) mentions</div><a name="0607145000499"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an

institution (other than a charity) which is established for charitable,

benevolent or philanthropic

purposes.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not too

concerned about the benevolent or philanthropic purposes, but will the

Minister give an illustrative example of something that is not a

charity that is established for charitable

purposes?</div><a name="0607145000102"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000588"></a>The

not.</div><a name="0607145000104"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000590"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000591"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> No, I am happy to respond, Mr. Gale.

I was not seeking to question the Chair and your wisdom.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 290</div><a name="0607145000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I answered the first question put

by the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) in my previous

remarks. An example such as he asks for is an institution that is set

up by the Government and disburses Government funds. Such bodies

include V, which is encouraging youth volunteering, and Future

Builders, which is providing loans and grants to institutions and

charities that want to help deliver public

services.</div><a name="0607145000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example of

an institution other than a charity that is established for charitable

purposes is Amnesty International, which is not a charity but does have

charitable purposes. I hope that that is helpful to him and the

Committee.</div><a name="0607145000108"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000592"></a>Mr.

<a name="0607145000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000594"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b>

No.</div><a name="0607145000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000595"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The Minister may not realise the opportunity that

he is missing with this amendment.</div>

<a name="0607145000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause obliges the Minister

to report on the operation of the Act not later than in five

years&#146; time, but some of the conditions and changes to charity

law that we have been discussing, may have immediate implications for

charities and change the way in which charity registration happens.

They might also change and even challenge the effectiveness of the

Charity Commission. It is therefore important that we have an annual

review of the sector&#146;s

operation.</div><a name="0607145000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

implications for the sector are wider than simply the provisions in the

clauses that we have discussed in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 291</div>this Committee. The relationship between the Government and the private

and voluntary sectors in terms of the delivery of services and public

policy objectives is a legitimate subject for regular review. Review

does take place, but on a piecemeal basis, together with occasional

debates on volunteering in Westminster Hall and ministerial speeches on

particular projects. It would therefore be valuable to have a well

rounded and concentrated report each year. The members of the Committee

are extremely well informed on the third sector, but we may be in a

minority among our colleagues in terms of a real knowledge of the way

in which the sector is operating.

</div><a name="0607145000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said in the

amendment, reviewing the changes in the number of registered

charities&#151;whether that number is rising or falling&#151;may

reveal trends resulting from the changes to charity registration in the

Bill. The number of organisations that have failed to attain or to

retain charitable status is clearly relevant to the changed

arrangements in relation to the new heads of charity and the public

benefit test. There are differing views on the public benefit

test&#151;whether it represents a continuation of the status quo, as

the Government believe, or operates tighter guidance, as I would wish,

or offers a privileged position to private schools, as the hon. Member

for Isle of Wight and his colleagues would prefer. Those matters should

be discussed and any legitimate concerns about the operation of the

public benefit test could then be revealed sooner rather than

later.</div> <a name="0607145000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could

discuss the total value of gift aid and other special tax provisions

for charities in that year. That would provide an opportunity for the

Parliamentary Secretary to parade the extraordinary generosity of

Government towards charities in the form of the various tax breaks and

concessions that it offers to them. However, in fairness, the report

should also include the total net cost of value added tax to registered

charities. The amount that it costs the many charities that are not

able to recover VAT because they do not sell anything is a matter of

concern in the sector. That is, in effect, a tax on charities, which

those of us who are sympathetic to the third sector ought to be

lobbying our respective Treasury teams to tackle through amended

policies. The review that I propose would offer an opportunity for the

issue to be discussed in Parliament in a cool-headed, rational and well

informed way.</div> <a name="0607145000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

a report on the number and value of central Government contracts placed

with registered charities in the relevant year would help to illustrate

the developing relationship between charity, the private sector and the

Government.</div> <a name="0607145000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment is balanced and reasonable, and would introduce a welcome

opportunity for Parliament to discuss the values and development of the

third sector in a well informed way.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000596"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> If I were giving star ratings to the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s amendments, amendment No. 72 would be low down the

list&#151;indeed, I am not sure that it would receive more than one

star. Let me explain why.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 292</div><a name="0607145000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matters set out in paragraphs

(a) and (b) of proposed new subsection (Z1) are for the Charity

Commission, which will have to provide an annual report to Parliament.

Paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) have only tangential relevance to the Bill.

However many important claims I would make for the Bill, I would not

claim that it will have a huge impact on the operation of gift aid, the

total net cost of value added tax or the number and value of central

Government contracts, although that is not to say that some of the

other things that are being done will not affect them. All Departments

produce an annual report, which will certainly cover issues such as

those that the hon. Gentleman has raised.</div>

<a name="0607145000124"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000597"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> If the Minister were to give an assurance that

his Department&#146;s annual report will cover all the subjects in

the amendment, I would happily withdraw

it.</div><a name="0607145000125"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000598"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I will not do that, but I shall give the hon.

Gentleman the assurance that we will attempt to cover the issues that

he raises, while of course respecting the fact that tax&#151;as I am

sure even the Liberal Democrats know&#151;is a matter for Her

Majesty&#146;s Treasury. I would not want to trespass upon that

territory, but I am sure that the more general issues affecting the

charitable sector will be covered in the annual

report.</div><a name="0607145000126"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000599"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> While the Minister is dealing gently and fairly

with the hon. Member for Cheltenham, could he tell the Committee what

kind of person he might have in mind to commence the review? Also,

given that the clause says that the review should start within five

years of the passing of the legislation, roughly how long does the

Minister think the review might

take?</div><a name="0607145000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000600"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I believe that the review is to be conducted by

central Government. That is the commitment made in the Bill. If the

hon. Gentleman is proposing himself a potential reviewer, I am sure

that he will be considered by the relevant Minister at the time. No

doubt the hon. Gentleman has important qualifications in that

respect.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000603"></a>Peter

apologise to the Committee for their late tabling on Tuesday. We have

tried to avoid tabling bundles of amendments at the last minute, but it

took longer to prepare these amendments than I had hoped. I shall

briefly explain what they will do.</div>

<a name="0607145000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The revised version of section

10 of the Charities Act 1993 provides for the disclosure of information

to and by the Charity Commission. It includes specific provisions

relating to the exchange of information by the commissioners for

Revenue and Customs.</div>

<a name="0607145000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the Government

amendments is fourfold. First, they will modernise the

information-sharing gateway between the commissioners for Revenue and

Customs and the Charity Commission to reflect changes to the way in

which HMRC wishes to disclose information following the passing of the

Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005. Secondly, the

amendments will extend the gateway for the sharing of information,

including Revenue and Customs information, to principal regulators of

exempt charities. Thirdly, they make provision for sharing of

information including commissioners of Revenue and Customs&#146;

information with the proposed regulator of charities in Northern

Ireland. Finally, they make some minor changes to the rules governing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 294</div>disclosure of other information to and by the Charity Commission. I hope

that that brief explanation satisfies the

Committee.</div>

<a name="0607145000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000611"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> I am sure that what the Minister has outlined

makes sense. I congratulate peopleon spotting one or two of

the moves from &#147;commissioners&#148; to

&#147;commission&#148;, which are a consequence of earlier parts of

the Bill.</div> <a name="0607145000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is

Government new clause 14 precedented? The Minister will know that it

relates to the provision whereby, if a charity commission in Northern

Ireland is established, various other things happen. I can see the

reason for the new clause, and it makes sense, but is it a legislative

innovation?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000620"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> Amendment No. 104 is extremely important. It

deals with an issue about which much concern has been expressed by

certain charities: the title of receiver and manager that is used when

the Charity Commission steps in and changes a charity&#146;s

administration.</div><a name="0607145000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Receivers

and managers have a very wide remit, and the proposed title of interim

manager is a misleading one. Only a small proportion of receivers and

managers who have been appointed have had the kind of narrow remit to

which the term &#147;interim manager&#148; might be appropriate.

Using the Freedom of Information Act 2000, the Association for

Charities has obtained details of 51 receiver and manager appointments

between 1993 and the end of June 2005. The vast majority of those

appointments excluded trustees: in effect, the existing trustees were

taken out of the charity&#146;s administration and the temporary

receiver and manager was inserted. To all intents and purposes that is

an interim trustee appointment.</div>

<a name="0607145000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The importance of the

phraseology is twofold. First, it makes the real status of such persons

clear, and removes the confusion that has undoubtedly existed in the

past, sometimes among trustees and former trustees of the charity and

sometimes even among the receivers and managers, if the evidence from

the Association for Charities be believed. The association has even

cited evidence of confusion among commission staff. Secondly, and

perhaps more important, is the message that is sent to people who

support the charity. In any circumstances, beneficiaries&#146;

interests are best served by an organisation that is properly

administered, either by the original trustees or by an interim receiver

and manager, and that can carry on its legitimate charitable activities

with the maximum possible funding. That depends absolutely on public

confidence and often depends also on continuing public donations. If

the public are told that a receiver, or even an interim manager, has

been appointed, a confusing signal is sent that might cast doubt over

whether the charity is in crisis, and that doubt might deter them from

donating. The term &#147;interim trustee&#148; is much less

value-laden and much less

threatening.</div><a name="0607145000182"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000621"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> Many members of the Committee have had the

chance to read the schedule produced by the Association for Charities,

but will the hon. Gentleman tell us for how long, on average, such

people remain in post? Will he confirm whether any of them were

appointed because there was not a crisis?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 300</div><a name="0607145000183"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000622"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first

question. I am sure that most receivers and managers were appointed

because of real concerns, and even the Association for Charities

document cites cases that I would describe as being arguable either

way. In some cases, there are legitimate arguments for the commission

having to intervene. However, that does not mean that it is right

unnecessarily to damage public confidence in a charity, especially

since, if the commission is really worried about how it is being

administered, the very act of appointing a receiver and manager is done

with the intention of bringing the charity back into line. The idea is

that it will then be properly administered and that the receiver and

manger will continue to administer it in the best way

possible.</div><a name="0607145000542"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

pm</div><a name="0607145000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607145000623"></a><b class="B">James

Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): The hon.

Gentleman is eloquently making the case for the title of

&#147;interim trustee&#148;. However, I am worried that the use of

&#147;trustee&#148; might confer additional legal responsibilities

for the organisation that people would not be willing to accept,

especially financial responsibilities. While it sets the right tone, is

there not a tight legal definition of a trustee? It would cause

confusion.</div><a name="0607145000185"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000624"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> That is a valid point, but if the existing

trustees have been displaced and excluded, which is what has happened

in the majority of cases, the person appointed to be the receiver and

manager, interim manager, or interim trustee&#151;whatever we call

him&#151;might be taking on the legal responsibilities of trusteeship

and certainly the responsibility to comply with charity law that

applies to the trustees who have been excluded. I cannot see who else

would take on that responsibility in such

circumstances.</div><a name="0607145000186"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000625"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to be asserting, as I

believe the Association for Charities does, that we cannot have a

charity without trustees and that the most senior person who appears to

be administering the charity becomes the trustee, whether they want to

or not, for the charity&#146;s purposes and its resources. Therefore,

an interim whatever is a trustee in law even if he did not intend to

be.</div><a name="0607145000187"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000626"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman may well be right, although I

am not necessarily asserting that the individual becomes a trustee. My

legal qualifications are not such that I could say whether the person

would become a trustee in law, but in that appointment he would

certainly seem to carry the responsibilities of a trustee and, thus, be

acting as if he were a trustee. That is why the amendment is sensible.

It would protect the interests of beneficiaries by maintaining public

confidence in the charity and stop the confusion and dispute over the

role of receivers and managers that has been present in the

past.</div><a name="0607145000188"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000627"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> I am pleased to support the amendment. The role of

the proposed interim manager, who has hitherto been called the receiver

and manager, needs to be bottomed out and made more clear in respect of



<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 301</div>when the trustees are removed or when that individual has power to

override them. That is clearly the purpose of such an appointment. To

be neutral for a moment, if a chief executive is appointed to a charity

and that person either has the practical power to override the trustees

or the commission removes the trustees and leaves a gap before

appointing new trustees, someone must have legal responsibility for the

trust. Whether or not my assertion is correct that that person takes on

that responsibility under law, he does so in practice. That cannot be

gainsaid. It seems absolutely correct that we should make it clear that

that person is an interim trustee or perhaps even the interim

trustee.</div><a name="0607145000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am worried

about the practice of the appointment of interim mangers and trustees.

Before I speak to the new clauses, I should say that amendments Nos.

106 to 111 are merely consequential on amendment No. 104. I am anxious

about three aspects of the appointment of trustees or interim managers,

each of which is neatly covered by my new clauses.</div>

<a name="0607145000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the charity trustees or

corporation&#151;if the charity is incorporated&#151;must be

notified in good time of the reasons for the appointment, otherwise it

will be impossible for them to appeal against it. Apart from anything

else, that is good practice, common sense and a courtesy. Furthermore,

they will be unable take advantage of the tribunal if they do not know

the reasons for the appointment. I suspect that unless that requirement

to notify is placed in the Bill, or the commission makes an undertaking

that it will always do so, there will be lots of appeals to the

tribunal.</div><a name="0607145000191"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000628"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I am the bearer of good news. That has been

placed in Bill following a debate in another place. Paragraph 108 of

schedule 8 inserts a new section into the Charities Act 1993 to achieve

precisely that

purpose.</div><a name="0607145000192"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000629"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> The sun has indeed got his hat on&#151;hip, hip

hooray.</div><a name="0607145000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4

deals with my second concern&#151;the remuneration of trustees. My

hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West referred to appendix 2, which

I think was circulated to all members of the Committee. It is headed

&#147;appendix 2&#148;, but I am not clear on what it is an

appendix to. However, it is the outcome of a list of appointments of

receivers and managers over the period from 1993 to 2004. It runs to

seven or eight pages and covers the appointment of 51 receivers and

managers.</div> <a name="0607145000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem

is that such people have to be paid. A bigger problem is that they can

be paid, and usually are, by the charity on the orders of the

commission under the 1992 Act. When I list the first page of the

companies that furnish those trustees, hon. Members will be able to

imagine the sort of the sums that we are talking about. The list reads

as follows: Coopers and Lybrand, Coopers and Lybrand, Arthur Andersen,

Arthur Andersen, Coopers and Lybrand, KPMG&#151;then there is one

that I have never heard of&#151;BDO Stoy Hayward and Coopers and

Lybrand. That is just the first page. Those are big companies that cost

a huge amount to retain, as the Government know because they do it all

the time. When such companies are appointed to run small

charities&#151;or indeed large ones&#151;they inevitably rack up

huge bills.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 302</div><a name="0607145000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly, the freedom of information

search found only about seven or eight examples in which the commission

retained sufficient information to tell the researcher how much it had

spent on the 51 receivers and managers. In one case the figure was

&#163;129,000 for six months, in another &#163;87,000 for nine

months, in another &#163;393,000 for four months&#146;

work&#151;these are KPMG rates&#151;and in a further case the

figure was &#163;72,000 for five months&#146; work. All those sums

were paid for by the

charity.</div><a name="0607145000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that

we cannot measure the work of a big company such as KPMG solely by the

time that elapses between its appointment and its discharge. I am sure

that in many cases such companies do not do much for part of the time

and that they do not charge for those periods. However, those are huge

sums to charge small charities. I am concerned to read that in at least

one case&#151;the Little Gidding Trust case&#151;the commission

refused to appoint a receiver and manager whenthe trustees

requested that it do so, because the commission believed that the

charity did not have liquid funds with which to pay the receiver and

manager. That is not the Charity Commission working in the best

interests of the charity. I propose therefore in new clause

4&#151;this is fundamental&#151;that the commission and not the

charity should meet the regulatory cost.</div>

<a name="0607145000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 emphasises that. I

cannot see a single person in the list of 51 who is a volunteer. I

shall let other Committee members into a secret, Mr. Gale,

of which you might be aware: for many years, whenever there was a row

in a Conservative association, the professional staff in the

Conservative central office had to spend hours trying to sort it out.

<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Of course there were lots of rows, as I am sure

there are in other parties as well. Recently, that has been changed.

Professional staff in central office now spend their time campaigning

or assisting people in campaigning&#151;in some cases, not as

effectively as we might like, but never mind; that also is true for all

parties&#151;while the senior volunteers spend their time trying to

sort out the rows. I see no reason why the commission should be wedded

to appointing hugely expensive international firms of consultants, for

that is what they

are.</div><a name="0607145000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607145000630"></a><b class="B">Helen

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000634"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right.

It is customary, after the two Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen have

spoken to their amendments, to hear from the Minister. If the hon.

Gentleman wishes to contribute further before the Minister responds, he

may do so.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div><a name="0607145000203"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000635"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am extremely grateful for your indulgence,

Mr. Gale. I apologise that I neglected to address new clause

9, which stands in my name and has been grouped with amendment No.

104.</div><a name="0607145000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 9 is

relevant to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight on

new clause 4, because the two offer alternative approaches to the

possibility that the cost of receivers and managers, interim managers,

trustees or whatever they will end up being called will run out of

control. I have a lot of sympathy with new clause 4, and the sums that

the hon. Gentleman recited sound extremely high, but it is unreasonable

simply to say that the Charity Commission should always bear the cost

of sorting out the problems of a charity that has, legitimately or not,

been put into such a

situation.</div><a name="0607145000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most

alarming thing about the Association for Charities report, although I

cannot find the page that gives chapter and verse, is that in some

cases the original estimated cost of the receiver and manager, and

therefore the basis on which the contract was awarded, was exceeded by

a huge proportion&#151;six or seven times, if I am right. In such

circumstances, there is a legitimate reason for the commission to bear

at least the cost of any surplus over what was originally

intended.</div><a name="0607145000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 9

would address the problem by saying that a proper public tender

exercise must be conducted in line with best practice from the Office

of Government Commerce, which I am sure is very good indeed. If a cost

has been estimated to the receiver and manager, there would therefore

be some onus on them to limit costs and a direct interest for the

commission in restricting excessive costs among the receivers and

managers that it appoints, because it will run the risk of bearing the

costs if they are

excessive.</div><a name="0607145000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regrettably,

I cannot support new clause 4, but I invite the hon. Member for Isle of

Wight to support new clause 9. If the opportunity arises, I shall press

it to a

Division.</div><a name="0607145000208"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000636"></a>The

Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman has indicated that he would

like to force a Division on new clause 9 when the appropriate moment

arrives, and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight indicated that he wished

to press one of his amendments. If he does, he had better tell me now,

or it will not be

moved.</div><a name="0607145000209"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000637"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000638"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> The amendments are important, but I disagree

with them. None the less, I hope to offer some words of

reassurance.</div><a name="0607145000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

Nos. 104 and 106 to 111 are all about the name &#147;interim

manager&#148;. It is precisely because of the debate in another place

that we have changed the name from &#147;receiver and manager&#148;

to &#147;interim manager&#148;, because it was considered in that

the name &#147;receiver&#148; would conjure up inappropriate

images. Interim managers are appointed only after an inquiry has found

misconduct or has found that property is at risk&#151;appointment is

not a trivial matter. Last year, there were only two cases of

appointment of an interim 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 304</div>manager among all the charities in Britain. Appointment of an interim

manager is both a serious and an unusual occurrence.</div>

<a name="0607145000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that the name

&#147;interim trustee&#148; would be appropriate. It is true that

interim managers sometimes assume the whole of the trustee&#146;s

responsibilities, but on occasion they assume only part of those

responsibilities. It would be incredibly confusing for there to be both

an interim trustee&#151;whom we propose to call the interim

manager&#151;and a group of trustees who would continue to fulfil

some of their charitable functions. An interim manager might, for

example, assume responsibility for the charity property, with

operations remaining in the jurisdiction of the trustees. The solution

proposed by the amendment was potentially ingenious, but it would lead

to

confusion.</div><a name="0607145000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607145000639"></a><b class="B">Alun

Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I

understand the point that my hon. Friend makes, and it is a powerful

one. The point of the amendment would be to clarify the function being

undertaken. However, although it cannot be dealt with now, is there a

case for a title such as &#147;interim trustee&#148; to be used

when all the trustees&#146; functions are being taken over, rather

than only part? That should not be decided on the hoof, but will my

hon. Friend reflect on

it?</div><a name="0607145000214"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000640"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I shall, but my first impression is that my

right hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion might lead to even further

confusion. An interim trustee would be appointed if he were going to

run the whole charity, whereas an interim manager would be appointed if

only part of the charity were going to be run under his jurisdiction. I

am not sure that that would convey the message that we want to convey,

though I appreciate that the suggestion is an ingenious

one.</div>

<a name="0607145000215"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000641"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> Would the Minister be moved in his position by

the opinion of counsel that was obtained by the Association for

Charities? That

concluded:</div><a name="0607145000506"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For

practical purposes, therefore, an R and M has the same powers as the

trustees whom he displaces, whether the displacement is in whole or in

part, albeit that he exercises them under the Commission&#146;s

supervision.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the

Minister therefore accept that the confusion already exists, or at

least that legal differences of opinion already exist? The suggestion

made by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun

Michael) has a lot to recommend it.</div>

<a name="0607145000217"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000642"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I do not agree. The legal opinion might be

right, but that does not detract from the fact that trustees continue

to fulfil part of the functions in the case of at least some interim

manager appointments. To give the interim manager the name

&#147;interim trustee&#148; would suggest that the trustees no

longer had any powers over the

organisation.</div>

<a name="0607145000218"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000643"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The evidence obtained by the Association for

Charities under the freedom of information legislation suggests that

that is exactly what is happening in the majority of cases&#151;the

existing trustees are excluded.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div><a name="0607145000219"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000644"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> The question is not about the majority of

cases&#151;we are trying to deal with all cases. The question is

whether the term &#147;interim trustee&#148; would be appropriate

in all cases, and the problem is that it would not be appropriate.

Where would that leave the original trustees who are continuing to

carry out functions? It is all very well the hon. Gentleman saying that

my right hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion is correct&#151;it is

ingenuous&#151;but I am not sure what it would achieve.</div>

<a name="0607145000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the most serious cases, we

would have an interim trustee appointed where all the powers were being

taken over. In the cases seen as less serious, we would have an interim

manager appointed with trustees continuing to exercise some functions.

If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concern is that the notion of

&#147;interim manager&#148; is an unfortunate term&#151;because

it suggests a gravity that he thinks is inappropriate&#151;it does

not meet his purpose to apply it to what might be seen as the less

serious cases.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000647"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The suggestion of the right hon. Member for

Cardiff, South and Penarth is more ingenuous than he realises. In the

less grave situations, charity trustees would still be in position.

Therefore, the damaging impression would not necessarily be there. It

is only in the case in which the charities are completely excluded that

the greatest risk to public reputation is

present.</div><a name="0607145000224"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000648"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I am not sure that I follow that point but let

me give way to the hon. Member for Isle of

<a name="0607145000225"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000649"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> I think that the Minister is construing this

amendment slightly too sharply because it actually refers

to</div><a name="0607145000507"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#146;(who will

otherwise be known as an interim trustee as

appropriate)&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

other words, if someone has responsibilities of trusteeship, he is

known as an interim trustee. If he does not, he is not known as that.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000650"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I fear that we are beginning to dance on the

head of a pin. I understand the point being made. My point is that that

is an unusual case; it happened twice last year. Let us have one name

covering the appointment of those individuals. To have different names

for the same individual, albeit exercising powers that are slightly

different in whole or in part, will add to the confusion that hon.

Gentlemen say that they want to clear

up.</div><a name="0607145000228"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000651"></a>Alun

Michael:</b> My hon. Friend is engaging precisely with the

matters before us. I understand his wish not to make a change that

might end up being more, and not less, confusing. He is right to

attempt to achieve that. However, if there is a lack of clarity about

what the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 306</div>responsibilities are in all cases and if there are two functions, one

taking over the full

trusteeship&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>]</div>

<a name="0607145000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000652"></a>The

with staff, they must do outside the Committee

room.</div><a name="0607145000230"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000653"></a>Alun

Michael:</b> If an individual comes in under those powers and

takes over all the responsibilities of trustees, that ought to be clear

in common-sense language to people outside. If that individual is

taking over only a specific area, such as protection of property, that

also ought to be clear because the trustees are still in place. I

suggest to my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary that he may be

right&#151;that defending what is in the Bill is the right course to

take. However, it would be sensible to reflect on the available options

and try to achieve terminology that is clear to the general

public.</div><a name="0607145000231"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000654"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> One thing that will add to the confusion is that

the trustees always remain in office even if their functions are given

to the interim manager. However, I will reflect on what my right hon.

Friend says.</div> <a name="0607145000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

think that there is an issue that needs to be cleared up because the

substantive issues about interim managers are not really about the

name, but about the costs, as raised by the hon. Member for Isle of

Wight. They are about the ability to review both their appointment and

continuing appointment, as raised earlier&#151;very

passionately&#151;by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. I want to deal

with that briefly, and I hope that that will provide some

reassurance.</div> <a name="0607145000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier

in our deliberations, the hon. Member for Cheltenham engaged in a

protracted discussion with me about the extent to which the appointment

of the interim manager and that person&#146;s continuing presence in

office was reviewable. I undertook to come back to him with the Charity

Commission&#146;s guidelines on how often it reviews the continued

appointment of the interim manager and how often that decision can be

reviewed. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that new, internal guidelines

are being prepared and they will be implemented by the commission in

the coming months. That will ensure that there is a gap of not more

than two months in the process of reviewing the appointment of interim

managers and, on each occasion, those decisions will be appealable to

the charity tribunal. I know that he was worried about ensuring that

there was proper scrutiny of the continuing presence in office of an

interim manager and I hope that he will be reassured by what I have

said.</div> <a name="0607145000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I

have answered the point about new clause 3 in my intervention on the

hon. Member for Isle of Wight. Indeed, he concluded that the sun was

shining as a result of it. New clause 4 is about who pays for the

interim manager. I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

argument about the costs and nature of interim managers, and the impact

that that could have. I reiterate that it is an unusual occurrence, but

that is not to say that the costs that he described are large. Big sums

are often at risk and liabilities are potentially

aspects to new clause 9 tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham, the

first of which is a sum being agreed in advance and who should meet the

additional costs. There is a real danger in a public tender exercise.

At present, the commission appoints from a panel, but a widely

publicised public tender exercise would do more reputational damage to

a charity than the current system of appointing from a

panel.</div><a name="0607145000239"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000657"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is

aware that the panel is sometimes appointed by public tender. That does

not involve naming each individual charity that it might be called on

to serve in the future. Is that the

practice?</div><a name="0607145000240"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000658"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> That may be right. I will happily look at the

matter but I am not convinced that there is not a perfectly good system

in place at the moment. I undertake to talk to the commission about how

it chooses its panel and whether, tying together the comments of the

two hon. Gentlemen, there is a sufficiently wide range of candidates

that can come

forward.</div>

<a name="0607145000544"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

pm</div><a name="0607145000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second

part of the amendment, for the same reasons that the hon. Member for

Cheltenham answered the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight about the

costs being borne by the charity concerned, it would be difficult to

say in advance before one has gone into the organisation to work out

the full extent of its problems and difficulties that a certain sum

must be the limit of how much the interim manager is paid. I take the

points about cost control that have been made across all sides, and I

will go back to the commission from the debate and I am sure that it

will be listening and reading the transcript of our proceedings and

hearing the Committee&#146;s concern, but it is not practical to

decide in advance how much those costs would be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 308</div>and essentially make the commission bear any additional cost. With that

explanation I hope that I have satisfied the

Committee.</div>

<a name="0607145000242"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000659"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am reassured by some of the Minister&#146;s

statements and certainly by his intention to go back and talk to the

commission. He mentioned both the role of receivers and managers and

possibly considering the suggestion by the right hon. Member for

Cardiff, South and Penarth; to look at the excessive costs being run up

on occasion by people in the position of receiver and manager and in

future of interim manager or trustee, as we decide.</div>

<a name="0607145000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that he is being

slightly optimistic, however. First, he said that this happens only

once or twice a year. If that is true in the past 12 months, that is

atypical, because as I mentioned earlier, the Association for Charities

obtained the total list of appointments between 1993 and 2004 and in

some years five or six such appointments were made. It is sometimes

much more common than he suggests in his remarks.</div>

<a name="0607145000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a matter of legitimate

concern among charities, particularly among smaller charities that are

growing and developing and are possibly subject to scrutiny because

some of the practices that they may have indulged in may not conform

always to best practice. It might be a legitimate concern for the

Charity Commission that in practice the appointment of the receiver and

manager can end up doing more harm than good, and on occasion lead to

the closing down of the independent charity.</div>

<a name="0607145000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I take the Minister at his

word on his good intentions to talk to the commission, I am still

minded to press new clause 9 in particular to a vote to ensure that

there is a clear incentive for both the appointed receivers and

managers and for the commission to minimise those excessive

costs.</div>

<a name="0607145000246"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000660"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman has picked the

right new clause to press if he is going to press one, but we all

recognise that the Charity Commission is not part of the debate while

it might agree with one or two of the things that the association has

said; for example, in one case the receiver manager found poor

financial controls and record keeping, inability of trustees to work

together, inadequate charitable activity, the absence of a definitive

membership list, which had apparently been remedied, and the

unconstitutionality of some trustee appointments. I think that people

who were complaining about the Charity Commission accept the criticism

that the charities were broadly just. He has picked the right new

clause.</div>

<a name="0607145000247"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000661"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful for that generous intervention by

the hon. Member for Worthing, West. He makes a legitimate point that we

are not here to challenge the concept of appointing something

equivalent to a receiver and manager or an interim manager in

principle. Obviously in many cases that will be necessary and as I said

in many of the cases presented by the Association for Charities the

case is certainly arguable and I can see the argument on both

sides.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 309</div><a name="0607145000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as he suggested I am

going to press new clause 9 to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000662"></a>Mr.

<a name="06071412000002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;but so that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000663"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the

following amendments: No. 52, in

&#145;or&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) for more than one

amendment No.

62</div><a name="0607145000254"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000664"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> These are simple amendments. Amendment No. 52

would require that those setting regulations for charities&#146;

accounts be able to prescribe more than one statement</div>

<a name="0607145000508"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to reflect the differing natures

and sizes of different

charities.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

51 would provide that</div>

<a name="0607145000509"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the requirements...be the

minimum commensurate with the need to ensure that the statement of

accounts provides a true and fair view of the charity&#146;s

financial

position&#148;.</div><a name="0607145000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that is

designed to put SORP into context, which at present it appears not to

be, and to reflect more clearly the capacity of different charities to

do things

differently.</div><a name="0607145000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some

charities&#151;I wish this were in the UK&#151;of the character of

the Bill Gates Foundation, but not of its size, need do no fundraising

at all. All they do is disburse moneys. There is no need for them

therefore to have the same accounting requirements as, say, a large

charity that depends a great deal on

fundraising.</div><a name="0607145000258"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000665"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

comments on the matter, but I am slightly confused. It seems to me that

the advantage of SORP is its universality. Even if the declared

fundraising costs are nil, there is a huge virtue in everyone following

the same standard. However, in the interests of work-life balance and

the time of day, I shall restrict my comments to

that.</div><a name="0607145000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000666"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> A friend of mine essentially leads the

trusteeship of a significant charity, and was amazed when approached by

someone from the Charity Commission and asked, &#147;Why

aren&#146;t you trying to raise more money?&#148; She replied with

the point that my hon. Friend made, &#147;Actually, the job of our

trusteeship is to spend the money that it has got, and is perfectly

adequate for the purposes for which it was established. We do not want

to be told to raise money, if we decide that we do not need to&#148;.

A degree of sensitivity would be worthwhile. I am sure that the Charity

Commission 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 310</div>is capable of distinguishing between charities that raise money and

those that do not. It should not be telling people which of the two

they should be

doing.</div><a name="0607145000260"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000667"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> First, let me deal with my amendment in this

group. Essentially, it is a minor amendment consequent on the

conversion from &#147;Commissioners&#148; to

&#147;Commission&#148;.</div>

<a name="0607145000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid that the hon. Member

for Isle ofWight gets no stars for his two amendments,

uncharacteristically. Amendment No. 52 is unnecessary because section

86 of the 1993 Act, which applies to all regulation under this Bill,

allows already for the Secretary of State to make provision for

different cases. Indeed, current regulations do exactly that.</div>

<a name="0607145000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s intention behind amendment No. 51, but I do not

think that it is fit for purpose&#151;to use the current

parlance&#151;because it would be placed in a paragraph dealing

specifically with requirements on settlor trusts. I am sure that it is

not his intention, but the amendment would essentially introduce a new

&#147;true and fair&#148; yardstick for settlor trusts and their

statements of accounts. That would introduce SORP into a part of the

law applicable only to settlor trusts, and a whole new raft of

accounting standards for settlor trusts, which I am sure is not the

deregulatory intent for which he wishes to be

famous.</div><a name="0607145000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other thing

about it is that paradoxically, it would introduce new requirements

relating to settler trusts but would also, by using the phrase

&#147;minimum commensurate&#148;, relax the obligations. It would

not require settler trusts to comply with more general regulations

relevant to all charities&#151;for example, by disclosing the

salaries of a charity&#146;s highest paid employees.</div>

<a name="0607145000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid that this is

comprehensively a no-stars amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman

will withdraw

it.</div><a name="0607145000265"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000668"></a>Mr.

attempt to set out the responsibilities and duties of trustees in a

single clause. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that they

appear elsewhere in the legislation, or they might appear spread out

over lots of different parts of the legislation. It may be that in the

consolidation to which my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West

referred a moment ago, those duties and responsibilities will be

clarified and brought together. The new clause is probing rather than

one that I expect to press to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000673"></a>Edward

clause. The Trustee Act 2000 covers unincorporated charities, and the

Companies Act 1985 and the Company Law Reform Bill currently being

debated elsewhere in the House cover incorporated charities, giving

them very similar responsibilities. It is important to clarify the

duties of trustees, so it is worth saying that the Charity Commission

has produced a popular and well respected booklet called &#147;The

Essential Trustee: What you need to know&#148;, which covers the

responsibilities and duties of trustees. The hon. Gentleman raises an

important issue and the main things to say is that it is set out

clearly in documents available to trustees. I hope that he will

withdraw the new

words about the booklet &#147;The Essential Trustee&#148; will be

warmly endorsed across the House? The Charity Commission, which

produced it, has done a service to trustees, and those who have

presented it have put it in an accessible form. They give a brief

introduction and then expand on what people need to know. It is one of

the examples of the Charity Commission doing its job well and allowing

trustees to do theirs

as always, Mr. Gale, to serve under your chairmanship. I

wish to be brief but I shall touch on the matter, which I raised on

Second Reading, of people with learning disabilities being unable to

serve as trustees. I have had an awful lot of conflicting advice,

despite the reassurances on Second Reading that such people could

stand. One of my researchers phoned the Charity Commission yesterday

and explained the problem, and the Charity Commission said,

&#147;Yes, absolutely, people with disabilities can stand as

trustees.&#148; My researcher asked, &#147;People with learning

disabilities?&#148; and the reply was, &#147;No, definitely

not.&#148; The commission then said that maybe they could. We need

more clarity.</div><a name="0607145000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

matter seems to hang on the

words:</div><a name="0607145000522"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

reason of mental disorder, illness or injury of managing his own

old-fashioned, paternalistic and pejorative view of people with

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000677"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> Briefly, I wish to commend the spirit of the new

clause. I reassure the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East,

that even under current charity law there is latitude for trustees to

be appointed in such circumstances. My own experience of the

Alzheimer&#146;s Society, which deals not only with

Alzheimer&#146;s disease but with other forms of dementia, included

the moment when the first person with dementia was appointed as a

trustee. His business experience, intelligence and different

perspective on the running of the charity was incredibly valuable and

he was a very effective trustee. The nature of his dementia did not

preclude him from involvement in any of the charity&#146;s decision

making. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s fears are well

founded, but I commend to the Minister the spirit of the new

clause.</div><a name="0607145000310"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000678"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> We all owe a debt to the hon. Member for

Rochford and Southend, East for raising the issue. I have a few things

to say on it.</div><a name="0607145000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second

Reading, the hon. Gentleman said that his worry was prompted by the

situation of the SHIELDS&#151;supporting, helping, informing everyone

with learning disabilities in Southend&#151;parliament, an advocacy

organisation of which he is a trustee. Mandy Smedley, the administrator

of the SHIELDS parliament received advice from the commission that

people with learning difficulties cannot be charity trustees. The

commission looked into that and has confirmed that the advice given

through its telephone help line was incorrect. It will be writing to

her to apologise and to confirm the legal

position.</div><a name="0607145000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

discussed the matter raised by the hon. Gentleman with representatives

of the commission 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>since Second Reading. The commission needs to be more aware of the issue

in the future and must ensure that proper guidance is given. To that

end, I hope that several things happen, the first of which is that the

commission will write to the hon. Gentleman and set out the position

more clearly. Secondly, it will consider updating the document

&#147;Users on Board&#148;, which is about users of charities

becoming trustees, to make it absolutely clear that people with

learning disabilities are not excluded from being trustees, but,

indeed, encouraged to be trustees as part of its commitment to

diversity. It will also look at updating other documents, including

&#147;Finding New Trustees&#148;, to take account of such issues.

The latter document will not be updated so quickly, but the commission

will be making quick progress to update &#147;Users on

Board&#148;.</div><a name="0607145000313"></a>

Duddridge:</b> Specifically with the &#147;Users on

Board&#148; document, will the Parliamentary Secretary consider the

it says that it is unfair to impose on someone a range of duties that a

person cannot properly understand or does not want to carry out. That

general guidance to existing trustees caused some confusion,

too.</div><a name="0607145000314"></a>

Member for Rochford and Southend, East, who is doing the Committee a

service by raising the matter, he has confused learning disability with

the incapacity to make decisions on one&#146;s own rights. There is a

huge difference in those two definitions. While there may be a grey

area in between them, we must not assume that those with learning

difficulties are not capable of making decisions in their own right.

Will my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary comment on a situation

in which an existing trustee had a stroke and a power of attorney is

act for the trustee under such

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000686"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="0607145000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose

behind the new clause is to deal with what might be a slight gap in

charity law&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] The Minister is already

nodding his head vigorously. Sorry, I meant that he is shaking his head

vigorously. The new clause was the result of discussions with a learned

and noble Friend who had debated the Charity Bill at length in another

place. When discussing the public benefit test, he had realised the

possible implications of the loss of charitable status. The assumption

of many people would be that an institution that lost its charitable

status for whatever reason would simply carry on in a non-charitable

form. However, that would not be the case because the assets that it

had employed as a charity were given for a charitable purpose and must

in law be applied to a charitable purpose. They would not be available

to the non-charitable institution. In the case of fixed assets, such as

a significant building, that would be a major issue.</div>

<a name="0607145000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose behind the amendment

is to clarify what is already the intent&#151;and is certainly the

commission&#146;s intent&#151;to avoid the loss of charitable

status, that continuity and the interests of the beneficiary were ideal

and that every step should be taken to avoid this happening.</div>

<a name="0607145000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the event of loss of

charitable status happening, the clause makes clear that the desirable

outcome is not the collapse of the institution and the redeployment of

its assets to another charitable purpose, whether cy-prÃ(c)s or

not, but the continuity of the institution&#151;its name, public

reputation and the interests of its beneficiaries.</div>

<a name="0607145000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those responsible for the

charitable assets would have a duty to try and recreate the charity

within the terms of charity law and passing whatever public benefit

test or whatever other reason it was that they had failed in their

charitable status in the first place. My noble and learned Friend was

convinced that this is a gap in charity law. However, if the Minister

can reassure me, I would happily withdraw the new

clause.</div><a name="0607145000327"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000687"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> If I understand the new clause and the

explanation that the hon. Gentleman has given&#151;he has made a fair

speech&#151;I do not agree with his intent. If an organisation has

been a charity and has been held to have a charitable purpose, because

of this change of law&#151;which frankly, I do not think is

necessary; I prefer to assume that both education and religion are

charitable, but that is not the situation that we are in&#151;it is

perfectly possible that an organisation that has 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 318</div>operated as a charity with excepted charitable purposes for decades or

even hundreds of years may find itself ruled not to be

charitable.</div> <a name="0607145000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">One

circumstance, which the new clause is aimed at, is for the trustees to

accept it as a modern charity. The alternative is to say that is not

why we exist, we want to go on doing what we have been doing for

decades or centuries, even though we are now to be modernised and told

we are not a charity. In those circumstances, it is not right that all

their assets&#151;their name, property and endowments&#151;should

be taken from them and given to something that is still excepted as a

charity.</div><a name="0607145000329"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000688"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I hesitate to intervene on the hon. Gentleman and

ask him about something about which he may be wrong. Once the assets

have been given for a charitable purpose, they must be applied to that

charitable purpose. If that institution ceases to be charitable, it

cannot use them under any

circumstances.</div><a name="0607145000330"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000689"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> That is one of the reasons whyI might

do a disservice; I know that I have a communication problem. I need to

go on and attempt to perfect what I am trying to say.</div>

<a name="0607145000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us suppose that donor

Bottomley in the 1660s had said, &#147;I want my money to establish

an institution for purposes that are acceptably charitable in the 17th,

18th, 19th and 20th centuries.&#148; There is a tradition of what the

purpose is and it is accepted. Yet because of this change of

law&#151;we are changing the law and potentially redrawing the

boundaries of what is charitable&#151;Bottomley&#146;s donation

should be allowed to continue for the purpose for which it is given.

The fact that it is charitable is a secondary factor. I argue that, in

those circumstances, it should be allowed for the present trustees to

meet the purpose for which the trust was established. That is the

problem. I contend that it contradicts what the hon. Member has put

forward in his new clause. At some stage it would be useful to hear

other people&#146;s views on

that.</div><a name="0607145000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I can make my

point more clearly, I do not want to get involved in the independent

school issue. I do not want to try to imagine the circumstances in

which the Chancellor might so take against an Oxford college, which is

going to have some kind of regulation or is part of the exemption that

we have dealt with already&#151;so I should not go into that too

far&#151;that he wants to say, &#147;I am going to try to get the

Charity Commission to say that the charitable purpose is not

sufficient&#148;. If there were then a review, and it decided that

the public benefit was not great enough, and so the college&#146;s

charitable status was lost, what would happen to

it?</div>

<a name="0607145000546"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

pm</div><a name="0607145000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the

college be told that all the fellows who are the society, who are the

trustees, are going to be displaced and the Chancellor&#146;s friends

from some other university are going to be brought in? Or would there

be an advertisement and a public appointments commission, with

head-hunters being brought in, to decide, once a society had been

created, who should be the research fellows and what tenure each of

them should have&#151;all because the charitable purpose has been

redefined? It strikes me that the hon. Gentleman needs a bit of help on

this.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 319</div><a name="0607145000334"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000690"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I may have

underestimated the power and intellect behind his argument, because he

is right. The weakness in my new clause is that it says that where

charitable status is withdrawn from any organisation or

institution</div><a name="0607145000523"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;assets...must

be deployed or protected for the charitable

purpose&#148;,</div><a name="0607145000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">but it does not

specify whether those assets are charitable under the new law. If they

are considered to be charitable&#151;if they were given for an

obviously beneficial, philanthropic purpose that qualifies as

charitable even under the new public benefit test&#151;what I was

saying does apply and those assets would have to be deployed for a

charitable purpose and could not be carried forward to the new, now

non-charitable organisation. However, if those assets had been

charitable, but are not now charitable because, as the hon. Gentleman

said, they were given for a purpose that was deemed to be charitable in

the 17th century but is not deemed to be so under the new 21st century

law, there is a problem, which he has correctly identified, and I share

his

sentiment.</div><a name="0607145000336"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000691"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> Perhaps there is a better way of putting it.

Will the Minister reflect in the next few months on whether, in the

rare circumstances in which a charity cannot maintain its charitable

status, which will not be common unless a coach and horses is driven

through independent education, and when it is clear what the

donor&#151;the person who settled the trust&#151;intended and there

is a conflict between that intention and the new circumstances that

have come about because of this legislation, there can be some way of

settling whether the purposes must be changed to remain charitable, or

whether the purposes can be maintained and the assets used? If the

Minister is adamant, Report is going to be rather more interesting than

it would otherwise be. What I am really trying to say is that I do not

support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause, assuming that I have

properly understood

it.</div><a name="0607145000337"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000692"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I thank the whole Committee for this interesting

debate. Let me start with the legal base, which is really the subject

of the amendment, although it clearly goes much wider than that. I can

provide the whole Committee with an explanation by quoting from the

little-known Charity Commission document, &#147;Maintenance of an

Accurate Register of Charities&#148;. At paragraph 31, it

says:</div><a name="0607145000524"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In law,

assets held on a charitable trust are irrevocably dedicated to

charitable purposes. So, if trustees are unable or unwilling themselves

to arrange for changes to their charity&#146;s objects so that these

are exclusively charitable, then they must apply to us to make a

cy-prÃ¨s scheme directing that the assets held on trust are used

for other charitable purposes as near as possible to the original

purposes of the institution. We can help trustees in making such an

application.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The basis

for that is in common

law.</div><a name="0607145000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth

pointing out that it is wrong to say that charitable status is

&#147;withdrawn&#148; from an organisation. That is the word that

the hon. Gentleman uses in his amendment. It is a bit of a

logic-chopping point, but charitable status is not like a licence that

can be granted and withdrawn. An organisation is either inherently a

charity or not, depending on whether the purposes for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 320</div>which it exists are charitable and whether it is for the public benefit.

In registering a charity, the commission is not granting charitable

status to an organisation, but recognising that it is inherently

charitable, having legally assessed its purposes and the public

benefit.</div><a name="0607145000340"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000693"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I agree with his

interpretation; perhaps the use of the word &#147;withdrawn&#148;

was unwise drafting. Nevertheless, as the hon. Member for Worthing,

West has observed, we are in the process of changing the law, and it is

possible that an institution that was charitable may no longer be so.

It might be that charitable status is lost, rather than withdrawn. None

the less, charitable status could be held to have been lost&#151;the

change is possible.

</div><a name="0607145000341"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000694"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> It is difficult to understand, but loss of

charitable status is already possible&#151;the public benefit test

exists now. That takes me on to something that I was going to say about

what happens when an organisation is deemed not to be compliant with

the charitable purpose and public benefit requirements, which addresses

the point made by the hon. Member for Worthing, West. In that case,

action must be taken to get the institution back into charitable

status, and that is possible in most cases. It is not usually

inherently impossible for the institution to move back into charitable

status. In the few cases in which that cannot be done, the assets must

be dealt with by some form of cy-prÃ¨s variation of the

charitable purposes, but that is the already the situation

now.</div><a name="0607145000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman

asked was why it is not possible for the institution simply to carry

on, not as a charity, but essentially pursuing the same purposes. There

are two problems with that. First, it is not fair to the people who

gave money, property or whatever to the charity in the first place, who

did it on the basis that the institution was a charity that met

charitable purposes and provided public benefit. Secondly, loss of

charitable status removes not only some tax privileges, but a degree of

regulation so that the assets of the charity could then quite easily be

disbursed for private profit, because charity law would no longer apply

and there would be no regulator for the institution. The wording of the

new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Cheltenham is admirable, as

are the underlying sentiments, but no organisation would exist to

regulate the institution, because the institution would no longer be

covered by charity law.</div>

<a name="0607145000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the hon. Member for

Worthing, West that the issue is tricky. The reassurance that I offer

to him is that the Charity Commission will in all circumstances

endeavour to enable institutions to move back to charitable status if

public benefit is no longer met. That must be the Charity

Commission&#146;s priority. Only in the most extreme cases in which,

dare I say, there is stubbornness or refusal to co-operate would other,

more drastic measures be

considered.</div><a name="0607145000344"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000695"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> I know that the Minister&#146;s words are

intended to be helpful. It is clear that there should not be an easy

way for charity trustees to turn their charity into something

non-compliant and non-recognised, otherwise they would be able to just

walk away with the assets. That is easily accepted. I suspect that the

examples that I have in mind would be rare and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 321</div>difficult to achieve, and I am sure that trustees would in most cases

wish to remain compliant. I am sure that if there were a question mark

over recognition they would do their

best.</div><a name="0607145000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me cite an

odd example, which is not intended to be taken too seriously. The

former Member of Parliament for Cambridge University, Henry Lucas,

established two trusts. One was a hospital for the elderly in

Berkshire, of which I was once a trustee. The other, of which I was not

a trustee, established the Lucasian chair of mathematics in Cambridge,

which has been held by Isaac Barrow and Isaac Newton and is now held by

Stephen Hawking. Were it to be judged that higher mathematics had no

public benefit&#151;this is where the exaggeration comes in&#151;it

would be perfectly possible for the trustees to be told by the Charity

Commission, &#147;You are in danger of ceasing to be recognised so

you should switch to something else such as nursing, so that the

Lucasian chair of mathematics becomes the Lucasian chair of

nursing.&#148; The trustees would respond, &#147;Henry Lucas said

that he wanted mathematics. There is a tradition of mathematics and a

chair of mathematics it should remain.&#148; I know that that is

improbable, but it is the sort of issue that I have in mind. I hope

that the Minister will think about that and accept that there is

something in what I am saying: that there would need to be an

adjudicating authority. It is not easy, but I think that there is a

serious

problem.</div><a name="0607145000346"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000696"></a>The

Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman is in danger of winning the

award for the longest intervention in any

Committee.</div><a name="0607145000347"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000697"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> In the hon. Gentleman&#146;s defence, I think

that he presumed that I had

finished.</div><a name="0607145000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman&#146;s point is interesting. The answer is that one cannot

possibly imagine the circumstances in which the Charity Commission

would say that an organisation established for a chair of mathematics

should change to a chair of nursing. As earlier discussions showed, the

whole point about cy-prÃ¨s is that if the old purposes are either

not for the public benefit or cannot be carried out, the new purposes

must be as close as possible to the original intent of the gift. I do

not think that anyone can suggest that the gift in that case was

intended for a chair of nursing.</div>

<a name="0607145000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy for that discussion

to continue outside the Committee. Hon. Members must admit that I have

been very flexible so far, but on that matter I am inclined to be

inflexible. The Committee holds the nature of charity law in trust and

I am being invited down a dangerous road whereby an organisation that

did not meet the public benefit test could simply say, &#147;Well, in

that case we will go outside charity law.&#148; I know that that is

not what the hon. Member for Cheltenham was suggesting, but that would

betray the history of the organisation and the nature of charitable

law. So I am going to be intransigent, but as always we shall listen to

representations.</div><a name="0607145000350"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000698"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am disappointed that the Minister is inclined

to move from generosity to intransigence at this stage in the

Committee&#146;s deliberations.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div><a name="0607145000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I offer an alternative

example to the one offered by the hon. Member for Worthing, West? The

Joseph Rowntree trusts were established for a number of purposes, some

of which were specifically charitable and designed to fall within the

charitable remit. However, one of them&#151;I cannot remember which

one because the names are very similar&#151;was designed specifically

to fall outside charity law, yet under the new heads of charity, it

might well qualify as charitable. It is equally possible that under a

different Administration the law will change again, causing it to lose

that charitable status. As we change legislation, it is eminently

possible that organisations that were

charitable&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The Minister is shaking his

head. Perhaps he could explain the error in my

argument.</div><a name="0607145000352"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000699"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> This will be a legal one-way street. The hon.

Gentleman is right that an organisation that was not set up for

charitable purposes could become charitable if conventions of the time

change. However, once an organisation starts to benefit from charitable

status, it should not be able to take those benefits outside charity

law. That is why it is a one-way

street.</div><a name="0607145000353"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000700"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> That was not really the point that I was making.

An institution&#146;s charitable status might change, by virtue not

of its changing its activities, but of a change in the law. I was

simply supporting the point made by the hon. Member for Worthing,

West.</div><a name="0607145000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister was

right in describing the ideal process, which is that the loss of

charitable status should be the last resort and that everything should

be done by the Charity Commission to avoid that happening. It would

require a succession of intransigent trustees to make it happen.

However, it will be possible, as it is now, to lose charitable status.

As we change the basis of charitable status, that is slightly more

possible than it has been in the

past.</div><a name="0607145000547"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

pm</div><a name="0607145000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is

what happens to the assets of the charity in that event. The Minister

talked about assets falling outside charity law. My new clause does not

address that. It specifically states

that</div><a name="0607145000525"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

assets...must be deployed or protected for the charitable purpose

for which they were originally

constituted&#148;,</div><a name="0607145000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">so I am

addressing what happens to charitable assets that must still be applied

for charitable purposes. I have tried to frame a new clause that would

explicitly direct those responsible away from the cy-prÃ¨s route

towards the reconstitution of the charitable institution or the

charitable purposes as originally

constituted.</div><a name="0607145000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Worthing, West has identified a parallel and equal problem

with assets that might have been given first for the purpose of the

institution and only secondly as charitable assets and therefore might

well be considered not charitable under a change in the law. There is

also a lack of clarity about what might happen to those assets, as the

Minister, too, has

shown.</div><a name="0607145000358"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000701"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> First, just to fill a gap, I should say that it

was the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust that the hon. Gentleman referred

to. Secondly, does he believe 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div>that the Minister should reflect on the fact that it would be open to

the Government to change the law, whether through Parliament or under

one of the provisions that we discussed earlier, so that various bodies

that were not charities&#151;this is a separate point from the one

that I made before&#151;could have charitable status? There would be

a responsibility on the trustees to apply for it and then, if the

Government changed the law again or the Charity Commission changed the

way in which it thought of things, they would be caught and

stuck.</div><a name="0607145000359"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000702"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes more elegantly the point

that I was struggling to make that charitable status can change and

what happens to assets in the event of loss of charitable status is a

serious issue. The hon. Gentleman and the Minister have pointed out

technical problems with the drafting of my new clause, so I am content

to withdraw the motion, but I hope that the debate has shown that there

is a serious issue that the Minister might care to reflect on further.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

motion.</div><a name="0607145000360"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

admirable progress, this is an appropriate moment to remind the

Committee that in its programme motion of Tuesday 4 July it said that

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000704"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="0607145000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for

that reminder, Mr. Gale, and I shall do my best to comply

with it. The new clause is designed to place on a statutory basis the

institution of the independent complaints reviewer. The office already

exists, but the new clause would facilitate significant alterations to

the current arrangements. There is an accusation that the independent

complaints reviewer is, to an extent, the creature of the commission.

If it is to continue to exist and to be useful even after the Bill

creates the charity tribunal&#151;we also have the alternative of the

ombudsman route&#151;some changes to the status of the independent

reviewer could be instituted, and the new clause is designed to effect

those.</div><a name="0607145000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many

respects, the new clause is self-explanatory. In opposing a similar

suggestion in another place, the Minister, Lord Bassam of Brighton,

suggested that the ombudsman route was advantageous. However, in

practice that is not really available to many charities. As I said, in

many respects the new clause speaks for itself and I will not detain

the Committee any longer in proposing it, but I would be interested to

hear hon. Members&#146; views on

it.</div><a name="0607145000366"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000705"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> The problem with the new clause is that it would

give powers to the independent complaints reviewer that already exist

for the parliamentary ombudsman. The danger is that it would confuse

the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s situation. I refer the hon.

Gentleman to the 2004-05 report by Jodi Berg, the independent

complaints reviewer, who says on page

3:</div><a name="0607145000526"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

particular, an argument has been made for a new statutory office of

Independent Complaints Reviewer, changing the basis of appointment and

affording the office holder the power to award substantive compensation

to those adversely affected by the Commission&#146;s actions or

omissions.</div> <a name="0607145000527"></a><div class="hs_brev">My personal

view is that some caution needs to be exercised in relation to this

proposal. There is already a statutory avenue for complaints about the

Charity Commission, that being the Parliamentary and Health Service

Ombudsman, who is able to award redress for financial loss where she

deems it necessary to do so. It is doubtful whether a potentially

overlapping office would add anything for the citizen other than

confusion. My own role, in common with other similar offices, is based

on agreed terms of reference which underline my independence and

authority.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tend to

agree with the ICR.</div>

<a name="0607145000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a response open to the

hon. Member for Cheltenham. He could ask, &#147;How much power does

the parliamentary ombudsman have, and will Government accept her

recommendations?&#148; I point out that the Charity Commission has

always accepted the parliamentary ombudsman&#146;s recommendations,

which is an important record. I cannot speak for the commission, but I

think that it is good that it has done so. I do not think that the new

clause is advisable, and I hope that he will withdraw

it.</div><a name="0607145000369"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000706"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments.

He needs to understand why the parliamentary ombudsman route is not

available in practice for many charities. The independent complaints

reviewer is not empowered even to recommend that the commission pay

compensation 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 325</div>where a charity has suffered loss as a result of its practices. It also

routinely refuses to take up cases where there is a legal possibility

of pursuing the commission for compensation through the courts. In

practice, that route is potentially ruinously expensive for charities

and therefore not a realistic option, but it effectively bars them from

going to the

ombudsman.</div><a name="0607145000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proof of

the pudding is in what has happenedin the past decade. Since

the introduction of the Charities Act 1993, the parliamentary

ombudsmanhas investigated only eight complaints about the

commission&#146;s conduct, upholding three and recommending financial

compensation in two cases. There are clear grounds for the new clause

and the financial compensation powers that I am proposing. I hope that

if I withdraw it, the Minister will reflect on the role of the

independent complaints review and the possibility of strengthening its

powers, making access easier and introducing powers of financial

compensation.</div><a name="0607145000371"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000719"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="0607145000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause

was recommended by a learned friend, and I should be interested to hear

the Minister&#146;s response to

it.</div><a name="0607145000392"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000720"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> The new clause is about delegation, some of

which I suspect has already taken place from Lord Phillips to the hon.

Gentleman.</div> <a name="0607145000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first

subsection of the new clause is unnecessary, because the law already

allows charity trustees to delegate appropriately. The Charity

Commission&#146;s publication &#147;The Essential Trustee: What You

Need to Know&#148; puts it like

this:</div><a name="0607145000528"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Trustees

can generally delegate certain powers to agents or employees, but will

and must always retain the ultimate responsibility for running the

charity.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the context

of section 36 of the 1993 Act, it means that in practice, trustees must

personally make the initial decision to sell a property and the final

decision to sell it on particular terms. In between, the trustees may

and routinely do delegate the administration of the sale to their

staff. That balance is right.</div>

<a name="0607145000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second subsection of the new

clause would remove important safeguards on sales of property worth

less than &#163;500,000. Since the hon. Gentleman appears to want to

allow charities to sell their property without having it properly

valued, one wonders how they will know how much it is worth in the

first place. However, the serious point is that although he, as the

beneficial owner of his own house, is free to sell it at whatever price

he likes, the trustees of a charity do not have similar freedom. They

must obtain and consider a written report from a qualified surveyor,

and they are under a duty to dispose of their land only on the best

terms.</div> <a name="0607145000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The objection

to the new clause is that essentially the duties on trustees to take

expert advice and to sell only on the best terms reasonably obtainable

should not be disapplied as the new clause suggests. They are important

safeguards for the disposition of charity lands. However, I have a

piece of good news. I understand the amendment&#146;s deregulatory

intent, and I undertake to review the regulations that set out what a

surveyor&#146;s report must contain. They were made in 1992 and may

be seen as over-prescriptive, especially for smaller sales. Our review

would aim to reduce the level of detailed prescription in the

regulations.</div>

<a name="0607145000397"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000721"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> If the hon. Member for Cheltenham does not mind

me saying so, the Minister is right. However, the Minister might want

to include the exception&#151;I am not sure how far it is covered by

the 1992 provisions&#151;that if a charity sells property to another

charity, it does not have to get the best market price. It would be

interesting to know whether some of the regulations under the Charities

Act 1992 apply.</div>

<a name="0607145000398"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000722"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> That process is already possible, but I shall

consider the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. On 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 327</div>that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Cheltenham is happy-ish, and

will withdraw his new clause.</div>

<a name="0607145000399"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000723"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am interested in the Minister&#146;s

response. I was surprised by his response to the first part of the new

clause, which talks about the power to delegate to a proper officer.

Part of the problem is that properties can be disposed of once in a

blue moon by some charities, but when properties are left as part of a

legacy, as they frequently are, the requirement for the trustees always

to take the decision can be extremely onerous. I have talked to

charities that were under the impression that that was the requirement

in law, but the Minister&#146;s response appears to go against it.

Nevertheless, if that is the legal situation, and he has put it on the

record, they might well be reassured.</div>

<a name="0607145000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the second half of the new

clause, the value of &#163;500,000 is only indicative. It then

says,</div> <a name="0607145000529"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or a sum

afterwards determined&#148;</div><a name="0607145000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">by

the Secretary of State. It is a rare and generous example of me

offering rather than withdrawing latitude to the Secretary of State.

However, I am reassured by the Minister&#146;s statement, and I beg

to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</div>

grateful if the Minister told me that the new clause complied with the

Cheltenham principle, but I believe that it does not. It is intended to

provide an additional power&#151;although not, I emphasise, a

duty&#151;for local authorities to remit any fee that is payable to

them by a charity, or to draw up and operate a scheme of remittances

for such fees. I shall illustrate it, as one so often does, by

reference to a local example.

amended twice since then, and the Isle of Wight has once again started

holding extremely successful pop festivals, the most recent of which I

attended the previous one and enjoyed it immensely. Some 60,000 people

clause.</div><a name="0607145000411"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000728"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> When I raised the matter with councillors and

officers of the Isle of Wight council, they told me they had no power

to remit any fee payable under the Licensing Act 2003. If that is

untrue, I will be glad to hear it. It occurred to me that they may also

find themselves without the power to remit fees payable under other

Acts, and that we ought to give them that power. It would be entirely

discretionary; we are not forcing any local authority to spend any more

money than it is currently

spending.</div><a name="0607145000412"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000729"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> May I give wholehearted support to my hon.

Friend&#146;s new clause? A number of examples can properly be used.

For example, on Remembrance Sunday, when organisations including the

Royal British Legion want a temporary interruption to traffic, a

regulation requires them to apply for a full traffic management order,

and a fee is involved. Another example is that of a village that is

going to have a popular regatta and wants to ban traffic on a road. In

the past, that was done by custom and practice, but the law has been

tightened up so that people have to apply for a temporary road closure

order.</div><a name="0607145000413"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000730"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for

raising the issue, which is close to my heart and on which we have

tabled amendments to another Bill going through the House, namely the

Compensation Bill, which will deal with much of the

problem.</div><a name="0607145000414"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000731"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> The Minister may accept the new clause, in

which case further debates will not be necessary. The new clause might

for some reason need further modification, or the Government might need

to co-ordinate&#151;perhaps the Minister will want to talk to the

Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government&#151;to see

whether giving the option suggested to local government would be

acceptable across government. I know that it is acceptable to local

government, which wants control over crucial charges. I strongly

support the new

clause.</div><a name="0607145000415"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000732"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am delighted to have the opportunity at this

late stage in our deliberations definitively and finally to restate the

Cheltenham principle, which I believe is that if something such as the

new clause might require the services of an extremely expensive lawyer

to explain that it is not necessary, it might be worth putting it into

legislation in the interests of clarity and transparency. If the

officers of the Isle of Wight council are under the impression that it

is necessary, it is worth supporting. I therefore support the new

clause.</div><a name="0607145000416"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000733"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I am afraid that I disagree with the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of the Cheltenham 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 329</div>principle. As I remember it, as defined by my hon. Friend the Member for

High Peak (Tom Levitt)&#151;he will correct me if I am

wrong&#151;the principle relates to something that is nice but

ineffective.</div><a name="0607145000417"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000734"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> The exact wording used a long time ago was that

an amendment that was</div>

<a name="0607145000530"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;harmless, but not entirely

necessary&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee A,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000735"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I stand corrected. The question is whether the

new clause fulfils the Cheltenham or any other principle. Local

authorities can waive fees and charges to small charities in certain

cases. For example, under the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992, local

authorities have the discretion to waive a charge for waste collection

from premises occupied by a charity.</div>

<a name="0607145000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be a danger that the

new clause would drive a coach and horses through lots of national

charges applied by local authorities. Perhaps the hon. Member for Isle

of Wight would not mind that, but it would be more than my job&#146;s

worth. Having said that, I shall look at the issue properly and see

whether I can take on board some of the spirit of the new clause and do

something in a generous and charitable

way.</div><a name="0607145000421"></a>

commission is&#148; for the words &#147;the commission are&#148;.

That is Cheltenham all the way through.</div>

<a name="0607145000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to something rather

more serious. I tabled the new clause very late, and so the Committee

ought to know that if the Minister gives any kind of response, I do not

intend to push it to a vote. Secondly, many of us have had

correspondence from Benedict Birnberg, Uri Davis, Roland Rance and

David Wolton. Those who have read the correspondence will know about

the issue that they had in mind, but I do not think that it is

appropriate for the Committee to become involved in that in any sense

whatsoever.</div> <a name="0607145000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new

clause is about human rights compliance, and I am relying quite heavily

on a letter that Benedict Birnberg and his colleagues sent to the

Minister, dated 26 June. I shall also be quoting from a letter sent to

the Charities Bill team on 3 June. The proposed new clause

</div><a name="0607145000535"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is framed to make it

clear...that English charities may not engage in activities which,

were they committed by a public authority, would be inconsistent with

Convention rights as defined in the Human Rights Act 1998 and to

mandate&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607145000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">to

require&#151;</div><a name="0607145000536"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

Charities Commission to investigate and take appropriate action against

charities which are alleged to do so by exercising its statutory

powers.&#148;</div><a name="0607145000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">The allegation by

itself should not be sufficient. The wording of the proposed amendment

by which I have been assisted was based on the advice, I am told, of a

senior member of the judiciary.</div>

<a name="0607145000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter dated 3 June is from

correspondence with the Charity Commission and the charities unit,

which has now moved to the Minister&#146;s Department from the Home

Office. It has been put to Benedict Birnberg and his colleagues that

existing charity law is sufficient to empower the Charity Commission to

take action to deal with the abuses that were alleged when a complaint

was put forward against a particular charitable trust. In fact, the

petitioners, if I can put it that way, supported the view that the law

was sufficient. That is why they wrote to the commission, seeking the

investigation of the activities that they alleged contravened

international human rights laws.</div>

<a name="0607145000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Charity Commission rejected

the complaint, taking the view that it operated within a statutory

framework that precluded it from undertaking such an investigation, let

alone from having the power to cause any remedial action. The

petitioners considered, as they argue in the letter, that there was a

gap in charity law that needed to be filled, namely the deficient 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 333</div>powers, as they saw it, of the commission to monitor and intervene in

the affairs of a UK charity alleged to be engaged in activities that

would be incompatible with the Human Rights Act 1998 were it to be a

public authority.</div>

<a name="0607145000445"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607145000745"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): The hon.

Gentleman raises an extremely important and serious matter. Could he

explain to me, as I am confused, his position in relation to his hon.

and right hon. Friends, who appear to have a problem with the Human

Rights Act and think that perhaps we should get rid of

it?</div>

<a name="0607145000446"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000746"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> No.</div>

<a name="0607145000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">The petitioners continued that

they carefully considered what the Charities Bill team sent back, but

that it reinforced their concerns. They were told that charity law

provides remedies either in circumstances when the

charity&#146;s</div>

<a name="0607145000537"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;purposes cease to be charitable

under English law&#148;</div><a name="0607145000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">or in

circumstances when the

charity</div><a name="0607145000538"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;carries out

unacceptable activities (for example, activities that are

unlawful...)&#148;.</div> <a name="0607145000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

whole point is that because charity law is, in the petitioners&#146;

view, so unspecific and lacking in clarity and the existing statutory

powers of intervention so limited, that prompts the question of what

purposes are non-charitable and what charity activities are

unacceptable or unlawful.</div>

<a name="0607145000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the absence of clear

statutory precepts, the reaction of the commission to the

petitioners&#146; complaint and to similar complaints is bound to be

as it was. There is no criticism of the commission in what has been

said, but rather it has been questioned whether there is a gap in the

law. It may be that charity law needs amending&#151;and the

petitioners would say that it certainly does&#151;to make it explicit

that an English charity, or for that matter any charity anywhere in the

United Kingdom, may not engage in activities that contravene

international human rights provisions and standards, and that the

commission is mandated to intervene if it does

so.</div>

<a name="0607145000549"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

pm</div><a name="0607145000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal

that was first discussed in correspondence has been changed and its

most recent form is the new clause that I am offering to the Committee

today. The particular wording does not matter, but the commission

wishes to see&#151;and there is an argument here that the Committee

might wish to consider&#151;an amendment that satisfied the principle

behind the concerns. The underlying issue is whether non-state

institutions have obligations under human rights treaties and if so, to

what degree. The purpose of the new clause is to make it explicit that

UK charities not only are expected to comply with international human

rights standards, but can be required to do

so.</div><a name="0607145000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other

matters contained in a letter that could come up if we return to the

issue later, but I have spelled out the issue and the responses from

the Charities Bill unit, which was very open, and the Charity

Commission. The underlying question is not whether the law is being

applied or interpreted 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 334</div>properly, but whether there is a gap in the law. The Committee might

benefit from hearing the Minister&#146;s

response.</div><a name="0607145000453"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000747"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> I do not want to detain the Committee, for obvious

reasons, but one issue about international activity by charities that

has been drawn to my attention&#151;and to which the Minister might

slip in a response in replying to the debate&#151;is the extent to

which the commission has a duty to ascertain that money raised in this

country for charitable purposes is spent for charitable purposes

overseas. We know that that is the duty of the charity and of the

commission; the question is whether they have the capacity to discharge

it.</div> <a name="0607145000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned

because of allegations, of which I am sure Ministers and hon. Members

are aware, that some religious charities in this country remit

considerable funds overseas, where they are spent for purposes that are

only borderline religious, at least in the sense that that is

understood in the United Kingdom.</div>

<a name="0607145000455"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000748"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Worthing,

West for raising this difficult and serious issue. Things are

difficult, partly because the example that the correspondence has

raised seems to rest on the territorial nature of the charity.

Geographical restriction as a principle is well established in charity

law as a perfectly legitimate restriction that would not contradict

public benefit. To introduce a new clause that appears to detract from

the commission&#146;s ability to judge public benefit on a broad

basis seems to narrow the commission&#146;s remit.</div>

<a name="0607145000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am sympathetic to the

new clause, it opens a door to further attempts to define more

narrowly, in ways outside the public benefit test, exactly how the

commission behaves. However, the issue is serious and I should like a

reassurance from the Minister that, under his interpretation of the

Bill, charities that engaged in activities that fell short of human

rights standards would not pass a new public benefit test, and that

activities undertaken overseas that are widely accepted as being

charitable&#151;in the case of Oxfam and many others that is well

established&#151;but which fall short of proper human rights

standards should not pass the public benefit test

either.</div>

<a name="0607145000457"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000749"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> This is a fitting new clause to discuss in our

last debate. The hon. Member for Worthing, West has raised a complex

but important subject, although I shall not be able to give a

substantive and definitive answer today, because the issues are

incredibly complex and involve many parts of

government.</div>

<a name="0607145000458"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000750"></a>Mr.

Flello:</b> The hon. Member for Worthing, West was unable to

clear the fog over whether those on the Opposition Benches wish to get

rid of the Human Rights Act 1998. Will my hon. Friend the Parliamentary

Secretary consider the additional costs that would be incumbent on a

charity when looking at the legal implications of making sure that it

was complying with the Human Rights Act each time that it did

something?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 335</div><a name="0607145000459"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000751"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. We must bear

in mind three issues. First, such a proposal would require quite

detailed investigative action by the commission. Secondly, that action

would be outside Great Britain and, thirdly, there is much wider issue

about the extent to which non-state actors are subject to the European

convention on human

rights.</div><a name="0607145000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal

with each issue briefly. Of course, the commission has investigative

powers and can exercise them, although the sort of investigation that

would be involved when making a judgment about human rights standards

would be incredibly complex. Without going into a particular case in

detail, it is clear from the new clause that the issues involved would

be extremely deep and complicated.</div>

<a name="0607145000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second issue is the power of

the Charity Commission outside Great Britain. It can visit other

countries to look into allegations, but its staff cannot exercise any

powers outside England and Wales. Its powers of investigation under the

Bill are confined to England and Wales. That limits its ability to

investigate outside the United Kingdom in the way suggested under the

new clause, although it can, of course, hold trustees in England and

Wales fully accountable for the charity&#146;s

activities.</div><a name="0607145000462"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now

to the third and most fundamental issue, which is the extent to which

the ECHR applies to non-state actors. For most purposes, a charity

would not usually be subject to the Human Rights Act, which places a

duty on public authorities not to act incompatibly with the convention

rights. It is possible that a charity could be a public authority were

it to be exercising a public functions, such as the provision of

publicly funded care. However, it would be extremely unlikely ever to

be exercising such a function

overseas.</div><a name="0607145000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new

clause would be a new departure because it would place obligations on a

charity not necessarily in its role as a public authority to comply

with the ECHR. That is the Government&#146;s view of the new clause.

However, given its importance, the lucid way in which the hon. Member

for Worthing, West presented it and the distinguished nature of those

who have contacted us, it deserves a more substantive reply than I have

been able to give. I shall endeavour at least to report back to the

Committee in some form or another on our view. Obviously, the matter

can be raised on

Report.</div><a name="0607145000464"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000752"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> We must be aware of two issues, the first of which

concerns when remittances are made outside the United Kingdom or

England and Wales. I do not know what powers the commission has in

respect of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Should the trustees be

expected to demonstrate a higher level of awarenessin such

circumstances so that they can show the commission that money has been

properly spent than would be the case if that money were spent in

England and Wales?</div><a name="0607145000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

second question impinges on that. I believe that I am right in saying

that a charity may currently have objectives for a particular racial or

ethnic group. Were such an amendment accepted, would it have an effect

on certain existing charities in England and

Wales?</div><a name="0607145000466"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000753"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> I feel that I am already skating on legal thin

ice. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is valid 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div>and I shall address it in any substantive answer that I give to the

Committee on the new clause. The issue is important and I thank him for

raising it. I shall endeavour to come back with a more substantive

reply at a later

date.</div><a name="0607145000467"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000754"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> The Minister may find that the issue should be

dealt with by written statement or on Report. We have nearly finished

our work so he will not be able to come back to the Committee. In

passing, may I say to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South

(Mr. Flello) that I was advised, at the time that I was

first elected, that bringing up a straightforward party point in the

middle of a serious debate does not always carry the reputation of the

Committee forward?</div><a name="0607145000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister has dealt fairly with my points. He may have added some

additional ones, because my new clause does not refer to

extraterritoriality, though the example behind it is there. I fully

understand the reluctance of the Charity Commission to be bound up in

investigating things that may have happened&#151;they did happen in

one particular case 50 years ago&#151;in the middle of one of the

most complex areas of pain and disorder that one could imagine. Even if

what I am proposing is right and acceptable, I can see that there would

be arguments of practicality. For instance, what would it open up in

terms of consequence? At the moment, however, there remains the

question of what is right.</div>

<a name="0607145000469"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should perhaps declare that I

think that I was a fellow trustee with Benedict Birnberg on the Canon

Collins Educational Trust for Southern Africa&#151;the follow-up to

the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa. The Defence and Aid Fund

was not charitable, but the Canon Collins trust was. What has been said

by Benedict Birnberg and his colleagues and the way that the new clause

has been proposed do not necessarily open up many of the problems that

have been discussed in our brief debate. Will the Minister consider

whether the approach in the new clause is right, proper and useful, and

whether it is controllable? I know that he is not committed to

accepting it, but I should be grateful for his reflections. I beg to

ask leave to withdraw the

motion.</div><a name="0607145000470"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and

clause, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000755"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> On a point of order. Mr. Gale, I want

to say some thank yous. This is as close as I shall get to the Oscar

ceremony, but I promise that my speech will not be as long as those at

the Oscar ceremony&#151;although as I understand it, I have

until9

o&#146;clock.</div><a name="0607145000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me

start by thanking the Doorkeepers, the police, the Clerk and the staff

of the Committee for their hard work during the last two

weeks.</div><a name="0607145000474"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000756"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> And the official

reporters.</div><a name="0607145000475"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000757"></a>Edward

Miliband:</b> And the official reporters&#151;I am extremely

grateful to them for their work and dedication to their job. I also

thank my officials, led by Richard Corden. I can reveal to the

Committee that he has had the privilege of working in the strategy unit

on 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 337</div>the report that led to the Bill, then going to the Charity Commission to

reply to the Bill, and then coming into Government to implement the

Bill&#151;a real hat trick. He has ably led what is a very able team

of officials.</div> <a name="0607145000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also

thank the members of the Committee. On my own side there was a

glittering array of talent. They have engaged very much with the

Bill&#151;mainly constructively. My hon. Friend the Member for Bishop

Auckland (Helen Goodman) had 11 amendments of her own, which showed her

reputation for independence. My right hon. Friend the Member for

Cardiff, South and Penarth has brought his great expertise to the

subject and to the Committee, and I am very grateful to him.</div>

<a name="0607145000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for

High Peak (Tom Levitt) has coined a new principle, which I expect will

endure beyond this Committee. I am grateful to all Members of this

Committee, especially my hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham

(Dr. Blackman-Woods) and for West Bromwich, West (Mr.

Bailey) who have been extremely kind to me. Most importantly, my hon.

Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman) has kept me in order as I

predicted that she would do.</div>

<a name="0607145000550"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

pm</div><a name="0607145000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me also pay

tribute to some notable contributions on the other side, including the

hon. Member for Worthing, West and the hon. Member for Cheltenham who

has asked me many difficult questions to which I have not known the

answer. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Cheltenham who has

brought good humour and a new principle to this debate and to the hon.

Member for Isle of Wight who has brought his considerable talents and

assiduousness to the work of this Committee. Finally, thanks to

Mrs. Humble and to yourself, Mr. Gale, for your

stern, but fair, chairmanship. Finally, I think that we have met the

two principles of being a charity: charitable purpose and public

benefit. I thank all members of the

Committee.</div><a name="0607145000479"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000758"></a>Mr.

Turner:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.

Gale, may I endorse the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary? I am

grateful to those whom he has mentioned and my failure to repeat them

individually is not an indication that I am not genuinely grateful to

them. I am also grateful to him for his forbearance on occasions,

assistance on many occasions and genuine agreement and attempt to reach

consensus wherever possible on the further proceedings of this

Bill.</div> <a name="0607145000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to

my hon. Friends and in particular, my hon. Friend the Member for

Upminster (Angela Watkinson) for her assistance, to my hon. Friend the

Member for Worthing, West for the great knowledge that he has brought

to the Bill and to my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham in

providing a useful &#147;butt&#148;. I also acknowledge the support

of my research assistant. I think the job of a virgin Front Bencher

depends heavily on the assistance of their research support.</div>

<a name="0607145000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the officials

of the Charity Commission which has responded to my frequent letters,

and to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s predecessor, the Under-Secretary of

State for Northern Ireland, the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 338</div>hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) for having

been quick to respond to my many

inquiries.</div><a name="0607145000482"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000759"></a>Martin

Horwood:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.

Gale, I would like to add my thanks to yourself and Mrs.

Humble for the firm but fair way in which you have regulated us. My

thanks to the Clerks and the officials, both those who are present and

those in the Minister&#146;s office who have worked hard behind the

scenes to help the Committee

proceed.</div><a name="0607145000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">The spirit in

which this Committee has undertaken its deliberations is in contrast to

my only other experience of a Bill in Committee, which was rather more

confrontational, less humorous and less constructive. The Bill will be

received well by the voluntary sector. The spirit in which the Bill has

proceeded as a piece of legislation is exemplary. The Minister&#146;s

tone and attitude in responding and listening to the points that we

made in a serious way reflected well on him.</div>

<a name="0607145000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay credit to my researcher,

Jake Rigg and the hard work that he and Elizabeth Fosten have done in

my office to try and take me as a fellow Committee virgin through this

process. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight for

describing my &#147;butt&#148; as useful. I will try and think of a

comparable comment for him. I take it in the spirit in which I assume

that it was meant. Finally, I thank the hon. Member for High Peak for

recognising that Cheltenham is indeed a town that deserves its own

principle.</div><a name="0607145000485"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000760"></a>Peter

Bottomley:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.

Gale, if Back Benchers are allowed to join in this exchange of thanks

and praise, I am glad that the Minister referred to those who backed

him up&#151;those in his Department and the Charity Commission.

However, I do not think that we have mentioned trustees or the charity

lawyers who give them guidance. They deserve to be mentioned for their

attention to what has gone on, not just in Committee, but in previous

years. The lawyers will also be helping trustees when the Bill comes

into force.</div><a name="0607145000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in

which the Front Benchers have led the debates has been exemplary. I say

to the Minister, in the hope of doing his party as much damage as

possible, he deserves his place on the Front Bench and the sooner that

he gets into opposition and lets us take over his role, the

better.</div><a name="0607145000487"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607145000761"></a>Tom

Levitt:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.

Gale, I never thought that I would rise, accused of having said that

Liberals have principles. I know that the Cheltenham principle will be

forever with us and brings a warm glow to the heart of my hon. Friend

the Member for West Bromwich, West, who is a native of

Cheltenham.</div><a name="0607145000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a

serious note, I do not expect that on Report we will bring too much

controversy or dissent. Over the four days of our work, we have

witnessed a serious and timely updating of charity law which, as we

know, has been with us for 400 years. I believe that the importance of

the voluntary and community sectors, and the third sector generally, is

in logarithmic phase at the moment and is of ever increasing value and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 339</div>importance. I am proud to have served with colleagues on both side of

the House in taking the matter

forward.</div><a name="0607145000489"></a>
