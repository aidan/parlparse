Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I beg to
move amendment 22, in clause 8, page 6, line 24, at beginning insert
&#145;On or before 31 December
2010&#146;.</div><a name="10011434000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000191"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 1, in
clause 8, page 6, line 24, leave
out &#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;shall&#146;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0"><i class="I">Currently the
bill is written in a way that means that the Secretary of State is not
required to make schemes for the purpose of reducing fuel poverty. This
amendment would place an obligation on him to do
so.</i></div><a name="10011434000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000192"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> We are beginning part 2, and the deliberations on
fuel poverty and the schemes for its reduction&#151;a welcome and
topical subject. I propose to be brief because this is an introductory
group of amendments and more substantive debate will come in a moment
or
two.</div><a name="10011434000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have announced that they are moving towards a statutory
agreement for alleviating fuel poverty at the end of the present
voluntary agreement in 2012. The Minister knows that that is welcome
and that everybody has, in effect, signed up to that. Whatever the
rights and wrongs of the voluntary system run by the utilities,
everybody has concluded that a compulsory statutory system is
needed.</div>
<a name="10011434000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
questioned the utility representatives, they accepted that. They had
different interpretations of how successful the voluntary system had
been. We asked them the same question that we asked Ministers: has the
voluntary system been a failure? They made various points, but the
conclusion has been reached, and rightly, that we need to replace the
voluntary system with a statutory one.</div>
<a name="10011434000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 22
would simply require the Secretary  of State to make one or
more schemes for the purpose of reducing fuel poverty by the end of
this year. It would tie down the timetable by which the scheme had to
be in place, which would obviously have to be done by secondary
legislation. It would get the Government to agree to commit to
implementing legislation this year, which would bind the hands of
whoever was in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>Government after the general election, which has to come this year. That
would be a good thing because it would bind others if this Minister was
not still in office&#151;who knows, that may be the outcome of the
election in May or June. I wish the Minister no personal ill will, but
that is the nature of elections. He cannot be sure what the future
holds.</div><a name="10011434000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
1 is equally important. It is of a type often found in Committee and
would require the Secretary of State to make the schemes by secondary
legislation&#151;by regulation&#151;rather than leaving it as an
option. I know that it is conventional to draft Bills to say that the
Secretary of State &#147;may by regulations&#148; do something and
that that is permissive, but we need to tie the Government&#146;s
hands. If legislation says that they must, then they must. There will
not be any possible ducking, diving or weaving by whoever has
responsibility in the months
ahead.</div><a name="10011434000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that there is no great controversy about either of the amendments,
and I hope that the Minister is sympathetic to both. If he thinks that
there are technical problems in the drafting, I will be happy to think
about that and come back on Report, but I hope that the new scheme can
be in place by the end of the year and that the legislation will make
it clear that it will happen, not that it may happen. That will
reassure all those with an interest in the
issue.</div>
<a name="10011434000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000193"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
(Mr. David Kidney):</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his comment about not wanting me personally to lose my
seat at the next general election. I am all for that.</div>
<a name="10011434000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have made their intentions on social price support very
clear. In July, in the low carbon transition plan, we said that we did
not think it acceptable that nothing followed the voluntary agreement.
We said that we would bring forward a policy of mandated social price
support, and in November last year we introduced this Energy Bill,
which contains the enabling clauses required to do so. We said that we
would significantly increase the amount that suppliers had to spend,
and in the pre-Budget report, we announced that suppliers will have to
provide &#163;300 million a year by 2013-14. That is double what
suppliers agreed to provide in the final year of the voluntary
agreement.</div>
<a name="10011434000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We said that
we would help suppliers better target those who need the help. The
regulations to put in place the data-sharing pilot, allowing us to test
this innovative tool, were considered and agreed yesterday by the House
of Commons. There is now no chance that the proposal will not happen,
and it will happen because of what we have already put in
place.</div>
<a name="10011434000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">All members
of the Committee agree on the importance of making further progress on
tackling fuel poverty and the need to continue to identify better ways
of helping more of the most vulnerable households. I believe that the
intention behind the amendments is to ensure that the Government act on
the provisions of the Bill and bring forward regulations to create the
mandated social price support scheme.</div>
<a name="10011434000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not take
it as any criticism or questioning of my honourable intentions that the
hon. Gentleman should have made these proposals. Although our
intentions on mandated social price support can be in no doubt, I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>happy to repeat yet again, on the record, that the Government are fully
committed to bringing forward mandated social price support in time to
follow on from when the current voluntary agreement ends in
2011.</div>
<a name="10011434000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 22
would require the regulations to be in place unnecessarily early. The
voluntary agreement does not end until March 2011 and suppliers have
already committed to a collective spend of &#163;150 million on
support schemes in the 2010-11 financial year. The new scheme will not
come into force until after the voluntary agreement has ended.
Furthermore, we should not underestimate the significant amount of work
that will be done if the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament later this
year. We have rightly committed to public consultation on the
regulations, which, in line with the Cabinet Office&#146;s normal
guidelines, will run for three months&#151;as it should, because
these are big, serious and important issues. After the consultation, we
have to collate the information received and ensure that the
regulations fully reflect the finalised policy.</div>
<a name="10011434000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">To help as
many people as possible in the most meaningful way, we need to work
through a number of issues before we can set out detailed proposals,
even for the consultation. For example, we need to identify the right
balance between the overall number of households that we help through
this policy and the appropriate level of support that we give them,
within that &#163;300 million funding envelope announced
in the pre-Budget report. We also need to determine the best and most
cost-effective ways to identify and deliver the support to those who
need it most, while minimising the risk of fraud in the scheme.
Finally, we need to consider the evidence on which elements currently
funded through the voluntary agreement&#151;such as trust funds,
partnership working, debt write-off and sponsorship&#151;should be
continued in the new system as part of the legacy spending.</div>
<a name="10011434000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that
requires analysis and work with Ofgem, suppliers, consumer
representatives and other key stakeholders, including Members of
Parliament with an interest in the subject. I also believe it would be
useful to feed as much information as possible from the data-matching
pilot that I mentioned into the proposals for the social price support
mechanism before launching the consultation. Subject to successful
testing of the processes and systems, that data-matching pilot is
expected to take place in the spring.</div>
<a name="10011434000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a more
technical note, because of how it is worded, the amendment would limit
the Secretary of State to bringing forward a mandated price support
mechanism once. That is because the amendment would not give the
Secretary of State the power to introduce any further schemes to reduce
fuel poverty after the specified date at the end of December.</div>
<a name="10011434000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that that is not the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention, because clearly
it would be sensible to retain the option of introducing more schemes
in the future, as and when they are needed. There is a strong
precedent, of course, in existing legislation for using
&#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;shall&#148;. It is very
unusual to require the Secretary of State to introduce regulations;
moreover, it is not necessary in this context. We will bring forward a
mandated social price support scheme in 2011, as promised, after the
current voluntary agreement
ends.</div>
<a name="10011434000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all those
reasons&#151;and with yet another reiteration of my commitment to
introduce the scheme before the voluntary agreement comes to an
end&#151;I hope that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey will withdraw the
amendment, otherwise I will ask my hon. Friends to vote against
it.</div>
<a name="10011434000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000194"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> To show that there is always good will when
Ministers are reasonable, I am persuaded by the Minister&#146;s
response to the first amendment and will therefore seek to withdraw it.
On the second amendment, I am not persuaded because the Minister has
given the conventional argument that says, &#147;I will do it and
therefore I do not need to be obliged to do it by legislation&#148;.
As the Minister understands, he may not be the person who is
responsible for these matters, as it depends on who is in government.
However, it is on the record that he, as a Minister, has given the
undertaking, which is relevant if we are to hold the Government to
account. It is never as good to have permissive rather than obligatory
obligations, but I am not going to start on a confrontational note. I
will reflect, when we complete Committee proceedings, on the areas that
we need to toughen up on Report by imposing definite obligations on
Government, rather than obligations that give them options.
For the time being I am content not to press the first amendment, and I
beg to ask leave to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="10011434000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="10011434000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000195"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment 2, in clause 8,
page 6, line 25, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) A scheme under
this section must make provision for a national programme to make every
home a warm home within 10 years of the passing of this Act.
For the purposes of this Act a warm home shall mean a home that is
rated 81 or above on the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) ratings
system.&#146;.</div><a name="10011434000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled in my name, in that  of my hon. Friend the
Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, who is here to support this
important measure, and in the names of our other hon. Friends as well.
The amendment is, in our book, very important because, if it is
accepted by the Committee, it would establish a much more comprehensive
scheme for dealing with fuel poverty than anything that the Government
have so far done, or have said that they plan to do. If the amendment
is accepted it would require the Government to make provision for a
national programme to make every home a warm home within 10 years; that
is, by 2020. For the purposes of the measure, a warm home would mean a
home rated 81 or above on the SAP&#151;standard assessment
procedure&#151;rating system, which is generally accepted as being
the right system for assessment.</div>
<a name="10011434000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come to
the Committee this morning the day after a debate in the Chamber on
energy security. One of the key issues that emerged from that debate
was that to achieve energy security we need to reduce unnecessary
energy consumption, and one way in which we can do so significantly is
by having properly insulated homes. When the right hon. Member for
Derby, South (Margaret Beckett) was the Minister for Housing last year,
she wrote to me, and subsequently confirmed in oral questions, that
only one in 100 British homes meet the SAP 81 standard. I invite the
Minister to confirm that there are no updated figures that suggest that
that is not the position.</div>
<a name="10011434000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government response last October to the inquiry by the Select Committee
on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs into energy efficiency and fuel
poverty is, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>in many ways, the latest comprehensive statement of Government policy
and intent in this area. On page 25, in response to the
Committee&#146;s 30th recommendation, the Government
say:</div><a name="10011434000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;DECC
believes that using SAP ratings as a standard, and requiring all fuel
poor households to be upgraded to a SAP 81 rating by 2016, ignores the
diversity of the UK housing stock, over 40% of which has a SAP rating
between 39-54&#148;</div>
<a name="10011434000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next paragraph goes
on to
say:</div><a name="10011434000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is currently estimated that only 35,000 properties in England meet Band
B&#151;SAP 81, and that 1.7 million homes are Band
C &#151;SAP 69, 28,000 of which are thought to be fuel poor.
The average SAP rating of all homes is 50, according to the 2007
English House Condition Survey
(EHCS).&#148;</div><a name="10011434000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious that the power to legislate on those matters is more
significant in England than in the devolved Administrations. Those are
obviously English housing figures, but there is no indication that the
level of properly insulated homes is significantly higher in the other
three countries of the
UK.</div><a name="10011434000164"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000197"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is, of course, a relevant issue and an
important part of the proposal, and I shall come to it in a minute. We
have about 22 million households in the United Kingdom. New house
building accounts for less than 1 per cent. of the housing stock in any
given year, and at the current rate of demolition and building some 75
per cent. of the existing housing stock will still be in use by 2050.
In an article this month by Brenda Boardman, there was a graphic and
colourful illustration of the time it would take to replace our housing
stock. She said:</div>
<a name="10011434000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Did
you know that your home could still be standing and occupied in 3010?
That is not a typo, it is a statistic. In the UK we are demolishing
about 20,000 properties a year out of a total of 26 million. That means
the stock will take 1300 years to
replace.&#148;</div><a name="10011434000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
significant point is that all the legislation in the world about new
housing may be brilliant, but it is relatively insignificant, compared
with the amount of housing that will not be new and in which people
will continue to live. I am reassured that the hon. Member for
Northampton, South feels that he has a home that will still be there
well beyond his lifetime and into the lifetime of many generations
after
him.</div><a name="10011434000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
than 4 million homes that were built before 1914 are currently in use,
and that is hugely important on two accounts. One is that those homes
are cold and energy-inefficient, and the other is that their emissions
are high. The Government understand the obligation to deal with
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions; we all know that about 27 per cent. of
emissions in the UK come from domestic housing. Dealing with energy
efficiency and emissions at the same time would be a completely win-win
option. It would be a further win because of its capacity significantly
to reduce fuel bills. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee
estimated that if we had proper energy insulation across the country,
people&#146;s bills could be reduced by 50 per cent. That figure was,
I think, cited yesterday in the Chamber by the hon. Member for
Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div><a name="10011434000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
phenomenal task ahead. The Government, as they indicated in their
response to the Select Committee, have, of course, not been inactive,
and there are now various programmes that deal in part with these
issues, including the Warm Front programme, the carbon emissions
reduction target programme&#151;CERT&#151;and the community energy
saving programme or CESP. However, it was clear in the Select
Committee&#146;s report last autumn that those schemes together do
not sufficiently meet even the Government&#146;s targets and
ambitions, and that they ought to be put together under one national
programme, rather than having three overlapping, inconsistent and not
coherently co-ordinated schemes. That was certainly not addressed
adequately in the Government&#146;s response to the Committee, so I
seek to probe them on
it.</div><a name="10011434000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have announced that they want to do something called
&#147;the Great British Refurb&#148; post-2012. The Secretary of
State has indicated in oral responses to me in parliamentary questions
in recent weeks that the Government have, or plan to have, a 10-year
programme for delivering that. However, if one seeks to discover what
is behind it, one finds that it is all a bit opaque. There are lots of
programmes around, including those that I have named. There are
consultations taking place at this very moment on extending the carbon
emissions reduction target. The Government will no doubt respond to
that, and it was referred to in the Select Committee
report.</div><a name="10011434000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
concern, however, is whether the Government are seriously willing to
make the step change to say that we are not just going to deal with the
fuel poor who spend more than &#163;10 in every &#163;100 of their
income on their fuel bills. Not only do we want to try to make up for
lost time in meeting the targets that we have set ourselves and that
everybody thinks the Government are unlikely to meet, but we want to
have a much more comprehensive
system.</div><a name="10011434000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me make two specific points before outlining our proposal in response
to the intervention of the hon. Member for Northampton, South. I want
the Government to clarify exactly what their plans are, as well as what
the Department of Energy and Climate Change has in the pipeline in
relation to announcements and whether the great announcement of the
national scheme will happen before the election. The scheme has been
trailed and half-promised, but it is extremely vague and does not seem
to have the Government&#146;s support, because they have not been
willing to find the money or the
commitment.</div><a name="10011434000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
central issue is that the Government are going to fail to meet their
target of taking people out of fuel poverty by the end of this year,
although they have not admitted it yet. Secondly, the Government have a
statutory obligation in legislation to take everybody, as far as is
practicable, out of fuel poverty by 2015. What is the Minister&#146;s
assessment of achieving that longer-term target? It is more obtainable
in theory, even if the shorter target, which is meant to be met by the
end of this year, is
not.</div><a name="10011434000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000198"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am deeply concerned to try to meet the target of
completely eradicating fuel poverty. The hon. Gentleman wants to give
me a target to improve all the houses in the country within 10 years.
Is that instead of my target or is it in addition to it? A lot of the
money that I would like to spend on eradicating fuel poverty&#151;the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>mandated social price scheme, for example&#151;will help address other
related elements, such as the household incomes and bills of the
poorest people in the country. Does the hon. Gentleman seek to take the
money for those elements away from me in order to fund his own
proposal, or does he want to add another huge bill on top of
them?</div><a name="10011434000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000199"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I can be clear about the answer to
that.</div><a name="10011434000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000200"></a>The
Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury (Steve
McCabe):</b> And
succinct?</div><a name="10011434000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000201"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> And succinct. I want the Government to merge all
their current programmes into one. One scheme dealing with the fuel
poor would be most effective. As evidence from Kirklees, Harrogate and
other councils has shown, it would be best delivered at a local
authority level by the people who know the community well, doing it on
a street-by-street and village-by-village basis. The Select Committee
has put forward all sorts of ideas, such as using infrared, to work out
which homes are the most energy inefficient. There are ways of doing
that.</div><a name="10011434000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
I want the Government to commit to a scheme that would not
significantly involve Government money, although it might involve it
partially. I do not think there is any great difference between the
parties on how we proceed, but under the scheme, the
householder&#151;the local authority, the housing association or
trust, the private landlord or the owner-occupier&#151;would be able
to acquire the money to deliver a complete and comprehensive insulation
programme.</div>
<a name="10011434000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the
question asked by the hon. Member for Northampton, South, our view is
that that programme, which would be for the whole country, would cost
hundreds of billions of pounds. It would be a significant programme;
there is no hiding from that. The actual assessment of how much it
would cost depends on how much one believes it would cost on average
per home. As it happens, in this country local authority housing is the
most energy efficient already and so might require the least spending
per property. Obviously, some homes, such as farmhouses, cottages,
croft houses and homes that are built in a particular way, will be
particularly hard to insulate. Some homes that are not local authority
homes will be relatively easy to insulate, such as the standard more
recently built and better designed
homes.</div><a name="10011434000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various
figures have been discussed by knowledgeable people. The
&#163;6,500-per-dwelling contribution figure is the lowest, which, as
I am sure the hon. Member for Wealden will either confirm or deny, is
the one that the Conservatives still use. The more realistic proposed
and accepted figure is in the order of &#163;10,000 and there are
some who think that the true figure may be above that, and there will
obviously be administrative costs.</div>
<a name="10011434000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">How do we get
the Government to sign up to a scheme that delivers that, given that
hundreds of billions of pounds of public money have to be found for it
to be delivered? As a precursor to the answer, I should say that we are
likely to achieve the objective only if the political will and systems
are in place to deliver such a scheme; it is not instead of the
objective that the Minister already has in legislation, but in addition
to it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div><a name="10011434000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
should commit to a scheme that starts this year and runs over 10 years
by setting up an agency of central Government to drive it. I am not
into creating more duplicating agencies, so that could be the same
agency that drives renewables and ensures that we have a more energy
efficient and less carbon intensive country. To deliver the scheme on
the ground and work out how it should roll out in their areas, local
government is the natural partner in England and the devolved
Governments are the natural partners in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="10011434000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way to raise the money is for the Government to act as underwriter and
have two specific obligations. The first would be to pay for those who
are so poor that they would never be able to afford to make their homes
more energy efficient themselves; that would be an amalgamation of the
current schemes. There is a consensus that there is a group of people
who will never be able to afford to do it themselves. The second
obligation would be to underwrite the borrowing of money in a way that
releases some funds up front to start the programme, which get paid
back by the users as an addition to their bills over a maximum of 10
years.</div><a name="10011434000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
energy bill will be topped up by the repayment, which will increase as
the bill reduces, so the user will never have a relatively higher bill.
We cannot predict fuel costs over 10 years&#151;that is the
variable&#151;but bills would continue to reduce because the savings
from the insulation scheme would be significant. The money would be
paid back and the householder would enter into an
agreement.</div><a name="10011434000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two groups that, in our book, should be obliged to fund the rest of
the scheme. First, the utility companies should be obliged to produce
the money for the loans once the system is up and running. Secondly,
local authorities should be allowed to loan the money and collect it.
They are the other group that could make the loan to the householder.
Those are the two most secure sources of raising the significant amount
of money involved. The Government act as underwriter. Introducing the
scheme would not be an additional burden on the public exchequer; it
would set out a programme that says that over 10 years, in each local
authority in England and in each part of the UK, a programme will
encompass
everybody.</div><a name="10011434000165"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div>
<a name="10011434000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we
cannot make people insulate their homes and, as a liberal, I would
accept that if somebody wants to sit in a cold home, they must have the
right to do that. In the same way, if somebody insists on sitting in
the middle of a place that is set for development as a motorway, they
have the right to do so until compulsory purchase takes that right
away. One must allow people to opt out.</div>
<a name="10011434000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scheme by
definition would start slowly in all local authorities; I expect the
graph would be a parabola. The skills sector must be built to be able
to do the work. At the beginning, there must be a comprehensive survey
of the home, to list what is required to insulate it properly. Then
people can choose when to implement different parts of that scheme.
They may not be able to afford it at the beginning; they may be able to
afford some in the first year, some in two or three years, but others
may take longer to implement. One thing that must be secured is that
the obligation should pass at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>moment of sale if the property is sold. Otherwise, people will be taking
on an obligation when they have left the property and have no further
interest in it.</div>
<a name="10011434000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that only such an ambitious, bold and comprehensive scheme will deliver
the huge transformation needed by the housing stock in this country.
The gains are for everybody: for the world, by reducing the damage to
our climate through emissions; for our country, by reducing consumption
and demand on energy supplies; and for every householder, by
significantly reducing
bills.</div><a name="10011434000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000202"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I admire the hon. Gentleman&#146;s vision but I
despair at his accounting. He talks about &#163;10,000 per home.
There are 23 million homes in this country, of which roughly 17 million
are owner-occupied. Even if householders borrow the money, as most will
have to, it would place a massive burden on the Chancellor of the
Exchequer for 10 years, at the start of which period we would be coming
out of recession. Secondly, if the Liberal Democrats are genuinely
promising this, it has to go on their list of promises. How will they
explain this massive amount of expenditure to the
electorate?</div><a name="10011434000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000203"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman, either wittingly or
unwittingly, has misunderstood the point that I was making. I repeat it
clearly. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> He is being advised by
the hon. Member for Wealden. He will need to ask his hon. Friend
similar questions, because his Front-Bench team has talked about a
scheme to give people &#163;6,500.</div>
<a name="10011434000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer is
that the money does not all come from the Exchequer. The Exchequer acts
to underwrite the system as it begins; then the utility
companies&#151;and/or local government, if it wishes to do
so&#151;would act as the source of the borrowing that then gets paid
back later to the utility companies or local government. The money
would not come out of the public fund; I am very clear about that. The
Government would act as the underwriters, the backer and support. The
Government would get the scheme going but then the scheme would bring
in its own money because people would start paying back.</div>
<a name="10011434000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
definition, if one starts slowly, as one must, to get the scheme going,
the initial investment is relatively small. The payback is within a
year, as people begin to repay the loans.</div>
<a name="10011434000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000204"></a>Mr.
Binley</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="10011434000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000205"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I will be happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman
if he still does not understand, but I hope he accepts that there would
not be the burden of that huge bill on the public purse. That would be
unsustainable. He knows that, I know that and we would not
argue.</div><a name="10011434000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000206"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that I am of
independent mind and question my own party just as much as his. At the
end of the day, most of this money will be borrowed and most of it will
come out of the product of the nation. That is the point that is being
missed by the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10011434000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000207"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Of course, most of it will be borrowed by the
consumer, who will repay it over a 10-year period, or a shorter period
if they wish. If the property is sold, it will have to be recovered on
sale, but that can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>be reflected in the sale price. It can also be done by way of a charge
on the property, so that it is only payable at the time when the
property is disposed
of.</div><a name="10011434000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000208"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I understand
that.</div><a name="10011434000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000209"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman understands how that system
works. The crucial issue is how we get the scheme up and running. To
encourage both the utilities and local government to get the scheme on
the road, the Government need to underwrite the finances that they have
proposed. He will be aware that my hon. Friend the Member for
Twickenham (Dr. Cable) for Twickenham has said that there should be a
national investment bank to deal with green initiatives. We believe
that there should be an increase in local banking to do the same sort
of borrowing to enable the capacity for that underwriting. That could
happen nationally or locally. However, I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point that this is not something for which we can
expect this or a future Chancellor to write a cheque, because the money
is not in the public
coffers.</div><a name="10011434000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011434000210"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman has suggested that the borrowing should be repaid by shaving
savings off bills over a 10-year period following the introduction of
energy efficiency measures. Is he confident that a margin of around
&#163;800 to &#163;900 a year on bills exists in order to effect
the repayment without increasing them? That would have an adverse
consequence, certainly as far as fuel poverty is concerned, on those
people whose homes have been provided with energy efficiency
measures.</div><a name="10011434000072"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000211"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman has asked a perfectly valid
question. Of course, the system will only incentivise people if they
believe that their total bill will not increase in the repayment
period. The hon. Gentleman will have seen the figures from the Select
Committee and others estimating the reduction in consumers&#146;
bills. They show significant savings of 50 per cent. on gas bills,
which would give the leeway that would allow for the repayment. I
understand his point, and that is exactly why I want the Government to
tell us what they mean by the Great British Refurb. Do they really have
a 10-year plan or not? We believe that external evidence and the
experience of other countries&#151;the hon. Gentleman is an expert in
that field&#151;show that if we allow a 10-year pay-back period, we
can ensure people do not paying more by virtue of the
top-up.</div><a name="10011434000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make two other points that I am sure the hon. Gentleman will
understand. The likely gain in reduction of fuel bills is incremental,
so the bill will reduce over the 10 years of a scheme that starts
early, which means that someone would be likely to repay more as the
period progresses. We think that it is important to have a pay-back at
the date of the sale of a property so that the obligation is with the
property. Having talked to estate agents and others, my understanding
is that a property that has complete energy efficiency will be a much
more sellable product. People would be willing to pay a little extra
for such a property in the knowledge that it is an energy efficient
home. It would not be a disincentive to sale and purchase; people know
that they would get a much better property. Moreover, if people want to
pay by charge on the property, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>happens with the right-to-buy legislation and local authorities, that
could be redeemed either at 10 years, or earlier if they sell earlier.
That is a secure way that people often feel they can afford. That
flexibility has to be given to people, local authorities and other
social
landlords.</div><a name="10011434000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only area in which the issue is difficult and in which there would have
to be some compulsion is the private rented sector, where the incentive
to reduce the bill is on the tenant, not the landlord. We need
legislation to require the landlord to comply. Indeed, existing
legislation passed by this Government and supported by us requires
local authorities to enforce healthy homes, but it is not being
effectively delivered at the moment. Perhaps that is because of the
pressure on local authorities&#146; trading standards departments and
the like, but we need a system covering the private rented sector to
prevent fiddling. For example, when it came to the next letting once
the legislation was in force, we could say that it would be illegal to
have a letting by a private landlord, unless they had signed up to the
scheme. I would support that as it would be the best and most secure
way of delivering this measure in the private
sector.</div><a name="10011434000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nation needs a 10-year programme for making every home in Britain a
warm home if we are to ensure that we reduce UK emissions by about a
third, cut bills and reduce our energy consumption in the domestic
sector by about 50 per cent. That must be done in a way that will not
add to public expenditure more than marginally, and there must be a
safety net for those people who will never be able to afford to do it
to their own homes, and need to be supported by the public purse. Above
all, the Government, which so far have introduced piecemeal schemes,
need to be bold and adopt a wholesale scheme.</div>
<a name="10011434000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
a proposal, and I know that the Conservative party has made another one
that we will discuss later in Committee. However, the Government do not
yet have a proposal on the table. In his reply, I would like the
Minister to make it absolutely clear&#151;as I am sure he
will&#151;what the Secretary of State means by a 10-year programme.
Where is it and when will we see its details? What commitment is there
to make every home a warm home? Is it, as I fear, still a plan that is
limited in ambition to a minority of homes in Britain and not to every
home?</div>
<a name="10011434000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I end with
the example of places such as Kirklees and Harrogate and elsewhere.
Where such schemes have been tried, those that deliver village by
village, street by street, community by community are seen to be the
most effective. The incentive for local authorities to do it for their
community provides a wonderful opportunity for communities to see
something in which they have a collective interest. I hope the Minister
will say that the Government are now willing to be bold. If he does, it
will redound to their credit and will be something that they can
rightfully put in their shop window at the next election. If they are
still tempering the issue with a partial scheme, they will be at a
great disadvantage at the next general election. I hope that the
Minister realises that and changes or firms up policy between now and
then.</div>
<a name="10011434000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011434000212"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): We have all listened carefully to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution. I am not sure that it was his
finest hour&#151;it may not have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>been an hour, but it seemed like one. He had a rather absolutist
position that became less absolute as it moved forward. It gave a sense
of policy being developed on the hoof in response to each
intervention.</div>
<a name="10011434000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in
which the amendment is phrased is pretty absolute&#151;if one can be
pretty
absolute:</div><a name="10011434000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
scheme under this section must make provision...to make every home
a warm home&#148;,</div>
<a name="10011434000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">and there are no
exclusions to that. We will return to this debate next week with the
new clauses&#151;there might be a sense of groundhog day as we go
through this issue again, but we will have a further opportunity to
look at it. However, the amendment as phrased is not the right way to
address the matter.</div>
<a name="10011434000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman said that the measure would not be compulsory, but there is
also a clear obligation for every home to be included. How to handle
that could become quite complicated. In a constituency such as mine,
there are a mass of 400 or 500-year-old timber-framed huts, cottages
and farmhouses. To make an obligation for every one of those to be
brought up to a SAP rating of 81 would be challenging and cannot be
done on the &#163;10,000 that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Going
further north to the constituency of his hon. Friend the Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough in Yorkshire, there are some pretty large
stately homes. Would the Earl of Harewood be locked up in prison for
failing to meet the obligations imposed on him? If one goes even
further north to Angus, there are all those large, baronial piles
scattered across the landscape. It will be extraordinarily difficult to
bring them up to this level without an enormous amount of money being
spent. Are those properties to be excluded from the way in which the
amendment is phrased or will they have to be included?</div>
<a name="10011434000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not
just about people who may have the money, but who choose to live in
large, draughty homes. It will also be an issue for elderly people on
low incomes. Someone will go into their homes and tell them,
&#147;I&#146;m sorry, but you haven&#146;t got cavity walls that
we can insulate, so we&#146;re going to have to strip all the plaster
off your walls to make you home energy-efficient. You&#146;re going
to have to move out for a few months, and we&#146;re going to have to
go through every single room, rip off all the decoration and the
plaster and make a complete mess.&#148; Somebody in their 80s may
simply say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, but I don&#146;t want
that,&#148; and they could be in breach of the law. It is not clear
who would be in breach in such circumstances. Would it be the poor,
hapless Minister, who will be carted off to the clink with the Earl of
Harewood, or will it be householder? The amendment is badly
drafted.</div>

Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): The hon. Gentleman is talking
about old homes and large homes, but there is another problem. In
recent years, all our constituencies have seen a growth in park homes,
particularly for people who are retiring. These homes will be almost
impossible to bring up to this energy rating. Under the proposals, they
would have to be vacated or have heaven knows what done to
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000214"></a>Charles

wider issues about park homes, which the House should address at some
point. They would be impossible to bring up to this rating.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="10011434000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
intentions behind the amendment are understandable and positive, it has
been badly drafted, which makes it quite difficult to accept. It is not
clear who would be responsible. An obligation would be introduced, but
it is not clear whether it is the Secretary of State or the householder
who would fail if houses were not brought up to standard after 10
years. The amendment is inadequate, and there will be better
opportunities to move in the right direction when we come to some of
the new clauses in the next few
days.</div>
<a name="10011434000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000215"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> As has just been said, the amendment would require
the Government to introduce a scheme that led to every home having a
SAP rating of 81 within the next 10 years. However, I was heartened
that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey made it clear
that the amendment does not mean that, as there is a helpful concession
that anybody could opt out of the scheme, so nobody would be made to
take part. Only a small number of properties might therefore be
modernised under the amendment in the next 10 years. If that
were the case, the hon. Gentleman would be as disappointed as me that
he had not achieved his ambition. The amendment is therefore wrongly
drawn, and there is certainly a lot of detail missing. For now, the
hon. Gentleman probably simply welcomes the opportunity to have a
debate, and we will debate more focused provisions next week when, as
the hon. Member for Wealden says, we will come to the many new clauses
and everybody else&#146;s bright ideas on the subject. I look forward
to each of them.</div>
<a name="10011434000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
amendment, using SAP ratings alone as a standard and requiring all
households to be upgraded to SAP 81 within 10 years of the Bill being
enacted ignores the diversity of the English housing stock. Figures
from 2007 show that about one third of all properties in England have a
SAP rating of between 39 and 54. Many of those properties
are therefore hard to treat&#151;the point made by the hon. Member
for Wealden. We must recognise that some of these properties will be
extremely challenging if we take the measure set out in the amendment.
The hon. Member for Angus is right that some properties are not
conventional and simply could not reach SAP 81. I am sure that we would
not want to prevent people from living in them because they could not
reach the standard that the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey thought was right for them.</div>
<a name="10011434000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard
in many interventions, there is a lack of clarity about how much the
amendment would cost and how works will be funded. The most telling
intervention was from my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test.
The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey does not know
whether the savings on people&#146;s energy bills will be sufficient
to repay the giant loans that he mentioned, although he hopes that they
will be. In that respect, the pay-as-you-save pilots that we launched
last December are significant, because we will find out what the best
model is, how much it is likely to cost and how long the money will
take to repay. I suspect that we will find that if the scheme is to
work on the scale of our ambitions, the Government and Parliament will
not be able to run away from the necessary commitment from public
funds. We will need not simply to guarantee or underwrite the
transactions but provide cash to make the schemes add up for some
people.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="10011434000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another reason why the amendment is not helpful. The hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey rightly said that some people in this
country would not wish to take on a loan even if we gave them all the
assurances in the world that it would not cost them more than the
savings on their bills, because they are too poor or risk-averse to
credit. He accepts that we would have to find the cash from public
funds and pay for them. However, there are a lot of people in this
country for whom it makes sense to go out and do work on their
homes&#151;not simply because it will help us save the planet from
dangerous climate change but because it will save them money on
bills&#151;but who are not doing so. We cannot say in this Act of
Parliament that we will let them off the obligation to do it for
themselves.</div>
<a name="10011434000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the start
of our campaign to improve radically the energy efficiency of all homes
in this country, as we all want to do, we must do more to persuade
those people who can afford it to go out and do that work today. A new
advertising campaign started this week. I do not know whether anyone
here watched &#147;Emmerdale&#148; on Monday, when our new
&#147;Act on CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#148; advert aired, featuring dad
insulating the loft. It is one of our efforts to persuade people that
they should be thinking seriously about doing such work themselves,
because it is in their own
interest.</div><a name="10011434000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000216"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> What does that add to the Government&#146;s
advertising bill just before the election? What sum are we up to, given
the addition of this new
campaign?</div><a name="10011434000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000217"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I will look up the figures for the hon. Gentleman.
They have been published, and I have answered parliamentary questions
about the cost of the advertising campaign. It is one in a series. I am
sure that most people remember the advert before Christmas about
climate change, in which a parent tells his child a scary story. It led
to many complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority. The new ad
is one in that series, for which the spending has public
approval.</div><a name="10011434000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to the issue of cost, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
(Mr. Heath) had a similar ambition during the last Session
in his private Member&#146;s Bill on fuel poverty, and a similar idea
about focusing the country on improving the energy efficiency of
properties to a SAP rating of 81. I met him to talk about his
ideas, as I share his ambition, and he said that he would be
willing to discuss an energy rating matching level C, or a SAP rating
of about 70 instead of 81, if that would help me.</div>
<a name="10011434000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and I discussed, and fell out about, the likely cost of
hitting either of those targets. We agreed that it would cost tens of
billions of pounds. His number was smaller than mine, which was based
on the advice of my officials, but the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey has been more up-front than either of us, saying that it
will cost more than &#163;100 billion. It is helpful to
see that we have moved on from arguments about the cost to a
recognition of how serious the issue is. I am pleased that that is now
off the table. The number is
big.</div><a name="10011434000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no argument that if we are to fight fuel poverty and meet our
challenging climate change targets, there must be a step change in the
overall energy efficiency of our existing housing stock. Every
political party says 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>so, the independent committee on climate change says so and most of the
public can see the sense of the argument. The Government recognise
that, and we have introduced extensive programmes to address the issue.
I know that Opposition Committee members will groan as I run through
them all, but I remind the Committee that since 2002 the obligation on
energy companies has delivered more than 6 million homes with energy
efficiency works, such as insulation and so
on.</div><a name="10011434000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000218"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Some works, but not necessarily the comprehensive
work necessary to insulate a home
fully.</div><a name="10011434000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000219"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I accept that entirely. In addition to those
measures, I wanted to mention the contribution of Warm Front, which the
hon. Gentleman mentioned and praised. That has contributed another 2
million properties and probably delivers more works than an energy
suppliers&#146; obligation.</div>
<a name="10011434000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
under Warm Front it would be possible&#151;in the maximum grant, if
the figures stack up&#151;to insulate the loft and cavity walls, and
have draft proofing and a modern, efficient central heating system. The
maximum grant today, off mains gas grid, is &#163;6,000. The average
improvement in SAP rated properties benefiting from Warm Front will
bring them up to SAP 57, which is nowhere near SAP 81. That is for
&#163;6,000&#151;or &#163;3,500 if they are on the mains gas grid
and can use gas central heating. Clearly, there is a mountain to climb
to find the money to get to the level that the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey is talking about.</div>
<a name="10011434000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
the energy suppliers&#146; obligation and Warm Front. There has also
been a huge programme, with &#163;33 billion of spending, on the
decent homes programme for councils and registered social landlords to
improve the quality of their properties. A lot of their
&#147;decency&#148; is to have decent kitchens and bathrooms in
their properties&#151;not central heating and not energy efficiency
measures. However, some of them have improved the energy efficiency of
properties, although nowhere near the level of SAP 81.</div>
<a name="10011434000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
committed to extending the carbon emissions reduction target
scheme&#151;the energy suppliers&#146; obligation&#151;to the end
of 2012, and expect a significant contribution to the target, set by
the Prime Minister in 2008, of another 6 million properties receiving
insulation works by 2011. We have also set our ambition to insulate
every loft and every cavity where it is possible, and where the
occupier accepts it, by 2015. The achievement of those targets will be
helped by the CERT extension to 2012 and will make a significant
contribution to our carbon budgets, as well as our fuel poverty
alleviation strategy.</div>
<a name="10011434000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the community energy saving programme, which we
launched last September. That also runs to 2012. So many MPs urged us
to use the approach of going street by street through an estate, in a
focused and strategic way, to improve energy efficiency that we have
launched CESP to do precisely that. That will run to 2012. CERT, with
the extension, will run to 2012. Hopefully, Warm Front will run for
that kind of period. That brings us the opportunity, in 2012 as the
hon. Gentleman urged, to bring together all those different programmes
and design one overarching strategy that will focus on making the step
change and the improvements to people&#146;s homes in the way that he
desires.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div><a name="10011434000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
stress that even with one programme we must recognise both the
diversity of the properties that we will treat and the diversity of the
arrangements at the local level that will probably be required to make
it work. The CESP programme might reveal that in some parts of the
country a really willing, enthusiastic committed energy supplier will
be a great lead for a local partnership that involves the local
authority and the local community groups. In another area, a
&#147;Kirklees&#148; of the country, we might find that it is
absolutely the local authority that should take the lead. I entirely
agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should be open-minded about
having more than one delivery vehicle at the local level, but there
needs to be that central drive and direction for it to work.</div>
<a name="10011434000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman urged us to use the way of paying that the Conservatives also
propose, though they suggest &#163;6,500 for every property. The
pay-as-you-save scheme pilot that began last year will be an integral
part of designing this whole programme from 2012. I cannot say today
that I think it will be the energy companies that find the money for
the scheme; I cannot even say today that it will be repaid through
people&#146;s energy bills. That is a debate that we will have later,
on one of the other clauses. I am trialling both of those methods, and
many others as well, through those pay-as-you-save pilots. I want to
see the results of those pilots to know which is the most reliable way,
or the most reliable ways, to do that in the
future.</div>
<a name="10011434000167"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="10011434000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
although the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has asked
whether I will set out my programme for the future today, I cannot do
that. The programme will be in a document called the household energy
management strategy. I would have liked to have been able to brandish
that to Committee members today, but it will come out in a couple of
weeks&#146; time&#151;ish.</div>
<a name="10011434000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">People know
what Ministers are like. They avoid giving a date and say
&#147;shortly&#148;, but that document really is close to
publication. I have been intimately involved in the discussions about
its content and I have read the draft contents. The document does exist
and hon. Members will see it
shortly.</div><a name="10011434000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000220"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Will the Minister accept that that is very
disappointing? We have before us a Bill that proposes significant
changes to how we deal with fuel poverty, and then we discover that the
Government strategy will come out the week after we finish considering
the Bill in Committee. Can he give us an assurance that we will not
consider the Bill on Report until we have seen that
report?</div><a name="10011434000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000221"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Given that I am disappointed that I am not
brandishing the document today, I shall not disagree with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point. I am not a manager of business, so I
cannot say when consideration on Report will happen. I can say that the
document will be out shortly, and I hope that that will be within the
time scale that he requires of
me.</div><a name="10011434000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the points, put to me by the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey, about giving more detail of the scale of the
Government&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>ambition, I still can say that by 2015 I expect every cavity wall and
every loft in the country that can take it to be insulated to an
acceptable level, provided that householders and occupiers will allow
us to do the works. We are expecting that, by 2020, 7 million of the
hardest-to-treat properties will have received a whole-house approach
to the insulation and energy efficiency measures under our strategy. We
expect every property in the country to have had that kind of
whole-house approach by 2030. Furthermore, I expect there to be a smart
meter in every single property in this country by
2020.</div><a name="10011434000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not short of ambition or detail in the sense of what my programme
will be, but some of the things that we all need in front of us before
we legislate on these important issues, including the payment
mechanism, require the results of work that is taking place at present
but has not yet finished. That is an important point for me to draw to
everyone&#146;s
attention.</div><a name="10011434000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment pre-empts our considerations about longer-term household
energy efficiency policy and the delivery arrangements, so I hope that,
after what has been an informative and useful debate, the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011434000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000222"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It has been a useful exercise already, in that it
has flushed out the Minister a bit. I shall return in a second to the
central point, which is about trying to discover what the strategy is.
At least, however, we have discovered today that it is a strategy for
20 years, not 10. That is very disappointing; it is not only
on the Opposition Benches that the Minister&#146;s and the
Government&#146;s level of ambition is not regarded as
sufficient.</div><a name="10011434000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
recommendation 14 of its report entitled &#147;Energy efficiency and
fuel poverty&#148;, published last year, the Select Committee on
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, talking about smart
meters&#151;the Minister will know what I am going to
say&#151;stated
that</div><a name="10011434000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
believe that the 2020 target is unambitious. The Government must decide
urgently on the roll-out model for the programme so that the industry
can move ahead as fast as possible. Customers also need to be given
clear information on the costs and benefits of smart meters, including
advice on how they can use them to monitor and adjust their own energy
usage and
costs.&#148;</div><a name="10011434000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
example always cited is that Italy delivered the programme in, I think,
three years. There are arguments that although that is true, it was
easier to do that, partly because many more of the meters there are
outside people&#146;s homes than inside them. However, I think that
the general view of the Committee was that for smart meters, for
example, a five-year programme should be completely sufficient for
delivery.</div><a name="10011434000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberal
Democrat Members believe that it would be possible&#151;indeed, this
should be the Government&#146;s ambition&#151;to have a national
programme that is delivered in 10 years. We may not always be able to
deliver everything that we wish to deliver, but a 10-year delivery
programme for warm homes in Britain is a hugely different proposition
from a 20-year programme. If we are talking about dealing with the
climate crisis, of which the Minister is certainly aware, as well as
trying to ensure that we improve our energy security, a 10-year
programme would be a far more effective and appropriate ambition.
During his exchange with me, the Secretary of State said that there
would be a 10-year programme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>for all homes. In the document that we are told is coming&#151;today
we were told that it is coming soon&#151;that is likely to be a
20-year programme rather than a 10-year programme, although, of course,
we cannot confirm that until we have seen the document.</div>
<a name="10011434000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
pick up now on the point made by the hon. Member for Wealden; I did not
intervene when the Minister was speaking, but the hon. Gentleman
rightly did. The Minister has seen a draft and we know that the
document is in his Department. Furthermore, in his Department&#146;s
response to the Select Committee in October it
said:</div><a name="10011434000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;DECC
is also considering how future arrangements for delivering energy
efficiency measures to households could continue to support the fuel
poor alongside other households as we develop the Government&#146;s
proposals for the heat and energy saving &#147;Great British
Refurb&#148; post 2012.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011434000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the end of that
section from the Department&#146;s response, it
says:</div><a name="10011434000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are presently considering, in great detail, the post-2012 delivery
options in the HES Strategy, making sure that we develop options that
mitigate the impacts on the fuel
poor.&#148;</div><a name="10011434000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
share the view that it would be nonsense for the House of Commons and
Parliament to consider the Energy Bill, fuel poverty and the insulation
of homes before we know what the programme is. Therefore, can the
Minister say to the Secretary of State that I tabled the amendment
partly to discover where this document has got to and when we would see
it?</div>
<a name="10011434000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has been helpful&#151;I am not criticising him, so far&#151;but we
need to see the document. I agree with the hon. Member for Wealden that
it must be produced. Let us be honest about this. Normally, the
convention is that we allow two weekends between consideration in
Committee and on Report. Consideration in Committee is due to finish at
the end of next week, meaning that we could consider the Bill on Report
in early February, before half-term. Will the Minister go away and say
to the Secretary of State that the great press release, the great press
conference and the great announcement must all happen this month, so
that we can know what we are talking
about?</div><a name="10011434000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now want to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Wealden. I
say to him gently that I suppose that he could interpret the amendment
in the way that he said he had interpreted it. However, if he reads it
again carefully, I think that he will see that it does not have the
flaw that he specifically highlighted. It was drafted so that the
Government would have to:</div>
<a name="10011434000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make provision
for a national programme to make every home a warm
home&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011434000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
definition, when the Government come forward with the detail of the
programme, they must accept, first, that some people will not want this
work to happen and must have the right to say no; that was the point
that I made to the hon. Member for Northampton, South. The Government
would then have to deal with the categories of homes that are more
difficult to deal with. The hon. Member for Angus made the obvious
point about park homes and there are other categories of homes, such as
prefabricated homes, that may be more difficult to deal with. The
obligation is for a programme&#151;not for an obligatory system that
turns every home into a warm home whether or not the 80-year-old owner
or the aristocratic owner of the home wants that to happen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div><a name="10011434000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
issue about the cost of the programme, and it was raised several times
in different ways. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that I am
not trying to hide the national cost of the scheme if we were to do
this work for every home. That is why the Conservative scheme is
flawed, modest and inadequate. We will be able to test that next week.
The best evidence I have received is that an average cost of
&#163;6,500 across the UK is an underestimate, although some
properties might be able to have full insulation for that sum. The
Select Committee has done some work in this area and between us we need
to work on the best estimate.</div>
<a name="10011434000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
there are two preconditions for a scheme. First, I perfectly accept the
need to pilot the best way to have the repayment. We have a proposal
that it be put on the bill, provided that it does not add to the
bill&#151;gross&#151;over the period. Secondly, we need to have a
survey in advance of the work that is to be done. I have not heard from
the Minister about that, but I hope that it will be in his
Department&#146;s document that the precondition for doing this work
properly is that a survey should be carried out on every home so that
the occupier can know exactly what they need to have done.</div>
<a name="10011434000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The failure
of the current system is that there has been a bit of cavity wall
insulation here, a bit of loft insulation there, a bit of boiler
replacement over there and possibly some double glazing somewhere else.
The Minister and I know that unless people are offered the opportunity
of a whole programme, there will not be as successful an outcome. Of
course there would be improvement, but people should know the score.
The industry is up for it&#151;I have talked to all the different
trade bodies in the industry, which represent glaziers, roofers and
electricians, and they are willing to work together. It would be
fantastic work for
them.</div><a name="10011434000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000223"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Wonderful
work.</div><a name="10011434000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000224"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> It would be wonderful work, and would provide many
of the jobs that the Government want, as well as many apprenticeships
and training opportunities. We believe that it should be done locally
because local authorities will be much more likely to ensure that local
firms, young people and apprentices are engaged, and everyone will see
themselves as having an investment in the
process.</div>
<a name="10011434000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000225"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I just want to give the hon. Gentleman the
reassurance that he sought when he began making that point. Although he
has moved on, I am going to be very naughty and deal with both
things.</div><a name="10011434000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was at the annual conference of the National Insulation Association
just before Christmas. The hon. Gentleman is right about the enthusiasm
about the jobs that will be made available. He wants to be assured
about a whole-house approach and the fact that people&#146;s
properties will be assessed for the measures that are needed. That is
now the approach under CESP, and I suspect that it will be the
forerunner of what happens post-2012.</div>
<a name="10011434000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
hon. Gentleman that the estates that are being chosen for the
whole-house approach&#151;house by house and street by
street&#151;are some of the poorest in the country. We hope that the
fuel-poor will be at the forefront of what happens. The hon. Gentleman
is right about the enthusiasm for the scheme. Centrica&#151;British 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>Gas&#151;announced its first 10 agreements with local authorities to
do works under CESP as soon as we launched the
scheme.</div><a name="10011434000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000226"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am glad that there is agreement. We have all
been picking up the same indications from the industry. Of course it is
in its interest; it is such a fantastic opportunity. There may be less
new house building because of the recession, and if we can turn
difficulty into an opportunity to improve existing housing stock, that
will be all to the
good.</div><a name="10011434000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have three remaining points to make. I had understood from the then
Housing Minister, the right hon. Member for Derby, South, that she
accepted that the standard that we should work to was the best
standard: SAP 81. Of course I understand that there are some homes,
such as park homes, for which that may not be possible, but otherwise
that should be the standard. I would be grateful if the Minister told
the Committee whether that is still the Government&#146;s aspiration
or whether he has downgraded
it.</div><a name="10011434000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
support of what the Government have been doing, the Minister prayed in
aid the decent homes programme. I supported that programme; I am, in
England, the Member of Parliament with the largest proportion of
council tenants among my constituents, so the impact on my constituency
has been huge&#151;although there has been a heavy obligation on the
local authority to deliver. However, the Select Committee confirms that
the decent homes programme was not at all intended to deal with
insulation; it was to improve kitchens, bathrooms and things like that.
The Committee was critical about that.</div>
<a name="10011434000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether the Minister has any figures, but I am not aware of a
substantial number of local authority or social housing
landlords&#151;housing associations or housing trusts&#151;that
have included insulation measures as part of the decent homes
programme. I should be grateful if the Minister told me, now or in the
near future, whether a comprehensive list can be supplied of the
landlords that have delivered such measures, and the details of what
they have
delivered.</div><a name="10011434000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011434000227"></a><b class="B">Derek
Twigg</b> (Halton) (Lab): We all want to get to the same end,
but it is a question of the means. Will the hon. Gentleman be clear on
two points? If as many people as he would like took up his suggested
loans scheme, how would we ensure that those loans were repaid, and
what would be the cost of compliance?</div>
<a name="10011434000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">A related
point is about private landlords. Would there be a cost to the
tenants&#151;and therefore to the Exchequer, via housing
benefit&#151;because of compliance for private landlords? What would
that cost
be?</div><a name="10011434000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000228"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The answer&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The
answer to both questions, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate
and Knaresborough said under his breath, is that it would add to the
cost of people&#146;s electricity bills. Their bills will go down
because with better insulation they will use less fuel, and over a
10-year period, as the bills go down, the cost of repaying the loan
will be added on incrementally. We have suggested a 10-year period
because that seems manageable within people&#146;s sight
lines&#151;it could, of course, run for longer.</div>
<a name="10011434000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially,
the obligation has to move with the person who takes it on; it cannot
be passed on if the property changes from one tenant or homeowner to
another. That is where the additional cost comes. Private-sector 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>tenants would benefit from the reduction, as the landlord would be able
to share among the tenants the cost as the bill went down, and tenants
who paid the bill in the normal way would continue to do so, with the
bill reducing. However, the sanction is needed because a private-sector
landlord does not have the automatic advantage that we would have if we
were owner-occupiers, or that a local authority would have if it was
letting to
tenants.</div><a name="10011434000168"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000229"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I do not understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last
point. A private-sector landlord would not benefit from the reducing
bill. He might benefit from the improvement to the property, but surely
he would pass the cost of that on to the tenant through increased rent.
The hon. Member for Halton was making the point that if the person
concerned was on housing benefit, that could impact on the Treasury as
well.</div><a name="10011434000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000230"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I did understand that point, and I am saying that
the cost would not come by virtue of increased rent, which could call
for an increase in housing benefit and therefore an increase in the
Exchequer subsidy. It would come on the bill of the tenant, whose bills
would be lower because the property was better insulated, topped up
with the cost shared. However, there has to be an obligation on the
landlord to do that, because they do not necessarily have the same
incentive as an
owner-occupier.</div><a name="10011434000139"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000231"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Under those circumstances it would be necessary
to transfer the saving from the tenant&#146;s account to the
landlord&#146;s account, to effect the difference that the landlord
would enter into as a result of taking out the property improvement
loan. There would therefore be a landlord capture of tenant&#146;s
savings on bills. Although that might be technically possible, some
people might find it a bit
difficult.</div><a name="10011434000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000232"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that that context is the most
organisationally difficult, and it is exactly the sort of thing that
needs to be consulted on and checked. The private-sector landlord would
not benefit immediately, but he would benefit indirectly because the
better-insulated property would be more saleable or lettable. We have
to ensure, therefore, that an indirect state subsidy is not required as
a result of adding the cost to the rent instead of the bill. The
obligation on the landlord therefore comes elsewhere, through
legislation and other measures. I agree, however, that the greatest
technical difficulty is with that
sector.</div><a name="10011434000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will be interested to see whether the Government paper makes this
clear, but the Minister seems to have accepted that from 2012 it is
imperative that we have one national system, rather than the different,
partial schemes that we have had. It might be a different national
system in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and that would be a
matter for those countries.</div>
<a name="10011434000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has rightly said that the most recent scheme, which has been piloted in
certain areas, appears to be the best because it is the most
comprehensive. I am happy to seek leave to withdraw the amendment at
the end of this debate, because I wanted to use it to
flush  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>out the Minister&#146;s position. It would help if he said that the
Government had come to a view that from 2012, having done the piloting
and testing, we would have one scheme in England, rather than the
current plethora of schemes. If he could say that, I would happily
proceed quickly to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011434000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000233"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am happy to speak again to answer those three
questions. The first was really a fishing exercise about whether the
draft will say that the Government will aim to hit a target of SAP 81
in each property that will be improved. The document certainly will not
say that, for the reason I gave in my earlier response to the hon.
Gentleman. We must respect the diversity of the housing stock in
England and provide appropriate solutions, tailored to the needs of the
individual property. We will not, therefore, be going down the route of
specifying one particular outcome for every property. I take his point,
however, about the importance of people living in comfort, their bills
being as small as possible and their carbon emissions being as low as
possible. We aim for all that.</div>
<a name="10011434000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
other standards already exist. We aim for every new property built from
2016 onwards to be carbon neutral. There is already a code for
sustainable homes, which sets very good standards that are way above
building regulations. The best builders already aim to meet the best
standards. Certainly when public money is put into building properties,
we require people to aim for the better standards. The hon. Gentleman
can therefore be reassured that we will be ambitious, although we will
not necessarily be tied to the particular solution in the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10011434000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">On decent
homes, some registered social landlords will be disappointed that the
hon. Gentleman is not aware that they have very high standards and that
they aim for good levels of energy efficiency when they carry out
decent-homes works. Some of the best registered social landlords have
certainly included insulation works in their programmes. When I am
given figures to give publicly as a Minister, I am always told that 1
million properties have been subject to insulation measures and have
had their energy efficiency improved through decent-homes standards.
That is a considerable body of work, although a lot of the &#163;33
billion spent on the programme is for the other measures that I
mentioned, to ensure decent standards in people&#146;s
homes&#151;in their bathrooms, kitchens and so on.</div>
<a name="10011434000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
thing that the hon. Gentleman asked was whether I could definitely say
that there would be one national system from 2012. What is for sure is
that our single strategy will provide the necessary coherence, central
direction and leadership. However, I want to correct him on one thing,
because he put words into my mouth when he suggested that I had said
that CESP delivery is the best. I did not say that. He and others urge
the Government to adopt a whole-house approach and to move
systematically&#151;house by house, street by street&#151;to get
the best value for money from the programme. I said that that is what
CESP does and that it is a good model, which we might want to adopt
post-2012. That is different from saying that CESP is the
best.</div><a name="10011434000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
CERT, the energy supply companies are doing excellent work. As the
Minister who sponsors Warm Front, I think that that is an excellent
programme, so I am certainly not saying that CESP is best.
However, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>agree that we want a coherent programme that is entirely focused on the
step change that we all agree is needed. The opportunity to bring
together the learning from the different projects and to set the end of
CERT, CESP and perhaps Warm Front for a particular time, may allow us
to bring those projects together to get the coherence that the hon.
Gentleman and I want.</div>
<a name="10011434000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000234"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and
Knaresborough and I would draw from this debate the conclusion that it
is still possible for our Government to have a programme with the
ambition and intention that every home should be a warm home within 10
years. I concede that the response to what he said is that such a
programme would realistically have to start in 2012, not 2010, given
where we are and the need to dovetail programmes.</div>
<a name="10011434000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
also give us time to complete the pilots, to learn the lessons from
them and to complete any other technical work, while allowing
appropriate Select Committees and others to look at the work. I am
entirely happy to accept that it may be better to set the
programme&#146;s start date for two years from now, after the end of
the current programmes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="10011434000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000235"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> In case there is any doubt, given what the hon.
Gentleman has just said, I should say that works will go on until 2012.
Between 2008 and 2011, work will still happen on 6 million properties.
In the pre-Budget report, Warm Front got more money for its budget.
That will still go on, day by day, month by month and year by year,
until we get to the start date.</div>
<a name="10011434000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011434000236"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Of course; I did not mean to imply that such work
would not go on. We continue with the current scheme. In 2012, however,
we should start a 10-year programme, and that is possible. We have
heard what the Minister said, and we will inevitably come back to it.
He has heard the requests to outline the Government&#146;s programme
in full before Report, but on the basis that we have, to a degree,
flushed out where the Government stand, I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.</div>
