Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Good morning, Mr.
Amess. It is a lovely morning and I think that we can make progress
today. However, as ever, it is important that we at least question some
of the small
print.</div><a name="06103190000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I see the
word &#147;directions&#148; in a Bill, instinctively I smell a
rat&#151;if that is not an inappropriate thing to say&#151;and at
least want to question Ministers about why they use that word. In the
spirit of making progress, I shall indulge the Committee with a brief
anecdote: as a Minister, I remember having to make final decisions on
whether schools should shut and saying to my private secretary,
&#147;Stalin died in about 1952. Some 40 years have now
passed&#148;&#151;at that time&#151;&#147;and here I am, a
Conservative Under-Secretary, being required by fiat to strike out with
a pen the existence of a school&#148;, albeit after a lot of
consultation.</div> <a name="06103190000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was merely the preliminary to a substantive point, which is that
Ministers and their officers and officials, as they know, need to act
in accordance with the principles of judicial review and in a
reasonable manner at all times. However, I am not saying that the
Secretary of State or his officials should have no powers to issue
directions in certain cases and, to be fair, the rationale for what is
envisaged is set out in the explanatory notes.</div>
<a name="06103190000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">In effect, the clause provides
for the power to strike out a work-related activity if it is thought to
be inappropriate for a person&#146;s circumstances. However, I
suspect that by the time that happened, relations between the personal
adviser and the claimant or customer would have deteriorated badly, if
the claimant had not been prepared to listen or were acting in
ill-faith&#151;a matter that we explored earlier&#151;and went
wild, as it were, or refused to do what was suggested. It is
appropriate that Ministers take a moment or two to explain to the
Committee the circumstances in which they envisage such a situation
arising.</div> <a name="06103190000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Under-Secretary explain the relationship between that and an action
plan? The purpose of the iterative process of interview is to establish
capacity for work and the employment allowance. If unable to work, the
person would attend a health assessment for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 296</div>work-related activity and an action plan would be drawn up. It would be
useful if she could share with the Committee Ministers&#146; thinking
on how divergences might arise, be monitored and then acted on under
the terms of the
clause.</div><a name="06103190000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
other administrative points to raisewith the Under-Secretary.
First, I take it that the requirements would not apply to persons
receiving the support allowance. I think that that is clear in the text
because it is tied to clause 12, which I do not think applies to the
support allowance, but it would be useful if she could clarify that. My
second point is on the relationship with the payment of benefit. In
effect, any direction under the clause would be saying,
&#147;Whatever the claimant is doing is not appropriate and does not
count&#148;. In normal circumstances, we cannot order people to stop
what they are doing, but clearly the implied threat is the withdrawal
of benefit. I am not clear on whether that would kick in
retrospectively or only from the date of the notice.</div>
<a name="06103190000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, in the spirit of my
opening remarks, it is fairly clear that if that set of circumstances
were to arise, relations already would have broken down. A formal
notice of a decision by an officer on behalf of the Secretary of State
would be a severe sanction in itself. It is quite important that if
that then jolts people back to a sensible path forward, there is
provision for advancing in a more constructive way. I presume that it
would be possible at that point to rewrite the action plan or for the
individual claimant to be able to make alternative proposals. I hope
that, in normal circumstances, those will be considered in good faith
and acted upon as soon as
possible.</div><a name="06103190000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we have no absolute opposition to the principle of the
provision; it may be necessary. It will, I suspect, be confined to a
small number of cases, but it is important that any action taken under
the clause is taken fairly. It should be properly documented and
accompanied by the necessary input from the personal adviser into
revising the action plan and involving the claimant in what they should
be doing, as opposed to what is deemed to be inappropriate. However,
the claimant should be able to make representations if they have not
already done so and should be treated fairly throughout the process. I
suspect that this can be done through regulations. Clearly it needs to
be and we look forward to the Under-Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06103190000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06103190000308"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): It is good to be in Committee again, Mr.
Amess. In the spirit of the remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry
(Mr. Boswell), I hope that we can make some progress today.
I certainly will be working to achieve that. I am sad to say that once
again, while the weather in London may be clement, the weather in the
highlands is rather inclement, as it has been over the weekend. I am
not sure whether that has much bearing on our proceedings, but I
thought that it was worth starting with that
observation.</div><a name="06103190000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
be brief. The clause gives Ministers the power to direct that certain
activity does not count as work-related activity. Presumably such a
direction would have to be issued retrospectively. In other words,
someone would be carrying out a certain activity and the personal
adviser would, for whatever reason, decide that it was not work
related.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 297</div><a name="06103190000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000309"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is right in his
interpretation, although we must wait for the Under-Secretary&#146;s
confirmation. One would hope that there was something of an iterative
process in which the personal adviser rang up and said, &#147;Are you
sure that that is the right thing for you to be doing?&#148; There
would then be something of a dialogue and this directive procedure
would be used very much as the last
resort.</div><a name="06103190000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000310"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> That is the burden of the point that I was
coming to. Clearly, the process of engagement that is set out in this
Bill involves work-focused interviews, action plans being drawn up and
a great deal of conversation and engagement with the claimant. The
circumstances in which a direction would have to be issued to an
individual&#151;presumably such directions would be issued only in
individual cases rather than generically, stating that a certain class
of activity would not count as work-related activity&#151;suggest
that the previous steps in the process, for whatever reason, had not
worked. There had been a breakdown in communication, a misunderstanding
or the personal adviser or the contracted-out organisation would simply
have chosen to issue such a direction. It would be helpful if the
Under-Secretary could set out in a wee bit more detail the
circumstances in which she foresees this power being
used.</div><a name="06103190000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
welcome clarification on what rightsthe claimant has in
response to such a direction. Presumably if someone has engaged in
something that they consider to be work-related activity, made it clear
to the officials that they regard it as work-related activity and are
then told that the Secretary of State does not consider it to be
work-related activity, they will have to do something else. In passing,
I note that it seems that the powers here in relation to directions are
quite different from the directions under the jobseeker&#146;s
allowance. Under the jobseeker&#146;s allowance, directions can be
made that the claimant must do something specific, whereas this
direction is only to say that they must not do something specific, or
if they do, it is not to count as work-related activity. I should be
grateful if the Under-Secretary could clarify
that.</div><a name="06103190000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is thus
the question about a claimant&#146;s right of appeal or how they can
challenge such a decision. Presumably if a claimant has carried on in
good faith in the belief that such an activity is work-related, there
must be a process by which they can engage in a discussion about the
reasoning behind a decision notice being issued and the consequences of
it. I look forward to the Under-Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06103190000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06103190000311"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I have three or four brief points
to raise with the Under-Secretary, which relate to the mandatory nature
of work-related activity. The notes on the Bill state that when
mandatory work-related activity is introduced, it will apply to most
claimants in the work-related activity group. I want reassurance that
we are not returning to the days of the workhouse when people were
instructed to undertake certain types of work-related activity. I would
be concerned about the state of mind of people in that position,
especially those in vulnerable groups who have mental health challenges
but who are not in the long-term support group.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 298</div><a name="06103190000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second concern is that the
requirements placed on claimants will be further developed in the light
of the pathways to work experience. Without the final report on that
programme, which I think will be published next year, how confident can
we be that the interim results will deliver the right types of new
requirements that will be suitable for people in the work-related
group?</div><a name="06103190000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, I seek
clarification on clause 14(3), which seems to allow the Secretary of
State to vary or revoke retrospectively a determination of what is a
work-related activity. I am always slightly wary of retrospective
directions or determinations and I hope that the Under-Secretary will
be able to reassure me in that respect or perhaps give an example of
why the clause is in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06103190000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000312"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> My hon. Friend has healthy instincts about the
arbitrary exercise of powers by Ministers. Does he also agree that
officers or officials acting on behalf of the Secretary of State also
need to be very competent in making those judgments and to seek the
advice of others, including medical specialists, before jumping to
conclusions?</div><a name="06103190000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000313"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> My hon. Friend makes the point very well indeed
that if a retrospective decision is made and it concerns a
health-related matter, the experience and skill of the person making
that judgment, which may be outsourced to a third party, must be
considered very
closely.</div><a name="06103190000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
query relates to the last line of the notes, which states that it is
envisaged that the proposal would be used only in very limited
circumstances where a given activity was wholly inappropriate to the
claimant. Could the Under-Secretary give an example from the existing
pathways to work pilots of what those very limited circumstances may
be, and what she would consider to be wholly inappropriate for the
claimant?</div><a name="06103190000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000314"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> I am pleased to be here
again on a Tuesday morning under your chairmanship, Mr.
Amess.</div> <a name="06103190000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can reassure
hon. Members on all the points that they have raised in the debate. I
was fascinated to hear that when the hon. Member for Daventry was a
Minister, he immediately thought of Stalin; socialists tend not to
think of Stalin.</div>
<a name="06103190000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000315"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> We could have a very interesting discussion
outside the Committee on the psychology of whether people really found
Stalin warm, caring and generally supportive. For the purposes of this
argument, I need to put on the record that being a Stalinist was not in
my view a term of approbation and certainly not for any Conservative
Minister of the Crown and, I dare say, not for any Labour Minister of
the Crown either, which is the point of my
remark.</div><a name="06103190000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06103190000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000316"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am so glad I raised that point, so that we
heard that explanation. It was a fascinating image and it sits at odds
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s image, both in and outside this
Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 299</div><a name="06103190000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I can give hon. Members
comfort on the points that they have raised because the clause permits
personal advisers to rule that certain kinds of activity do not count
as work-related activity in circumstances that will be set out in the
regulations, when they are published. Those regulations will be subject
to a separate vote in the House.</div>
<a name="06103190000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I give the hon. Member for
Windsor (Adam Afriyie) definite reassurance that we are not inventing
either the workhouse mentality or the ethic of the workhouse? We cannot
and will not direct a claimant to do a specific type of work-related
activity. It is about getting the right support in place for the
individual and, while I am sure Victorians may have thought they were
providing the right support for those who went to the workhouse, I am
sure many of us would agree that that was not the
case.</div><a name="06103190000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also reassure
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny
Alexander) that it is not a generic instruction. It is not about taking
out of the equation a whole range of activities. It is very
specifically related to an individual. I will come to some of the
circumstances in order to give an indication of the sort of examples we
think the clause may need to cope with.</div>
<a name="06103190000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not anticipate that the
provision will be widely used or widely needed. As my hon. Friend the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform and I have indicated
throughout the Committee proceedings, and has been accepted by the
Committee, we are seeking to take a collaborative and consensual
approach with the claimant. We have proved through our pathways
approach that by working with people we get more out of them in terms
of the support they are willing not just to accept but to relate to. I
think that that is very important.</div>
<a name="06103190000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members for Windsor
and for Daventry raised the issue of retrospection. I can confirm that
subsection (3) of the clause enables a direction to be revoked or
changed so that an activity that was designated as not being a
work-related activity can subsequently be so designated. It is a
positive subsection that is designed to recognise that work-related
activity will be part of the action plan that will be agreed between
the personal adviser and the customer. It may well be, however, that
the customer does something outside the action plan that meets the
requirement. It would be unfair to not give the credit for that
work-related activity. The direction is
separate.</div><a name="06103190000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under what
circumstances can the power be used? As I have said, we anticipate that
the use of directions in practice will be rare. To give an example, a
graduate in English may decide that a work-related requirement could be
a basic English skills course. That would be totally inappropriate for
someone with that level of qualification. It would perhaps have more to
do with attempting to tick a box than to embrace work-related activity.
Somebody may decide that they want to become a personal trainer. Again,
given the individual circumstances, their qualifications and so on,
that may not be appropriate and may be a recreational view of
work-related activity. This is what I mean when I say that it is very
specific to the individual and it is not about excluding all sorts of
activity. I also confirm to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 300</div>the hon. Member for Daventry that clause 14 will not apply to the
support group and I am pleased to put that on the
record.</div><a name="06103190000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many interim
reports have been published on the pathways evaluation. We are learning
all the time about pathways, but the predominant message we get from
them is that if we work with individuals as individuals, we get a
greater response rate, which means getting more people into work. The
pathways approach may require some tweaking as the evaluations are
produced, but it is recognised as an individual-focused support for
people who are long-term unemployed or who may never have been employed
at all.</div>
<a name="06103190000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06103190000317"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): We all agree that
there are circumstances in which the work-related activity programme
needs to be varied, but I do not understand why it cannot be varied
under the regulations in clause 12(1). Will the Under-Secretary provide
specific examples of situations in which work-related activity could
not be varied under clause 12, thus making clause 14
necessary?</div><a name="06103190000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000318"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I hoped that I indicated that clause 14 should
act as a backstop in situations where people are not prepared to engage
in activities that are supportive of their search for employment.
Clause 12 deals with all sorts of other circumstances. Clause 14 will
allow us to deal with specific and, I hope, very rare situations: I
gave the example of someone with an English degree thinking that they
could tick the box by doing a work-related activity that would not be
appropriate for them, although it may be for another
individual.</div> <a name="06103190000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Various
hon. Members asked for reassurance on directions and whether there will
be a right of appeal. I can confirm that any directions made under the
clause will be subject to an independent right of appeal. Furthermore,
if a customer were sanctioned for undertaking an activity that was not
treated as a work-related activity under clause 14, they would have a
separate right of appeal under clause 12.</div>
<a name="06103190000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14 is necessary to
ensure that there is flexibility on the ground to deal with customers
undertaking inappropriate activity. It is not intended to force people
into a specific activity, but rather to retain the right to deem a
particular activity non-work-related, due to the circumstances of the
individual and his or her action plan.</div>

have been outlawed or was determined as a non-work-related

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000320"></a>Mrs.

we have seen some of the final evaluations of the pilot. If I come
across an example during our proceedings that would meet his
requirements, I will advise him of it. I hope that I have indicated the
type of example that we would expect to occur. I reiterate that we do
not anticipate using the clause to a great extent, but it is important
to deal with any situation that may arise, although we hope that it
will not.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 301</div><a name="06103190000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000321"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her
response; its spirit is impeccable. Just as my hon. Friend the Member
for Bury St. Edmunds banished the term &#147;scroungers&#148; from
the Committee, we may thank her for encouraging us to banish the term
&#147;Stalinism&#148;. We will put them in the same
category.</div> <a name="06103190000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two points that I would like to come back to. The first is supportive
of the Under-Secretary and relates to the helpful exchange that she had
with the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. It
is important that officers are qualified to take decisions and offer
advice where appropriate. She did not mention advice but I will take it
as being implicit&#151;I see that she is nodding. However, officers
must not fetter their discretion in any particular case.</div>
<a name="06103190000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Under-Secretary gave the
example of an English graduate. It might be regarded as inappropriate
if such a person decides that they must do an English foundation
course. However, I can imagine a circumstance in which such actions
might be entirely appropriate, such as if, say, the person had suffered
a stroke and needed to recover. That is the kind of flexibility that we
need. We are not arguing about that.
</div><a name="06103190000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">One specific issue
that the Under-Secretary did not cover&#151;I do not want to press
her into making an immediate decision&#151;relates to the interaction
between clauses 12 and 14. Clause 14 is, as it were, dependent on
clause 12. If a person were deemed not to have been carrying out
work-related activity, and then a direction was issued, would that
person&#146;s benefit be impaired for any time before formal
notification? A person may have been acting in good faith. The personal
adviser may even feel that what is being done is harmful to the
interests of the individual and that it ought to stop as soon as
possible. Assuming that there is not some dumb insolence at work, it
seems to me that there is a potential disadvantage in somebody suddenly
getting a note slammed on their desk saying, &#147;What you are doing
is inappropriate, and you have lost your benefit from the
start.&#148; Bad relations with the personal adviser may further
complicate such a case.</div>
<a name="06103190000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reading of clause 12(1) is
that it relates to &#147;continuing to be entitled&#148; to benefit
&#147;to the full amount&#148;, and that before a direction is
issued, it would therefore be impossible to dock that benefit
retrospectively, although that may happen after the event. However, the
Under-Secretary will need to pay attention to that matter before the
regulations are defined.</div>
<a name="06103190000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000322"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I obviously recognise the point made by the hon.
Gentleman. In many respects, he answered his own question by referring
to the development of the regulations, which will be subject to a vote
in Parliament.</div> <a name="06103190000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
thank the hon. Gentleman for his supportive comments. The example that
he used finessed mine. He pointed out circumstances in which it would
be wholly appropriate for an individual to take on a work-related
activity that may not, on paper, appear to be so. However, through the
approach of the personal adviser, such a course of action could be
deemed wholly appropriate.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
15</h4><a name="06103190000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Contracting
out</div><a name="06103190000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000323"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in
clause 15, page 12, line 38, leave
out paragraph (c).</div><a name="06103190000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates directly to the previous debate on the powers
proposed in clause 14. The amendment&#151;a probing amendment
designed to elicit more details about the Government&#146;s
intentions&#151;seeks to delete the provision that allows
contracted-out parties to carry out functions under the clause in
making the sort of directions discussed previously.</div>
<a name="06103190000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of a preamble, let me
say that I welcome the Government&#146;s general approach to
contracting out. There is an enormous amount of evidence, from a
variety of organisations. I have mentioned them before, but I do not
apologise for mentioning them again. There is the SHIRLIE project in my
constituency, right the way through to national providers. I have
visited the Working Links project in the Parkhead ward, Glasgow, a
tremendous neighbourhood scheme not only for people on incapacity
benefit, but for a range of people who find themselves excluded from
the labour market.</div>
<a name="06103190000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s
approach is absolutely right: it makes use of skills and experience in
the private and voluntary sectors to deliver the kind of back-to-work
help that the Bill proposes. I must say, in passing, that it is a shame
that the Government have not gone further. In our previous sitting, we
discussed the fact that although 60 per cent. of pathways areas have
been led by contracted-out parties, 40 per cent. are still led by
Jobcentre Plus. I hope that Ministers may review that split in a few
years&#146; time, once the schemes have been rolled out and have been
seen to work. Such a review could be conducted on the basis not of the
views of Jobcentre Plus staff about their own performance, but of an
objective assessment of the performance of different contracted-out
parties.</div>
<a name="06103190000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06103190000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The area of
controversy in this clause is the degree to which the powers in earlier
clauses, particularly those relating to conditionality, should also be
given to the contracted-out parties, the voluntary and private sector
organisations that carry out this work. Later amendments will draw
particular attention to the powers that relate to sanctioning, so I
will not burden the Committee with them at the moment. The powers in
clause 14 allow the Minister to make directions about what may or may
not be counted as work-related activity. We want to probe the
Government&#146;s intentions on the provision that would allow
contracted-out partners to make those same directions. Contracted-out
organisations could make directions to individuals about what should or
should not count as work-related
activity.</div><a name="06103190000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister clarify the circumstances under which private and voluntary
sector organisations will use that power? What mechanisms of
accountability will be in place to ensure that people can complain or
appeal if necessary against such directions? Will that complaint or
appeal be to the organisation to which that work is contracted out, or
will they have a right of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div>redress to Jobcentre Plus or another Government body? The Bill allows
for powers to be exercised differently in different localities. The
city strategy was mentioned by the Minister in previous debates. Will
the claimants who have been subjected to a direction under clause 14 by
a contracted-out party, which may be different from a similar direction
issued in another area of the country, have the power to appeal? We
have already had a debate on the powers and I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06103190000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000324"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> I am delighted to see you in your place again on
this warm and sunny morning, Mr. Amess. The hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has already alluded to the
weather; we seem to have a running commentary on London&#146;s
weather in this Committee. I am comfortable with that. If he ever
wishes to move away from carrying the burden single-handedly of his
whole party in this Committee, he may apply for the job of BBC
weatherman. I note that on Thursday morning when talking about looking
forward to going home to Inverness he
said:</div><a name="06103190000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I will
be confronting storms, snow, ice and all sorts of other things when I
return to my constituency this evening&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 26 October 2006; c.
233.]</div><a name="06103190000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone who lives in the
northern part of this kingdom and saw the TV coverage over the weekend
will know that that was an understatement.</div>
<a name="06103190000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a bright and happy
morning for another reason. The Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs.
McGuire), has reason to celebrate because she became a grandmother for
the first time over the weekend. She is a very young grandmother to a
baby girl called Orla. I congratulate her on that fantastic
news.</div><a name="06103190000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000325"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I relay a message from the Opposition to say
that those of us who already have the privilege of being grandparents
welcome the Under-Secretary of State to the club? It is one in which
all parties may join with equal delight. The only amazement in my mind
is that she could possibly have qualified for
it.</div><a name="06103190000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000326"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps I might be allowed, on behalf of
the whole Committee, to express our pleasure that the Under-Secretary
of State has become a
grandmother.</div><a name="06103190000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000327"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I did not think that I could be outdone in my
obsequiousness to my hon. Friend. I am sure that young Orla, as she
grows up, will be given a transcript of these proceedings as a
keepsake. I hope that it does not have too much of an impact on her in
later life.</div><a name="06103190000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
deal with the points raised in the probing amendment, but first I thank
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey for his
comments about the Government&#146;s general approach to contracting
out, which we will have an opportunity to discuss in more detail later
in the clause. He is right in saying that it is important that we
harness the creativity, skill and experience in the private and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 304</div>voluntary sectors as we roll out pathways and other labour market
interventions and welfare to work services. It is increasingly
important that we utilise the capacity in the private and voluntary
sectors.</div><a name="06103190000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
probing amendment, we believe that, in the contracting out of such
services, private and voluntary sector organisations should be given
the full range of tools available to help and encourage people into the
right kinds of training and support. Through the experience of
Jobcentre Plus and Jobcentre Plus-led pathways, we know that personal
advisers can strike up a close working relationship with the customers
that they advise.</div><a name="06103190000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we retain the power in clause 15 because the detailed
knowledge of customers&#146; circumstances and support needs and
other inside information that the personal advisers can obtain and
reflect on, puts them in a strong position to make a decision on
whether a particular work-focused activity would be ineffective or
inappropriate for their customer. That applies whether the personal
adviser works within the Jobcentre Plus or private and voluntary sector
pathways.</div> <a name="06103190000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
decision to apply a direction in itself will not lead to sanctions. It
is important to put that on the record and I think that my hon. Friend
the Under-Secretary of State alluded to it earlier. The decision to
apply a direction is completely separate and has separate appeal
rights. Removing the ability of personal advisers employed by
contractors to apply directions would place an administrative burden on
the contractor and Jobcentre Plus requiring further complicated
hand-offs and transfers of information, which would delay decision
making and increase the chances of mistakes. So it is important that we
have that consistent process from end to end.</div>
<a name="06103190000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we will need to
ensure that such directions are applied consistently and fairly and we
will work with providers to ensure that that is indeed the case.
Furthermore, regulations will set out clearly exactly when directions
can be used, but it is in the best interests of claimants that
directions be applied by the organisation that has day-to-day dealings
with them.</div> <a name="06103190000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We note
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments on the right mix of Jobcentre Plus
and private and voluntary sector provision of pathways. That is part of
a continuing conversation on the right mix between public sector-led
and private and voluntary sector-led employment programmes. We do not
have a dogmatic approach and will review the evidence on the most
effective ways in which to support people to enable them to return to
the labour market. Jobcentre Plus-led pathways have been successful. We
anticipate that roll out in the private and voluntary sectors will use
available capacity and that could be even more
successful.</div><a name="06103190000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000328"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Without prejudice to the Minister&#146;s
remarks, or indeed to the views of my colleagues, will he reassure the
Committee that if, for some reason, there were a deficiency in the
private sector provision&#151;I am not talking so much about the
quality of the provision, but actioning the applicants who come
forward&#151;the Government would introduce those programmes
throughout the country, if necessary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div>by additional public provision? For the avoidance of doubt, I am not
canvassing that, but talking about a fall-back power if 100 per cent.
coverage were not
possible.</div><a name="06103190000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000329"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable point.
Jobcentre Plus would also be there as the last resort to manage market
failure, but it would genuinely have to be the last resort, because we
anticipate that a more appropriate first, second and third line of
management would be through stringent contract management, continuous
assessment of management information, penalties that can be built into
the contracts, and terminating contracts and awarding them to others.
The situation that he outlined is a possibility as a final and last
resort, but only if everything else has been
tried.</div><a name="06103190000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I have
reassured the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
and that he will therefore ask leave to withdraw his probing
amendment.</div><a name="06103190000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000333"></a>John
Penrose:</b> There we are; I&#146;ve been spotted.</div>
<a name="06103190000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendment is
clarify the proposal and, most importantly, to emphasise the importance
of the quality of the individuals and organisations that will have
contracts with the Government, and to probe how the Government plan to
contract with those organisations to ensure that there are enough
individuals and organisations of sufficient quality&#151;a proper
supply&#151;with whom to enter into contracts. How the Government
behave in their commissioning process will have an enormous effect,
either constructive or destructive, on the availability of people who
have the necessary skills and qualities to deliver the services we are
discussing.</div> <a name="06103190000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worth while pausing to reflect on how complicated that commissioning
job will be if there are to be enough people of sufficient quality to
deliver the services. For a start, the range of conditions that have to
be catered for is enormous: it varies from people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 306</div>with mental health conditions to those with severe physical disabilities
and everything in between; geographical variations throughout the
country also have to be dealt with. The local employment market in
Weston-super-Mare may be hugely different from that in Glasgow,
Doncaster and elsewhere, so the ability to find suitable work-related
activity for people in each area will also vary
enormously.</div><a name="06103190000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
variety of organisations that have to be contracted with is enormous,
too, which makesit even more difficult. It varies at one end
of the spectrum from large private organisations such asReed
in Partnership and WorkDirections, through comparatively large and
extremely successful third-sector organisations such as the Shaw Trust,
right down to myriad highly successful, very small local organisations
that often focus on a particular niche in a local employment
market.</div><a name="06103190000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000334"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Does my hon. Friend, who, like me has experience
of the private and voluntary sectors, share my anxiety about what would
happen if one of the service providers were to get into difficulty?
There may be hundreds if not thousands of claimants dependent upon that
organisation. My concern is what the Government and the Secretary of
State would do in response to such a failure when the well-being of
thousands of people is at
stake.</div><a name="06103190000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000335"></a>John
Penrose:</b> That is a fair and cogent point. There are powers
elsewhere in the proposal to deal with some of those issues in extremis
if necessary. I am sure that the Minister will respond to the point as
he is nodding at me, which will prevent me from having to ask the same
question.</div><a name="06103190000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The range
and complexity of the supply market is great. That makes clear the
difficulty faced by any commissioning organisation run by the
Government in stitching together a full range of high-quality supply in
all areas of the country to satisfy all the different employment local
markets and to cope with all the different incapacity problems and
conditions which have to be dealt with as part of this
Bill.</div><a name="06103190000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">A year ago this
was proving so difficult that it was extremely problematic. I know the
Minister will tell us that things have improved significantly since
then but I think it is worth while pausing to note some of the comments
made by some of the organisations with which the DWP was contracting. A
number of them came to give evidence to the Select Committee on Work
and Pensions on 18 January and I would like to put on record a couple
of the comments that give a flavour of the scale of the problem between
the Government and the organisations they were contracting with just a
year ago.</div><a name="06103190000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the representative of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary
Organisations, Stephen Budd, said to the Select
Committee:</div><a name="06103190000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
good news is that the procurement process is so bad that even small
changes would be very
effective.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to
say:</div><a name="06103190000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
effective price is not based on full cost recovery. There is excessive
bureaucracy and the contract is almost always one
year.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 307</div><a name="06103190000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those contracts are not
effective so it costs the taxpayer money. They are not efficient in
terms of their outcomes and, if you changed the contracts, you could
get better quality outcomes. They are a nightmare for organisations to
operate and also excessive bureaucracy has a cost back on the Civil
Service.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
<a name="06103190000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="06103190000336"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the most
critical problems in these contracts has been their length? If we have
short contracts, for example, a one-year contract, the management of
the private or voluntary sector organisation have to spend most of
their time and most of their effort trying to re-secure the contract
for subsequent years, which is where all their money is coming from.
Will he join me in urging the Minister to listen to the feedback about
the length of contracts, so that we have more realistic periods of
time?</div><a name="06103190000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000337"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s
characterisation of the problem. However, that has an impact not just
on the contracted organisation, but on the commissioning organisation,
which has to spend an enormous amount of time dealing with the yearly
rollovers as well. It is, therefore, a problem on both sides of the
fence.</div><a name="06103190000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">To illustrate
the last point, Mr Budd went on to reveal some results from a poll of
members of his organisation who were involved in DWP contracts. They
were asked whether contracts were fairly priced and 62 per cent said
no. They were asked whether the contracts involved a fair sharing of
risks between the Government and the contracting organisation and 92
per cent said no. They were asked whether there was excessive
bureaucracy and 93 per cent said yes. To answer my hon. Friend&#146;s
last point, they were asked whether the contracts were long enough and
71 per cent said
no.</div><a name="06103190000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The killer was the
final question about the number of people of sufficient quality for the
Government to contract with. Those organisations were asked whether
they had to close some services in the past two years as a result of
contracting with the DWP. Two thirds said they had to do
that.</div><a name="06103190000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was also
the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion, whose representative,
Dave Simmons, said on the same day to the Select
Committee:</div><a name="06103190000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
was a general, almost institutional, lack of trust between Job Centre
Plus and its providers. This was exemplified in an almost
over-specification of &#145;this is exactly what you must do at this
time&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to
say:</div><a name="06103190000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Job
Centre Plus needs to step back from that command and control mentality
and they need to start thinking about who their supply chain is and not
take them for granted. If a big company treated Job Centre Plus
customers in the same way, there would be all hell to
pay.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">His final
comment was:</div>
<a name="06103190000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I think Job Centre Plus
and other funding bodies have yet to realise the strength of these
organisations and that they should be using them in partnership and not
in a directive
way.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
illustrates the difficulties that have obtained. I know the Minister is
going to give examples of changes that have improved the situation, but
it is instructive to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 308</div>realise that, for the reasons I have given, the commissioning job is
extremely complicated and will require a great deal of care and
attention in order to deliver the universal services, varied for people
across the country, that will be required.</div>
<a name="06103190000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000338"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have been very taken by the examples my hon.
Friend has quoted and the evidence given to his Committee. It would be
helpful if the Minister could say a word or two about the way in which
the procurement function in his Department has been
changed&#151;there is a director of procurement who seems to have
cleaned things up to some extent&#151;but particularly in relation to
contracting with the private sector, which is cardinal for the whole
success of the
policy?</div><a name="06103190000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000339"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for giving me a great lead
into my next points. It is vital to look at how things need to change
and what best practice should be. I hope that the Minister can give us
examples both of what has happened since the period to which those
quotes referred and what he expects to happen in future. We are dealing
with a complicated situation, yet we have a series of commissioning
decisions and activity that, at their worst, seem to be better suited
to a commodity market, where things are primarily decided on price,
rather than on the quality of the service and the variety of the
service being provided. It also seems better suited to a series of
large providers which can cope with the bureaucratic demands that are
being made upon them and are big enough and serious enough to be able
to stand toe to toe and eyeball to eyeball with an organisation of the
scale of the Government in a contracting
negotiation.</div><a name="06103190000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
that is not the sort of organisation that we have&#151;I have just
described some of them. Many are led by inspirational individuals,
employ five or six people and focus on, for example, dealing with the
employment problems of people who are partially sighted in Doncaster.
That set of behaviours has to change if the Government are to achieve
their central aim of developing capacity and the ability of the
organisations that are providing those services to grow and to provide
yet more services in future.</div>
<a name="06103190000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have already
accepted the notion that there is not sufficient capacity out there
atthe moment. They have said that they will have the
equivalent of a mixed economy in that they are expecting to provide
some services in future via contracting and contracted-out
organisations. At least to start off with, a proportion of the services
will be provided by public sector employees in the same way as the
pathways to work pilots have been. That is an acceptance of reality and
makes enormous sense.</div>
<a name="06103190000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government want to
expand the amount of contracting at any point in future, they cannot do
so unless they have taken the necessary steps to improve their
commissioning to build the capacity of those other organisations. That
will mean satisfying some of the proposals contained in a report from
Oxford Economic Forecasting in late 2005 commissioned by the Employment
Related Services Association. It made several recommendations. It said
that, when contracting with people, the DWP should avoid overly short
small contracts and protracted decision making, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 309</div>that it should allow sufficient time for implementation and that it
needs to rebalance the risk between procurers and providers. I would
add that it is probably vital, if we are to grow capacity, that
contracts are priced fairly. We are talking about public sector money
and we have to get value for money. Care needs to be taken that we are
not pricing things at the marginal cost. They need to be at full cost
if we expect any of these organisations to grow
successfully.</div><a name="06103190000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000340"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am enjoying my hon.
Friend&#146;sspeech. The Oxford Economic Forecasting report
commissioned by ERSA and others made one other startling observation
which concerns the public sector procurement process. It gives examples
where a contract is put out to tender and once it has been accepted
contractually the terms are changed. Quite often these are small,
not-for-profit organisations or charities that accept the conditions
from Jobcentre Plus. Because of Jobcentre Plus&#146;s monopoly
position, they have no choice but to accept what is a contractual
variation after they have accepted a bid. Does my hon. Friend agree
that that kind of nonsense must be stamped out in order to protect
small private and voluntary sector
bodies?</div><a name="06103190000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000341"></a>John
Penrose:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That
illustrates the perils of changing contract terms after the contract
has been signed and the problems of dealing with a fragmented supply
base that includes some larger organisations capable of negotiating
with the Government and saying, &#147;That is not an acceptable way
to behave and we will not put up with it&#148;. They can do that
because they are large enough to cope with a negotiation of equals, but
a small organisation led by one or two charismatic and highly able
people in a particular local market is not able to do so and ultimately
we will be driving them out of business. We will all be the poorer for
it.</div><a name="06103190000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000342"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In support of my hon. Friend&#146;s point, does
he not agree that it is not in the interests of the public department
involved, whether the Department for Work and Pensions, Jobcentre Plus
or any other, to set up an equivocal contracting process? In fact,
those bidding for a position for contracts, including the larger
sophisticated organisations, will have to factor a very substantial
premium into their bidding to cover the contractual
risk.</div><a name="06103190000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000343"></a>John
Penrose:</b> That is another good example of the problems that
the industry was facing just a year ago.</div>
<a name="06103190000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister is
going to tell us that a number of things have been done already or are
about to be, such as longer contracts, more careful sharing of risks
and rewards between the Department and the people being contracted
with, a specification not of process, but of required outcomes and
stability of contract. Those sorts of things are
essential.</div><a name="06103190000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that steps have been taken to put some of those things in
place. For example, when giving evidence to the Select Committee, the
permanent secretary, Mr. Lee Lewis, said that he felt that
the Department was creating a new cadre of specially trained
commissioners with the specific skills required 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 310</div>to achieve such things. He was good enough to accept that the skills
required for buying or commissioning are not ones that perhaps are
traditionally found in the civil service, that it is a departure
needing a new set of skills and that the Department was having to
develop
that.</div><a name="06103190000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Lewis mentioned also prime contractors, which are potentially an
extremely effective way in which to simplify some of the difficulties
created by the fragmentation of the organisations that have to be
contracted with. A prime contractor can subcontract specific types of
condition that need to be dealt with or entire geographical areas to
other people and smaller organisations in an attempt to get the right
mix and variety of
provision.</div><a name="06103190000114"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000344"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the problems
with the contracts issued by the public sector and the DWP is that
inevitably there is a huge focus on price? That is absolutely
scientific and therefore the people issuing the contracts have to pay
attention to that and worry that, if they give a contract to someone
who is not the lowest-priced provider, their decision could be
questioned. On the other hand, in the business world, businesses have
greater flexibility to give contracts to those that might not be the
cheapest, but are the best. Sometimes, public sector contracting
processes do not reflect the flexibility in the business
world.</div><a name="06103190000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000345"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I agree completely with my hon. Friend. That goes
back to the point that I made about the necessity of not behaving as
though this is a commodity market between large consolidated suppliers
providing something on the basis of lowest price. We are talking about
hugely varied organisations providing hugely varied services. Quality
is key and if we do not have the highest possible quality of service,
the results will not
follow.</div><a name="06103190000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prime
contractors will potentially simplify the contracting process
dramatically and allow some of the smaller contractors to live with the
deal done with an enormous Government Department and to develop their
ability to provide those services over time. The danger is that in
moving to prime contractors&#151;simplifying the commissioning
process and having the ability to stitch together a universal set of
varied provision in different parts of the country, taking account of
all the relevant conditions&#151;we will shift from a public sector
local monopoly to a private or a third-sector local monopoly. Can the
Minister reassure us that that will not happen? Will he also please
tell us how the Government plan to ensure that there is sufficient
accountability and tracking of results, so that we do not end up with
monopoly provision and supply in those
areas?</div><a name="06103190000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06103190000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where the
Department for Work and Pensions is operating the mixed economy and
public sector employees and third-sector or private sector
organisations are delivering some of these services, perhaps next door
to each other, it is important to know that the different organisations
will be treated equally. There should be a level playing field for
public sector organisations and private or third-sector 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 311</div>organisation providers. If that is not the case, the contractors cannot
be sure that they will be given a fair crack of the whip relative to
the public sector organisations that will also provide the services. It
will be extremely difficult to persuade them to step up and enter into
these contracts if they feel that they are the least-favoured
organisations and that there is a preferable in-house deal that others
will get. It is vital that we have reassurance from the Minister on
that point.</div><a name="06103190000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
now return to the point about pricing made earlier by my hon. Friends:
how can we be sure that we obtain not just the best-value price,
because we are dealing with public sector money, but that we provide
enough of a price for these organisations, many of which are extremely
small, to grow and to provide effective services across a wider range
of areas, building on their existing geographical base? How can we be
sure that they will get enough money to develop in that way rather than
being asked to set a marginal price or have the terms of their
contracts changed, and therefore have resources sucked into
unproductive work instead?</div>
<a name="06103190000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek clarification and
reassurance from the Minister because if these things are done
properly, there will be many more high-quality organisations to
contract with. The people who are being helped through work-focused
activities do not care whether something is done by a public sector
employee, a private sector employee or a third-sector employee; they
just want to know that the service they get, by whatever route and
whoever delivers it, is of the best possible quality and stands the
best chance of getting them closer to the world of
work.</div>
<a name="06103190000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000346"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I will avoid any meteorological references in
welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Amess. I want to focus on
the meat of amendment No. 243, the purpose of which is to ensure that
contracts for the delivery of assessments and work-focused interviews,
among other things, are awarded only on condition that the contractors,
whomsoever they may be, have relevant knowledge of disabilities and
health conditions that may affect the customer and the general
employment support needs of the client groups. The interests of the
work-related activity group and the support group must be protected and
the amendment goes some way to delivering that
objective.</div><a name="06103190000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without the
safeguard in the guts of the amendment, some contractors delivering key
elements of the Bill might not have as much expertise in disability,
health or employment support as the Committee, Ministers and customers
would wish. The amendment would ensure that potential contractors would
have to demonstrate, at the phase of tendering for the contracts that
are the subject of the clause, an awareness of, and expertise in, the
issues to which we have referred&#151;both employment and health and
disability. The Government would use that knowledge to come to the best
decision as to who should be given the contract. Unless we get that
right, it will not just be bad public policy and bad for the taxpayer
but, worst of all, it will be bad for the customers.</div>
<a name="06103190000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must ensure that the
contractors are of the very highest quality. They will all be coming to
the process wanting to deliver a good service for the Government, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>and not to fail commercially. However, it is not clear to me, after all
the negotiations and discussions that I have had with the private and
voluntary sector, that the contractors are of uniformly high quality.
The amendment would raise the bar.</div>
<a name="06103190000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend gave some of the commercial issues behind the thrust of the
clause a good airing, but can the Minister explain how his officials,
when they award the contracts in the pathways roll-out and beyond, will
ensure that the expertise in health and employment support is there? I
do not think that it is good enough to say that the market will
decide.</div> <a name="06103190000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The market is
a powerful mechanism to ensure that those who are not much use at doing
things fail, and that those who are good at what they do succeed.
However, I would not take a risk with the lives of customers who are
looking for support and help to get back into work. To put it bluntly,
there might be some cowboys out there. The procurement process will
clearly weed out quite a lot of the weaker brethren in the private and
voluntary sector, who are weaker in the sense that they do not have
enough expertise in particular conditions. Obviously, that is what
Ministers will want to achieve, but I do not see anywhere here how to
tackle the problem of procurement, which the amendment tries to
do.</div> <a name="06103190000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard a lot
from my hon. Friend the Memberfor Weston-super-Mare (John
Penrose) about the inadequacies of procurement, and I do not blame the
Ministers full-square for that, because DWP officials and Ministers are
undertaking a learning process. They are to be congratulated on the
proposition that there should be more contracting out to not-for-profit
organisations. It is done now, but we are talking about a huge
expansion in for-profit and not-for-profit organisations delivering
services. We welcome that, but it is not immediately clear that the
safeguards are there, In that spirit of honest probing, can the
Minister say something about how specific expertise is going to be
built into the tendering process, so that we can all have comfort that
the market will not run riot, and that the interests of those most in
need of protection are
safe?</div><a name="06103190000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000347"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> It is a particular pleasure to follow the hon.
Member for Weston-super-Mare, who made an intelligent and thoughtful
contribution to the debate. I wish to add a few points to those that he
made. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley)
made it clear that the amendment would ensure that people who come
forward, wishing to provide services through the contracts that may be
issued by the Department, would have a sufficient level of knowledge
and expertise in the subject that they are being asked to deal with.
However, it is equally the case that the willingness of such people to
come forward to offer themselves to carry out the contracts will
depend, to some extent, on the issues aired in the contribution of the
hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. Those included the structure of the
contracts and their length of time, as well as&#151;I do not think
that this point has been raised and I wonder whether the Minister could
address it, given that we are talking about contracts&#151;the extent
to which he sees contracts focusing specifically on job and other
outcomes related to different stages in the process, and how
organisations dealing with people requiring assistance for a very long
time will get paid for carrying out that work.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 313</div><a name="06103190000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have visited a number of
organisations in the private and voluntary sectors carrying out the
sorts of functions that we are debating and I have observed that those
with a number of funding sources and contacts with a number of
organisations have a great deal more flexibility in carrying out their
functions and therefore, in many cases, get better results than those
subject to a single contact with the DWP, which lays down very specific
and often quite onerous obligations. That limits the freedom of action
for the private and voluntary sectors to contribute.</div>
<a name="06103190000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Minister&#146;s
remarks on an earlier amendment, he rightly made the point that the
Government wish to capture the innovation, imagination and dynamism of
many of the best private and voluntary sector providers. It is
important therefore, in order to encourage the best people to come
forward and deliver the services, that the contracts are structured in
a way that allows that spirit of innovation and imagination to flourish
and does not restrict it through specific obligations in the contracts.
That is an additional point to the one made
earlier.</div><a name="06103190000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
interested also in the points that the hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare made on prime contractors and subcontracting. That is
particularly important because, in many communities, local
organisations are best placed to deliver such services, rather than the
generic national providers who might move into an area. I hope that the
Minister will say something about how those who are best qualified for
the work will be encouraged through the subcontracting process and
about the steps that he will take to ensure that smaller organisations
with the expertise referred to in the amendment will come forward to
take
part.</div><a name="06103190000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000348"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern that, as
well as competition for provision of services to claimants, there will
be competition in the market for suitably qualified staff? Does he
share my concern also that staff might be poached from Jobcentre Plus
to work in the voluntary and private sectors, which could create
additional pressures on the
system?</div><a name="06103190000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000349"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> This debate elicits some remarkable comments
and I think that that counts as one of them. The hon. Gentleman, who
sits on the Conservative Benches, seems very concerned about the
implications of competition. Although an unanticipated intervention, it
is welcome because it was an important point. Of course, it is
important that an individual can work for any organisation and if a
better job turns up, they should be free to apply for it. Indeed, if a
private or voluntary organisation is delivering services more
effectively than Jobcentre Plus, I hope that the best people would go
and work for that organisation, rather than for Jobcentre Plus. I hope
that the contracting methodology would allow the Minister or the
Department to look at Jobcentre Plus-led areas to determine whether it
is doing the job properly and ask whether we wish to use the powers in
the clause to invite private and voluntary sector organisations to come
forward if we think that they might do a better
job.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 314</div><a name="06103190000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000350"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> There is absolutely no question about that;
people should be free to work where they choose. However, let us say
that Jobcentre Plus is offering better terms and conditions than the
voluntary sector, which begins to lose staff to Jobcentre Plus because
of an uneven playing field in the recruitment and terms and conditions
market due to the former&#146;s greater resources. That is my
concern. In the set-up phase of a national roll-out, there would be
concern about staff movement. Will they move so quickly that services
to claimants, about whom we care, are
affected?</div><a name="06103190000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="06103190000351"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention and, with
your indulgence, Mr. Amess, it is a point worth developing.
I have visited a number of private and voluntary sector organisations
and also Jobcentre Plus, and it is not my experience that Jobcentre
Plus offers more advantageous terms and conditions for personal
advisers than, for example, private and voluntary sector providers. In
fact, I think that is not usually the case. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] I
think that the hon. Member for Daventry says from a sedentary position
that &#163;12,000 a year is the starting salary for a personal
adviser. Perhaps the Minister can confirm if that is
correct.</div>
<a name="06103190000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000352"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I was muttering that and I am glad that the hon.
Gentleman has brought that point to the attention of the Committee.
Does he not agree that it would advance the sum of our deliberations if
we slightly got away from the model in which everything was absolutely
in the public sector or absolutely in the private sector by conceding
that it is perfectly possible within the existing business model for
Jobcentre Plus in its pathways or their derivatives to incorporate
large chunks of private sector expertise and even private sector
activity within its overall framework. Conversely, there may be
occasions where the private contractor needs to buy in to the
specialist services available in the public service&#151;for example,
NHS occupational
therapists.</div><a name="06103190000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000353"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the good point that
the mix may be different in different areas, according to individual
circumstances. That is a very important point and I hope it is one the
Minister will reflect on in his remarks. I suspect, however, that the
hon. Member for Daventry may, in his characteristic fashion, have
expressed a view that the Minister might himself have chosen to
express.</div> <a name="06103190000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will deal with the question of subcontracting as that is
also an important point. It is important to spell out to what extent
multiple organisations might be involved in a particular part of the
country and whether individual claimants might have a degree of choice
about where they go. In employment zones, there has been piloting of
multiple provider areas as well as single provider areas. The intention
behind this amendment is to get the best-trained people to deal with
individuals according to their individual health condition or
impairment. Given the vast range of particular circumstances that we
are talking about, I would welcome more information from the Minister
about the Government&#146;s intentions in view of the fact that
claimants might be able to choose which provider is best able to meet
their requirements.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 315</div><a name="06103190000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06103190000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000354"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Clause 15 is to be welcomed as it provides a
mixed provision of service to claimants who have not been that well
served in the past. The Bill is to be welcomed as it is a fairly bold
one and it certainly shifts the balance of rights and
responsibilities.</div>
<a name="06103190000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 15 authorises the
Secretary of State to outsource, to delegate and to authorise other
third parties to provide services on the Secretary of State&#146;s
behalf, such as work-focused interviews, pathways action plans and also
some decision-making powers. It is a bold clause because it appears
that the Government are effectively&#151;I shall use a strong word
initially&#151;&#147;privatising&#148; the benefits system. That
seems clear. If we do not like the word &#147;privatisation&#148;
or the introduction of a private element to the provision of welfare,
perhaps we could say the Government are introducing a market for
claimants in claiming welfare and getting back to work. This may be
slightly more acceptable, but let us be clear that there is a
privatising element here and that is part of the Government&#146;s
objective.</div> <a name="06103190000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
markets, with privatisation and with competition comes failure and this
is the point that I want to explore. By outsourcing functions the
Government must be willing to accept some failure in the market that
they are enabling. If, for example, a particular private firm gets into
difficulty, it may well be that the firm will fail. Perhaps it is not
providing
services&#151;</div><a name="06103190000140"></a>

the amendment. It seems that we are going on to a clause stand part

<a name="06103190000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason that the issue of
competition is relevant to amendment No. 243 is that if there is a
requirement on third parties to have properly qualified staff in place,
it will impact on their cost base, the type of staff that they employ
and the outsourcing contract. However, I will restrict my points more
specifically to the amendment.</div>
<a name="06103190000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Secretary of State
outsources or contracts out his responsibilities, it must surely be
right for there to be a requirement on the providers of the services to
be appropriately qualified. Using his knowledge and experience of the
pathways to work schemes, will the Minister give a few examples of
where the Government have learned lessons from those schemes about the
qualifications of people employed by voluntary organisations and in the
private sector?</div>
<a name="06103190000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 15 also proposes to
outsource decision making. The Minister said that it would be
difficultor bureaucratically inefficient to keep passing
responsibility for decision making on sanctions back to the Secretary
of State or the Department. Will he explain why he thinks it will be
workable if a third party has decision making on sanctions outsourced
to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>them? Referring to the Green Paper, on 3 July the Public and Commercial
Services Union warned that</div>
<a name="06103190000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the private and voluntary sector
in the provision of public services will mean a step back to a model of
pre-war...provision.&#148;</div>
<a name="06103190000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister share that view? If
not, can he explain why not, based on his experiences of the pathways
to work scheme?</div>
<a name="06103190000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">My support
for the amendment is based on the fact that it is absolutely essential
for the welfare of people with mental or physical health conditions
that the contracts&#151;the requirements placed on third
parties&#151;make it absolutely clear that staff must be properly
qualified and skilled in order to make decisions that will make a
fundamental difference to the lives of
claimants.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000357"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. The Committee is
indebted to you for allowing a clause stand part debate by proxy,
though perhaps the Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household, my hon.
Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell) is less
enamoured.</div> <a name="06103190000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
try to make progress on the amendment. However, if it is your wish,
Mr. Amess, to allow a clause stand part debate, we can
respond to some of the wider points.</div>
<a name="06103190000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall address a couple of
issues that have arisen on the matter of contracts. The hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare enlightened the Committee in his first substantive
contribution to the debate. The experience he gained as a member of the
Select Committee on Work and Pensions shone through, showing his
knowledge of the issues. Obviously, I will not have time to respond to
all his 30 or 40 questions&#151;I have not kept a tally&#151;in the
discussion on the amendment or even in a clause stand part debate.
Suffice it to say that we have heard the comments from Stephen Bubb and
others on contract length. As the hon. Gentleman knows, three-year
contracts will be the norm for the pathways to work schemes.</div>
<a name="06103190000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the capacity of the market,
it may be helpful for the Committee to be aware that we currently have
more than 1,000 providers contracted with the Department for Work and
Pensions; that is the scale of the market. The Committee will be
pleased to hear that between 10 and 20 providers have been bidding in
each of the areas in which we are rolling out private and voluntary
sector-led pathways, which shows dynamism, determination and the
capacity of the market to participate in and support such
work.</div><a name="06103190000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked about choice. It is
important that people have choice in public services, regardless of
their economic background. The question of how further to empower those
who are furthest from the levers of power runs through much of our
public service reform. As far as I am concerned, that is about how we
extend choice into poorer communities and poorer families.</div>
<a name="06103190000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Weston-super-Mare conveyed some disappointment that a number of
contractors lose their contracts. We have had a conversation about
Stalin and comments about Marx, although we have not yet mentioned
Lenin. I am sure that Conservative Members do not need any lessons in
market economy; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 317</div>its nature is such that we have contracts for a set
period. At the end of those contracts, some firms are assessed as not
having lived up to the mark: they have not provided the expected
outcomes, and they have failed to serve the people whom they were
contracted to serve. As a consequence, such firms do not have their
contracts renewed.</div>
<a name="06103190000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000358"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the Minister for his remarks. The point
that I was trying to make did not relate to firms that lose their
contracts because they fail to live up to expectations; we all accept
that that should happen. I was concerned that firms were backing away
from contracts because they found them impossible to deliver, not
because of the outcomes required, but due to the demanding nature of
the bureaucracy and support
costs.</div><a name="06103190000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000359"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is another fair assessment from the hon.
Gentleman, who thus far has joined the Daventry school of probing.
Perhaps, by the end of our deliberations, I will think of the hon.
Member for Weston-super-Mare in the same way as I do the hon. Member
for Daventry. That is meant as a
compliment.</div><a name="06103190000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
evidence of what the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare suggests. We
have learned through the procurement process. The roll-out of pathways
is a black box, as we would term it in the market sense, allowing
flexibility for providers to suggest innovations that are most
appropriate to the customers and the area that they support. I reassure
him that performance information will be reviewed monthly by the
contract manager. The first review must take place within26
weeks of the start of the contract, at which point we will identify any
problems with support for customers as the contracts roll
out.</div> <a name="06103190000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful to make available on the Department for Work and Pensions
website some of the documentation regarding contracting, as long as it
is not commercially confidential. The answers to a lot of the questions
that have been asked are contained in that documentation; it includes
information about the contracts sent to potential private and voluntary
sector providers, specifically on protection for customers and the
approach of those providers.</div>
<a name="06103190000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that I am the only
person with a copy of the documentation, so other members of the
Committee are at a slight disadvantage. Private and voluntary sector
organisations have been sent the documents; they are the basis on which
organisations are applying for
contracts.</div><a name="06103190000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000360"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not wish to interrupt the Minister&#146;s
flow. Will he clarify how widely available the documents will be? He is
reading into the record elements of them, so will it be possible to
have copies placed in the
Library?</div><a name="06103190000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000361"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b><b class="B"> </b>I hope to place the documents on the
internet, and putting them in the Library would be much less ambitious.
That is what I intend to do, on the basis that they are not
commercially confidential.</div>
<a name="06103190000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">An organisation would have to
be accredited, and page 13 of the invitation to tender pack details the
necessary compliance with statutory requirements, including the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and with equality and diversity
requirements, and the need for financial
viability.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000362"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As the Minister has one of the contracts in his
hand, will he tell us the length of its period? That is important for
private and voluntary sector
providers.</div><a name="06103190000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000363"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am sure that the Committee will thank me for not
reading out all the documentation, but the contracts will be for three
years with the opportunity to run for longer. I mentioned that in
response to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, but I am happy to
say it a second time to the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey.</div><a name="06103190000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">On protections
and staff training, the necessary level of support is made clear in the
method statementfor private and voluntary sector
organisations. The documentation clearly sets out that providers must
show evidence of being able to address the specific needs and barriers
of all customers. hat is important to bear in mind when discussing the
ability of people in the support group to volunteer. On human resources
under the pathways initiative, the same documentation makes it clear
that those who wish to bid must state
their</div><a name="06103190000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;existing and
additional staffing
requirements&#148;,</div><a name="06103190000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">including
staff of their partners and sub-contractors. That is important. They
must also attach job titles and descriptions of the qualifications and
experience required for each post. The form also states a requirement
to</div><a name="06103190000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide details of
your training arrangements, both for new and for existing
staff&#148;</div><a name="06103190000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">to deliver
pathways and to</div><a name="06103190000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;describe
your contingency plans for dealing with fluctuating customer numbers
and staff
turnover/absences.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not go through the whole process, but the issues in question are
covered in great detail in the contract, under which 10 to 20
organisations in each area are considering offering
services.</div><a name="06103190000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000364"></a>John
Penrose:</b> On ensuring a level playing field between private
sector, third sector and public sector organisations, are those
requirements also levelled at other organisations&#151;for instance,
if a particular sector of the Department bids? Does such an
organisation have to go through the same bureaucratic hoops to ensure
that it is of sufficient quality, or is that assumed to be a
fact?</div><a name="06103190000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000365"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I was not in this role at the start of the
roll-out of pathways, but there was no private sector comparator in the
challenge function, so no comparison could be made between public
sector-led pathways and an alternative. However, I am certain that
there was a challenge function involving the Department, lobby
organisations, Parliament and Select Committees, as has been the case
throughout the process, to see what more we could get from the public
sector provision of pathways. It would have been in a different format,
because such a contract would not have been signed between the
Department and Jobcentre Plus, but there would have been a challenge
function and an accountability
function.</div><a name="06103190000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
my remarks have been tightly linked to the amendment. Many other
comments have been on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 319</div>much wider points. There are protections and challenges in the
documentation on contracts. As long as there is no issue of commercial
confidentiality, I would be happy to place the documentation in the
Library and on the Department&#146;s
website.</div><a name="06103190000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
243 would put in regulation something that will happen through
contracts and contract management. To include the need to adjust the
training qualifications, skills and approach of every private or
voluntary sector provider would be bureaucratic and inflexible, and it
would not enable us to adjust to changing customer needs and the
evolution of the welfare market. I hope that I can reassure the hon.
Gentleman that as a result of our contracting and procurement process,
the amendment is unnecessary. The documentation that I will provide
will ensure that his legitimate and well-intentioned concerns will be
met. It is unnecessary to be as prescriptive as he suggests by placing
such a requirement in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06103190000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000366"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Before I allow my hon. Friend the Member for
Weston-super-Mare to wind up for the Conservatives, I must say that
although I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s undertakings, I am
puzzled by his reference to what he has published on the
website.The safeguards that he discusses do not need to be in
the Bill if they are publicly available. I have had the advantage of
conferring with the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey, the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, who suggested to
me a few minutes ago that they were not aware that there had been
publications on the website, and my team would confirm such a
view.</div> <a name="06103190000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Opposition
parties might have been saved a bit of time if answers had been given
to our questions about the safeguards. The Minister assures us that
they are in the documentation from which he was reading and which he
will place in the Library. In the interests of transparency, it is
important to know when the documentation was made publicly available,
and, in particular, whether what has been on the web and will be placed
in the Library is a full, unexpurgated
version.</div><a name="06103190000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say that
for one particular reason. I do not doubt the Minister&#146;s bona
fides, but the Liberal Democrats and I have been the victims of a lack
of transparency from another part of his Department in respect of Post
Office card accounts. It took considerable effort, involving references
to &#147;Erskine May&#148;, Back Benchers piling in and much else,
to get the original POCA contract, dated 2003, placed in the Library.
That was the subject of much controversy, and there were removals and
excisions the first time the documentation was put in the Library. The
Minister has tried to be helpful, but when did the information go on
the web and is it a full and unexpurgated version of the contractual
documentation?</div>
<a name="06103190000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000367"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I do not know whether my accent is causing
difficulties today. It has not changed from last week; if anything it
has become even softer&#151;another couple of days in London does
that to a Glaswegian accent. The hon. Gentleman said that he had the
advantage of conferring with the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats,
which is an unusual phrase for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 320</div>Conservative Front-Bench spokesman to use. I said, as I am sure the
record will show, that I &#147;would&#148; place&#151;not I
&#147;had&#148; placed&#151;the documentation on the DWP website
and, by extension, in the House of Commons Library. As some of it might
be commercially confidential, I will ensure that I give clear guidance
to Committee members at the time of publication as to whether or not it
has been published in full. The caveat is commercial
confidentiality.</div> <a name="06103190000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the hon. Gentleman would accept that that is a reasonable
approach, because the alternative would have been to say,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry. It has all been taken care of. It is all in
the contracts.&#148; I seek to continue the tone that we have had in
this Committee. Therefore, if it is possible, notwithstanding
commercial confidentiality, we will publish all the documentation on
the website, and therefore in the Library, to enable a continuing
conversation on the types of things about which Opposition Members, and
my hon. Friends, have concerns, wish to probe and wish to be reassured.
That is entirely reasonable; it is the proper way to
proceed.</div>
<a name="06103190000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000368"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply, which
contained a series of things that reassured many Conservative Committee
members, particularly the reference that he twice made to three-year
contracts. He also mentioned that there seems to have been adequate
capacity so far in terms of the number of organisations bidding for
each contract. As the expansion of contracting continues&#151;it is
inherent in the notion of rolling out the pathways project with
contracting out&#151;we will have to wait to see whether, as we hope,
there will be sufficient capacity in future. Whatever has been achieved
so far in expanding the capacity of service providers will need to
continue on quite some scale if he is to continue to enjoy 10 or 20
offers for each tender.</div>
<a name="06103190000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was particularly encouraged
by the Minister&#146;s use of the phrase &#147;black box&#148;
when talking about creating and encouraging innovation. If the
Department is no longer specifying the required process and activities,
but the outcomes, which I think is what he was driving at&#151;he is
nodding&#151;I am particularly reassured because it answers many of
the criticisms made in the past year. I was encouraged to hear also
that there will be regular reviews of the performance of each
organisation during the contract
term.</div><a name="06103190000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Probably the
best news and the thing that is most reassuring, which will lead us to
withdraw the amendment, was the Minister&#146;s promise to put copies
of the contract out for public view, within the limits of commercial
confidentiality. That is important because it will allow us to see the
progress made so far in instilling new commissioning skills in his
Department. I hope, pray and expect that that skills growth will
continue and that the contracts will be improved and refined still
further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06103190000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06103190000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000369"></a>John
Penrose:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 262, in
clause 15, page 12, line 44, leave
out paragraph
(b).</div><a name="06103190000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
straightforward probing amendment to ascertain how far the
contracting-out process might go. In the debate on the preceding
amendment, we talked 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 321</div>about a number of different services being provided, but one of the key
and ultimately core decisions that must be taken is the gateway
decision for access to the benefit itself. That is probably one of the
most difficult and ticklish things if the Government do intend to
outsource, although I suspect that it is probably one of the last
things they would get to&#151;they would want to outsource a lot of
other easier things first.</div>
<a name="06103190000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to ascertain how far
the Government intend to go in outsourcing and whether they genuinely
intend to outsource all or part of the gateway decision-making process.
We have discussed the way in which the decision-making process is going
to alter, and people&#146;s benefits might be sanctioned during
work-focused interviews and in other parts of the new arrangements.
However, it is important to understand exactly which bits of the
decision will come to rest where, because at the moment there is
somebody called a decision maker in most Jobcentre Plus offices. Will
their job be smaller and split up? If so, who will do it in the
future?</div><a name="06103190000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 99
of the explanatory notes on clause 15
states:</div><a name="06103190000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(2)...would allow private and voluntary providers to take
responsibility for related decision-making activity regarding sanctions
and safeguards.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would
like some more detail on that. I shall give examples of what might be
meant by that, some of which would cause us concern and some
not.</div> <a name="06103190000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
decision-making authority was outsourced to the same person undertaking
work-focused interviews, that person would be involved with the client
in helping them to get closer to the employment market. He would also
have the power to sanction that client&#146;s benefit. It would be
potentially difficult and dangerous to make that delicate relationship
work for a couple of reasons if the client knows, as he sits in his
work-focused interview, that the person interviewing and supposedly
helping him can ultimately say,&#147;I intend to sanction
your benefit. That is my decision and that is it.&#148; First, we all
hope and expect that the frequency of sanctioning will be very low and
that it will not happen often. The probability is that sanctions will
be discussed only when the relationship between the person running the
work-focused interviews and providing the service and the client has
degraded and probably broken down badly. In that case, we would be
asking that person, in sanctioning a person&#146;s benefit, to be
both judge and jury in a case that they are part of already. I think
that that is dangerous and potentially leaves the way open to both
injustice and appeals against such
decisions.</div><a name="06103190000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
and equally dangerously, that situation would create a problem, because
if the client talks to someone who is supposed to help them get closer
to the world of work, and they know that that person may decide to
sanction their benefit, it will be difficult to create the right
relationship of trust and support, which has been an essential plank of
the pathways pilots, making them so productive and
effectivethus
far.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000370"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a world
of difference between a large Department, which has established
protocols and draws a distinction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div>between a personal adviser and a separate decision maker who could be
independent, and a private contractor, who is not bound by those rules
and practices, and whose functions may reside in the same person
without the necessary transparency? Is that my hon. Friend&#146;s
concern?</div>
<a name="06103190000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000371"></a>John
Penrose:</b> That is precisely my point. We have discussed
examples of small local organisations that provide an excellent
service. Within them, it will be difficult to separate people who may
have decision-making powers from people who may support people as they
get closer to work. The crucial question is whether there will be
single or dual capacity. In the Government&#146;s contracting
decisions, will people be asked to take on sanctioning power and
provide services, or will the sanctioning power always be separate from
the people who provide services?</div>
<a name="06103190000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to pick up on
the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made. The
safeguards for the decision-making, sanctioning power are different
from the skills and supportive ambience that one tries to create when
offering the services that people need as they get closer to work. For
the decision-making power, one needs clarity, transparency, a strong
culture and clear guidelines to ensure that decisions are taken
correctly. The requirements are different for someone attempting to
befriend and support a client who is a long way from work and trying to
get closer.</div> <a name="06103190000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
there be single or dual capacity? Will a large organisation such as
Shaw Trust, Reed in Partnership or WorkDirections, have dual capacity?
Parts of their organisations might be involved in sanctions and
decision making, and other, separate parts might be involved in
delivering contracted services. To what extent will they be contracted
out? Will there be Chinese walls between people providing services and
people making decisions? Is the whole system a step too far? Do the
Government not in fact want to contract out, but keep the ultimate say
about a decision in the public sector? Will the contractors merely
provide recommendations and factual reports to a public sector decision
maker? Those crucial questions must be unpicked and explored in more
detail, so that we and the organisations that might bid for the
contracts understand what they are asked to sign up to.
</div><a name="06103190000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000372"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I shall follow the remarks of the hon. Member
for Weston-super-Mare. The provision is about the potential contracting
out of benefit sanctions to third parties who will also be given the
power to carry out the welfare-to-work activities and work-focused
interviews. This troubles me greatly, and clarification would be
useful. It troubles me particularly, because talking to voluntary and
private sector providers I have found that they are able to achieve
better results than the public sector because of the strength of
relationship that they form with their clients, customers or
claimants&#151;however we may wish to describe them. In at least some
cases, those organisations have a fear&#151;they are being genuine
about that&#151;that if the claimant believes, knows and understands
that that organisation not only will go about building that
relationship positively, carrying out the work and support to enable
that person to get into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div>the labour market and, one hopes, back to work, but potentially has the
power directly to sanction that person&#146;s benefits, that could
act as an disincentive to the claimant to engage in a positive way with
the organisation, as claimants currently do. That may be the brief of
some of the providers.</div>
<a name="06103190000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The separation of benefit award
and benefit sanctioning power from what I shall call in shorthand the
welfare-to-work help has been of great assistance to those private and
voluntary organisations to which I have spoken in delivering services.
In some cases, those organisations believe that that separation is one
of the reasons why their success rates are significantly better than
some in the public sector. It is important that the Minister spells out
a clear rationale, first of all, for including that power in the Bill.
Page 32 of the supporting material, the draft regulations,
states:</div><a name="06103190000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
intention behind such a change would be to allow the organisations that
come into face to face contact with claimants to conduct the end to end
process.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see what
is being argued for there from an administrative efficiency point of
view, and perhaps that is what the Minister has in mind. However, I
would strongly counsel against taking any steps that may help to
improve administrative efficiency if there is any risk whatever that
they will reduce the outcomes and success rates and reduce the ability
of claimants to interact with private and voluntary sector contractors
in a way that leads to a greater chance of success. I hope that the
Minister can clarify
that.</div><a name="06103190000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister can clarify something else. The draft regulations
state:</div><a name="06103190000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
no current plans to contract out sanctions decision making when ESA is
first implemented.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the concerns that I have expressed, the Minister will not be too
surprised to know that I welcome that. However, it is important that he
spells out in some detail the sorts of circumstances in which he might
consider using the power that is contained in the part of the Bill to
which the amendment relates. The supporting material also makes the
point:</div><a name="06103190000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
will...work with providers to establish whether they would be
interested in undertaking this function and whether it would deliver an
improvement in efficient
service.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
made it clear in a previous debate that there would be considerable
contact with a large number of voluntary and private sector providers
in the course of the contracting process. Will he tell the Committee
whether any of those organisations have expressed any interest in being
given the power of benefit sanction as well as the positive side of the
equation? Has anyone expressed an interest in that? Has there been any
interest whatever? On the basis of my experience, I would be surprised
if many had expressed an interest in carrying out that function. I hope
that the Minister will take that as a guide when considering whether he
will ever want to implement those powers at all. I look forward to his
response on what I consider to be a sensitive part of the
clause.</div>
<a name="06103190000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000373"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Briefly, it is always healthy when a Committee
holds its hand up to a Minister and asks, &#147;Are you quite sure
that you need these powers? Have you thought them through, and are they
fair?&#148; The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 324</div>concerns that have already been expressed showthe emphasis that
Conservative members of the Committee are putting on being fair to the
claimant, or meeting the rules of natural justice. I hasten to say
that, as a lay person, I do not use that term in a precise context, but
the Minister will know what we are all driving at.</div>
<a name="06103190000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also some related
issues about what I might term the status of public officials, or those
who are standing in for public officials, and I shall say a little
about that in my brief remarks. Playing my usual trick of anticipating
the Minister&#146;s remarks, I think that he will always want to say
to the Committee that this is all really exactly the same, and that we
are not going to allow it to be anything other than seamless. If for
administrative reasons, which are at least arguable, the process is
smoother, work-related interviews are not disputed and interview number
one by Department for Work and Pensions officials is not different in
status from later interviews because that forms an ensemble, I
understand the practical case for doing that. I even understand why
contractors might want to have control of the whole process and not to
feel subverted by officials coming in and taking part of it away from
them. On the other hand, it must be done fairly and in accordance with
the broad approach to natural justice. In the real world and for the
practical reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare
adduced, there are concerns about that, not least because the
Department has a tradition, it has scope, and access to legal advice
and enough officials to adopt different and independent functions to
discharge the duties, none of which may be available by custom and
practice, or in reality, to smaller or less experienced private
contractors.</div><a name="06103190000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
concern about the practical role is the extent to which the Department,
if it is inclined to devolve the functions, will be able to instruct
and advise decision makers who, under the clause, will still make
decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State on the protocol of those
decisions to ensure that there is commonality, for example, between the
pathways to work area of Jobcentre Plus and the various private
contractors doing their own part in the contracted sector. It is
important that, at least in practice, they operate in the same
way.</div><a name="06103190000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am equally
concerned about the redress available to individuals. I
understand&#151;perhaps the Minister will confirm this&#151;that
the normal nature of social security decisions is that an individual
who is aggrieved by a decision made by a public official has the
opportunity to have that decision reviewed and, if there is a
substantive issue, it may be referred to the social security tribunal.
The Minister is nodding at my understanding of that. Equally, if there
is an issue of law or the conduct of public officials that goes beyond
the individual case&#151;an issue concerning not whether it was right
or wrong in the particular case, but whether the Minister or his
officials behaved in a way that no reasonable Minister would
contemplate, such as if an edict were rebarbative or
objectionable&#151;there is ultimately a separate sanction of
judicial review. I would like the Minister to tell the Committee that
that battery of redress for individuals dealing with Jobcentre Plus or
the public sector will be available in the case of private decision
making. I hope that he can reassure us on that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 325</div><a name="06103190000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">A converse, complex and somewhat
ambiguous situation might arise if the Minister when setting his
contracts or his officials in the procurement department took on a
private contractor and that private contractor in discharging a
quasi-public function erred and incurred damages against the
Department. Who would pick up those damages? Would the Minister, as the
contractor, indemnify an individual who took on a contract as a party
to that contract, or would the Government say, &#147;You got it wrong
and it is your fault, so you pay for it.&#148;? If so, would that
constitute a
deterrent?</div><a name="06103190000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
theoretical point, but it shows that we are moving into deep waters:
people with particular expertise in alcoholism, mental health or
whatever who are pleased to be called in by the Department to help with
a particular function might suddenly find themselves in the middle of a
legal maelstrom about whether they conducted sanctioning functions on
behalf of the Department. That worries all of us and I shall not go on
about it.</div><a name="06103190000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
must consider two specific points inherent in the position of a
decision maker in the public sector if that is to be devolved outside.
One is in relation to the new disability duty which will bite on public
authorities in just over a month&#146;s time. Will contractors be
bound by those provisions when carrying out their contracts more
generally, let alone when there is any dispute about their contract?
They are not in the public sector. They may be receiving money from the
public sector, but what is their status in relation to the disability
duty?</div><a name="06103190000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06103190000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linked to that
is my second concern in relationto the human rights
legislation. For example, notwithstanding the fact that many of its
residents are being paid for at the public expense, if a care home is
run by a private contractor rather than the local authority, the
obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the disability duty
obligations do not currently apply. The Minister should clarify whether
contractors buying into this process would be so bound by their
contracts. If they would not, the defences both in law and in practice
available to the individual claimant would be lower in status or less
well protected than those within a conventional pathways
situation.</div><a name="06103190000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
understand that this is not a situation that is likely to arise often
in practice. Nor is it the Minister&#146;s intention to create a
two-tier economy. Neither he nor any of us want that or to resile from
the principle of sensible contractorisation. That is not the issue. But
we need to be assured that the defences are equivalent and that this
has been properly considered. We certainly need to be clear about that
before any move towards the implementation of these detailed provisions
is
made.</div><a name="06103190000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06103190000374"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): I apologise to the
Committee for not being here for the earlier part of the discussion. I
wanted to raise an issue that is pertinent to the point that has been
made, but is also relevant to the clause generally. It is the issue of
contracts and subcontracting. There is some concern about whether the
legislation allows for a private and voluntary contractor to put
forward a bid and to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 326</div>include in that bid some subcontracting to other organisations. If so,
how will that be assessed by the Department? Alternatively, if a bid
put in by a private or voluntary organisation was accepted and the
contract was signed, and then during the course of implementation of
that contract it was found that to fulfil the criteria it was necessary
to subcontract and bring in other organisations, would the Department
allow that and if so how would it assess the
matter?</div><a name="06103190000207"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000375"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I endorse what my hon. Friends have said. I wish
to be absolutely clear about the thrust of the amendment. It deletes
subsection (2)(b) because we are not quite sure what it is doing there.
If my cross-referencing of the legislation to section 8(1)(c) of the
Social Security Act 1998 is
correct&#151;</div><a name="06103190000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000376"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b>
Congratulations.</div><a name="06103190000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000377"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The Minister congratulates me, but I was rather
disappointed not to find in the explanatory notes a description of what
8(1)(c) is about. It is not really surprising that they do not tell us
that because it is essentially about subcontracting. It is not about
WFIs or service provision but about something fundamental to the
British welfare state&#151;the decision-making power and the power to
sanction that is currently in the hands of Jobcentre Plus. It is not in
the hands of anybody else.</div>
<a name="06103190000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is the Minister
contemplating that? Not many outside bodies in the private and
voluntary sector have any interest in taking over the decision-making
function. For example, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People
told the Select Committee in evidence earlier this year:</div>
<a name="06103190000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would be reluctant
to involve ourselves in regulating benefit, and we do not see that as
part of our
job.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Examples are legion
of private and voluntary sector bodies saying that they do not want to
touch sanctioning with a bargepole. They do not want the
decision-making role anywhere near
them.</div><a name="06103190000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000378"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> It seems to me that that is a big difference
between pathways to work, with the delegated powers that were given
during the project, which was successful on many levels, and the new
scheme that is proposed under the
Bill.</div><a name="06103190000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000379"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Mr. Chris
Melvin of the Employment Related Services Association has reminded us
that in employment zones private sector providers have the power to pay
benefit. However, the Minister cannot therefore tell us, &#147;This
is happening in employment zones&#148;. It is not, because there is a
massive difference between the paying of benefit, as happens in
employment zones, and the sanctioning power. Mr. Melvin gave
evidence to the Select Committee on behalf of ERSA and said:</div>
<a name="06103190000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
they&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06103190000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
customers in employment
zones&#151;</div><a name="06103190000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are
not engaging it is our responsibility to put together a case for
decision making and appeals to then decide whether they have breached
their benefit regulations.
We&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06103190000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">the private
sector providers in employment zones&#151;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 327</div><a name="06103190000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are not doing the sanctioning

it.</div><a name="06103190000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;All we are
doing is providing that body with the evidence that they require in
order to make their
decision.&#148;</div><a name="06103190000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
state of play so far and that is why the power that our probing
amendment would delete is ground-breaking.</div>
<a name="06103190000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to the merits of the idea of
contracting the function to the private and voluntary sector at some
future date, should the Secretary of State exercise the power, I
am&#151;when I say that I have an open mind&#151;staggered that
Ministers even contemplate it. So I should be most grateful for the
Minister&#146;s specific answer to my question about how the power is
likely to be
used.</div><a name="06103190000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally&#151;I
do not mean this in a partisan way<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i> The
Minister knows that I am an honest seeker after truth in this
Committee, as elsewhere. Has he had any representations from any public
sector union about what the clause might mean? If one wanted to
speculate, one might think that the power was a precursor to the
breaking up of Jobcentre Plus. If the Minister wants to deny that, I
shall be happy to hear the denial. Why else, however, should the power
be in the Bill? Why, in short, give any future Secretary of State,
whoever that might be, the power to contract out the decision-making
function?</div>
<a name="06103190000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000380"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess, for another broad
debate on this narrow amendment. Of course you will guide us if I
wander on to the subject of the Disability Discrimination Act 2005,
which is a discussion for a future amendment.</div>
<a name="06103190000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to set out the position
clearly for the Committee this afternoon. The power taken under the
clause is about dealing with the possibility that in future it may
become desirable to move the decision-making function closer to the
front line and into the organisations that deal with customers daily,
particularly as we extend work-related activity and conditionality.
Allowing providers to undertake the end-to-end process, to which I have
alluded, would make the decision making more efficient and would help
link rights and responsibilities much more closely in the minds of
customers and others. It is therefore important that we have the option
in the Bill. It is not an option or a policy that we currently intend
to implement. We think that as employment and support allowance,
work-focused interviews and work-related activity evolve, and we
successfully roll out the private and voluntary sector provision of
pathways, the power may be a useful additional
measure.</div>
<a name="06103190000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000381"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Can the Minister solve something that is puzzling
me? When we last met, he declined my freely-made offer of greater
flexibility in the sanctions for those who did not turn up. Now he
wants to take powers, when all Conservative Committee members have
expressed considerable concerns about the propriety of devolving such
powers to the public sector, while reassuring the Committee that he
does not need to use them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 328</div><a name="06103190000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000382"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am trying to set out accurately what we seek to
achieve. The hon. Gentleman is right thatwe did not want his
blank cheque of taking either passports or driving licences, or the
suggestion made by the hon. Member for Windsor of compelling customers
to undertake medical treatment. Such was the conversation last
Thursday. We did not wish to take those powers.</div>
<a name="06103190000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek to identify where, as
we successfully roll out the private and voluntary sector provision of
pathways, the decision maker should physically be located. I should
just say a word or two more on that. As I did in the supporting
information that was sent to Committee members, I make it clear that
decision making leading to sanctions would not be contracted out at the
point of the ESA&#146;s implementation in 2008. It is prudent to
allow the successful roll-out of pathways and to allow the ESA to be
thoroughly embedded before we embark on further changes and to take
time to consult with providers and others to ensure that, should we
contract out decision making, it is done properly and with the support
of stakeholders.</div> <a name="06103190000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can make other clear commitments in respect of the points raised by
Conservative Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly
(Mr. David). We will go into the specific point about the
Disability Discrimination Act in more detail later. In the invitation
to tender and the contracting process, the private and voluntary sector
will operate on behalf of the Secretary of State, so the responsibility
of adhering to that Act is clear. It will be the responsibility of the
primary contractors to ensure that subcontractors adhere to their
statutory responsibility in respect of that Act. Failure to adhere
could, in some instances, lead to the termination of
contracts.</div>
<a name="06103190000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000383"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> It appears from the Minister&#146;s remarks
that he has moved on from describing the rationale behind the taking of
this power. I want to probe him on it one further time. He mentioned
that the Government might want to take this power in future but that
they did not intend to do so now.For the Committee&#146;s
benefit, will he describe the circumstances in which he envisages that
the Government would take the power?</div>
<a name="06103190000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000384"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The reason why I went off at that little tangent
was that I caught sight of my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly out
of the corner of my eye and thought that it would be good manners to
respond to his point at that moment. On the specific questions that
have been
raised&#151;</div><a name="06103190000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000385"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I may have misheard the Minister, but I
understood that he just said that, without prejudice to the
decision-making power, any activity by contractors in relation to the
Bill would be covered by the Disability Discrimination Act and the
Human Rights Act. He went on to say that any subcontractors would be
bound by their contract also to fulfil those obligations. Will he
confirm that understanding of mine? I do not want to confuse the issue
in respect of the decision making, but would contractors be carrying
out a public function and would they be bound by those two bits of
legislation?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 329</div><a name="06103190000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06103190000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000386"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I provided that confirmation just a moment ago and
in an earlier debate on where responsibility for enforcing the DDA
lies. I do not wish to tempt your patience, Mr.
Amess&#151;this relates to the next amendment&#151;but private and
voluntary sector organisations could act on the Secretary of
State&#146;s behalf and those contractors would have to adhere to the
DDA. Subcontractors would be held to account by the primary contractors
should they fail to comply with the DDA. Primary contractors would be
held responsible by the Secretary of State for their adherence to the
DDA and for that of the subcontractors to their statutory requirements.
It would be a matter between the Secretary of State and the prime
contractors.</div><a name="06103190000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
going to try and make some progress because we said at the start of
proceedings that that is what we would do. There are issues around
whether it would be appropriate to contract out certain
responsibilities; in no scenario would we wish to contract out
responsibility for decisions made under clauses 8 and 9 regarding
limited capability for work and limited capability for work-related
activity, which would remain the responsibility of Jobcentre Plus. We
have debated that
already.</div><a name="06103190000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jobcentre
Plus would also retain the responsibility for the first work-focused
interview at eight weeks and we would not wish to subcontract that out
to the private and voluntary sectors, although there was a legitimate
debate about whether that should happen. We settled on the view that
Jobcentre Plus should retain that work-focused interview. Furthermore,
although the return-to-work credit is not strictly a benefit, it is
part of the package, and we would not seek to contract it
out.</div> <a name="06103190000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are some
important circumstances in which we would not wish to apply the powers
in the clause. Some have suggested that the provisions are a precursor
to further changes to Jobcentre Plus. The Public and Commercial
Services Union, which represents Jobcentre Plus, is a highly effective
and professional organisation that carries out its work on behalf of
its members effectively, as it is entitled to do. However, not even it
has put on the record anything that goes as far as what the hon. Member
for BurySt. Edmunds suggested, which is that the power in the
clause is a precursor to the break-up of Jobcentre Plus. As I have said
already, the responsibility for the first work-focused interview and
payment of return-to-work credit will be with Jobcentre
Plus.</div><a name="06103190000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000387"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not think that anyone is disputing the fact
that some parts of the Bill relating to the roll-out of pathways and
beyond will not be susceptible to subcontracting.</div>
<a name="06103190000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the amendment
before us, will the Minister tell us whether
a</div><a name="06103190000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;function conferred or
imposed on the Secretary of State by virtue of the application in
relation to such regulations of section 8(1)(c) of the Social Security
Act 1998&#148;</div><a name="06103190000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">is a function
of decision making? If so, in what possible circumstances would he
consider contracting out that decision-making function? My question is
not about anything except the decision-making
role.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 330</div><a name="06103190000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000388"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall seek to respond to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point.</div>
<a name="06103190000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the responsibility for the
decision making, the power in the clause will not change the role of a
personal adviser. Opposition Members have spoken eloquently and
effectively on the nature of the trust in the relationship between the
personal adviser and the customer. Sanctions have been tested in the
Jobcentre Plus-led pathways. In those cases, personal advisers can say
whether customers, whom they meet on a regular basis, have fulfilled
their obligations. If a personal adviser feels that the customer has
not met his or her responsibility, the personal adviser can refer the
case to a decision maker. We are discussing the location of the
decision maker, not the relationship, responsibility or skills of the
personal
adviser.</div><a name="06103190000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000389"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Is the Minister therefore saying that we should
have a dual-capacity model&#151;in other words, that the personal
adviser, contracted out or not, should not be the decision maker but
should make a recommendation to somebody else? Should that somebody
else be in the same organisation or an entirely separate
one?</div><a name="06103190000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000390"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is entirely
fair. Our intention is that the personal adviser will not be doing the
sanctioning under any feasible roll-out of the power contained in the
clause. He will remain a personal adviser and will not become the
decision maker. I know that the hon. Gentleman is following this,
because he has great knowledge of the details. The power in the clause
will potentially move a decision to a private or voluntary sector
organisation&#151;not to the same person, but to the same
organisation. As we consult with stakeholders, the private and
voluntary sector, Parliament and others on how that can feasibly be
delivered, we will seek to structure a system whereby there is a clear
separation of the personal adviser and the decision maker. I apologise
to hon. Members if they got the impression that we were trying to
expand the personal adviser into a quasi-personal adviser/decision
maker. We are seeking to maintain the system under the Jobcentre
Plus-led pathways whereby a personal adviser makes an assessment and
refers it to a decision maker, who makes a judgment. That is the model
that the power in clause 15 is intended to
create.</div><a name="06103190000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000391"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the Minister also confirm that no clause in
the contract with a private sector contractor will be likely to
influence either the recommendations of a personal adviser or the
decision of a decision maker? It troubles me slightly to think that
there might be a performance situation whereby a decision taken by a
private sector organisation might be distorted bythe terms of
the contract that it holds with the
Department.</div><a name="06103190000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000392"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I can give some relief to the hon. Gentleman by
saying that we will not incentivise private and voluntary sector
organisations to sanction anyone. We will not provide a financial
incentive framework that would make it in an organisation&#146;s
interests to do so.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 331</div><a name="06103190000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000393"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Following on from the point about financial
incentives, the concern expressed by private and voluntary sector
organisations to us, and I am sure to Ministers, is that it is
fundamentally against their ethos to be judges. They want to support
and help someone who is trying to engage in the world of work. If they
have to take on the role of administering sanctions, it will be a
fundamentally different role. Will the Minister confirm that the
Government will not use the contracts, through which they will exercise
considerable power over the actions of private and voluntary sector
providers, to make it impossible for private and voluntary sector
providers to say that they do not wish to be involved in the
administration of
sanctions?</div><a name="06103190000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000394"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Even in the scenario empowered by clause 15, the
private and voluntary sector will not be administering sanctions.
Sanctions will be related to the payment of benefit, which is in the
public sector. The location of a decision maker will change. To be fair
to Opposition Members, I do not believe that even in their darkest days
they would have sought to set targets for sanctions on the customers
whom we are
considering.</div><a name="06103190000244"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000395"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am still a bit confused by the
Minister&#146;s position. He has set out clear and precise ideas
about how the power in the clause will work in practice, but he seems
unwilling to tell the Committee anything about the circumstances in
which he might seek to use it, which seems odd. Perhaps I am
misunderstanding him, or maybe there is more to the matter than meets
the eye. Will he tell us more about his intentions? Under what
circumstances will Ministers seek to give the private and voluntary
sector the power to make decisions about whether someone&#146;s
benefit should be
sanctioned?</div><a name="06103190000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000396"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have already set out the conditions. They are
when the ESA is introduced, pathways are introduced nationally and the
delivery is successfully embedded, the capacities of the private and
voluntary sectors evolve, and after consultation with Parliament,
stakeholders and the relevant Select Committees. The conditions are
based not on a customer&#146;s medical ailment, but on the successful
roll-out of pathways.</div>
<a name="06103190000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Daventry
raised concerns about the protections. If the location of the decision
maker were changed, all protections allowed or enabled under Jobcentre
Plus would be in place, including appeals to the social security
appeals tribunal, and in some cases, to the social security
commissioners.</div> <a name="06103190000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
15 will not be able to apply the functions under clauses 8 and 9. We
would consider changing the location of the benefit-entitlement
decision maker on the basis of, for example, whether there was
adherence to and attendance at work-focused interviews, whether there
was good cause for non-attendance and whether someone had fulfilled his
or her responsibility in respect of work-related activity.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 332</div><a name="06103190000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to retain the
power in the Bill for future introduction as welfare provision evolves
throughout the country, and as pathways and ESA are successfully
implemented. From Opposition Members&#146; comments and from the
nature of our debate today, before introduction, we are aware that we
would need to conduct detailed conversation with the private and
voluntary sector organisations. Some welcome it: Shaw Trust and Working
Links have confirmed that they would be interested in having such
responsibility. However, we would need to take part in detailed
conversations about contracts and protections as the provisions are
introduced. It is important to include the power in the Bill, so that
it can be introduced if appropriate in the
future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000397"></a>John
Penrose:</b> We got there in the end. I think I heard the
Minister say that he expects&#151;in the future, not
immediately&#151;to contract out the decision-making function to
third parties, be they private or third sector organisations, with the
strict proviso that there is a clear distinction between the personal
adviser role and the decision maker role, and that he intends, in
consultation with all stakeholders, to build a high Chinese wall
between those functions. That is vital. Now that that is clear, the
debate has been revealing, and I am sure that everybody listening will
want to return to it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06103190000398"></a>Adam

my hon. Friend agree that even if it were agreed to in Committee, the
Lords would identify it as a significant provision whose powers needed
to be curtailed?</div>
