<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss (North-East Cambridgeshire):</B> Welcome back to the Chair, Miss Widdecombe. I shall speak briefly, as we had an important debate on clause 45 at the end of our last sitting when we discussed amendment No. 93. The Minister rejected my amendment on the basis that the research to which clause 45 refers was such that the Secretary of State would wish to contribute to it on a United Kingdom-wide basis rather than having research specific to Northern Ireland. Although research would apply to the Northern Ireland police service and the Royal Ulster Constabulary, it would be used to contribute to wider research projects.
<P>
I see the merit in that, as important lessons can be learned from the operational activities of the RUC and of the whole police service in Northern Ireland. They face one of the world's best organised terrorist groups and have had considerable experience during the troubles of dealing with civil unrest and terrorist activity. There is great merit in using the lessons learnt and the expertise and skill of the RUC and the rest of the police service for wider research projects.
<P>
However, the Bill ought to give the Police Authority--or the Secretary of State in consultation with the authority--the ability to become involved in Province-wide research. Clause 45 does not make it clear that that is to be the case. The Committee on the Administration of Justice, in its submission on the Bill, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The value of policing research bodies was so obvious in all of the jurisdictions CAJ visited, we would propose making this a duty. Furthermore, we propose that this be a duty imposed on the Police Authority rather than the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The committee put forward some ideas on amendments which went much further than those the Opposition have suggested. We thought that the Secretary of State could, after consultation with the Police Authority, set up bodies to undertake research. The CAJ believes that that should be the responsibility of the Police Authority, not the Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 2(3) places a heavy responsibility on the Police Authority. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall secure that the Northern Ireland Police Service is efficient and effective.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the context of that overarching duty, the Police Authority will need to establish research bodies to ascertain whether it fulfils the duty that that provision outlines. We believe that clause 45 should refer to the Police Authority's involvement in and influence on research. The CAJ goes even further and claims that undertaking research should be the prerogative of the Police Authority.
<P>
We agree with the Minister that it is important for Northern Ireland to be part of the wider research sphere, but I do not understand why that cannot go hand in hand with allowing the Police Authority to establish research bodies. The measure should contain in further reference to research. I leave it to the Minister to decide whether the addition can be made in later clauses or in the schedules.
<P>
Research is important, and is deemed important by the Police Authority, which wishes to be involved in it. That is right and proper. Although we did not push our amendment to a Division, the Minister should reconsider the matter and give the Police Authority powers to instigate research. It needs to do that to fulfil its duties under clause (2)(3).
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> Welcome back to our proceedings, Miss Widdecombe, I, too, have been away. I did not attend our previous sitting because I was engaged on ministerial duties at the intergovernmental conference in Dublin, and the transcripts of the Committee's proceedings do not always give the full flavour of the exchanges.
<P>
Nothing precludes the Police Authority from undertaking research. Our debate is about whether that should be enshrined as a power, or duty, in the Bill. It could be argued that that is unnecessary. However, given that I was not privy to the full flow of the discussion, I undertake to consider the matter further. The Police Authority has the right and responsibility to carry out research. In the case of a major investigation, instigated by research sponsored by the Secretary of State, consultation between the Secretary of State and the Police Authority would occur. There would be communication between the Secretary of State and the Police Authority about the necessity of research and the purpose of an inquiry. Such matters would be in the public domain irrespective of consultation.
<P>
I shall take advice and consider the matter further on Report, although I do not believe that the addition that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) proposes is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister's response is similar to that of the Under-Secretary of State, who deployed similar arguments in the previous sitting. The Minister also said that he had studied all the clauses with his officials before presenting them to the Committee--perhaps he thought that we were starting on clause 46 or 47. I am grateful to him for saying that although he comes to this afresh, he will consider the matter. As he rightly says, there may be a facility for the Police Authority to undertake research for its own purposes, and no one would preclude them from doing that. A provision does not have to be included in the Bill.
<P>
We debated the matter reasonably and amicably in our previous sitting. I withdrew the amendment on the basis that a strong and powerful point had been made about the Secretary of State's powers to involve the Northern Ireland police service in research to assist on a United Kingdom basis--or on an even wider scale--to which I have no objection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone):</B> I listened to what the Minister said, but in the light of financial constraints in the financing of the Police Authority, would it not be difficult to predict what sort of research will be considered necessary? Will the Minister reassure us about that financial aspect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Under the financial arrangements, a grant is made to the Police Authority. As we discussed earlier, moneys for Police Authority purposes are ring-fenced, and are separate from those for police purposes, on which the Chief Constable draws down. It is not specified what the Police Authority's expenditure shall be earmarked for. In early discussions as part of budget negotiations with the Secretary of State and the Minister, the Police Authority could justify the way in which it would like money to be allocated. I would imagine that that is probably how it would be done. However, research is not specifically recognised in the Bill as an important function of the Police Authority. The availability of resources to undertake research is not mentioned in the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend's question would be better answered by the Minister. The Police Authority expressed anxiety that under the clause it was not to be involved on consultation on research. In its submissions to us, it said that it did not believe that it had the power to undertake any research, or that sufficient resources had been allocated for that purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We could end up making heavy weather of the matter; I hope that we will not. Nothing currently prevents the Police Authority from undertaking such research. Under the proposed provisions, it would have its own grant. If it wanted to use a substantial amount for research purposes, that wish would be expressed as part of its bid for that grant. Small-scale research would not be contentious--although I use that word carefully. However, wide-ranging, potentially contentious and in-depth research that required checking and double-checking would require substantial sums and would be subject to discussion.
<P>
Ultimately, like any other public body, the Police Authority has a fiduciary duty and must live within proper expenditure limits. We shall therefore be advised as to whether research should be included and defined.
<P>
I recognise the strength of the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is already recognised in the Bill. Moreover, financial regulations may cover actions taken by the Police Authority in relation to such expenditure. I do not think that there is much more to be said. I said that I would re-examine the matter and consider the points that were made--although I hope that hon. Members also accept my reservations. Change will not necessarily be along the lines that I suggested. The hon. Gentleman can return to the matter on Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The wording of the clause, which is very short, mirrors that used in section 57 of the Police Act 1996, although there is a slight rewording: the legislation for England and Wales uses the word ``considers'' but the Bill uses the word ``thinks''. The Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State . . . may make such contribution . . . as he thinks necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know why the word ``considers'' was changed; in this context, pretty well all the other words in the 1996 Act were used in the Bill. Perhaps there is a subtle difference between ``considers'' and ``thinks''. If so, I hope that the Minister will enlighten us about it. I could not justify tabling an amendment on the matter.
<P>
Section 57(3) and (4) of the 1996 Act give the Secretary of State powers to make regulations. Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for requiring all police forces in England and Wales to use specified facilities or services, or facilities or services of a specified description''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Before making such regulations under this section, the Secretary of State shall consult . . . persons whom he considers to represent the interests of police authorities, and . . . persons whom he considers to represent the interests of chief officers of police.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He will consult the organisation representing police authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland before making regulations, which refer to services.
<P>
	Clause 46 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may . . . make such contribution to the provision or maintenance of such organisations, facilities and services; and . . . make such other payments . . . as he thinks necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When is it deemed unnecessary to include in the Bill the provisions in subsections (3) and (4) of section 57 of the 1996 Act, which give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations? He or she would be able to ensure that the Northern Ireland police service was involved with the organisations, facilities and services that he or she established. Much of the wording of the 1996 Act has been transferred to the Bill, and I cannot think why there should be a difference in this case.
<P>
An important power seems to have been set on one side--although I am not necessarily asking for the Secretary of State to have more powers. Most of the Bill's provisions give the Secretary of State powers that the Home Secretary in England and Wales does not enjoy. That important power has been omitted either because it is deemed to be unnecessary or because the matter has been overlooked. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not have a quick answer for the hon. Gentleman, so I shall write to him and to other Committee members to explain the subtleties involved. The clause is intended to make the situation clearer. When Bills are drafted, people ask whether a particular phrase is clear, and whether it could be made clearer. The change from ``consider'' to ``thinks'' falls into the latter category. I had understood previously that it was being argued that too much power was accruing to the Secretary of State. It is interesting that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire is now implying that more power should be transferred to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> No, I was asking why there was a difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 40, which concerns the power to require use by police of specified facilities, equipment or services. That is relevant to what the hon. Gentleman was saying about section 57 of the 1996 Act. If that proves inadequate to deal with the matter, and there proves to have been an omission that weakens the Bill, I shall, having heard the arguments that have been advanced in Committee, take any necessary action on Report. However, I do not think that any omission has occurred, as clause 40 replicates the function of section 57 of the Police Act 1996.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Annual and other reports by Police Authority to Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 22, line 37, leave out `4' and insert `5'.
<P>
This is a probing amendment. Clauses 47, 48 and 49 deal with reports of various kinds. There is a parallel provision, section 9, in the Police Act 1996. Clause 47 is a hybrid; it incorporates that provision, and also section 43, in subsections (4), (5) and (6). I do not argue against the fact that it brings together borrowings from earlier Bills. That probably makes sense.
<P>
Section 15 of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 also relates to annual and other reports. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Inspector General shall, as soon as possible after the end of each calender year, submit to the Police Authority a general report in writing on the carrying out by the police force of their functions during that year and the Authority shall transmit that report or a copy thereof to the Minister who shall lay a copy before each House of [the Parliament of the United Kingdom].''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision now in force requires the Chief Constable to submit the report to the Police Authority, which in turn submits it to the Secretary of State. There is no current requirement for the Police Authority to prepare its own report. Clause 47 is new in that respect. It mirrors the 1996 Act and is very important. It concerns the way in which the Police Authority will be seen to be accountable for its duties under clause 2. It is to be hoped that the public will be able to scrutinise the report and reach their own conclusions. Subsection (2)(a) alludes specifically to an assessment of how the annual policing plan, which we discussed at great length under clause 17, has been carried out. Under subsection 2(a), the annual report after the end of each financial year performs the vital role of showing the extent to which the aims and targets of the annual policing plan have been met.
<P>
The 1996 and 1970 Acts do not specify how many months after the end of each financial year the report shall be issued. The Bill specifies that it shall be issued
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not later than four months''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after the end of each financial year. The 1996 Act simply says that the Police Authority shall issue that report ``as soon as possible'' after the end of each financial year, as does the 1970 Act in relation to each calendar year.
<P>
Someone has decided that four months is the appropriate time scale. Why should it not be three or five months? Why not retain the wording of the 1970 Act or the England and Wales legislation, which would be reasonable and would mirror the present Northern Ireland and England and Wales legislation. The reason why Northern Ireland should be any different escapes me. No doubt the Minister will enlighten us as to why clause 47(1) specifies four moths.
<P>
The 1970 Act specifies that the Chief Constable's report should go the Secretary of State via the Police Authority. Section 15(1) of that Act specifically states that the Minister
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall lay a copy before each House of [the Parliament of the United Kingdom].''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no such requirement for the Police Authority's report to be similarly treated under clause 47. Clause 47(1) requires that the Police Authority shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issue a report relating to the policing of Northern Ireland for the year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under subsection (3)(b), the Police Authority shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``send a copy of the report to the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State is not required--there is certainly no such requirement under clause 47--to lay that report before either House of Parliament, to send it to the Library, or, it would seem, to make it available to the public. That is an incredible oversight.
<P>
If I may move ahead to clauses 48 and 49, which happen to deal with the Chief Constable's report, I shall point out that it is strange that clause 49(5) requires the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lay before both Houses of Parliament every report submitted to him under subsection (4).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) refers to the Chief Constable's report as defined in clause 48(1). What is the reason for that inconsistency? Clause 49 states that the Chief Constable's report, which goes to the Police Authority and the Secretary of State, shall be laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State. Yet the Police Authority's report, which is just as important--if not more important--is not required to be laid before either House of Parliament. Under the 1970 Act that report is supposed to be laid before Parliament. There is an inconsistency there.
<P>
I have not been able to find other provisions in the Bill under which reports of the Police Authority should be laid before Parliament.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is specific; it is concerned with a number of months. The hon. Gentleman is going wide, and his comments would be more suitable for a clause stand part debate. I would be grateful if he would confine his remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for your advice, Miss Widdecombe. That is the first time during our many sittings that I have been called to order. It was bound to happen at some juncture--and you, Miss Widdecombe, were bound to be the person who did it. [Laughter.] Never mind. We live and learn. I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion.
<P>
Why does the clause specify four months? The current legislation, the 1996 Act, specifies that the report should be submitted as soon as possible. The Minister must make a strong argument for the change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had been listening he would have heard the rationale behind this part of the Bill. He said that he recognised the relevance and relative importance of clause 47 with regard to the publishing of reports. It is logical that there should be a time limit for such publication. That is tidy and organised, and gives some discipline and focus for those who draw up the reports and those who oversee their outcome. They know that they are working within a particular time frame, and that allows the mechanisms to be put in place for public consumption of the documents. The handling of publication and the way in which such matters are brought into the public domain are important.
<P>
Incidentally, I have no hang-up about the particular period of four months. However, it has been argued that if the period were longer than four months, that would take us into July. That has traditionally been a troublesome month in Northern Ireland, although I hope that with the Parades Commission and the good will of those involved in parades, that trouble will be avoided this year and in future years.
<P>
The period could be three months. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not say whether he thought the period was too long or too short. He asked only for a rationale for specifying four months. If he thinks the matter is so important, I am prepared to consider three months, or a longer period.
<P>
The Government are establishing working groups to consider the implementation of the legislation. Yesterday, I had a useful meeting with representatives of the Police Authority. I proposed that those detailed points might be discussed in the working groups. We could then find out the Police Authority's objections to the four-month period, and why it would prefer five or six months. The Bill could then be amended on Report. Those discussions are taking place, but until I hear the arguments for five or six months--or, indeed, for three months--a period of four months seems reasonable. My mind is open, as always. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has not argued for a different time scale, but I am amenable to his suggestions on the matter.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised a number of other issues, to which I cannot respond because of your earlier ruling, Miss Widdecombe, but we shall return to them on clause stand part, and they might be better dealt with under clauses 48 and 49.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I said that amendment No. 94 was a probing amendment. Not only is there a chink of light round the door, but the door is ajar. The Minister has given no reason why the number four is in the Bill. It could be three, four or five.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there needs to be a time scale? Those who are reporting and who are expecing a report need that discipline and date to work to. Does he agree that that is sensible? If so, how many months would he like to be specified?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not say that. I made it clear that existing legislation--the 1970 Act--says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as soon as possible after the end of each calender year''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The 1996 Act says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as soon as possible after the end of each financial year''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am happy for the phrase from the 1996 Act to be included in Northern Ireland legislation because it would leave the reporting date reasonably open-ended. [Interruption.] My amendment was a probing amendment. I wanted the Minister to justify why he chose four months. He has not done that. I thought he said that he was open-minded, which leaves the door ajar.
<P>
Four months is no more justifiable than three or five months. I believe that.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as soon as possible after the end of each financial year''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is perfectly acceptable. I know that my amendment does not say that, but if the Minister is prepared, after discussions with the Police Authority, to table an amendment on Report, he may well consider that phrase. I am sure that the Police Authority would agree. It suggested five months, to give it an extra month to prepare the report. The Police Authority is aware that that would mean July and therefore possible difficulties with the marching season, but it did not see that as a problem. It is no more hung up on five months than the Minister is on four months.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister, after discussions with the Police Authority, will come up with some arrangement. The Police Authority felt that four months was a little tight and that an extra month would be helpful in certain circumstances and certain years. But why be prescriptive? Why not say, as legislation for England and Wales does:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as soon as possible after the end of each financial year''?<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I deliberately did not catch your eye, Miss Widdecombe, until I had heard the Minister's response to the so-called probing amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire.
<P>
The Minister appears to have trailed yet another red herring across our path. He has introduced to the debate what he calls the marching season of July. I have no vested interest in the marching season in July--I am not a member of the organisations that parade in July--but to suggest that the Police Authority might not want to issue its report in July because of the marching season, and the difficulties associated with it, is disingenuous.
<P>
For most of my lifetime, July has been a peaceful and happy holiday month in Northern Ireland. Only recently has it become less peaceful, which has not a little to do with the deliberate orchestration by the IRA. Even that breakdown in peace at the end of June and in July is confined to a remarkably small number of parades. Had the Minister been scrambling around looking for a justification for specifying four months, he might have suggested the fact that July is a holiday month. However, a more important argument for the extra month is that clause 48 makes it clear the the Chief Constable will not produce his report until the end of June.
<P>
If the Police Authority is fully to carry out its responsibilities, it will take much longer than a month to examine the Chief Constable's report, put it in its proper context, compare it with set objectives and so forth. Any police authority, or any committee, will take considerable time to meet extra responsibilities over and above its normal routine. One reason why five months, as stipulated in the amendment--or even six--would be more appropriate, is that it would give the Police Authority an opportunity to examine all aspects and implications of the Chief Constable's report.
<P>
Deep in the Minister's mind is the impression that the Police Authority has been virtually laid to rest. We have seen that progressively as we have debated the Bill. The matters that the Police Authority has to promote, suggest, discuss or agree are matters to which the Chief Constable will have only some regard. The Police Authority will have no real power to examine issues in detail. It will surely take longer than a month to examine what has happened in the entire preceding year.
<P>
The Minister must therefore reflect on his Department's--or the Northern Ireland police division's--attitude to the Police Authority. He must probe the depths of his mind to discover how the Secretary of State has become the supremo of policing in Northern Ireland. De facto, the Minister has relegated the Police Authority to a position in which it needs no time--a month is being tossed in as the time for consideration of the Chief Constable's report--to examine the issues. That month is a facade, an embellishment that is important neither to the Minister nor his Department.
<P>
If that is not the case and I misunderstand the Minister, will he explain in detail how the Police Authority can, on top of its usual duties during the holiday month of July, make a meaningful contribution to all the aspects of policing to which it should have regard? I leave the Minister with that thought, and perhaps he will give a fuller answer.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I agreed with the hon. Gentleman until he made his usual veiled attack on civil servants when he spoke about the attitude of those in the police division--but I shall not rise to the bait. The hon. Gentleman never receives support in Committee for that point of view and the way in which he presents it. He is a single voice, and his attack on dedicated civil servants was unwarranted.
<P>
I said earlier that the time scale was important, but that I was amenable to a variation in it. I referred to July because someone had told me that because it was the marching season it was a difficult period. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that it is a holiday period, but a five-month period would include August, which also includes a holiday period. The argument applying to four months also applies to five months. I have said that my officials are prepared to discuss with the Police Authority, through the working groups, a sensible time scale. That may be six months, or it could be three months if the period within which the Chief Constable must report was changed from three months to two months. If the Chief Constable could report within one month of the end of the year, there would be five months of a six-month period left, which is too long for the Police Authority. We could become involved in detailed mechanisms, and common sense should apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> On that point--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> An earlier report--
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister has the Floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> An earlier report from the Chief Constable is unlikely, because the report will cover important and detailed matters. Clause 48 specifies three months for the Chief Constable's report and we shall discuss that. I am amenable to an extension of the time scale, but let us first get the working groups under way and discuss the matter so that we arrive at a reasonable framework for the organisation and presentation of the reports.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire implied that he did not want a time scale in the Bill, so he seems to have concluded that the standards in England and Wales, which are open-ended, should apply. I am not in favour of that. Not everything in England and Wales represents the best way forward. There are good organisational reasons for having time scales in the Bill, because they provide a healthy discipline for those charged with producing reports. In the light of the assurance that I have given on the way forward, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not want to delay the Committee's proceedings, and if the Minister had given way on a very small point I would not have had to rise to my feet again. Is the Minister really thinking about the Bill and the details that we were discussing? He has just tossed in the concept that the Chief Constable may be able to provide his report within one month of the end of the financial year. He must be aware that the Chief Constable has a range of key objectives to analyse at the end of the financial year--and that the Secretary of State has been so impressed with those key objectives that she has claimed them as her own and may add to them. If so, any reasonsable person would acknowledge that a Chief Constable with operational responsibilities for employing and overseeing more than 13,000 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and charged with all the additional duties that the Bill heaps upon him, would not have the ability or the time to present a considered report within a month.
<P>
I beseech the Minister to be careful. A suggestion here may become an expectation of the Chief Constable. The report will be less than adequate if the proposal for one month is accepted. The Minister will be able to enlighten us by telling the Committee how long it normally takes for the Chief Constable to produce a report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister said that he intended to set a specific time scale. That clarifies matters, even if the aim is not necessarily welcome. He suggested that he would set out a finite time scale--for example, four months--for the completion of a report. When he developed his argument, he implied that the time scale for the Police Authority would be predicated on that for the Chief Constable, so there would be a finite time in which the Chief Constable--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should ensure that their pagers and mobile telephones do not ring in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): Apparently, my hon. Friend he Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter) has left his jacket and his pager. The police will be informed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Moss.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Before I was rudely interrupted--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> We will bring my hon. Friend's head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> --I said that the Chief Constable would be given three months to produce his report and that the Police Authority would produce its report later. That suggests that the Police Authority's report will wait until the Chief Constable's report is ready. But the two reports will be distinct from each other, and the Police Authority's report should be prepared separately.
<P>
Subsection (2) clearly states that the Police Authority's report should contain an assessment of the annual policing plan, membership of the police force and so on. Such statistical information should be readily available within a short time. It should not have to wait for the Chief Constable's report. I do not understand the reason for providing three months for the Chief Constable's report and four months for that of the Police Authority.
<P>
Let us assume that the Police Authority has to wait for the Chief Constable's report before it can begin its report. One month is not enough time for the Police Authority to compile a report. The reports are separate, and perhaps three or four months should be provided for the completion of both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal briefly with the point that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) made about existing arrangements for the Chief Constable. The report is begun at the end of the calendar year, and is normally produced after five or six months, in May or June. I do not believe that that is desirable. It is better to establish a tighter time scale for the report, because it relates to a particular year. That is why the Bill specifies three months for the Chief Constable.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire as come up with some obscure and unusual arguments. He implied that the Police Authority could publish its report before the Chief Constable published his report, because it should not need to wait around for the Chief Constable's report. However, that would mean that the Chief Constable and the RUC were not held fully to account by the authority, which is one of its prime functions. Surely, it is better for the members of the authority to consider the Chief Constable's assessment of his actions during the period in question before they produce their report.
<P>
Although the aurthority's duty is to hold the Chief Constable to account, many aspects of the two reports are likely to be complementary and the authority could supplement the points made by the Chief Constable. That would give greater thrust to both reports.
<P>
Better policing in Northern Ireland relies on partnership, with the Police Authority holding the RUC to account. The phrase ``holding to account'' can be overloaded, but it is clearly one of the authority's functions. It is carried out well at present, and the Bill will give the authority more power to carry it out in future. That is the reason for the gap of three months between the publication of the two reports.
<P>
Three months is a normal period for companies to take to produce and publish their accounts. We have heard the Chief Constable described as the chief executive of a major operation. That is one of his functions, although he is much more than that. When I talked to the Commissioner of the Garda Siochana last Thursday, he described himself as a chief executive, although he does not have the power that we want to invest in the Chief Constable at the RUC.
<P>
The situation of the Chief Constable is similar to that of senior executives running large operations. They are required to report within a particular time scale. In this case the Chief Constable is required to report within three months; the Police Authority, which holds him to account--in the same way that auditors might do with the executives of a company--makes its report some time after that.
<P>
The provision is consistent and sensible. I do not want the open-ended approach that applies elsewhere, and I ask the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire not to proceed with the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> When I strayed offside, as it were, I was raising a number of issues that, as you rightly pointed out, Miss Widdecombe, would have been better left to the debate on clause stand part. I shall return to them now.
<P>
In subsection (1) the Police Authority is required to issue a report, and under subsection (3)(b) to send a copy to the Secretary of State. In earlier legislation--the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 and the Police Act 1996, which covers England and Wales--the Secretary of State was required to lay such reports before both Houses of Parliament. However, under the Bill that is not a requirement for the Police Authority's report.
<P>
Strangely, the Chief Constable's report, which is covered by clauses 48 and 49, is required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament under clause 49(5). There is an inconsistency here. Surely it is more important for the Police Authority's report than for the Chief Constable's report to be laid before both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
I do not want to repeat the arguments, but the Minister seems to believe that if the Police Authority had the Chief Constable's report, it would be helped to write its own report. However, the point of the Bill is to separate the functions of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority, and to make the authority's duties and responsibilities transparent.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is impossible for the Police Authority's report to be critical of the Chief Constable and the RUC--it is charged after all, under clause 47(2)(a), with making
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an assessment of the extent to which the annual policing plan for that year issued under section 17 has been carried out''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With the best will in the world, not all plans--for policing in Northern Ireland or for ICI or any other large association--meet the targets originally agreed at the start of the year. There may be a discrepancy between the aims and targets set out in the plan and the objectives achieved by the end of the year.
<P>
Criticisms may be expressed in the Police Authority's report according to where the responsibility lies for failure to deliver appropriate targets in the annual policing plan. That might include criticism of the performance of the Chief Constable and his team of senior officers, which need not await the issuing of the Chief Constable's own report.
<P>
Human nature being what it is, the Chief Constable and his senior officers may try to put a certain spin on things--the Government know how to do that--or a gloss on developments. Given the Police Authority's additional powers, it would want to appear completely transparent and unbiased in its critique of the annual policing plan and the conduct of the Chief Constable and his senior officers.
<P>
The Police Authority's report above all others must be in the public domain, but nothing in the Bill establishes any requirement for the plan to go anywhere other than to the Secretary of State. The Police Authority will want to ensure that it enters the public domain, but the clause does not require that: it states only that the Police Authority shall ``issue a report''. That oversight will have to be attended to on Report. It does not matter whether the report is put in the public domain and laid before Parliament by the Police Authority directly or by the Secretary of State. It may be better after the Secretary of State has seen the report so that any contentious material can be hived off in the interests of security.
<P>
Public scrutiny is vital, however, and the Police Authority must ensure that the delivery of policing in Northern Ireland is efficient and effective. Regulations will ensure that other requirements, aims, objectives, policing principles and so forth are delivered by the Police Authority, which must be seen by the public to have achieved them. Any failure to deliver must also be brought to the attention of the public and the Chief Constable must be held to account--not for day-to-day operational matters, but for delivery of the annual policing plan, which, under clause 17, is to be drawn up in draft by the Chief Constable and submitted to the Police Authority for approval.
<P>
We debated clause 17 long and hard. Opposition Members argued that during the operational year in which the annual policing plan agreed between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable was being implemented, any deviations from the plan should be discussed with the Police Authority as they happen. We argued that the approval of the Police Authority should be sought before serious deviations were undertaken. We still believe that that proposed amendment is important and should be reconsidered on Report.
<P>
It is no good arguing that everything can be sorted out because of the requirement for reports to be submitted at the end of the year. It is evident that if the Minister does not alter the provision, the Police Authority's report will not be issued until four months after the end of the financial year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Six months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It says four months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Six months.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Let us work on the basis of four months. That is not hypothetical: it is in writing. It might be necessary to wait 16 months before the fact that a Chief Constable had deviated from the annual policing plan in its first month was placed in the public domain. It might not even be in the public domain, according to the information available, but it would be that long before it leaked out, perhaps, to enable the public to take a view on it. That is why it is so important that any deviations from the plan should be discussed and dealt with during the year of implementation, rather than after the issue of the report.
<P>
The ministerial view of the matter was that nothing should come between the Chief Constable and his operational independence. We do not disagree. However, the public should have a right to know, long before the elapse of 16 months, whether a Chief Constable has seen fit to deviate substantially from the annual policing plan that has been drafted, agreed with the Police Authority, submitted to the Secretary of State and put in the public domain, with its aims and objectives made clear to everyone. We shall return to that subject on Report.
<P>
The aims of clause 47(2)(b), which refers to the inclusion in the annual report of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an assessment--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) of the extent to which the membership of the police force is representative of the community in Northern Ireland; and
<P>
(ii) of the effectiveness of any measures taken by the Chief Constable with a view to securing that the membership of the police force is representative of that community''
<P>
</UL></FONT>are important and laudable. If they have not been enshrined in statute before, that is long overdue. During my party's time in government, every effort was made to change the balance of the RUC better to reflect the component parts of the community in Northern Ireland. During the first ceasefire, of those applying for membership, we obtained a figure of 15 or 16 per cent from minorities. Now, for all sorts of reasons, that has fallen to nearer 9 per cent. The figures are moving in the wrong direction, after a period of hope for substantial change.
<P>
We all know that one of the primary reasons for the nationalist community not being better represented in the police force is intimidation. The argument runs that to get rid of intimidation would mean that the numbers would increase. However, the end of intimidation requires an overall settlement in the talks process, which requires an end to intimidation. We just go round and round without ever seeming to make a substantial breakthrough.
<P>
Why does sub-paragraph (i) refer only to the ``police force''? I do not say that both sides of the community should not be properly represented in the police force, but why stop there? Why not extend the provision to the police service, which is introduced by clause 2?
<P>
I suspect that existing legislation on equal opportunities and the balance of the civil service takes care of those points in some ways. However, it would be sensible to consider including a provision in the Bill. Then there would be no ground for disagreement. Our intention should be clear for all to see: everyone working the police service--including civilian employees in police stations, traffic wardens and others--should come within the compass of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): Before my hon. Friends moves on from clause 47(2)(b)(i) and (ii), does he agree that sub-paragraph (i) implies continuation of a divided community? In the event, for which we all hope, of an overall agreement, the traditional divide within the Northern Ireland community will cease to have the significance it has had hitherto. What application and implementation would there then be for paragraph (b)(i)? The Bill presupposes, and we all understand it to mean, a representation of nationalist and Protestant traditions. However, an agreement would mean that that divide would cease to exist. In those circumstances what would the phrase ``representative of the community'' mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend raises a point to which I was coming. I am not sure what those words mean. We normally accept that Northern Ireland is made up of distinct communities or traditions. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the community in Northern Ireland''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not seem to me or my hon. Friend to convey what we seek to acheive, a balance between the two traditions. It is not explicit. If the target is better representation from both traditions, the Bill should say so specifically. We know what it seeks to acheive but it is not clear as it might be. As well as the police force, the overall police service should be incorporated in any Police Authority assessment of the balance of representation of both traditions.
<P>
Subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority shall . . . arrange for every report . . . to be published in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such words also appear in the Police Act 1996, covering England and Wales. I have no quibble with that, but the words are not strong enough in that the Police Authority is required to put its report into the public domain in some way. The Police Authority may be required to do that, and it may come into being at that stage or when the copy is sent to the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament or to publish so that it is publicly accessible. Such matters are important; at the time, however, I did not think that they merited amendments. We have had a useful discussion. The Minister may want to incorporate some of those ideas on Report; we look forward to his response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I hope that the Minister will be able to address the points that my hon. Friend and I made about paragraph (b)(i), especially our anxieties about the expression
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``representative of the community in Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that as the terminology is commonly used, the community of Northern Ireland is a single community, but tragically it is divided. I cannot understand how a police force should be representative of the community in the event--as we hope will be the case--that the divide within that community ceases to exist or to apply to the same extent. Will the Minister consider that source of confusion? I do not believe that we are being excessively pedantic. It is important to understand what the clause is designed to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal first with the extensive points made at length by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. This part of the Bill deals with the powers and responsibilities of the Police Authority. Subsection (3)(a) states that the Police Authority shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``arrange for every report issued under subsection (1) to be published in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire is arguing that that responsibility should be removed from the Police Authority, so that it no longer has the power to decide how reports should be published, and that that power should be transferred to the Secretary of State, who lays the report before Parliament. I do not object to that, but the Police Authority may argue that such a measure dilutes its areas of responsibility. It may feel that the matter should not be considered in Parliament; it represents the community in Northern Ireland, and may prefer to deal with the matter in a particular way within Northern Ireland. The Bill gives it that power.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman is arguing on behalf of the Police Authority that it wants the Secretary of State to take ownership of the report and to lay it before Parliament, as I said, I would not object to that. I shall speak to the Police Authority to discover whether that is what it wants. However, the Bill was drafted to give the Police Authority full responsibility for its own publications. I shall talk to the authority to ascertain exactly what it thinks about the matter, and if there is a need to amend the Bill, I shall do so on Report.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also made a point about deviations--his word--from the plan approved by PANI and about the 16-month time scale before the matter was reported. Clause 48(3) deals with that contingency:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall, whenever so required by the Police Authority, submit to the Authority a report on such matters connected with the policing of Northern Ireland as may be specified in the requirement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That takes account of the need to report using the annual reporting mechanism. If the Police Authority is worried about a major issue, it can demand regular reports from the Chief Constable, including a progress report on the plan. If the plan is knocked off course for a reason not envisaged by the Police Authority or the Chief Constable, the authority will have the right to request a report and to consider what the implications of that might be. Clause 48 (3) deals with that.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also commented on clause 47(2)(b)(i) and the use of the phrase ``the police force'' instead of the police service. There was some sense in his argument, but we must recognise that those who provide support to officers of the RUC are not at the interface, which is--rightly or wrongly--the point of contention and unease in the community. I have asserted that attacks on the RUC by certain sections of a community have been caused more by perception than by reality. None the less, the problem exists. That is why it is necessary to ensure that the police force is representative of the wider community.
<P>
	There is another aspect to the matter. Those who act in support of the RUC are--for want of a better word--civilians. As non-RUC officers, they are covered by existing employment legislation, which is the most robust anywhere in Europe in the way in which it deals with imbalance. Legislation exists to deal with the representative nature of those who serve alongside RUC officers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) made the valid point that there is only one community in Northern Ireland which, sadly, is divided. However, the police force should be representative of the wider community, not just of the present divide between various traditions and, some would argue, religions, but of gender and ethnic differences. There may well be divides other than the most obvious ones. A police force needs to be fully representative of the wider community. That is the reason for the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, which has been helpful, and I take on board what he said. I have one small point to make on my idea of where the report should be sent, published or placed. The Police Authority did not express that view to me. Although I am happy that it should have the power to publish
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hoped that somewhere the Bill would say that the report, irrespective of how it is published, should be laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There is a slight difference. If a report were laid before Parliament it would come under the ownership of the Secretary of State, not the Police Authority. It would be difficult for the Secretary of State to be accountable for a report that she had not drawn up. She is, however, directly accountable to Parliament for the RUC--the police force. But we will discuss the hon. Gentleman's idea with the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Again, I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. Perhaps it explains why the stipulation is not included in the Bill. It is, however, present in earlier legislation, so I remain confused about the difference. Although the Police Authority has general reponsibilities to convey information to the public, the Bill does not say that the report shall be placed in the public domain in Northern Ireland. I accept that it might be too difficult to require in statute that the report be laid before the House by the Secretary of State, but the Bill must require the Police Authority to publish the report so that it is accessible to the public within weeks or days of its submission.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Salter </B>(Reading, West): On a point of order, Miss Widdecombe. I apologise for having left my electronic irritator on earlier. I wish that I did not own it, and I apologise for the disruption caused to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Salter.
<H4><center>Clause 48</center></H4>
<H4><center>Annual and other reports by Chief Constable to Police Authority</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 23, leave out lines 27 to 29.
<P>
The amendment is straightforward and would delete lines 27 to 29 in clause 48. The clause deals with the Chief Constable's annual report, which is submitted to the Police Authority. Section 15(1) of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 specifies that that report should go to the Secretary of State via the Police Authority. At first sight, clause 48 appears only to require that the Chief Constable's report goes to the Police Authority. Clause 49(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall, at the same time as he submits a report to the Police Authority under section 48(1), submit the same report to the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is unusual that that requirement is made under clause 49. Clause 48 requires that the Chief Constable's report should go to the Police Authority, and surely should also require that the report be submitted to the Secretary of State.
<P>
The amendment seeks to delete subsection (2), which allows the Chief Constable to submit his report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in such manner as appears to him to be approrpriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that subsection is taken from section 22 of the Police Act 1996; indeed, most of the clause is taken from that Act. One obvious difference in the Bill is that the Chief Constable has up to three months to submit his report, whereas under the 1996 Act he has a little more licence--again, the report is to be submitted as soon as possible.
<P>
Under subsection (3), the Chief Constable is required to respond to requests from the Police Authority for reports on more or less anything relating to the policing of Northern Ireland. Subsection (4)(a) requires that the reports shall be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in such form as may be specified in the requirement under that subsection''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does the Police Authority determine the form of the report under subsection (3)? Under subsection (2), the Chief Constable determines the form of the report, which he is required to submit to the Police Authority. Clause 48(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall, not later than 3 months after the end of each financial year, submit to the Police Authority a general report on the policing of Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states that the report will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``published in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
In an earlier debate, the Minister used the powerful argument that if something is not going well during the implementation of the annual policing plan, the Police Authority could say to the Chief Constable, ``Look, we want a report on X, Y or Z. Furthermore, we will tell you what the form of the report should be and what it should cover.'' The annual report will be presented to the Police Authority in a way that the Chief Constable decides is best for him--or, to use the Bill's words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, if the Chief Constable is required to issue a report for the Police Authority during the year, he will have to submit it in a manner that the Police Authority deems to be appropriate. I am puzzled by that arrangement. Why is that apparent inconsistency in the Bill?
<P>
The Chief Constable's report on annual policing should be presented in a way that the Police Authority--rather than the Chief Constable--deems to be appropriate for its circumstances and responsibilities. The intermediate reports issued during the year, which are mentioned in subsection (4), will be produced by the Chief Constable for the Police Authority in a way that it determines. In that context, the amendment or deletion of subsection (2) may be appropriate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall be brief, because the relevant arguments are not extensive. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire placed the amendment in context and pointed out that the clause will require the Chief Constable to produce an annual report. The clause will also allow the Police Authority to require the Chief Constable to submit a report on matters connected with the policing of Northern Ireland to the authority. Subsection (1) will require the Chief Constable to produce an annual report. Subsection (2), which has attracted the Opposition's attention, will require the Chief Constable to arrange for the publication of such a report in the manner that appears to him to be appropriate.
<P>
I support my hon. Friend's argument. There appears to be an element of confusion and clumsiness in the order, content and arrangement of the clause--and in that of clause 49, which covers comparable ground. There is an apparent contradiction about who is responsibile for the manner in which a report is presented. Subsection (2) relates to annual reports and subsection (6) relates to other reports. I have no quarrel in principle with the production of reports, but we should deal with the element of clumsiness and confusion that the Bill contains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There seems to be a significant misunderstanding of what we are trying to achieve in the clause. The hon. Member for Basingstoke made an accusation and I shall try to explain to him and the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire what we are trying to do.
<P>
Clause 48(2), which the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire wants to delete, sets out the requirement for the Chief Constable to report to the public on his policing plan. That is his interface with the public. He is a public servant and accountable directly to the public, so it is right that he should maintain that accountability; it should not be filtered through, the Police Authority and/or the Secretary of State. He has an important public function, which is why subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall arrange for a report submitted under subsection (1) to be published in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That report is his assessment.
<P>
Subsections (3) and (4) refer to reports requested by someone who is holding the Chief Constable to account. The form of such reports can be specified if appropriate, but it is not for the Chief Constable to decide what is appropriate. Reports will be requested specifically on the operation of the policing plan as it proceeds.
<P>
The provision is not clumsy, but specific; it separates clearly the two areas of responsibility. The hon. Gentleman's misunderstanding may arise from misbriefing from sources unknown--perhaps from the Committee on the Administration of Justice or another body. If there was a misunderstanding, I hope that I have cleared it up.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgshire did not say that the amendment was a probing amendment, but he said that it was important. If it were accepted and subsection (2) were deleted, the Chief Constable's power to issue an annual report would be removed. That cannot be desirable. Subsection (2) requires that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall arrange for a report submitted under subsection (1) to be published in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would remove that power from the Chief Constable and I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman wants to dilute the provision to the extent that the Chief Constable has no freedom of action. When I referred earlier to a puppet of the Police Authority, there was a reaction in the Committee and outside. The amendment could result in the Chief Constable being a cipher for the Police Authority, which would be highly undesirable. He has an important role. He should determine how he presents his report and not do so under the direction and guidance of the Police Authority or the Secretary of State. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is the word ``submit'' in subsection (1) that sends one on the wrong trail. I listened to the Minister's explanation, but subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall . . .  submit to the Police Authority a general report''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not state that he should send his report, it states that he should ``submit'' it. That suggests a requirement to produce the report in a way deemed appropriate by the Police Authority.
<P>
Clause 47(3)(b) states clearly that a copy of the report will be sent to the Secretary of State. Clause 48(2) requires the report to be submitted. That is different because the word ``submit'' conjures up a different responsibility on the Chief Constable. If the intention outlined by the Minister is for the Chief Constable to produce his report and publish it in whatever way he chooses for the public--let us take that as read--I can go along with that, as long as it is stipulated that a copy is sent, out of courtesy, to the Police Authority. Later in the clause, powers are given to the Police Authority to ask for the Chief Constable's reports to be produced at short notice. Subsection (6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority may arrange, or require the Chief Constable to arrange, for a report under subsection (3) to be published in such a manner as appears to the Authority to be appropriate''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
strong wording. All the interim, intermediate reports that the Police Authority may ask for during the year must be published in such a way as that the Police Authority determines. Two different strictures are imposed by the clause--one on the Chief Constable, another on the Police Authority--which could lead to confusion.
<P>
If it is intended that the Chief Constable's report is for public consumption, that is fine and we can accept it. If so, the word ``submit'' should be altered to ``send'' to clear up any confusion. If it is the Chief Constable's report and he will determine how it should be published and where it should appear--if he can say simply, ``Here is my report to the public; and here is my report to the Police Authority''--the Police Authority will have no say in its formulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is a clear misunderstanding on the part of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire of what the Bill is intended to achieve. We have already debated clause 47, which gives the Police Authority some latitude in the publishing of its report. One requirement is to send a copy to the Secretary of State; but when a specific request has been made and the Police Authority want to monitor the Chief Constable and call him to account, there is a requirement to submit a report--a subtle difference. If we change the wording of clause 47--I said that we may, after consulting the Police Authority, return to it on Report--``send'' may become ``submit'', but that is not yet settled and I contend that submit is appropriate for clause 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his attempt at clarification, but he prefaced what he said by referring to a gross misunderstanding on the Opposition side of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Salter:</B> I submit that there is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to contribute--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I return to the word ``submit''. It appears in subsection (1) regarding the submission of the Chief Constable's general report to the Police Authority. Subsection (2) states that the report must be submitted in a manner to be decided by the Chief Constable. In subsection (3), submit is still used regarding the Police Authority's request for a report during the year. Subsection (6), however, states that a report shall be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``published in such a manner as appears to the Authority to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Submit is used in two contexts, one in respect of the Chief Constable's power to decide how to publish a report, and the other regarding the responsibility of the Police Authority to determine how to publish it. That amounts to inconsistency, and changing one word would clearly sort out the problem. I shall not labour the point but it is inaccurate to say that the Opposition are misunderstanding the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I submit. I was going to say that I would write to members of the Committee, but I will reconsider the problem and obtain a proper definition of the word ``submit''. It is hardly the subject of major debate, but if the provision needs to be changed, I am amenable to persuasion.
<P>
I believe that there has been a slight misunderstanding, but I shall reconsider the matter, and we may return to it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Until I heard the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire speak, I did not support the amendment. However, I now understand why he submitted such an amendment. The Minister suggested that he might amend the provision. Perhaps the word ``furnish'' would be appropriate. Other parts of the clause, as well as subsection (2), are clumsy.
<P>
Clause 48(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it appears to the Chief Constable that a report in compliance with subsection (3) would contain information which . . . in the public interest ought not to be disclosed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That it clumsy and ill defined. How does the Minister define,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``information which . . . in the public interest ought not to be disclosed''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that refer to what other legislation describes as national security matters, or does the phrase mean something else? The Chief Constable is expected to make decisions under ill defined provisions. I do not understand what the clause means by ``in the public interest''.
<P>
Clause 48(5)(b) is worrying. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it appears to the Chief Constable that a report in compliance with subsection (3) would contain information which--. . .<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) is not needed for the discharge of the functions of the Police Authority''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That provision is more than likely to put the Chief Constable in conflict with the Police Authority. It is not for the Chief Constable to decide that the Police Authority does not need information about any matter that relates specifically to policing, unless it is in the national interest not to reveal that information because it relates to intelligence or some sensitive issue that could endanger members of the public.
<P>
Ulster Unionist Members have not tabled an amendment on that matter. I have raised the issue merely for clarification. However, it is incumbent on the Minister to consider subsection (5)(b), in particular. I hope that he will do that. The legislation should not enshrine any encumbrance to the continuance of good working relationships between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.
<P>
I might have missed the point, but subsection (5) would enable the Chief Constable, when it was inconvenient or embarrassing, to make the excuse either that the Police Authority did not need such information to discharge its functions, or that the information was not in the public interest--without definition of those terms. Members of the public, and some elected representatives, would be extremely concerned if the Chief Constable were allowed such rights.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will respond positively and will suggest some amendments to the subsection, which is ill defined and clumsy in some respects.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The subsection is not ill defined or clumsy. It has been lifted straightforwardly from the 1970 Act and from section 22(5) of the Police Act 1996.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone raised the issue of which matters should not, in the public interest, be disclosed. There is a large amount of guidance, through the courts, about that and there is no need to provide more in the Bill. If the authority is holding the Chief Constable to account and is asking him for information, he may say that there are matters of public interest involved, so he is not obliged to disclose the information. He would refer the matter to the Secretary of State, as the clause specifies.
<P>
There is a clear body of legal opinion on those matters, to protect not only the public but those who undertake security duties in the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Will the Minister enlighten me further about the phrase ``in the public interest''? Is the public interest defined by precedent, in regulations, or in specific legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I should like to be able to enlighten the hon. Gentleman but I cannot cite all the legislation on those delicate and sensitive subjects off the top of my head. I will, however, write to the hon. Gentleman and other Members of the Committee to explain. The legal precedents relating to the matters referred to in subsection (5) have been clearly defined in the courts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone referred to in subsection (5)(b), which relates to information that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is not needed for the discharge of the functions of the Police Authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is well aware of the arguments about the operational independence of the Chief Constable. There might well be occasions when the Chief Constable believes that the Police Authority is acting outwith the powers that have been laid down by Parliament, and he must have some protection.
<P>
That brings us back to the point about the Chief Constable's not being a mere cipher of the Police Authority who simply does what it asks. If he has any doubts about reasons or motivation, or about the detail that he would have to provide and the implications of his providing it, he has the right to seek the protection of the ultimate authority in that context--the Secretary of State, who is accountable in turn to Parliament. That is a robust mechanism in the Bill for the protection of the operational independence of the Chief Constable. It also reflects the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 and section 22(5) of the Police Act 1996.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 48 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 49</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reports by Chief Constable to Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 24, line 16, after `(4)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `One month after he submits a report to the Police Authority under section 48(1)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 98, in page 24, line 16, leave out from `shall,' to `submit' in line 17.
<P>
No. 97, in page 24, line 18, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and arrange for it to be published in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My remarks on the amendments follow on from arguments about clauses 47 and 48. The matters are related. The submission of an annual report is one of the most important ways in which the Chief Constable is to be held accountable by the Police Authority for his actions and degree of effectiveness. It is, for the public, a demonstration of accountability. We have often said in Committee that the Police Authority purports to represent the views and opinions of the general public. It is surely important that the Chief Constable should be clearly perceived to report first and foremost to the Police Authority, and to be held to account in relation to the annual policing plan--the Police Authority's annual policing plan. The authority is to take ownership of that plan, albeit in consultation with the Chief Constable. He will have initiated it, submitted it in draft form and, under the Bill, taken amendments to it from the Police Authority. 
<P>
Let us consider the Chief Constable's annual report. Clause 48 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a general report on the policing of Northern Ireland during that year''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the report address some of the issues in the annual policing plan? I cannot see how the Chief Constable can issue an annual report without referring to the aims, objectives and requirements laid down in the policing plan. What would be the point of his report if it did not allude to what was laid down at the beginning of the year? Surely he should report on how matters have developed.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The public should see that the Chief Constable issues his report first to the Police Authority rather than simultaneously to the authority and the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 96 would interpose up to a month between submission to the Police Authority and to the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 97 would give the Chief Constable powers to arrange for that report to be published in an appropriate way, but there would be a time difference between its going to the Police Authority and to the Secretary of State.
<P>
Like the Opposition, the Police Authority believes that to be important. I make no bones about the fact that the authority proposed the amendment, as the Minister well knows. If he is going to accuse us yet again of misunderstanding the Bill, he will have to accuse the Police Authority, too. The authority feels that the amendment is important to public perception of its standing. The Chief Constable should transparently report to the authority first, before reporting to the Secretary of State.
<P>
Section 15(1) of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 says that the Chief Constable should submit a general report in writing to the Police Authority, which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall transmit that report or a copy thereof to the''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Secretary of State. There is a clear intention in existing legislation that the report should go first to the Police Authority, which should then hand it on to the Secretary of State. The report does not go simultaneously to each. The Bill is writing a change into Northern Ireland legislation. Does not the current system work? Why is the existing reporting system deemed unsatisfactory? Why change it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Clause 49 allows the Secretary of State to require the Chief Constable to produce reports on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``matters connected with the policing of Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It replaces, with some amendments, the provisions of section 15 of the 1970 Act. In principle, I do not quarrel with what clause 49 is intended to achieve. I see nothing wrong with it.
<P>
The Opposition's quarrel is not with the theme of the Clause or with subsection (1), which requires the Chief Constable to produce reports on demand, so to speak, from the Secretary of State; it is not with subsection (2), which deals with the report's format and the time scale within which it must be produced; it is not even with subsection (3), which deals with the report's publication; it is with subsection (4), which amendments Nos. 96, 98 and 97 would change.
<P>
We believe that a principle, which would be enacted by the amendments, is at stake, and that amendment No. 96 strikes at its heart. It returns us to the familiar ground of the relationship between the three parts of the tripartite structure--the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Police Authority--which we have discussed many times. We argue that the relationship between those three parts of the structure must be fair and balanced, and that failure to achieve fairness and balance would undermine the Bill. It is essential that no one part of the tripartite structure has undue influence over the other two.
<P>
The Minister will be aware from previous debates that we are concerned that the Secretary of State's functions are too great at certain key points in the Bill, and that the authority's and the Chief Constable's functions are correspondingly weakened. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire argued that the Chief Constable's annual report to the Police Authority should be precisely that--it should be his report, which he should give to the authority, and nothing should alter that situation. It is right and proper for the authority to be the first body to receive and to consider that report. If it were submitted at the same time to the Police Authority and to the Secretary of State, it would immediately cease to be the Chief Constable's report to the Police Authority.
<P>
I must give more emphasis than my hon. Friend did to the fact that if the report went at the same time to the Secretary of State and to the Police Authority it would be theoretically possible for the Secretary of State--advertently or inadvertently--to influence the authority's reaction, which would be wrong. In fulfilling its statutory obligations to secure an efficient and effective police service in Northern Ireland, the authority should, among other things, reach its own conclusions on the Chief Constable's annual report. It should not be influenced by the Secretary of State's perceived or known reactions. That is why I said that it would be wrong if the Secretary of State--advertently or inadvertently--made known her response to the Chief Constable's report, and thereby influenced the Police Authority's reaction. That would undermine the value of the Chief Constable's report and of the Police Authority's reaction to it.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 would redress the excessive powers and functions of the Secretary of State in one important respect. It would preserve the integrity of the Chief Constable's annual report and the integrity of the Police Authority's response to it.
<P>
Amendment No. 98 is consequential to amendment No. 96, and I do not believe that it requires any further explanation. Amendment No. 97, however, is not unimportant. It underlines the argument that the Chief Constable's report to the Police Authority is precisely that, by differentiating his annual report from other reports which may be required of him by the Secretary of State. According to subsection (3), the Secretary of State may dictate the manner in which those reports are to be published. That should not be so in the case of the Chief Constable's annual report: the Chief Constable should determine the manner in which that is to be published.
<P>
The amendments are important; they would help to ensure a fair and reasonable balance within the tripartite structure. I hope that the Government will acknowledge that and respond positively.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Cran (Beverley and Holderness):</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to make my first speech in this sitting of the Committee. I have decided to make only a small contribution to the debate--I see that the Minister looks as if he will welcome it--because my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke have articulated some of our main anxieties about the Bill. Those anxieties are about the relationship between the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State.
<P>
I was busy with my pen as I listened to the Minister speak to other amendments, but I was usefully employed. I recorded the Minister saying--I was so staggered that I did not catch whether he referred to himself or to his officials--that the Government had had a helpful meeting with representatives of the Police Authority. That implies that we are making progress--I and my hon. Friends are making contributions to the debate in the light of that progress--and I want to try to nudge the Government a bit further. If the Government listen more to the Police Authority, the Committee on the Administration of Justice and others, we will make progress with the Bill. Indeed, the Minister went further, saying--again I am not sure whether he referred to himself or to his officials--that he would undertake to speak to the Police Authority in relation to clause 47. On another occasion, the Minister spoke of consultation with the Police Authority.
<P>
The climate that the Government are operating in therefore seems to have changed. Until we exerted pressure on the Minister in debates on a number of other amendments, including this one, the Government were operating in a kind of fog. The Minister has been reading his brief well, but at last we have achieved some movement.
<P>
I shall explain my understanding of the clause, as that will give the Minister the opportunity to undermine my speech and force me to sit down if I have it completley wrong. Clause 49(1)--we had a great argument in a previous debate, when the Minister tripped me up by pointing out that I had mistaken the number 1 for the letter ``l'', but on this occasion the number 1 is correct--places a duty on the Chief Constable to provide a report to the Secretary of State on any matter connected to policing in Northern Ireland in a format requested by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman focus his comments on the amendment and not speak widely as on a clause stand part debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I immediately accept your ruling, Miss Widdecombe, which allows me to ask the Minister a legitimate question. You curtailed my reading from the Bill, but most Labour Members seem not to have read it and it may have been helpful for me to do so.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Section 15(2) of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 contains a similar provision, but no reference is made to format of report or time scale of submission. I am sure that you will agree, Miss Widdecombe, that that bears directly on the substance of the amendments. It would be useful for me, if for no one else, to be told why the Minister believes it is important for the report to be prescribed so tightly. The provision seems unduly restrictive, so will the Minister give his reasons for believing that to be necessary? It seems clear to me that it is not necessary. We need more flexibility, which is infinitely more important than restrictiveness, proscription and so on. I am sure you will agree, Miss Widdecombe, that I have not departed from being in Order.
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire moved the amendment he clearly and honestly said that it was inspired by the Police Authority. Throughout our proceedings we have tried to articulate the concerns of the Police Authority. If other elements of what the Minister refers to as the tripartite mechanism had spoken to us, we would have been happy to articulate their concerns also, not because we always agree with their points, but because we want the Minister to tell us the Government's intention.
<P>
I am not sure whether my hon. Friend said so, but the Police Authority in Northern Ireland told me that it considers the Chief Constable's annual report to be one of the most important ways in which he demonstrates his accountability and it is clear that that is so. Has anyone, anywhere, ever heard of annual reports being written but not submitted to the body to which, a priori, the authors are accountable? It is obvious that the Police Authority should want us to tease out from the Minister the reason for the provision. The productive meetings that we hope the Minister is having with the Police Authority and our probing may enable him to accept the points that have been made. It will be disappointing if he simply repeats, parrot fashion, the status quo in the Bill. We believe that there is a case to be answered. The role of the Authority should not be diminished by clause 49(4), which merely requires the Chief Constable to submit a copy of his report to the authority and to the Secretary of State at the same time. It is hardly surprising, in the light of what my hon. Friends and I have said, that we feel that the subsection needs to be amended.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke got close to--[Interruption.] It is difficult enough, Miss Widdecombe, to address hon. Members who have not read the Bill; it is even harder when one has to deal with heckling that has no bearing on the subject.
<P>
My hon. Friend got close to what is wrong with the Government's attitude. He said--I am sure that he will correct me if I am wrong, although I wrote down his words--that the Chief Constable's annual report will be undervalued. I believe that he is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Perhaps I may explain more fully. I think that the integrity of the report will be lost if it does not maintain the primacy, which it should rightly have, of being submitted to the Police Authority before it is sent anywhere else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I am grateful for that detail. I agree absolutely with my hon. Friend. The force of the argument is with him. I hope that the Minister will address his remarks and tell us what he thinks about our comments.
<P>
	The report will be undervalued. Its integrity will be far less than it otherwise would be, which should concern the Government and the Minister. On previous occasions, the Minister and his colleagues might have said that we were opposing for opposing's sake. I might have taken the same view when I sat on the Government Benches. But this concern is felt not just by the Opposition but by the Police Authority, which knows more about the administration of the police in Northern Ireland than any other body. Its views are of some substance and importance, and they deserve a detailed answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Does my hon. Friend go as far as I did in my argument? I believe that there is another dimension to the danger of the loss of integrity--the scope for the Police Authority's reaction and response to the Chief Constable's report to be influenced, advertently or inadvertently, by the Secretary of State, should she have early access to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Of course I agree with my hon. Friend, at the least to the extent of saying that the Minister should consider that possibility in his response. My hon. Friend makes a real point. We await the answer with considerable interest.
<P>
	There is more, however. My hon. Friends touched on this point, and I want to drive it well into the Minister's mind. Although I know your views on repetiton, Miss Widdecombe, it is important that he does not evade crucial questions. He needs to know our strength of feeling.
<P>
As my hon. Friend and I have argued, the Chief Constable's annual report will be devalued, or undervalued. Public perception of the Chief Constable and of the mechanism is important. The Chief Constable is not required to give the annual report to the Police Authority before it is sent to the Secretary of State. That is problematic; the public will wonder what is going on, and to whom the Chief Constable is accountable in respect of the annual report.
<P>
Moreover, although the Minister can--and shortly will--answer that, the question also arises of how people will respond to the Police Authority, and how members of the Police Authority will perceive their function. Why be a member of the Police Authority? They may not even see the Chief Constable's annual report before it is sent to the Secretary of State. They may wonder what their function is, and whether it is to be merely--to use a word that the Minister used in another context--a cipher. The Minister said that he was worried that the Chief Constable would become a cipher. Opposition Members would also worry about that contingency: of course the Chief Constable cannot be made a cipher. Equally, however, the Police Authority cannot be made a cipher. There is a delicate balance among the Police Authority's relative functions, their interaction and how they will be perceived by the wider world.
<P>
Opposition Members are worried. I am not practised in the workings of the police; I have never purported to be so. I suspect that you, Miss Widdecombe, know a great deal more than most of us. I do not. The clause seems to create something analogous to a company's board of directors, which is charged with sending an annual report--and in this case, accounts--to the shareholders.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Many conversations are now taking place among all hon. Members. It makes it difficult for me to hear the hon. Gentleman; it makes it almost impossible for Hansard. If hon. Members want to have discussions, they should do so outside, or so quietly that they do not disturb the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Thank you, Miss Widdecombe: even I became distracted, but carried on manfully as best I could.
<P>
Lest hon. Members did not hear what I said--and I doubt that they were listening--I should like to repeat the important point that I was making. The clause creates something analogous to a company's board of directors, which is charged with the responsibility of producing and agreeing an annual report for the shareholders. However, it does not produce the report, which is written by the chief executive, or the chairman, who thinks that what the members of the board think is unimportant. Naturally, however, he lets them see it. He drafts it, agrees it, issues it to the shareholders and simultaneously allows the board of directors a glance.
<P>
I am the first to agree with the Minister that the analogy is not absolute, if that was what he was going to argue. However, I wanted merely to show the Minister, using the realms of my experience, what he is doing and how ludicrous it is in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quoting the Police Authority extensively. Does the CAJ, which he has quoted extensively in the past, have any opinion on the matter, which may help us to understand it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I had forgotten that the CAJ has opinions on the matter. If the Minister had not jogged my mind, I would have forgotten about it and it would have gone--
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
