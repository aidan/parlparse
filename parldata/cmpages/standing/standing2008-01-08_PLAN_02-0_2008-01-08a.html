								Robert
Upton:
							</b>
						</i> Our thanks to the Committee for the invitation
to give oral evidence. I should explain that the Royal Town Planning
Institute exists to advance the art and science of planning and that
is, among other things, to promote good practice in planning and to
contribute to the formulation of policy and legislation. We have been
actively involved in discussing proposals for planning reform over
quite a few years now and we are broadly supportive of the proposals in
the Bill, but we have two major concerns, which I would like to flag up
at the beginning.</div>
					<a name="08010941000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first relates to the national policy statements and their role in the
new procedure that is proposed. As we see it, the whole system proposed
for development consents for major infrastructure projects depends
entirely on the adequacy of those national policy statements. In our
view, there are four tests that must be met there: clarity; consistency
with each other; credibility in terms of the evidence base in the
consultation; and the extent to which they manage to be location
specific, that is, that they give a sufficiently clear indication of
what is required so that impacts can reasonably be assessed. We think
that it is essential that the Infrastructure Planning Commission should
be required to make an annual report to Parliament on the adequacy of
the statements with which it is working, to give a suitable degree of
parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="08010941000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our second
major concern of principle relates to the provision under the Town and
Country Planning Act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>1990 for local member review bodies, which we see as a major breach of
the 1947 settlement, which separated the decision-taking from the
appeal
process.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08010941000465"></a>The

						<i class="I">

						</i> I think that I would want to know the
Secretary of State&#146;s intentions in terms of whether the entire
capture from a local plan-based tariff was to be kept locally or
whether there might be provision for some of it to be transferred for
regional or sub-regional infrastructure because I think that that is a
question that attracts a lot of interest. I think I would want to know
how the money was going to be
banked&#151;</div>

money would be disbursed. I think that I would want to know how this
would be seen as affecting the process of approving the plan&#151;the
local development framework&#151;because it becomes a very important
part of the local development framework and the extent to which that is
sound and
robust.</div>

the relationship between site-specific gains, through section 106, and
perhaps wider infrastructure gains? With site-specific gains, social
housing would probably be the classic
one.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Robert

through. My presumption at this stage, which has to come out of the

site-specific
issues.</div>

						</b> Finally, because we are rather time limited,
although I may catch the Chairman&#146;s eye again later, you said in
your national policy statements, with happy alliteration, that there
should be &#147;clarity, consistency, credibility&#148;&#151;but
then you could not find a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>&#147;c&#148; for the last one&#151;and that you hoped they were

the national policy statement is a planning permission, is it not? What
is left for this wonderful, great, huge quango to decide, if the
national planning statement says where the location of a development is
going to
be?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Robert
Upton:
							</b>
						</i> I think that the national policy statement
states an intention. We think that that intention should be as specific
as possible, so that there can be the most adequate consultation, but I
do not think that it amounts to a planning consent. There are questions
around what the IPC should be able to consider in seeking to determine
whether a development consent should be given. Should it be restricted
simply to the national policy statement or should it be in general
accordance with the national policy statement? To what extent should
the IPC have regard to all other national policy statements, to
planning policy statements and to local development
frameworks?</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): Mr.
Upton, you will be aware of the fact that in some planning systems
there is a qualified third-party right of appeal. In the paperwork that
you have submitted regarding this Bill, you have expressed concerns
that might arise from third-party communities and whether they would be
heard and so on. Are you satisfied that the conduct of
cross-examinations, as foreseen in the Bill, is going to deliver what
you are concerned about? Or is it going to impede hearing what third
parties have to
say?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Robert

						</i> There are two elements to that. First, we
broadly support the idea of the IPC taking an inquisitorial approach.
We think that that is right for the management of the process. We think
that it is important that the IPC should be required to hear anybody
and everybody who can demonstrate an
interest.</div>
					<a name="08010941000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I

consultation quite a bit. You say you prefer the inquisitorial to the
adversarial. Many local communities will want to be able to present
their views, but surely they will also want the opportunity to quiz
developers more closely about their proposals. How do you envisage that
that will work in an inquisitorial rather than adversarial

I can see the intellectual case for sticking with an adversarial
approach, but the danger is that adversarial approaches become
unmanageable in the end&#151;the process of inquiry loses its focus

forward proposals, should be required to give as much detail as
possible, and that those who have concerns should be able to express
them

							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): I should like
to pursue two issues with you. The first is that, while generally
supporting most of the Bill, you have come out strongly against local
member review bodies, which have generally been welcomed as part of
devolving responsibilities. Maybe it would do one or two of your
members out of a job to reduce the amount of work going to the planning
inspectorate, but nevertheless, why are members at the local level not
capable of making a final decision on the very smallest of planning
applications where a dispute arises about the initial decision made by
an
officer?</div>
					<a name="08010941000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Robert
Upton:
							</b>
						</i> May I first say that it is not the case
that they have been generally welcomed? As I
understand it, that provision is the one in the Bill that has attracted
the most hostility&#151;87 per cent. of consultation responses have
been opposed to it. The first point is one of principle and goes back
to what I called the 1947 settlement, under which it was accepted that
in return for having their rights over land possibly curtailed, people
should have a right of appeal to a body other than the body that took
the original decision. That principle has worked extremely well over
the years, and I cannot see any evidence to show why it should
change now.</div>
					<a name="08010941000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two main parts to
clause 150, which brings this measure in: the first is the ability of
the Secretary of State to designate what should go to elected member
review bodies, and the second is his or her ability to specify what
decisions might be taken under delegated powers by officers. That is a
good thing, which may well increase the speed and efficiency of the
process in the case of some less efficient local authorities or local
planning authorities, but the concomitant of that is that the public
require the reassurance that their appeal will not be heard&#151;as
Mr. Curry says, I had the honour to be the chief executive
of a very good local authority, but even in very good local
authorities, there are dynamics that would reduce the public perception
of the safety of the system.</div>

taking a bit of democracy away and giving decisions to officers is a
good thing, while putting a bit of democracy back in and giving more
responsibility to members is a bad thing, but that would perhaps be
unfair. However, let us say that the local member review body comprised
councillors from neighbouring authorities, not the authority for which
the officers who took the original decision worked. Would that not get
around the objection that you have made?</div>

						</i> I think that that is perhaps a question that
you might address more fruitfully to Ministers than to me, because I
have very limited influence here. However, as I understand it, the
Government&#146;s concern is to achieve not only a body that is seen
as entirely free standing and which has a range of expertise, some of
which may well come from the ranks of the inspectorate, which has a
great deal of expertise to offer, but a body that is seen as being
focused on all the major infrastructure decisions, as opposed to the
vast generality of cases, which run very effectively through the
planning inspectorate. That is the distinction. However, you should
perhaps put that more firmly to the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="08010941000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is one other point that I
would like to make on behalf of the institute. I would like to
emphasise the significance of the national planning statements, rather
than the mechanism by which the development consents are decided
downstream. What gives us the chance to move forward in a big way is
the requirement that there should be clarity and transparency about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>what is proposed and that the community, including the business
community, has the chance to be engaged in it. That is potentially very

suppose that that not only achieves those objectives, as you rightly
say, but prevents re-runs of the terminal 5 situation, in which
national policy considerations are mixed up with the individual site
inquiry. That is why I was interested in your final two points. You say
that the national policy statement must be credible in terms of the
evidence base, but it also must be as location specific as possible. If
it is to be location specific, how will you have robust and credible
testing of the evidence base without allowing the parties interested in
the identified site the right to appear before and be heard by the body
that decides the national policy statement? Shall we grasp that
nettle?</div>

						</i> First, I think that national policy statements
will vary quite considerably in kind. When it comes to discussions
about airports, it is quite hard to imagine hypothetical airports. We
by and large know where they are or where they might be. When you are
talking about wind farms, I think that it is unreasonable to expect the
national policy statement to say exactly where 150 wind farms in East
Anglia will or will not go; that just will not happen. There is a big
difference, but to the extent that national policy statements are more
locationally specific and should be more locationally specific, the
consultation on those national policy statements should indeed engage
with the communities
concerned.</div>

very interested in the comments that you made about the importance of

engagement in advance. Planning officials within the Government have
traditionally taken the view that an application should be considered
without regard to who is the applicant. You referred a moment ago to
wind farms. It seems to many of us that there is a case for engagement
and even ownership of the application by the local
community&#151;wind farm developments are a classic example of
this&#151;being a relevant consideration to be included in the

it would be almost perverse to rule out of a plan-based tariff the

						</b> I shall come on to an issue that
I raised this morning with the representatives of the CBI, who
commented on it. Essentially, the skills that your planning officers
have relate to looking at the types, nature and appropriateness of
development and the nature of the charge that we are perhaps getting
towards, and the community infrastructure levy would look at those
sorts of issues in determining the charge for particular schemes. One
aspect, however, that is in the Bill and can be considered when
determining the nature or size of the levy is the uplift in valuation
that arises when value on the site is increased. Would you have
concerns about that criterion being used to calculate the levy and
would that cause concerns for planners as it is not a skill they
normally have in their
locker?</div>

						</i> With respect, the members of my institution
have many skills covering a wide range of issues and are not limited to
the ones that you set out, and there are certainly some who would be
very competent at looking them. The point, however, is that clause
163(2) refers to the increase in the value due to the permission for
development, and we are not convinced that that is necessary or is an
issue of value. We think that it is theoretically possible that someone
might wish to carry out a form of development that was perceived to
reduce the value of the land, but in doing so might raise an
infrastructure requirement, and we do not see why they should not
contribute to
that.</div>

taking to try to establish some sort of common

						</i> The whole process starts with having a
valid local development framework. There have been a number of
difficulties for councils getting their LDFs through. One of the things
we have lobbied the Government about is simplifying the process. Part
of the Bill seeks to tackle that. Through that process you should as a
local area be able to come up with an agreed vision of the community
infrastructure needs. That will vary from area to area. We are keen
that there should be maximum flexibility for councils
and communities to define their infrastructure needs. It might be
crèches, cycle paths or combined heat and power plants. We
should not be prescriptive in the Bill or in guidance as to what that
should be. That requirement should then be partly funded through this
levy. That is how it should work. Yes, I believe that councils have the
capacity to come up with an agreed statement of needs for their local
community. That is at the heart of what councils can and should be able
to do.</div>
					<a name="08010941000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
point of your question and whether we see some kind of competition
between authorities, the development decision to invest in an area and
to seek to develop to build is subject to a whole range of economic and
market factors. It could be that in time the demands of a community
levy would become a material factor, but I doubt whether it would
become such a factor as to outweigh all of the other things such as
land values, complexity of development and the reputation of the
planning authority as to have a significant and material
impact.</div>

sitting, so I heard your Craven example. Councils are coming together
now in sub-regional partnerships. They are coming together in
multi-area agreements and through those are defining what kind of
infrastructure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>is needed for their areas, particularly to do with transport, but also
on skills development, economic development and housing. I think that
it is entirely reasonable that councils that have come together in that
way can agree among themselves to devote a small portion of the levy
towards meeting those wider sub-regional
needs.</div>

						</b> Can I move on to the national policy statements and
the IPC? One of the things that concerns me greatly is the degree of
consultation that is needed with the national policy statements and the
IPC. I wonder whether the Local Government Association has a view on
how consultation should be carried out on the development of the
national policy statement. A slightly different issue&#151;I am
running the two together&#151;is how the planning commission should
hear the views of local

								Sir

						</i> This goes to the point that I made in
my introductory statement about ensuring that there are safeguards to
ensure that local views are heard in the new process. The LGA believes
that there are one or two mechanisms that would help that could be
introduced by amending the Bill. First, on the national policy
statement, the Secretary of State should be required to commission and
pay for a statement of local community impact, particularly when it
comes to allocating a project to a different part of the country. That
would be one safeguard. Secondly, when you have a scheme that is going
through the commission, the commission should be required to pay for a
statement of local views and impact. That would allow the local
authority to pull together local opinion and local consultation and
present it to the commission. There should be a requirement for those
views to be taken into account through the probing and questioning that
the commission undertakes on the specific
application.</div>

direction is to get away from that. Nevertheless, it is important and
necessary that the views that are expressed are tested properly in the
hearing. I am sure that a commission, if it was adequately resourced
and had the capacity, could undertake that role. We would be very keen
to ensure that the issues thrown up by the statement of community
impact were tested in that forum. That is extremely
important.</div>

Yes, that sometimes takes slightly longer, but it is likely to lead to
a better outcome. The LGA would be opposed to having percentage
thresholds, with so much going to the sub-region and so much staying
locally. I think it has got to be done through negotiation with the

there should be a separation between decision taking and the appeal

						</i> I did not hear the RTPI evidence, but I
know that it is hostile to politicians getting involved in planning
matters. Local member review boards are the right mechanism. It is
ridiculous to assume that councillors are qualified to take decisions
on very complex major developments but not competent to take decisions
on minor planning matters that had been delegated to officers on which
there is an appeal. So there is no issue there about the skills or
capacity of elected councillors to do the
job.</div>
					<a name="08010941000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept
that councils would automatically rubber-stamp the decisions that had
been taken by officers. That is not the experience of how planning
committees work. Councillors operate pretty independently. I think that
they would be quite capable of assessing the evidence that was put
before them by the appellant and of taking a de novo decision on
whether the right initial decision had been taken. That has more
legitimacy than having a planning inspector from Bristol come in and
seek to take a decision without any real knowledge of local
context.</div>

that it should be confined to matters of national

would come before the commission is Highways Act trunk road schemes. If
you were building a trunk road to link a new port, it would clearly be
part of that application, but trunk roads per se are not matters of
national economic importance; they are quite suitable for being
determined by local planning authorities. It is a nonsense, in our

the process starts. Going back to what we were discussing earlier, the
opportunity to have a similar sort of process to that which we have in
appeals, where the local authority and the applicant can agree on what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>they agree on and therefore decide what they disagree on, before the
commission undertakes its process, is one which should not be missed.

effective councils must have an opportunity to conduct a
cross-examination of evidence from other parties or to require the
commission to take that into account in its own cross-examination. It
is the specific use of &#147;cross-examination&#148; that interests
me. In some cases, that is the best and most robust means of testing
the evidence, provided that it is kept within bounds in the way that we

infrastructure levy and paragraph 5.2 in your submission, to which
David Curry referred earlier, my understanding is that you are
generally supportive of the proposals. I am trying to get my head
around why you say that the Bill should be amended to provide councils
with the power to define local infrastructure requirements, with
discretion over how and when CIL funds are used. I thought that that
was essentially what the Bill did, and I wondered whether I was missing
something if you thought that it needed amending.</div>

						</i> The references to
community infrastructure levy in the Bill are pretty sketchy because
they are to be expanded through secondary legislation, guidance and
various other things. It is therefore not very clear at the moment, and
we are seeking to put down markers as the Bill progresses. The
intention always was that it should be developed as the Bill
progresses, so that we can ensure that those things happen&#151;in
other words, that councils are at the centre of determining what the
needs are, and that there is flexibility and so on.</div>
					<a name="08010941000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scenario that I favour is
one where the councils, through their LDFs, come up with a statement of
need. A range of other interested parties will feed into that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>process to ensure that the LDF takes account of their needs, and
passenger transport authorities would be one of those. I see them
feeding in through the LDF.</div>

						</b> May I ask you about the proposals, for want of a
better word, to &#147;streamline&#148; the local development
framework? Some people are concerned that taking away some of the
requirements that local authorities currently have to pursue would
weaken the requirements on sustainability. Others would argue that the
measures are necessary because, to date, LDFs have not gone as quickly
through the process as was envisaged. Indeed, many authorities still do
not have them in place&#151;and some of those probably did not have a
unitary development plan in place beforehand.</div>

						</i> The reason why LDFs have become so log-jammed
is interesting. Depending on who you speak to, you could apportion
blame in various ways. However, I think that everyone agrees that the
process is far too complex at the moment. One of the things that it
completely fails to do, in my view, is to engage the public, yet that
is so critical to communities. However, it is a very technical subject.
I looked at the consultation being put out by my authority for our LDF,
and the truth of the matter is that nobody other than highly trained
experts would be capable of responding to it. It is not because we are
particularly jargon-prone&#151;no more so than any other council. It
is because the requirements set out in the legislation are so demanding
and complicated. By simplifying that, we will start to make
progress.</div>
					<a name="08010941000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a
meeting, on behalf of the LGA, with the housing and planning Minister
at which we agreed to conduct a no-blame review as to why it was that
of 40-odd LDFs that had been presented, only nine got through the
process. The others had been either rejected or withdrawn. There is a
variety of reasons, but it is clear that unless we get that process
working smoothly, the whole of the rest of the planning system will
fall, because everything is founded on
that.</div>

say that we are looking to the planning system to deliver more and more
social benefits, and quite properly, possibly, social benefits from
affordable housing to sustainability. The latest iteration is national
security. The more you require the planning system to deliver, the more
complex you make it and the slower development then becomes. You also
risk choking off some development. There is nothing specific in the

to pitch it in a way that optimises the amount of development you get.
At the moment we debate endlessly what is the right target for
affordable housing to have in your planning policy&#151;what

clear understanding of the point at which it becomes uneconomic for a

think that if we are looking at a much larger number of developments,
involving a different scale of development as well, then the issue of
unified consent becomes more difficult, because it is affecting a much
broader array of schemes, some of which will, by their very nature, be
of much more local interest where those other consents would normally
kick in, rather than being of national interest. It comes back to the

						</i> The important thing is to start from first
principles. The proposals for the IPC include a wide range of both
pre-application and post-application processes. One should not simply
restrict oneself to looking at the inquiry. The expertise of the
Planning Inspectorate has been in managing major inquiries, which is
part of that decision-making process. The IPC proposals are a much
wider process because they involve some proposals particularly around
the application and pre-application process. For example, in response
to comments made by Jacqui Lait, if I may refer to that, there is a
clause that requires the applicant, under a duty to consult, to carry
out consultation processes. One of the things that the commission can
do is to give guidance on the extent of the consultation that is
required to ensure that you start off by flushing out the issues that
will be of concern to local people. This is not an assumption that by
consulting you get consensus, but that on the basis of consulting it is
clear to the community exactly what is being
proposed.</div>

					<a name="08010941000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the
application has been brought to the commission, it has a range of
different mechanisms by which that application can then be considered.
Early procedural meetings and early discussions with parties to try to
flush out what the issues are that need to be tested and explored are
very much part of an inquisitorial process. The inquisitorial process
does not simply mean the commissioners sitting in a room like this and
asking questions of people sitting around the table. It is a much more
involved process. It is about how you get to the point of the
application and the identification of what the issues may be once it is
being examined&#151;flushing them out early and allowing people to
exchange views through the early exchange of written representations to
draw out the issues. Then the commissioners with their expertise test
and explore and, as the Bill allows, offer the opportunity for
cross-examination as and when it is necessary and appropriate. All of
this is allowed for in the
Bill.</div>

barrier between the decision maker and the constituent. They are
designed to avoid the constituent getting to the inquiry process with
inadequate knowledge and understanding of what the commission is
seeking to do. I had a good example of this in an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>inquiry that I held some years ago where there was a great deal of
opposition. I held an open-floor session, much as is proposed here, and
as a result the local community had a much better understanding of what
the proposal was. Had that been done before the application was
submitted, many of the fears of that local community would have been
addressed through their ability to discuss with the promoters exactly
what was proposed. Clearly there still needs to be an opportunity for

&#147;statutory underpinning&#148;. There is a need to ensure that
everyone understands the process from the start. While there is
discretion to do much of what Leonora has described at the moment, the
new Bill provides that statutory underpinning. The other issue is that,
as I said at the beginning, the planning inspectorate is there to work
on behalf of&#151;and, for transferred appeals, to stand in the shoes
of&#151;the Secretary of State. We are not independent decision

						</i> The planning inspectorate
has evolved procedures over time, and a number of the procedures that
we use are more akin to an inquisitorial process, for example, the
hearings that we hold. About 19 per cent. of our cases are done by
hearing. The examination processes that have been evolved for the
development plan&#151;both regional special strategies and
development plan documents&#151;are based on an inquisitorial
process. The 2005 legislation on town and country planning, which only
relates to planning proposals and not to most of the proposals covered
by the Bill, is still based primarily on an adversarial process.
Stansted G1 was done within the spirit of the 2005 rules, and involved
more inquisitorial-type procedures. Planning inspectors certainly have
the expertise to operate within an adversarial and, indeed, a more
inquisitorial type of process.</div>

discussions. I should correct myself slightly so as to not give the
impression that the only distinction is the independence of decision

DCLG, we have looked at the model that is currently in force at An Bord
Pleanala, the Irish equivalent of the planning inspectorate. An Bord
Pleanala, however, is already an independent body, and therefore had an
extra wing put on to it to deal with this kind of major infrastructure

						</b> Finally, I want to ask you about the consumer
infrastructure levy. Concerns have been expressed about the problems
that might occur if the levy is levied at too high a level by the
developer. It could stop a developer full-stop, and there is no
effective right of appeal in the proposals, as they stand, if the
development scheme comes to a stop because of that. The British
Property Federation, which we will come to later with the House
Builders Federation, will propose some sort of right appeal against the
level of the levy. Have you given any consideration to that and how it
might operate as far as the inspector is
concerned?</div>

need to go back to the process by which the levy was initially
produced, or defined. I am aware that the

arrangements for identifying what the levy should be are still under
discussion.</div>
					<a name="08010941000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you
get the right sort of consultation arrangements for the definition of
the levy in the first place, the issue of whether that levy is too high
should not arise. It may well be much like current policy&#151;for
example, with affordable housing&#151;in which one issue can be the
viability of the development at a certain level of provision.
Sometimes, there is a negotiation between the parties, whether it be
the local authority and the developer or, ultimately, through an appeal
process, to decide whether there may be an exception to a policy to
allow a development to proceed because that development should proceed
in the public interest, without necessarily making the contribution
that is expected by the policy. I shall put that in simple terms, as it
sounded unbelievably complicated. If you have a CIL, the viability of
which was prejudiced in a particular development, but there were other
public interest reasons why that development should go ahead, one
could, conceivably, allow that development as an exception to that
policy.</div>

						</b> A few minutes ago, Ms Sporle mentioned that it was
very important that people come to understand the new processes. Part
of that process will involve a potential developer/promoter having to
take on board the views of those who oppose his or her application. How
confident are we that that developer will act in good faith and pass on
the views properly articulated in the process? It seems to me that
there is a basic conflict of interest between a developer and/or
third-party and/or person affected who might object to a development.
How confident are we that that developer will relay those feelings
adequately? Let me short-circuit my question with these comments. I am
sure that other Members present have had a similar experience: as a
group, the mobile phone industry is not exactly clean in this regard,
and I wonder whether commercial interests will outweigh the need to be

say that where there are disputes&#151;it is necessary to hear
disputes such as those we hear currently on appeal, which may well
affect telecommunications or wind farms&#151;the process must be
robust and the evidence that is being examined must be robustly tested.
The way to do that is to be inquisitorial if you do not think that all
the issues have come to the table, and/or to allow cross-examination
and/or to ensure that people can be heard. Whichever is appropriate, it
is the process that must allow for robust testing, so that in the event
that any party has been economical with the truth or whatever, it can
be exposed. That is the purpose of a robust testing of evidence at
cross-examination, whether at a hearing, an inquiry or an independent
examination.</div>

various duties that have been placed on promoters. Under clause 42,
headed &#147;Duty to consult local community&#148;, the proponent
would first have to identify how it is going to be done, and then do
it. Secondly, the commission would have the power to reject an
application if it did not consider that the promoter had carried out
proper consultation. A further safeguard is the role of the local
authority, because it is one of the parties that has to be consulted.
The local authority would have a role in representing the views of its

inadequacies that it became aware in the consultation
processes.</div>

have a small number of specially skilled inspectors who deal with the

23,000 appeals that we deal with annually are, by and large, town and

						</i> On behalf of the Home Builders Federation,
we want at a high level to welcome the Bill, which we think is helpful
in a broad sense for the major housing issues that we face as a
country, to both increase supply and, from our perspective, meet the
extremely challenging objective of building to a zero-carbon standard
from 2016 onwards. The general objectives of the Bill are helpful in
that respect, and we support the objective of improving the speed,
efficiency and effectiveness of decision making on national
infrastructure because that will be broadly helpful with regard to
spatial planning in achieving housing objectives as well.</div>
					<a name="08010941000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">We particularly welcome the
fact that we are going to have a process for developing legitimate,
properly consulted-on national policy statements. However, from our
perspective there are two main areas on which we want to focus today.
First, it is perhaps useful to say for the benefit of the Committee
that the community infrastructure levy in many ways reflects comments
that we made to the Government in the run up to the preparation of the
Bill about the best approach to be taken to achieve a suitable
contribution from development towards infrastructure requirements to
support that development.</div>
					<a name="08010941000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are particularly keen on the
fact that this is based on a localised approach that we believe will
help to produce a positive climate for development and a sense of
discussion among the partners. There are, however, a number of material
points that we would like to raise about it, so I shall hand over to
Stephen in a second. Briefly, we would like to say that the aspects of
the Bill that relate to the town and country planning system are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>also very important from our point of view, and there are a number of
issues there that we would like to go into if we have time.</div>

						</i> The British Property Federation welcomes
the Planning Bill as a whole and the efforts that it is making to speed
up the planning system. We particularly welcome the proposals on
national policy statements and hope that that will achieve the swifter
delivery of major infrastructure schemes and assist the development of
major infrastructure projects that are necessary to support
development, which is the life blood of the British Property
Federation&#146;s membership. We have concentrated in our memorandum
and in our comments to the Committee on the community infrastructure
levy. We support it in general terms, but with four key points. First,
we believe that it must be locally based. Secondly, it can be locally
based by ensuring that it comes through the local development framework
system, and we would look for clarity in the Bill to be sure that that
is the case. Thirdly, we would ensure that it was dealt with alongside
and as part of a planning application process. That is a well-tried,
tested and trusted mechanism, so that appeal mechanisms of the sort
that you discussed with the Planning Inspectorate can be used to
resolve final issues about the incidence of the levy. Finally, some
clauses in the Bill refer to the infrastructure levy being dealt with
on the basis of increases in value. We think that those are slightly
misleading in the way that they approach the infrastructure levy, and
we would look for those provisions to be
removed.</div>

The Milton Keynes roof tax, as it is called, is &#163;18,000 per

that suits the infrastructure being provided for the level of
development taking place at Milton Keynes. I am not suggesting that you
could pick up that calculation and put it in Ripon. Ripon will need to
undertake its own calculation, based on its land values, the level of
development and its own infrastructure needs. It will have to discuss

infrastructure plan, which local authorities are obliged to do in any
event. They would then cost that infrastructure plan and find out where
else they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>were going to get contributions from. As you rightly say, the CIL is not
there as a substitute for funding from other sources, but in addition
to them. Therefore, they would take that away from the amount of
infrastructure that they require. That gives them a residual amount.
They would then need to make an assessment of whether that residual
amount is affordable within the local market. If it is not, something
has got to give. We have to prioritise; otherwise you will get no

pedigree behind it because a need has been identified for a transport
infrastructure to serve Kent Thameside, with a bill of about
&#163;160 million. That has gone to the DCLG and the Highways Agency,
saying that they have to make a significant contribution, leaving a
balance that is being looked for from the development community and
other sources, including existing sources of public
funding.</div>
					<a name="08010941000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
consultation with the development community, landowners in the area and
other public agencies, a view is being taken about what is generally
affordable. That is a relatively subjective exercise and there is a lot
of debate about whether it should be &#163;3,000, &#163;4,000,
&#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000. That debate is now playing out in a
supplementary planning document that is being promoted by each of the
local authorities in the area. They are listening to the consultation
and I suspect that over the next two or three months they will reach a
conclusion about the level of the charge. In the meantime&#151;this
is quite an important transitionary point for the Bill as a
whole&#151;a number of developers have already started paying at the
level of &#163;5,000 per house. Land Securities has signed an
agreement that will make a &#163;40 million contribution to that
infrastructure.</div>

that why you are now getting alarmed at the use of the word

it a fundamental stumbling block. We just think that it is a mistake.
It is clear that the Government have abandoned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>the planning gains supplement, which as you say was based on two
calculations of value for every development in the country.
Calculations of value are complex and subject to a lot of disagreement.
We thought that that process was fundamentally flawed in its
application.</div>
					<a name="08010941000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process that the Government have announced is similar to the one that
we promoted. Instead of being based on value, it is based on an
assessment of infrastructure needs and their affordability across a
local authority area. We were therefore surprised to see reference to
value in the Bill. Affordability and viability are important. We have
just had a short debate about that, but that is very different from
saying that the CIL is based on securing a certain proportion of value;
it is not. It is based on assessing the requirements for infrastructure
in an area, seeing what element of that needs to be raised from the
development that is planned and sharing that cost against development.
There are references to value in the Bill that we think are unhelpful.
Among our members and others in the property industry, that has caused
concern that the planning gains supplement is not
dead.</div>

						</i> Maybe I can add to that.
The key question is workability and the concern about references to
changes in land value in relation to planning gain supplement&#151;it
was, as much as anything, that a lot of experts looked at it and found
that it would be very hard to operate in practice. The issues about PGS
were much wider than
that.</div>
					<a name="08010941000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the other
key aspects that we were collectively concerned about, as developers,
was the weakening of the link between development and the local
provision of infrastructure. We particularly want to stress today the
value of the levy from the point of view of hopefully strengthening
that local connection, having a proper assessment and buy-in to what is
needed to support development in an area, and, as a result of that,
making more things happen rather than less. But it is critical
technically that the basis on which the levy is assessed stems, as we
have said, initially from the identification of needs according to a
legitimate process, and then one works towards viability. We are
concerned that the references in the Bill to value may, at best, be
confusing and, at worst, could introduce complications into the
process. We would like a clearer understanding of how the mechanism of
setting the community infrastructure levy would work in practice. It is
important, from our point of view, that we get that emphasis right in
the enabling provisions of the
Bill.</div>

						</b> May I just lead on to some references you have made
to the relationship between the levy and section 10, which will still
be around? You referred, in paragraph 2.11 of your submission, to the
fact that we ought to be able to define one set of infrastructure
demands, which will be done under section 106, and another that would
be done under the levy, and that there should not be a
&#147;creep&#148; between the two. Is that not realistically
impossible? There will be the odd bit of road linking a development to
a major highway, which might well be pertinent to section 106, as being
very specifically part of that scheme, but there will be a
need for a wider contribution from a number of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>developments to other more significant transport improvements that are
necessary because of the general development of an
area.</div>
					<a name="08010941000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, you go on
in paragraph 2.13 to state that developers might elect to have elements
of the infrastructure provided through section 106 and that that should
be offset against the CIL, then in paragraph 2.19 you discuss the fact
that the CIL might simplify arrangements because it would mean that
there would be less need for agreements under section 106. Is there not
some confusion in what you are saying
there?</div>

						</i> The question comes in
three separate parts. There is a question about whether a bright,
shining line can be drawn between infrastructure that will be subject
to the CIL and infrastructure that will be dealt with under
site-specific agreement. You are right if you are treating it as an
absolute question. There will always be a blurred boundary. We think
that that can be dealt with in a number of ways. If the nature of
infrastructure that can be subject to CIL is identified in the Act, as
it goes forward, that makes very clear what a subsequent section 106
agreement cannot comprise, so you start to get a demarcation between
the two which is able to be
policed.</div>
					<a name="08010941000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">You then move
on to the question of offsetting. Offsetting works in practice; that is
the simple response to that. In Milton Keynes, with each of the
agreements that has gone forward on a site-specific basis, the
developers have said, &#147;We will deliver that piece of
infrastructure. This is the cost of delivering it and we will set it
off against our future payments of tariff.&#148; Identical
arrangements are working in the London Thames Gateway, for example. So
offsetting for identified pieces of infrastructure that have been
costed does work in
practice.</div>
					<a name="08010941000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to simplifying it: yes, absolutely you can simplify it, because if
there is a CIL requirement, a condition imposed from planning consent
that says, &#147;Pay x before you build&#148; is very easy and
simple to police and it will avoid a lot of the issues that arise in
negotiations at the moment. It does, I accept, get more complex if the
developer is delivering some pieces of infrastructure, but I promise
you that it will be far simpler to deal with that, and has been far
easier to do so in Milton Keynes in the context of the simple offset
provisions, when you compare it with the sort of approach that is
adopted in the normal negotiated planning
agreement.</div>

infrastructure costs. Those costs were between &#163;25,000 and

likely to be paid by the developer. It is associated with the grant of
planning permission being secured through a condition or a standard

LDF process, and one advantage relative to PGS, is that it would be
relatively straightforward to work out your likely liability to CIL
before you go through the planning process, or even before you buy the

Mr. Rhodes&#146;s answer deals adequately with the point.
If it does not, you need to expand slightly on what it is that you are
getting at. I do not see that it makes any difference whether one
builds leasehold or freehold properties. A development that has
planning consent is liable for a CIL payment, just as it would be at
the moment if a section 106 contribution had been agreed. How it is
paid for&#151;where the value comes from or where it is derived
from&#151;is up to the developer, who will have to come to some deal
with the landowner about where it will come from. There are only two
ways that we make money in land development. One is land value, and the
other is development profit. We will continue to make development
profit. Otherwise, we will not

106. The whole point of CIL is to take away some of that obligation
under section 106, although we think that overall CIL will be able to
raise more money than we currently get under section 106 because it
will apply to more schemes, not because it will raise more on each
individual scheme. We see that as an offset. Do not forget that we are

for affordable housing will remain. Indeed, the industry is currently
being berated for building too many small units and not providing
enough affordable houses or larger-type units. This environment of
strategic housing market assessment, strategic housing land
availability assessment, the local development framework and the
local development documents is still there and still forms the basis of
the policy stance against which we should be assessing all these
things.</div>

trying, via CIL, to provide a much more efficient,
transparent and quick methodology for making the contributions that we
are already making under section 106 agreements, but because that
system is complex it takes a long time and we have to repeat a lot of
work, time after time, and we are trying to simplify that process. It
is not as if we are operating in a

						</i> I am happy to add to that. One of the
clauses that is potentially missing from the Bill is
one dealing with the delivery of infrastructure. There is a useful
provision that makes it quite clear that the levy that is raised must
be applied to certain infrastructure, but there is no mechanism for
ensuring that the multiple bodies that are required to deliver
infrastructure co-operate in delivering the infrastructure for which
payment is being made. Trying to ensure that the health trusts,
education authorities and everybody else delivers the infrastructure in
accordance with the infrastructure plan is a missing element of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08010941000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">To date,
developers have been willing to sign up and make payments on the basis
of promises from the local authorities&#151;from the Milton Keynes
Partnership, for example&#151;that the infrastructure will be
provided. To a large extent, they have taken a leap of faith in
relation to that because all that they are getting back at the moment
are reasonable-endeavours obligations to deliver infrastructure. At the
moment, there is trust that that infrastructure will be delivered. The
next few years are critical to make sure that that trust is
repaid.</div>

						</i> There are two issues. You have heard us say
that we are keen that this should operate through the LDF process.
Draft PPS 12, which is out to consultation, already goes quite a long
way to explaining that a local authority will have to produce an
infrastructure plan and a delivery plan that goes with that. The LDF
will not be regarded as sound and capable of being adopted unless there
is a delivery plan that persuades the inspector conducting the
examination, whose recommendations are binding on the planning
authority, that if the money is raised through the CIL policies it will
be spent. For that and lots of other reasons, we regard the LDF process
as a protection whereby we will not be paying money that simply sits in
a bank
account.</div>

hassle a little while ago of having the planning-gain enabling Act. You
yourself expressed concerns, because there appears to be some ambiguity
in the Bill&#151;it opens the possibility of the levy having some
relationship to increase in value. Would these provisions not knock
that on the head, both by addressing the matter in the Bill and by
making sure that the Government were not given this other
instrument?</div>

						</i> Yes, that would be an easy way to approach
it. We have not promoted that. What we have promoted are changes to the
clauses that make it clear how the system is intended to work. So, the
deletion of reference to &#147;value&#148; was important, but even
more important to us than that is ensuring that the clauses take the
opportunity, which they do not at the moment, to explain that this is
going to operate through the planning system. There are three specific
clauses&#151;163, 166 and 167&#151;where the option could be taken
to say CIL will be raised through the LDF process. We do not understand
why that is not in the Bill at the moment. It is the only sensible way
in which local communities can engage in this, in which the property
industry can have confidence that the CIL is going to be properly
raised, and in which there is independent
examination.</div>
					<a name="08010941000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
the LDF process you would create CIL policies. You will then have a
planning system that creates a presumption in favour of any policies in
the plan, and we have an application process and an appeal process
already in place, through the planning system, in which the industry
has confidence. As long as that is the way in which CIL is intended to
be developed, then we are happy to contribute our views to try and make

<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>that work as best we can. In so far as there is any residual concern
that it may be a different system, then we do have concerns. For
instance, there are two references in the clauses to an appeals process
being established for CIL. We would like to see those deleted from the
Bill. We do not understand the need for a separate appeals process.
There is a more than adequate planning appeals process already in
existence.</div>

Betts:
						</b> The last point that you make on this issue in your
submission is about the right of appeal. You are almost proposing a
separate right of appeal, if there is a concern about the viability of
a project because of the amount of the levy that is going to be
charged. I have just asked the people from the Planning Inspectorate
whether they believed that that could be subsumed into the normal
planning process and be a matter for an appeal that could be taken in
the normal course of events. Would you be satisfied with that or do you
still have real concerns over this
issue?</div>

Rhodes:

						</i> I think that we may not have explained
ourselves properly if you have got an impression that we are seeking a
separate appeals process. We are looking for CIL to be embedded in the
LDFs, so that there is a policy that requires the CIL to be paid.
Planning application is then made, and lots of considerations are taken
into account, but it may be that in certain cases a developer argues
that he cannot afford to pay CIL. The local authority may take the view
that that is then contrary to the LDF. Planning permission is refused
and there is an appeals process to the Planning Inspectorate&#151;the
existing appeals process&#151;which allows an appeal to be considered
on the basis, which, as Leonara Rozee, I think, confirmed, works in
exactly the same way in relation to social housing policies. The
developer makes an argument that he cannot afford to meet the full
requirement for affordable housing. Planning consent could be refused
on that basis, if the planning authority is not convinced. That
decision can then be appealed to the Planning Inspectorate. It is a
simple, straightforward planning appeal. The Planning Inspectorate then
has to ask itself a question: are the merits of this development,
without sufficient affordable housing to meet the policies, sufficient
to outweigh the objection that there is not enough affordable housing
in accordance with the policy, should planning consent be granted? We
think that CIL can operate in exactly the same way. If it becomes a
policy of the development plan, it can be dealt with through the
planning appeals
process.</div>

						</b> You may have partly answered this question. You
will be aware that the Government recently identified the need to build
thousands of houses, particularly affordable houses, throughout various
parts of the UK, especially for first-time buyers. Can I therefore ask
whether there is any tangible evidence that, if this levy is
implemented, it will impact in any way on the ambitious plan that the
Government have for building significant numbers of new
homes?</div>

						</i> I probably need to come back to the point
I made a few minutes ago about avoiding the zero-sum game view of this.
It is undoubtedly true that, when you look at this in the round, what
local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>authorities will need to do&#151;and they will be in the
driving seat in terms of delivering all this in
practice&#151;is balance the need for affordable housing in the local
area against other requirements. One needs to look at that in a rounded
sense. There is no point in having a discussion about the levy without
looking at its interaction with affordable housing provision. We do not
see any direct trade-off between the two, but you need to have a
sensible overall approach to consider these issues in relation to each
other. If we hold to the thought that this is about achieving more,
rather than less, then I do not see why that should be a concern,
because the end result of this proposal from our point of view is that
it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>will play its part in delivering more housing. Our concerns about PGS
were, in part, that it might discourage more housing by discouraging
land supply. With CIL, it is the other way round. This is a positive
incentive if we set it up right, and we should therefore get more of
everything as a
result.</div>
