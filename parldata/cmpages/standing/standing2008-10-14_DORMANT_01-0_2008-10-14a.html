Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets in Committee. Would all
Members please ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned
off or switched to silent running in Committee? I remind the Committee
that there is a money resolution in connection with the
Bill&#151;copies are available in the room&#151;and that adequate
notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my fellow
Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments. We also do not
intend to call amendments that are not signed by members of the
Committee, because we assume that they would not be
moved.</div><a name="08101446000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
I remind the Committee of the procedure at the start of today&#146;s
sitting. The Committee will first consider the programme motion on the
amendment paper. Debate is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to a motion to report written evidence, before starting
clause-by-clause scrutiny.</div>

under your chairmanship? I am delighted to have the opportunity to kick
off the deliberations on what the Minister rightly said is a Bill that
has commanded support from all parties in the House of Lords, as well
as in the House of Commons. I look forward to proceeding on that basis,
but with the caveat that, as the Minister knows, we disagree on some
points. As the Government do not have a natural majority in the other
place, they were not able to force through provisions that the majority
felt could be improved. We shall now seek to improve the Bill again
with amendments in
Committee.</div><a name="08101446000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I turn my mind specifically to the amendment, I am bound to say that it
seems faintly peculiar that, yesterday in the Chamber, we discussed how
&#163;37 billion of public money could be put into the banking
system, yet today we are discussing how a rather smaller amount can be
taken out to assist public funds with youth projects and similar
matters. Nevertheless, we are where we are, so we shall concentrate on
what is before
us.</div><a name="08101446000032"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000342"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000343"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Absolutely. I take the blame entirely for taking
us down that
road.</div><a name="08101446000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 1 concerns a matter on which the Minister sought to reassure me
last week on Second Reading, but I should like further reassurance
about the means by which a depositor can be reunited with his or her
money if he or she goes to his or her bank more than 15 years after
having last touched the account. As set out in the explanatory note,
the banks and buildings societies will act as agents for the reclaim
fund and continue to manage the customer relationship, but the precise
details of agency arrangements will be a matter for negotiation between
the bank or building society and the reclaim
fund.</div><a name="08101446000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
individual will go to his or her bank to reclaim a sum&#151;for the
sake of argument, let us say &#163;100&#151;after which the bank
will go to the reclaim fund, but at that point the reclaim fund needs
to locate the money and may be unable to share sufficient details with
the bank. The Minister might consider that I am concerned unduly about
such matters and that the practical arrangements are better than I
understand them to be, but the amendment would require the bank to
transfer the customer&#146;s name, date of birth and the last known
address when transferring the balance of a dormant account to the
reclaim fund. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the
individuals concerned have the minimum administrative difficulty in
being reunited with their money, which is why I hope that it will be
supported by the Committee or that the Minister will reassure us to
such an extent that it will not be necessary to press it to a
Division.</div><a name="08101446000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000344"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The amendment raises an issue about the
relationship between the reclaim fund and the bank, which body people
will go to for assistance and what records the reclaim fund will be
required to hold. The hon. Member for Taunton suggested that we enable
the reclaim fund to trace the money that has been transferred to it by
the bank. I have a slightly different worry about that and why the
reclaim fund needs to have such information. If the customer goes back
to the bank and the bank acknowledges that a liability is due to that
customer and tries to recover from the reclaim fund the money that is
due to them, which I think is how the process is meant to work, how is
the reclaim fund to know that the bank has not tried to reclaim money
for that customer before? What controls will be in place to ensure that
the reclaim fund only pays legitimate claims to banks? If the reclaim
fund has simply transferred a lump of money from bank A, how will it
know which customers that sum refers to, what the breakdown of that
money is between different accounts and therefore what action it needs
to take?</div>
<a name="08101446000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the other
place, my noble Friend Baroness Noakes commented that the reclaim
fund</div>
<a name="08101446000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could not have
a proper system of internal control that did not identify the potential
obligations that it took on&#151;which would have to be on a named
basis&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11
December 2007; Vol. 697, c. 67.]</div>
<a name="08101446000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness Noakes made an
important point. It is difficult to know how the reclaim fund could
properly perform its functions without that type of information. As I
mentioned earlier, how would the reclaim fund know that it was paying a
valid claim that the banks had not sought to recover in respect of that
customer at an earlier stage and that no one was not coming back for a
second bite of the cherry?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="08101446000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">This issue is
also relevant to the other functions of the reclaim fund. If I was
administering the reclaim fund, I would want to know the liabilities
that were being transferred across to me. For example, if
&#163;1 million was transferred to the reclaim fund from a
bank, I would want to know whether I was accepting one block of
&#163;1 million or 1 million amounts of &#163;1, because I would
take a different approach to releasing that money to the Big Lottery
Fund, depending on the nature of the breakdown of the assets being
transferred. That relates to the proposed change to clause 1 set out in
the amendment, which would ensure that the reclaim fund knows the
balance of a dormant account that a person holds with the bank. It is
important that such information is transferred, so that the reclaim
fund is properly protected and so that it knows the make-up of the
liabilities that it is meant to assume. That would allow the fund to
make repayments to the banks in a controlled fashion and to have the
detailed knowledge that is necessary for making the right decisions on
the amounts to release to the Big Lottery Fund.</div>
<a name="08101446000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
that the hon. Member for Taunton has tabled the amendment, because it
helps to tease out the issues about how the reclaim fund will function,
what controls will be in place and what data it will hold. There was a
significant debate in the other place about the amount of data that the
reclaim fund should have. My noble Friend tabled an amendment
suggesting a confidentiality agreement that the reclaim fund could
enter into, to enable it to hold more data about the holders of dormant
accounts. In that case, the Government maintained that the Data
Protection Act 1998 would provide sufficient protection. We accept
their assurances, but it would be useful if the Minister indicated in
his response what information the reclaim fund will hold on individuals
to enable it to perform its duties properly.</div>
<a name="08101446000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000345"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I hope that I can give the hon. Member for
Taunton the assurances that he seeks, but I believe that the amendment
is unnecessary. One of the key principles behind the Bill is that the
bank or building society is expected to handle customer repayments.
Customers should not notice any significant change as a result of their
accounts being transferred to the reclaim fund; it remains their money
and if they go to their bank or building society and ask for their
money, they should get it. It will then be up to the bank to make a
claim on the reclaim fund. Customer records are therefore expected to
be retained by the original institution, to verify claims on behalf of
the reclaim fund. In practice, there should be no need for confidential
customer information to be transferred routinely to the reclaim fund.
I, for one, would not feel comfortable with a situation where a
customer&#146;s natural right to privacy within their own bank or
building society was, without their knowing it, jeopardised by
information being given to a third party&#151;the reclaim fund. We do
not believe that that is necessary.</div>
<a name="08101446000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Taunton will be aware, a bank or building society normally
has a duty not to disclose information about its customers&#146;
affairs to third parties without the customer&#146;s consent.
However, we recognise that, in exceptional circumstances, a customer
might be unable to seek repayment from their bank or building society
and the claim might need to be handled directly by the reclaim fund.
That could happen, for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>example, in a dispute about repayment in which the reclaim fund becomes
directly involved as the respondent. As a result of that eventuality,
clause 14 will allow a bank or building society to transfer customer
information lawfully to the reclaim fund if that is necessary to enable
it to deal with claims for repayment. Such a transfer of information
would otherwise breach a legal restriction on sharing information, such
as the bank&#146;s duty of
confidentiality.</div><a name="08101446000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000346"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Will the Minister give an example of circumstances
where that may be necessary, as I am confused as to what they might
be?</div><a name="08101446000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000347"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that they would be
exceptional circumstances. At the moment, in normal circumstances,
banks or building societies should hold sufficient information to
identify the account holder and to ensure that the money that was held
in their accounts and transferred to the reclaim fund is genuinely
reclaimable. Under those circumstances, there should be no need for
information to be transferred. Of course, there is potential for
dispute in such situations&#151;for example, a bank or building
society might no longer exist, and the records might be imperfect.
Clause 14 is intended to deal with such exceptional circumstances. The
principle that we should not routinely transfer data that give private
information about an individual to the reclaim fund is correct. Normal
account details should remain with a bank or building
society.</div>
<a name="08101446000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000348"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point about not
transferring data beyond what is necessary. In practical terms,
however, presumably I could go along to a bank where I had an account
with &#163;100 in it that I had not touched for 10 years, withdraw
the money and walk out with &#163;100 in cash. If I had a bank
account that I had not touched for 20 years, could I similarly go in
and walk out with my &#163;100? Would there be a delay or
complications because that money, having passed the 15-year threshold,
had gone into the reclaim fund? Could the bank say, &#147;Sorry,
we&#146;ll have to process it, and it will take a certain amount of
time&#148;? Would I, as the customer, notice the difference between
an account that had not passed the 15-year threshold and one that had?
</div><a name="08101446000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000349"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Subject to verification checks, which one would
expect a bank or building society to want if someone had not been in
touch with them for 15 or 20 years, a person should be able
to get the money immediately. If the money has been transferred, it
will be up to the bank or building society to get it back from the
reclaim fund. A customer can walk into a bank or building society and
get the money that is rightfully theirs. The bank or building society
should have already written to the individual to alert them to the
possibility that the money might be dormant. If they had not received
any information back from the customer, after 15 years the money could
be transferred into the reclaim fund. The principle that someone can
get their money back by going to their bank or building society and
having some simple verification checks is right, and it is one of the
reasons why banks and building societies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>should maintain official data that can be verified so that customers can
get their money as easily as possible. Overall, I do not believe that
the amendment is necessary.</div>
<a name="08101446000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
respond briefly to the point made by the hon. Member for Fareham. When
money is transferred to the reclaim fund, there should be sufficient
information&#151;but not personal details&#151;to enable the
reclaim fund, when producing its business plan, to make some assessment
of the likelihood of dormant funds being repatriated. We discussed on
Second Reading the need for a balanced decision to be taken by the
reclaim fund on that basis. There will be information that enables the
reclaim fund to take those decisions, but customers&#146; details
will not be routinely passed to the reclaim fund. We do not believe
that to be
necessary.</div><a name="08101446000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000350"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. What type of information does he envisage being passed
across by the banks or building societies to the reclaim fund? Will it
have a breakdown of the individual account balances that have been
transferred across, on a numbers basis? Will they know for how long an
account has been dormant, again on a numbers basis? What sort of
information will they get to enable them to make such a judgment, which
we all agree is a fundamental part of making sure that the scheme
works?</div><a name="08101446000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000351"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding is that fairly high-level
information will be provided. Individual accounts will not be subject
to in-flight refuelling. My advisers suggest that that will be a matter
for agency agreement and not for the Bill. As regards the general
principles involved, we need sufficient high-level
information&#151;to be clarified in agency agreement&#151;to be
provided to enable the reclaim fund to understand how many
customers&#146; accounts have been transferred to it, the age profile
of those accounts and the quantums involved. The reclaim fund need not
necessarily know exactly which individuals are having accounts
transferred into it. The Bill allows for the provision of information
that is likely to be necessary to repay customers. Other than that, it
will be a matter for agency agreement. I appreciate that the hon.
Member for Fareham is making a probing point. The reclaim fund needs
sufficient information to be able to have a properly functioning
business plan and to conduct the work that we want it to do, which is
to transfer money to good
causes.</div><a name="08101446000053"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000355"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendments are technical and arise from
debates in the other place. Our consistent position has been that all
accounts should be eligible for transfer into the scheme, provided that
they meet the test of dormancy set out in the Bill. That includes
accounts opened a long time ago. As the Bill is currently drafted, if a
customer dies it is not possible for their balance to be transferred to
the reclaim fund and the bank&#146;s liability extinguished, because
the account is not one that the customer holds with the bank. That
presents difficulties, as banks will not know whether older, inactive
accounts are owned by living or deceased persons. We certainly intend
to address that point, which was raised in the other place. It is
unlikely that banks or building societies would know whether account
holders were living or deceased. We appreciate what the banks and
building societies have told us&#151;that they wish to have certainty
on that point so that they are not constrained in their ability to
participate in the scheme. We are happy to propose the amendments,
which are a technical clarification confirming that the accounts owned
by deceased persons are eligible for transfer into the
scheme.</div><a name="08101446000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000356"></a>Mr.

<a name="08101446000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000360"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendments intend to bring the Bill back to
the state in which it was originally introduced. It is right to have a
significant debate on the objectives of the small and local schemes. I
would like to remind the Committee about the objective of the Bill,
which is to facilitate fair and efficient distribution of funds in
dormant accounts for the benefit of society.</div>
<a name="08101446000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that small banks and building societies often play a key role in
supporting and engaging with our local communities. It has always been
clear that small, locally based institutions should be able to focus
dormant account assets on needs in their local communities. That was
announced as far back as the pre-Budget report of 2005. In consultation
with the bank and building society sector, we have identified &#163;7
billion as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>credible threshold to define small and locally based institutions. The
Building Societies Association advised us that of those building
societies with less than that amount in total assets, more than 90 per
cent. have all their branches within 70 miles of their head office. We
consulted on the suitability of that threshold for identifying small,
locally based institutions, and the majority of respondents who
expressed a view believed the limit to be appropriate. The Government
are fully committed to supporting mutual organisations and recognise
the many benefits that such organisations bring to society and
communities across the United Kingdom. We recently introduced new
legislation to support the sector, including improving the rights
relating to member shares and improving procedures involved in
transferring business to the subsidiary of another mutual.</div>
<a name="08101446000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The vast
majority of building societies will be eligible for the alternative
scheme. The BSA advises that 50 out of their 59 members&#151;nearly
85 per cent.&#151;will be eligible. On Second Reading, it was
helpfully pointed out that building societies which will not be
eligible hold a large proportion of the dormant account funds in that
sector. To be precise, the BSA has estimated that &#163;100 million
of the &#163;130 million in dormant accounts in the sector lie in the
larger institutions. I am aware of the views that have been regularly
expressed by Nationwide building society. Much has been said of the
great need in the areas to which spending priorities in the scheme have
been directed, particularly the need for youth facilities and for
improving financial capability and inclusion. One of the key messages
on Second Reading was the strong support across the House for
investment in youth facilities and in matters of financial capability
and inclusion.</div>
<a name="08101446000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
reasons behind the scheme is that, if the larger building societies do
not take part in the main scheme, the funds for the spending priorities
will be heavily impacted on. We are aware that banks and building
societies support a variety of good causes in different communities
and, of course, we fully support such laudable objectives. However, are
banks and buildings societies really in the best position to consider
consistently the needs of wider communities throughout the United
Kingdom? We have identified the good causes following an extensive
consultation exercise in England, and other Administrations have
similarly consulted. We think that it is right to proceed with the
scheme. If we were to allow all dormant account money to be
administered through multiple individual foundations, it would
inevitably lead to significant overlaps and potentially large gaps in
provision. It is in the interests of a fair and efficient distribution
of funds to have a centralised national distribution
scheme.</div><a name="08101446000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08101446000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000361"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Is the Minister satisfied that the
&#163;7 billion threshold is still appropriately pitched,
given the events of the past few weeks and
months?</div><a name="08101446000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000362"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Yes, I am. I have asked that question of
officials. Obviously, there have been changes during the past few weeks
and months, but I am confident that an asset limit of &#163;7 billion
strikes the right balance and enables us to have a scheme of a
sufficient size that it can be efficient in its distribution of
funds.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="08101446000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We very much
welcome the recent BSA statement in support of the Bill as it was
introduced to Parliament, which is what the amendments are designed to
achieve. The Government&#146;s proposals for an alternative scheme
for smaller financial institutions have also been welcomed by the BSA.
We also welcome its statement expressing its members&#146; commitment
to making the scheme a success and their intention to participate in
it, as we do the British Banking Association&#146;s statement
confirming commitments to participate from banking groups representing
90 per cent. of the UK retail banking
market.</div><a name="08101446000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed scheme is designed to be simple and efficient, to minimise
costs to institutions and the scheme overall, and to maximise funds for
distribution. The asset limit provides a balance between giving small,
locally based banks and building societies the flexibility to benefit
directly their local communities against maximising the assets for the
main scheme, which will be operated through the Big Lottery Fund to
give money to good causes. We believe that the amendments will produce
the alternative scheme for small, locally based institutions, which is
what small banks and building societies
want.</div>
<a name="08101446000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000363"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The matter under discussion was the subject of
significant debate in the other place, and I happen to think that the
balance of debate there was right. Building societies are in a
particular position in our society and they differ from banks. We are
talking about the money not only of customers, but of members of a
building society. The society is a mutual and the money is its
members&#146; money. I am conscious that members of building
societies have made decisions about how building societies should
operate. For example, at its last annual general meeting, members of
Nationwide agreed to a commitment that 1 per cent. of its profits
should be allocated to charitable
purposes.</div><a name="08101446000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a strong belief in those organisations, which is one reason why
there is so much support for mutuals throughout the House. The mutual
nature of such organisations gives them different status; they see
their mutuality as a distinctive selling point compared with other
institutions. To carve out one group from the whole population says
that there is almost a two-tier category of building society: those
that are of sufficient size and thus will be dealt with on a different
basis when it comes to dormant accounts and those that will be allowed
to continue to use their members&#146; funds when there are dormant
accounts to benefit the communities in which they are based. That
creates an unhelpful
distinction.</div><a name="08101446000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton asked whether the asset limit of &#163;7
billion is right. From the Minister&#146;s justification of the Bill,
a better measure is the one that he used on the concentration of
branches&#151;to what extent does a building society serve a
well-defined local community?</div>
<a name="08101446000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000364"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not sure how this is helping the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument. My argument is that it is right to have a
small and local scheme, and that small building societies, which
generally serve local or regional and sub-regional communities, are in
a different place 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>from the larger building societies, which have extensive branch networks
and customers throughout the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="08101446000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the Nationwide building society. I have
enormous respect for the Nationwide and its policy on giving money to
good causes, but it has 14 million customers and is about to acquire
the Derbyshire building society, which will make it even larger. It
does not help his argument to say that we should treat all building
societies the same. The Nationwide is of sufficient size that it
deserves to be regarded as an institution on a par with some of our
banks, and it is right in that case that it participate in the wider
reclaim scheme, which will give money to good causes through the Big
Lottery Fund.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000365"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Again, the Minister points out two communities that
could lose out as a consequence of this measure. The communities of
customers being served by the Derbyshire and Cheshire building
societies would benefit if dormant accounts were sitting there and
those societies were not taken over by or merged with&#151;I am not
sure what the technical language is&#151;the Nationwide. Now, those
accounts will be lost in the big pot that will be transferred to the
Big Lottery Fund. The communities that those two building societies
serve could have used dormant accounts to help particular projects in
their area. Let us not forget, these building societies have been built
over time through the agglomeration of smaller building
societies.</div>
<a name="08101446000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
danger of losing the potential for local links for larger building
societies and creating two different sets of building society. It boils
down to the Minister&#146;s argument that the Government want more
money for the good causes. We support the three spending priorities
that are set out in the Bill and we want to see those work well, but
the scheme is voluntary, there is competition and there is tension
between the scheme and recognising the principle of mutuality and how
members of building societies and the local communities that they
support should be able to benefit.</div>
<a name="08101446000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second
issue arises from the &#163;7 billion limit, which is what happens
when the value of the assets fluctuates. When is a scheme in or out? If
a building society shrinks its lending book and has lower assets, one
year it will be over the &#163;7 billion limit, the next it will be
under. That does not create a stable base on which to
operate.</div><a name="08101446000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is regular discussion on the financial pages about de-leveraging. That
could lead to shrinkage in the size of some of those building
societies, which would suddenly go below the threshold. I think I am
right in saying that the Skipton building society has recently gone
over the &#163;7 billion limit, although it might find itself going
below that threshold, so even the threshold does not quite work. The
Government are making an artificial distinction. It does not sit well
with the treatment given to the vast majority of building societies,
and it is a retrograde step to restore the Bill to how it was before it
was, I believe, improved in the
Lords.</div><a name="08101446000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000366"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clearly, there is a difference of opinion between
us on the matter, but let me have one more go at reassuring the hon.
Gentleman. We want co-ordination and a fund of sufficient size to give
money to good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>causes. I repeat that youth provision, financial inclusion and
capability are important areas, and they have been recognised widely as
such here and in the other
place.</div><a name="08101446000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that having a small and local scheme
will create an artificial distinction. I do not agree. Building
societies are all not the same. They vary enormously in size, and many
small and local building societies are primarily locally and regionally
focused. Clearly, some societies with many millions of customers are
not, and it is not the case that building societies will be
disadvantaged in any way by participating in the reclaim fund and the
scheme if they are of sufficient
size.</div><a name="08101446000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Big Lottery Fund has already proved that it can invest effectively in
projects at local level and will continue to do so. If Nationwide
participates in the reclaim fund and the scheme, I am sure that many of
its members will benefit from the reclaim fund through the Big Lottery
Fund at local level. I must say to the hon. Gentleman that large
building societies such as the Nationwide are national. The clue is in
the title. They are not small and local, and I do not think it
unreasonable to have a small and local
scheme.</div><a name="08101446000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000367"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister&#146;s argument is rather spurious,
given the existence of building societies such as the Chelsea, which
has its headquarters in Cheltenham, as well as the Yorkshire and the
Skipton. To say that the clue is in the name is not the best argument
that he can make in
Committee.</div><a name="08101446000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000368"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but it plays to what I am saying as well. A number of building
societies have names that might imply that they are regional, such as
the Yorkshire, although in actual fact they operate very much on a
national
basis.</div><a name="08101446000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101446000369"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Janet Dean</b> (Burton) (Lab): Has my hon. Friend estimated
how much less there would be for good causes, such as youth facilities,
if large building societies were allowed to opt out of the
scheme?</div>
<a name="08101446000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000370"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The best figures that we have available show
that, of the &#163;130 million that we estimate would be classified
as dormant and be transferred to the reclaim fund in the first
instance, &#163;100 million would come from building societies with
assets in excess of &#163;7 billion. By the way, that
includes the Derbyshire, which, although it is being acquired by the
Nationwide, is already above the &#163;7 billion threshold. We are
saying that if the Bill remains as amended in the other place,
&#163;100 million will not go into the reclaim fund and then, I hope,
out to the Big Lottery Fund for
distribution.</div><a name="08101446000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
wanting to be in any way critical of large building societies, which I
am emphatically not, having a scheme of sufficient size to be able to
operate strategically, which is our intention, is the right thing to
do. It is also important that we make provision for small and local
building societies. That is the balance we struck as a result of the
consultation exercise. The BSA is happy with our amendments and the
approach that we want to
follow.</div><a name="08101446000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have has reassured the hon. Member for Fareham, although I
suspect that I have not done so

resolution if they wished to alter the threshold, rather than a
negative resolution, which is the current arrangement.</div>
<a name="08101446000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
parties routinely use this device in Committee to try to make the
Government more accountable to Parliament, and perhaps there is
something slightly ritualistic in the way that amendments are tabled to
that effect. In this instance, however, a serious point is being made:
it would not be appropriate&#151;indeed, it would be a slight breach
of faith&#151;for the Government to alter the threshold in a way that
substantially changed the legislation and the impact on small
communities that would otherwise benefit, without proper reference
to Parliament. That is the motivation behind
amendment No. 2.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div><a name="08101446000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike other
amendments moved by Opposition parties, which the Government&#151;by
virtue of having the majority of members of the Committee&#151;may
wish to disregard, they might want to look more sympathetically on this
proposal. Unless they have malign or hidden motives&#151;I have no
reason to believe that they have&#151;I cannot understand why they
would wish to reject the amendment.</div>
<a name="08101446000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000385"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We identified, in consultation with the industry,
the &#163;7 billion limit as a credible threshold to define small
locally based institutions, and it is enshrined in clause 3. The
amendment asks us to use the affirmative procedure rather than the
negative power in the Bill. I say to the hon. Member for Taunton that
we recognise the concerns that were expressed in the other place about
the suitability of the &#163;7 billion limit, and we have recently
discussed those concerns.</div>
<a name="08101446000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
provision in the Bill for the asset limit to be adjusted by Government
order, so that it can continue appropriately to identify small and
local institutions in the future, which is its purpose. The most likely
reason for changing the limit would be a technical matter, such as
inflationary adjustment. We therefore consider that a negative power is
appropriate, given the scope of the power and the interest that it is
likely to raise.</div>
<a name="08101446000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee confirmed that a sufficient case
had been made for the power, and it did not consider the power nor the
scrutiny that we are proposing&#151;the negative procedure&#151;to
be inappropriate. For those reasons, we believe that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment is unnecessary, and we will oppose
it.</div>
<a name="08101446000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000386"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am disappointed. I understand the point that the
Minister is making: if the limit will be adjusted due to inflation or
other incremental changes that take place from year to year, we do not
need a full-scale discussion, but I witnessed in the Chamber last week
large parts of the provisions for banking being made under terrorism
legislation, so I am cautious about the Government using powers created
for one reason to achieve different purposes at a later date. It is
perfectly possible that the Government could reduce the threshold
substantially without proper reference to Parliament. That concerns me,
but I sense that I have not persuaded the majority of members of the
Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000387"></a>Mr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="08101446000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
continues in the spirit of the previous amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Taunton, and I am not sure whether it holds any greater
chance of success. I want to introduce into clause 5 a power to ensure
that, where the Government issue a direction to the reclaim fund, that
direction is subject to parliamentary scrutiny. As the Government
frequently point out&#151;doubtless they will do so again today,
perhaps when we have a stand part debate on the clause&#151;the
reclaim fund is a private company and the Government will not have a
great deal to do with it. As with any other private company, it will be
regulated by the Financial Services Authority. Yet, when we look at the
detail of the clause, subsection (4) will give the Treasury the right
to &#147;give a direction&#148; to the reclaim fund, requiring
it</div><a name="08101446000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
give effect to any specified object that it has, or...to comply
with any specified obligation or prohibition imposed on it by a
provision that its articles of association are required to make under
Schedule
1.&#148;</div><a name="08101446000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
touched on the issue briefly on Second Reading last week. I asked the
Minister if it would be possible for the Treasury to give a direction
to the reclaim fund to transfer more money to the Big Lottery Fund.
After a while, we got the answer&#151;I paraphrase
significantly&#151;yes. It will be possible, in exceptional
circumstances, to use the power of direction to encourage or require
the fund to transfer more
money.</div><a name="08101446000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government intend to have such power of direction, it should be
subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny. In such circumstances, the
Government would be saying, &#147;We do not agree with the prudent
decision that the board of the reclaim fund has made to hold back this
amount of money. We believe that, in the interests of maximising the
amount of money in the Big Lottery Fund, the right decision is to
transfer across another &#163;20 million, &#163;30 million or
&#163;40 million.&#148; The Government&#146;s exercising such
powers without parliamentary scrutiny is not appropriate. What if the
reclaim fund is left short? We had the assurance in the other place
that the financial services compensation scheme would meet the needs of
customers, but it would not be satisfactory for the private sector to
pick up a shortfall through the FSCS.</div>
<a name="08101446000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
need for proper parliamentary scrutiny of the directions that the
Government can give to the reclaim fund. Without that, the directors of
the reclaim fund will be in a difficult position. We are giving the
Treasury powers without proper parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister
ought to accept the amendment, in the spirit of trying to improve the
scrutiny of the operation of the reclaim fund. We are told that the
fund is a private body; but at the end of the day, it will be subject
to those Treasury
directions.</div><a name="08101446000128"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000388"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the intention of the amendment,
which is to probe the Treasury&#146;s use of its power to direct the
reclaim fund to comply with the legislation and to ensure greater
parliamentary scrutiny. We touched on the issue on Second Reading. I
hope that the comments that I can put on the record today will help to
give the hon. Member for Fareham and others watching the proceedings
some
reassurance.</div><a name="08101446000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5 contains a direction-making power, as the hon. Gentleman said. We see
it as an ultimate safeguard, which allows the Treasury to take action
to ensure that a reclaim fund complies with the requirements to which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>it will be subject as a result of the Bill. I want to emphasise that the
direction will do no more than require the reclaim fund to give effect
to, or comply with, the requirements to which it is already subject
under the Bill, which will have been approved by
Parliament.</div><a name="08101446000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me be as clear as I can about how I see the power being used. The
Financial Services Authority will authorise the reclaim fund and put in
place ongoing prudential regulation, to ensure that the reclaim fund
has sufficient money to repay customers. That is in keeping with the
FSA&#146;s roles of financial regulation and consumer protection. It
is not expected to go beyond its statutory objectives and make rules
that govern other areas of the reclaim fund&#146;s operations. The
Government do not envisage using the direction-making power in the Bill
to interfere in any way in the day-to-day running of the reclaim fund
and the management of its money. It will be the FSA&#146;s sole
responsibility to regulate the reclaim fund for prudential
purposes.</div><a name="08101446000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power is an ultimate sanction, which the public would reasonably expect
us to have to ensure that the reclaim fund functions in accordance with
its articles of association, particularly in those areas that the FSA
will not regulate for prudential purposes. That is an important point.
Such areas include, in principle, the requirements in schedule
1&#151;for example, the publication of information by the reclaim
fund, the use of money to cover reasonable money costs or the
requirements elsewhere to transfer surplus money to the Big Lottery
Fund.</div>
<a name="08101446000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
emphasise that we do not expect to use this power. These issues are
primarily a matter for the company&#146;s directors and members, but
the power gives us the ability to act in exceptional circumstances.
That is all. It is not a question of using a direction if we just had
an honest disagreement about the distribution policy of the reclaim
fund. It would be used if there were in our view a fundamental breach
of the company&#146;s responsibilities that have been set out in
legislation. Only in those circumstances would we want to act without
delay in the interests of account
holders.</div><a name="08101446000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000389"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I find it difficult to comprehend what exceptional
circumstances the Minister refers to, since he does not appear to mean
an honest disagreement between the reclaim fund and the Government
about the amount being transferred. Will he give a better example of
the areas where the Government feel that they might have to give
directions to the reclaim
fund?</div><a name="08101446000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000390"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We do not have particular areas specifically in
mind because we do not anticipate any problems. This is a voluntary
scheme. A private company is going to be set up in accordance with the
legislation, and we have confidence that it will appoint people who
will run the reclaim fund in an effective way. This is very much a
back-up power in the case of unexpected
circumstances.</div><a name="08101446000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101446000391"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I imagine that the
reclaim fund will be carrying a balance. What will be the rules for
investing that balance? Will it have to keep it in cash or will it be
allowed to make investments? If it is allowed to make investments, will
it invest, for example, in Government bonds and public bonds, or in
Icelandic banks?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="08101446000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000392"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I seriously doubt that it will invest in
Icelandic banks. This is not a matter for primary legislation. It will
be up to the private company to decide how it manages its money for the
length of time for which it has it, the extent and size of a
contingency fund for moneys that will be reunited with customers, and
the extent of the funding requirements that it will pass on to the
BLF.</div>
<a name="08101446000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the hon. Member for Fareham, I stress that we see this very much as
a back-up power to be applied if there were a clear breach of a
company&#146;s articles of association. This would include failure to
publish information, as we want the reclaim fund to operate
transparently. Serious concerns about the behaviour of the company
might warrant the Government wanting to take action, and we think there
should be a power there. I hope that I have reassured the hon.
Gentleman that we do not intend to use this power routinely&#151;it
should be considered wholly
exceptional.</div><a name="08101446000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101446000393"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): Does
the Minister accept and recognise the heart of the concern that has
been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham in tabling the
amendment? Whereas in national lottery legislation there is a clear
delineation between the raising of the money and its distribution, with
the latter being in the hands of the BLF, in this instance, even with
the exceptional use of these powers, there will be a muddying of the
water in that the power of distribution will no longer be exclusively
in the hands of the Big Lottery Fund, as we shall see when we discuss
later clauses dealing with precisely how the powers will operate. That
is the nub of my concern. There should at least be some opportunity for
Parliament to have its say through the statutory instrument
provision.</div><a name="08101446000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000394"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
However, the reclaim fund will be set up as a private company and
incorporated under UK company law. It will have articles of association
and be regulated by the FSA. We will have a power under the Bill that
can be used in exceptional circumstances if we believe that the company
is in breach of its articles of association. That situation would not
be normal. The normal situation will be that the company collects money
that is given to it by banks and building societies from dormant
accounts. It will have a business plan whereby it makes decisions about
how much of that money can be distributed to the BLF, which will then
issue it to good causes, and how much needs to be kept back as a proper
contingency against future claims on the reclaim fund from existing
customers with dormant accounts. Only in exceptional circumstances
might the Government need to exercise a power to require the reclaim
fund to do certain things. I do not think that it would happen, but if
the reclaim fund suddenly decided that it did not want to publish
information and there were serious concerns about the propriety of how
the company was being run, the taxpayer would want the Government to
intervene. That is the reason for the back-up. We do not intend to use
it other than in wholly exceptional circumstances. It is normal to have
reserve powers of that sort under
legislation.</div>
<a name="08101446000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000395"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Will the Minister clarify whether a private
company will pay corporation tax on any surpluses that it builds up in
its accounts?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="08101446000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000396"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not have information on tax status to hand,
but I will make sure that the hon. Gentleman receives it during our
sitting.</div><a name="08101446000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have explained the exceptional nature of the power that is
being taken and why we do not support the amendment. As we have seen
from the events of the past few days, it is sometimes necessary to
intervene in a time of unexpected crisis. Having the power to do so is
a good thing, and I would like to think that in this week, of all
weeks, Opposition Members appreciate that
too.</div><a name="08101446000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000397"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Perhaps the directors of the reclaim fund would be
grateful that the Government lost their 42-day provision in the House
of Lords last night, as otherwise they could be detained without trial
in exceptional
circumstances.</div><a name="08101446000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
reassuring the Committee about the exceptional nature of the powers to
intervene and when they might be exercised, the Minister almost makes
the argument for why parliamentary scrutiny of such matters would not
be a bad thing. It will not be a daily occurrence. We will not have to
sit here week in, week out, approving directions. The powers will be
exceptional, and as such need parliamentary
scrutiny.</div><a name="08101446000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000398"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I would find it immensely reassuring if the hon.
Gentleman could assure me that, in the unlikely event of a Conservative
victory at the next general election, such a provision would be a
priority on which to legislate at the beginning of the new
Parliament.</div><a name="08101446000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000399"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> One thing that I learned when I was a member of the
Finance Bill Committee is that I could give way to too often to the
hon. Gentleman. I shall not go down that route, because he will change
his policy before we know
it.</div><a name="08101446000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that the scheme is voluntary, that the company is private
and that it will be regulated by the FSA. Would we expect the Treasury
to have these powers in the first place? I think that most people would
say not. If the Treasury does have powers to give direction it is
important that, given their exceptional nature, they are not to be used
willy-nilly but only in a moment of
crisis.</div><a name="08101446000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000400"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> In times of crisis we sometimes have to act
extremely quickly. I stress that we expect to use the powers only in
exceptional circumstances, but I will give the hon. Gentleman a
hypothetical situation. If the company directors of the reclaim fund
suddenly wanted to make an investment decision to put &#163;200
million into an Icelandic bank and the Government got wind of that, it
would be a good idea to stop them. We could not lay an order in the
House and then debate it before taking action, which is what we would
have to do under the affirmative procedure. In such exceptional
circumstances we might need to act very quickly, which is why the
negative procedure is the appropriate to way to operate.</div>
<a name="08101446000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000401"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister&#146;s example
is a good one. When the Government took Northern Rock into what was
then called temporary public ownership, we had not debated the
affirmative resolution before the decision was made and nationalisation

<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>had gone ahead. If the Treasury is going to use the powers in
exceptional circumstances and they will be reserved for such cases,
there should be proper parliamentary scrutiny of the exercise of those
powers. This will give the Government power to intervene in a voluntary
scheme run by a private company, and that cuts across the nature of the
scheme by undermining its voluntary nature. The Minister has not given
a satisfactory explanation of why we should not go down the affirmative
resolution route.</div>

Hoban:</b> I want to spend a couple of minutes trying to
understand more about the reclaim fund, because it is one of the key
elements of the Bill. It will be required to hold sufficient reserves
to meet the repayment of account balances that banks have deemed to be
dormant. This is an opportunity for the Minister to say a little more
about how the reclaim fund will work in practice. The point was made in
the previous debate that this will be a private company, but will the
Minister indicate who will actually establish it? Will it be
established at the direction of the Treasury, or will it be established
by the banks and building societies as part of their involvement in the
scheme?</div><a name="08101446000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reclaim fund has an important role in regulating the flow of money to
the Big Lottery Fund from dormant accounts and in ensuring that
sufficient reserves are in place. Will there be a consumer
representative on the board of the reclaim fund to ensure that consumer
interests are safeguarded and that any distribution policy will strike
the right balance between feeding the distribution fund and meeting the
repayment claims from customers? How would it set about establishing
the right reserves for repayments?

reclaim fund? The higher the cost, the less money will be available to
distribute to the Big Lottery Fund and the three spending priorities.
Will those costs be borne by the banks and building societies, or will
they be paid for out of the dormant accounts balances transferred to
the fund?</div>
<a name="08101446000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
reasons why the Bill took longer than expected in the Lords was that
the opacity around the operation of the reclaim fund detained their
lordships for some time. I hope that there are clearer answers now than
there were earlier this year.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000405"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause defines a reclaim fund as the body
that will receive dormant account money from banks and building
societies, by setting out criteria that must be written into its
constitution. It will ensure that the reclaim fund uses dormant
accounts money only for specific purposes: to repay customers, to
ensure that it has sufficient reserves to meet anticipated claims and
to make any surplus available for distribution to the Big Lottery
Fund.</div>
<a name="08101446000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
explained, the industry will establish the reclaim fund and it will be
a private company. Last year, the BBA and the BSA published a detailed
timetable to establish a reclaim fund between now and 2009. That has
been updated this month in their most recent press notices. They are
proceeding to identify a candidate and to work with them and the FSA to
have a reclaim fund up and running next year.</div>
<a name="08101446000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reclaim
fund will invest and manage dormant accounts money prudently to meet
reclaim applications. Only money not needed to meet the reclaim risk or
reasonable running costs will be released for distribution. The clause
should be read alongside schedule 1, which places certain requirements
on the reclaim fund. The BBA has stated publicly that costs will be
clear and transparent. Schedule 1 makes it clear that expenses cannot
be unreasonable.</div>
<a name="08101446000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham asked how the reclaim fund will establish how much
money it needs to keep back. The reclaim fund will determine that in
accordance with the FSA rules. The FSA will consult separately on its
rules, following Royal Assent.</div>
<a name="08101446000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
more information on the point about costs. The reclaim fund will be
able to meet reasonable running costs and have the option to outsource
key tasks&#151;for instance, the investment of funds transferred to
it. That is necessary if it is to be run
efficiently.</div>
<a name="08101446000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000406"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="08101446000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000407"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I want to be clear on this point and then I will
give
way.</div><a name="08101446000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation makes it clear that the fund may not defray unreasonable
expenses, including making unreasonable payments to third parties. We
will debate some of that with schedule 1. The fund may not make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>distributions to its members, which would be out of keeping with the
essential purpose of the scheme, which is to make money available for
reinvestment in the community. The industry has made clear that it will
defray its costs on a publicly disclosed
basis.</div><a name="08101446000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000408"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I do not expect the Minister to answer this today,
but perhaps he could write to me. He refers to the reclaim fund
investing money. It would be helpful to the Committee if we got a note
of what asset classes the reclaim fund will be allowed to invest in. I
raised that a few moments ago, but it would be helpful in reassuring
the Committee that the money will be invested in safe and secure
financial
instruments.</div><a name="08101446000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000409"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The investment policy of the reclaim fund is not
a subject for the Bill. Investment activity would obviously be
regulated through the FSA. The private company would determine its
investment policy in accordance with the Bill and the prudential
regulation regime that we have for companies of this
nature.</div><a name="08101446000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000412"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The Government recognise that the amended Bill
will require the reclaim fund to report directly to Government and to
Parliament. We argued in the other place that the requirements then
already in the Bill should satisfy any concerns about transparency.
However, we have reflected carefully, and the Government&#146;s
amendments today show that we have listened to the debate and are
seeking to reinforce transparency.</div>
<a name="08101446000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It remains
our view that requiring the reclaim fund to lay its annual accounts and
reports before Parliament is inappropriate and out of keeping with the
Bill. When we come to debate clause 6, I will seek to remove that
requirement. The Bill sets out how the reclaim fund will be
constituted. It does not establish a reclaim fund; that is the task for
the industry. Therefore, the reclaim fund will be independent of
Government.</div>
<a name="08101446000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transparency
is crucial to the scheme, and as a result of being formed as a company
under the Companies Act 2006, the reclaim fund will be required to
prepare annual accounts and reports each year. Government amendments
Nos. 21 to 25 will require the reclaim fund to publish the information
as soon as possible after the end of each financial year, so that it
will be available for all to see, including Members.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div><a name="08101446000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, I
remind the Committee that schedule 1 already requires the reclaim fund
to publish annually a list of institutions participating in the scheme;
the amounts of money transferred into the scheme by individual
institutions; the amounts of money reclaimed by customers from
individual institutions; and the aggregate amount passed to the BLF.
Therefore, that information will also be available for public
scrutiny.</div>
<a name="08101446000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to respond to amendment No. 27, which would require the reclaim fund to
publish the names of all banks and building societies that do not
participate in the scheme. That amendment is not necessary. A complete
list of all banks and building societies operating in the UK is already
available from the FSA&#146;s website. I can confirm that the FSA
updates the list regularly, so it would be easy to compare it with the
list of participating institutions, which the reclaim fund would
publish as soon as possible after the end of the financial
year.</div><a name="08101446000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
Government amendments indicate our strong commitment to transparency.
We have listened to debate in the other place. That is one of the
reasons why we have introduced our amendments
today.</div><a name="08101446000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000413"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to start by speaking briefly to amendment
No. 27. Among the objectives of increasing the transparency of the
payments in and out of the reclaim fund are encouraging those banks
that have taken advantage of the voluntary nature of the scheme to
think carefully about their policies and exposing them to proper public
scrutiny. That is why it would be helpful, alongside the list of those
banks that have paid into the scheme, to have a list of those that have
not. That comparison would make it easier for people to hold to account
those institutions that have not participated in the scheme or to
understand why they have not.</div>
<a name="08101446000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some banks
and deposit takers might have been set up only relatively recently. As
a consequence, they might not have assets over five years old, let
alone 15 years old, and they could explain their non-participation in
the scheme. It would be helpful to have that complete list, so that
people can start to ask the right questions, rather than going to the
FSA website to find a list and then compare it. We want to ensure that
the publicity and transparency exists to hold those non-participating
institutions to account. That is why I proposed amendment No.
27&#151;so that we can clearly see the laggards in the
process.</div><a name="08101446000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the Government amendments, which reflect some progress in
ensuring proper transparency, and I am grateful to the Minister for
them. It is better to put the information in the annual report and
accounts, rather than in a separate report to be laid before
Parliament. Those items must therefore be audited, which will give more
comfort on the accuracy of the data to be
disclosed.</div><a name="08101446000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000414"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I welcome the Government amendments, particularly
in relation to more transparency. If we have a voluntary scheme, as
presently proposed, we need transparency to see whether banks and
building societies are participating fully. Given that the amendments
allow for transparency in terms of the cash amounts given to the
reclaim fund, is there any way that the average person in the street
can judge how much money is in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>dormant accounts in those banks and building societies that contribute?
We could also judge how many are not contributing at all. As far as I
can see, although we have the ability, with the amendments and the
Bill, to see how much money goes into the fund, we do not know how much
money was
available.</div><a name="08101446000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000415"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. It is
right that the public should be informed of the extent to which
individual banks and building societies pass money to the reclaim fund
from genuinely dormant accounts and do not hold money back. I
understand that he might suspect them of wanting to hold money back for
themselves. I do not believe that, but the Bill&#146;s purpose is not
to judge the decisions that individual banks and building societies
make about which accounts are dormant and meet the criteria. However, I
understand his interest in that.</div>
<a name="08101446000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the
broad support for Government amendments and remind the Committee that,
under schedule 1, a lot of information will be available at individual
institution level on reclaims from consumers, as well as the amount of
money
transferred.</div><a name="08101446000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08101446000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Fareham says in
respect of amendment No. 27, and it is good to find ways to identify
those who are not participating in the scheme as well as those who are.
However, the amendment is not necessary or appropriate. It is not the
responsibility of the reclaim fund to horizon-scan industry and
identify institutions that are or are not participating. It is more
appropriate that the FSA, which has responsibility for regulating the
industry, undertake the horizon-scanning exercise and, as I said, that
information is available on the FSA website. Compelling the reclaim
fund to do something else would not be
appropriate.</div><a name="08101446000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000416"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Given that the Minister is in relevant territory,
will he explain the Government&#146;s thinking behind making the
scheme voluntary rather than mandatory on the financial
institution?</div><a name="08101446000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000417"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We discussed the matter on Second Reading and it
has been debated previously. The Government consider it right to adopt
the voluntary approach. Establishing the reclaim fund as a private
sector body to which the institutions contribute voluntarily will
maximise the efficiencies by which the scheme will operate. It was
welcomed by the hon. Member for Fareham on Second Reading. The banks
and building societies have told us explicitly that they will
participate in the scheme, and we see no reason not to proceed on a
voluntary
basis.</div><a name="08101446000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
a voluntary approach, the private sector will take responsibility for
managing liabilities to account holders, which will remain on the
private sector&#146;s balance sheet. The approach gives additional
flexibility too, because it allows individual institutions to determine
whether an account is genuinely dormant. That is an important
additional element of flexibility and such a system will be less rigid
than other international schemes, and therefore will help to reduce
costs related to unnecessary administration. It also fits in with the
spirit of better 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>regulation and existing regulatory arrangements such as the banking code
and Financial Services Authority regulation. A voluntary approach can
work better than a statutory scheme and ensure that more money is
transferred into good
causes.</div><a name="08101446000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000418"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Our concern is relatively straightforward. The
reclaim fund will be there to protect public interest, and given the
FSA&#146;s other work in a range of different areas, it is difficult
to see how it will be able to drill down in the way that we have in
mind. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham
would not put an unreasonable burden on the FSA. None the less, the
reclaim fund would have an idea of which building societies and banks
had taken account of their responsibilities, whether voluntary or
otherwise. That would provide additional protection whereby the public
at large would be aware of exactly what was going
on.</div><a name="08101446000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with the Minister that the amendments would enhance protection,
transparency and openness. In keeping with that, I am surprised that he
does not feel that our amendment would be part of the seamless
improvement set out in the
schedule.</div><a name="08101446000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000419"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is
making and welcome his support for the Government amendments, which
will increase transparency. The question that he must answer is this:
is it the responsibility of the reclaim fund to scan the horizon to
produce a complete list of banks and building societies operating in
the UK? That is not what the reclaim fund is there for, quite
transparently. If he believes that the fund should be doing that, the
second question he must answer is whether that is a cost-effective use
of its
resources.</div><a name="08101446000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would much rather that the FSA had that complete list&#151;it has a
statutory duty to provide such a list, which is available on its
website&#151;and leave the reclaim fund to operate and to publish in
a transparent way the information on those participating in the
scheme.</div><a name="08101446000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is not a lot between us on this issue. People who examine such matters
will quickly look at who is participating in the reclaim fund, compare
that with other databases that are readily available from the FSA and
others, and, if they want to, engage in a naming and shaming exercise
of those who for some reason have decided not to
participate.</div><a name="08101446000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000420"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister is in danger of making the matter
unduly complicated. There is a list in existence of all banks and
building societies that the FSA registers. All the amendment proposes
is having a list that says which institutions have paid in and how
much, and below that a list of institutions that have not paid in. He
proposed doing that through the annual report and accounts; my
suggestion was in the context of a specific report to Parliament. The
reclaim fund would simply take the list produced by the FSA and mark
off those that had not paid in. That would not be an onerous or
expensive exercise for
it.</div><a name="08101446000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister will accept the spirit of my amendment and come back on
Report with better wording as to where the list would come from and so
on, but it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>should not be a particularly onerous requirement for the reclaim fund to
do that and to increase the transparency of the
process.</div>
<a name="08101446000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000421"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> In the spirit with which the hon. Gentleman has
raised the issue, I say to him that I will reflect on it again. My
caution about accepting the amendment or agreeing to do so at a later
date relates to the fact that when we put such requirements into
legislation, sometimes they turn out to be far more onerous than
anticipated. He suggests that it would be a simple matter of taking the
FSA&#146;s list. If the amendment said that, it might be more
workable, but as it stands it does not say that, and it might require
the reclaim fund to do a substantial amount of work to prove that it
understood why all those organisations were not participating in the
reclaim fund, although they were licensed deposit
takers.</div><a name="08101446000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will reflect on the point that the hon. Gentleman has made. I share the
view that the public should want to know why organisations are not
participating in the reclaim fund voluntarily. That is the key aspect
that he is trying to push, so if he is prepared to withdraw
the amendment, I will certainly reflect on the matter
further.</div><a name="08101446000203"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000422"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Before the Minister concludes, may I go back to a
point that he made before we had this digression on who should produce
the list? I thought he said&#151;I would like clarity on
this&#151;that it is not the reclaim fund&#146;s job to scan the
horizon and that the FSA should have a role in that. Obviously, it does
that in the context of ensuring that all financial services
organisations are registered with it. Does the FSA have a role in
encouraging banks and building societies to look at the issue of
dormant accounts, and should it in any way supervise and regulate the
work that they do on reuniting accounts with their rightful
owners?</div><a name="08101446000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000423"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is not my job during consideration of the Bill
to comment on the role of the FSA in that respect, but we have a strong
commitment from banks and building societies that they will voluntarily
participate in the scheme. That is completely the right approach to
take and we have no reason to think that any major bank or building
society will not want to participate. The situation to which the hon.
Gentleman refers is not likely to arise, but I will reflect on his
amendment and come back to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000424"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I made clear earlier, we want the reclaim fund
to operate in a transparent way. Our amendments show that we have
listened to the debate and that we seek to reinforce transparency. We
did that with Government amendments Nos. 21 to 25, which require the
fund to publish the information referred to in clause 6 as soon as
possible after the end of each financial year. That information will be
available for all to see, including hon. Members. I hope that that
satisfies any concerns that there will not be full transparency and
scrutiny of the reclaim fund. However, requiring the reclaim fund to
lay its annual accounts and reports before Parliament would be
inappropriate and out of keeping with the
Bill.</div><a name="08101446000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall briefly restate why clause 6 is unnecessary and why I oppose it
standing part of the Bill. Representations have been made that the
reclaim fund should be regarded as a public sector body as a result of
the Treasury&#146;s direction-making power, which has been discussed,
and that that justifies additional parliamentary scrutiny. We have
already debated those points, but I want to re-emphasise the fact that
the reclaim fund is not a public sector body; it is a private company
operating under company
law.</div><a name="08101446000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, we do not envisage using the direction-making power to
interfere in the day-to-day running of the reclaim fund and the
management of its money. The FSA is responsible for regulating the
reclaim fund for prudential
purposes.</div><a name="08101446000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the reasons I have outlined, the improvements in transparency made by
Government amendments Nos. 21 to 25 and the explanations we
have given about why we envisage using the direction-making power only
in exceptional circumstances mean that a requirement for the reclaim
fund to put its annual report and accounts before Parliament would be
excessive and unnecessary. That is why I recommend hon. Members not to
support clause 6.</div>
<a name="08101446000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000425"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Given the consensus that we reached on the previous
amendments, I do not have a problem with the removal of the clause, but
removing subsection (2)(a) would be a retrograde step. That
subsection requires the Treasury to</div>
<a name="08101446000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;lay before each
House of Parliament...any directions issued to a reclaim fund
under section 5(4) of this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="08101446000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government won the point about whether the positive method for
directions should be followed, but now not only will there be no
parliamentary scrutiny, but there will be no obligation on the Treasury
to publish such directions, which makes the situation even
worse.</div><a name="08101446000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we remove the clause in its entirety, no one will know what directions
the Treasury has published. The directions might be used in pressing
emergencies&#151;to use the Minister&#146;s words&#151;but it
would be helpful if we knew when they had been issued to the reclaim
fund. I am sure that this is an over-hasty deletion by the Government,
not a deliberate step to keep directions shrouded in
secrecy.</div>

Pearson:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for
removing clause 6. If there is a problem with subsection (2)(a), I will
undertake to return to the matter on Report. It is not the
Government&#146;s intention to be secretive in any way in the wholly
unexpected circumstance that we might exercise a power of direction; on
the contrary, we would want to ensure that we act transparently. We
have debated whether that should be through an affirmative or negative
procedure, perhaps because of the requirement for urgency. I will come
back to that later should it be necessary or if there is any lack of
clarity or transparency.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000427"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in
clause 11, page 6, line 37, at
end insert &#145;and,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c) the bank or

inform the account holder of the funds that bank or building society
holds on their

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000428"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendment No.
16.</div><a name="08101446000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000429"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The amendment would create a statutory obligation
for banks to attempt to reunite dormant accounts with their owners. It
amends the definition in subsection (1) by adding another paragraph to
require the financial institution to have</div>
<a name="08101446000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exhausted all
reasonable efforts to inform the account holder of the funds that bank
or building society holds on their
behalf.&#148;</div><a name="08101446000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would ensure that financial institutions exercise appropriate
responsibility towards account holders before transferring their money
to a reclaim fund. The current system for allowing people to check
whether they have dormant accounts centres around the website,
www.mylostaccount.org.uk. That presupposes that the account holder
knows which institutions their account is with and believes that they
have a dormant account in the first place. It is also reliant on
voluntary information from the institutions, which can be patchy, and
on the account holder being able or willing to use a computer, which we
should not assume will automatically be the case. I am not trying to
undermine the Bill as a whole but to ensure that the interests of
depositors are safeguarded to an even greater degree than it currently
envisages by putting that greater obligation on the
banks.</div>
<a name="08101446000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000430"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman could expand on
the wording of his amendment where he says that</div>
<a name="08101446000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the bank or
building society in question has exhausted all reasonable efforts to
inform the account holder.&#148;</div>
<a name="08101446000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does he believe
that &#147;all reasonable efforts&#148; might encompass? For
example, one bank has employed a tracing agency to track down the
owners of accounts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>holding more than &#163;1,000. Is that reasonable, or would it be
expected to go further to include lower-value
accounts?</div>
<a name="08101446000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000431"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable point.
There is a useful debate to be had over how much effort the financial
institution should make. Many people take the view that the effort
should match the size of the deposit in the account. The process may
become not self-defeating but less obviously purposeful if it costs
more to try to trace the account holder than the total value of the
deposit. If the account held a higher amount of money, I would envisage
the efforts going somewhat beyond writing to an account holder at an
address at which he resided 15 years or more ago and having a website
that he or she could access if they so
wished.</div>
<a name="08101446000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
several ways in which the banks go about trying to contact longstanding
customers who have not been in recent contact. The essential point is
that at the moment the banks have insufficient incentive to try to
reconnect the dormant bank account holder with his or her dormant bank
account and that the Bill does not give them any great incentive to do
so. After all, what does the bank stand to gain from tracking down a
person who has not been in contact for 15 years or more? Very little. I
fear that the bank will do the bare minimum in order to be seen to be
doing the right thing and that that will not be good enough in the
interests of the individual account holder. I would be pleased if the
Minister could assure me that greater and more strenuous efforts will
be
made.</div><a name="08101446000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000432"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I want to say a few words about the amendment, with
which I have a certain amount of sympathy. I also want to put on record
the specific concerns of a constituent of mine&#151;Mr.
Manzetti of Belvedere house in Grosvenor road, Westminster&#151;which
were answered in part by an exchange of correspondence with the
erstwhile Economic Secretary to the Treasury that took place in the
summer. Having worked in the insurance industry for more than 35 years,
Mr. Manzetti is worried that not enough is being done to
seek out the owners of assets, along the lines of the proposal by the
hon. Member for Taunton. In a modern world in which there are websites
and far more detail that can potentially be demanded and accessed by
the public, banks and building societies are becoming more proactive in
their efforts to hunt down the owners of assets. Mr.
Manzetti&#146;s experience of this world leads him to believe that
there has been a reluctance on the part of insurers and others to
follow up unclaimed benefits or dormant accounts. There is still
concern as to whether that process has been adequately open.</div>
<a name="08101446000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Taunton said, there is now a desire for companies to be
required to list on freely accessible websites the names of all holders
of unclaimed assets and for part of the cost of that exercise to be
borne by advertising of the company&#146;s products on those sites.
At the moment, as the Minister will be aware, there is a pretty
extensive charging regime of some &#163;18 per search. That is a
fairly significant disincentive unless the cost is to be paid by an
individual who is aware of some unclaimed assets for him or his
family.</div><a name="08101446000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to put on the record, more broadly, that the Bill provides an
opportunity to improve on the reunification process and the procedures
for ensuring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>that dormant accounts go back, where possible, to the correct person. As
is betrayed by his surname, many of Mr. Manzetti&#146;s
ancestors come from various parts of Europe, including Italy, Germany,
France and the Czech Republic, and several accounts are unknown. That
will apply not only to many of my constituents but to those of hon.
Members throughout the country. The question is whether enough work is
being done by banks and building societies. Where are the incentives to
ensure that a proper job is done instead of merely making &#147;all
reasonable
efforts&#148;?</div><a name="08101446000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
her letter, which is dated 10 August, the erstwhile Economic Secretary
mentioned</div><a name="08101446000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;tracing
systems being made more
user-friendly.&#148;</div><a name="08101446000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister give some indication as to the nature of those tracing
systems and how they can be more user-friendly in a world where people
will increasingly access websites through the internet? What process
will be put in place to ensure that we do not have a system suitable
only for 2008 that becomes defunct in the light of new
technology in the years and decades ahead? Is there a commitment from
the Government, alongside the banks and building societies, to ensure
that this information is kept up to date, as far as
possible?</div><a name="08101446000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Benton, in allowing me to
stray slightly off the line, as I felt that the issues raised by my
constituent could best be discussed under clause 11. I hope that the
Minister is able to comment on them. I am happy, if need be, to forward
the correspondence that was responded to by the then Economic
Secretary, who is now Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,
the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty
Ussher).</div><a name="08101446000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000433"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is an opportunity for us to spend a little
time thinking about the precursor to the work that the reclaim fund and
the Big Lottery Fund will do with dormant accounts. Consumers will want
to know that banks have taken all the appropriate steps to ensure that
they identify the rightful owners of accounts. The provision is
important, because it will give customers confidence that this is not
just an exercise to take money out of their accounts and put it in the
reclaim fund to be used for the causes mentioned in later clauses. It
is important to consider the approach that the banks and building
societies use to identify dormant accounts and reunite them with their
owners.</div>
<a name="08101446000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having heard
the remarks of the hon. Member for Taunton, I am not sure whether I
support his amendment. The word &#147;reasonable&#148; is difficult
to explain and be clear about. Consumers will expect banks take all the
appropriate steps that they need to take to identify account owners.
The debate that we have had about unclaimed assets and dormant accounts
over the past six years, since the first document on such assets was
first published, has forced, or encouraged, institutions to consider
how they identify those accounts and what steps they should put in
place to reunite the accounts with their owners. National Savings and
Investments, the Building Societies Association and the British Bankers
Association have worked together to set up mylostaccount.org.uk. My
understanding is that there have been many more visits to that site,
and searches initiated on it, than there were on the previous websites
available to bank and building society customers. It appears to have
stimulated a great deal of interest in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>minds of customers about whether they might have accounts and about
initiating the process of searching for
them.</div>
<a name="08101446000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="08101446000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
banks have employed tracing agencies, particularly for larger accounts
and customers, and they appear to have been successful. It is
interesting that the banks have made quite a lot of progress in
whittling down the amount of their unclaimed and dormant accounts. On
Second Reading, other hon. Members and I said that HBOS had made
significant progress. We want that to continue. No matter how much we
want to go to the good causes, we want the banks to have as their first
priority trying to reunite those assets and getting their customers to
claim them. In the time between now, or Royal Assent, and the setting
up of the reclaim fund, we all want the banks to work carefully and
diligently to ensure that that takes place. We will touch on the
triennial reports in the next series of debates, but we certainly want
a mechanism to be in place that shines a light on the activities of
institutions in reuniting customers with their
accounts.</div><a name="08101446000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned about Government amendment No. 16, deleting subsection
(3), which was added in the House of Lords. That subsection would put
the onus on the banks to use the knowledge of their accounts, account
holders and any other relevant matters in determining dormancy. It
would try to encourage banks to take a holistic approach to their
customers, to determine whether there was any evidence that they were
aware of, or should be aware of, to suggest that the account was not
dormant.</div><a name="08101446000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
tabled in the Lords stemmed from a series of discussions that tried to
define dormancy more carefully. Those amendments were unsuccessful,
because there was, rightly, a concern that people did not want
statutory impositions placed on the scheme, to try to preserve as far
as possible its voluntary nature. Lord Davies of Oldham said in the
other
place:</div><a name="08101446000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
bank can follow its normal procedures for reaching a judgment on
whether an account is dormant&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House
of Lords,</i> 10 January 2008; Vol. 697, c.
GC344.]</div><a name="08101446000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some uncertainty, and my amendments Nos. 47 and 46, which
we will come to next, highlight some of the dormancy issues. I am not
clear in my own mind whether the banking code, which is the fall-back
position in this situation, is enough of a prod to ensure that the
banks deal with their customers on a fair basis when looking at
dormancy. Under the code, each bank will have to publish its own policy
on dormancy, but that is voluntary in nature, like so much of the
scheme. I am not sure whether that will provide adequate protection for
customers, who might see their accounts being declared dormant.
Subsection (3), from our perspective, tries to provide some of that
protection for consumers. We are disappointed that the Minister seeks
to delete the amendment made by the House of
Lords.</div><a name="08101446000242"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000434"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall speak to Government amendment No. 16 to
clause 11, which refers to the definition of dormancy. It allows us to
have a number of debates about that definition and to make some
important points about the priority that we all attach to reuniting
customers with their savings.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="08101446000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have made it clear&#151;this is a widely shared view in the
House&#151; that reuniting customers with their money should be a
priority for the scheme and that, whenever possible, efforts should be
made to ensure that customers are reunited with money that is rightly
theirs. That is one reason why we welcomed the launch of
mylostaccount.org.uk by the BBA, the BSA and NS&amp;I early this year,
and the industry&#146;s commitment to reach out to hard-to-reach and
disadvantaged customers. The website has the potential to provide an
efficient and effective means for customers to trace their lost
accounts and for concerns about personal data to be
respected.</div>
<a name="08101446000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
heard, since its launch on 30 January, the site has had nearly 190,000
search forms submitted for money left unclaimed in a dormant bank,
building society or NS&amp;I account. The Government are always
interested in ideas for improving such arrangements, but it is
obviously a matter for banks, building societies and NS&amp;I to ensure
that they have effective arrangements in
place.</div><a name="08101446000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
reinforce a point that I made on Second Reading, searches are possible
through multiple institutions. Website guidance suggests that, if
someone is searching just one institution, it might be best to approach
it direct, but multiple searches are allowed. As the hon. Member for
Fareham said, there has been an increase in the number of people who
have been reunited with their
money.</div><a name="08101446000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000435"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Given what the Minister says, is he comfortable
with the explosion in numbers since the website was set up at the
beginning of the year? Does he believe that it is adequate and open
enough or that it is simply a playing of the numbers game? Does he
understand some of the concerns mentioned by Opposition Members about
the fact that there seems to be a lack of incentive on the part of too
many of those who will benefit from the system to put in place an
entirely open one? At what point will he be satisfied&#151;perhaps it
has been reached&#151;in his own mind that enough is being done to
ensure that dormant accounts are being reunited with their
owners?</div><a name="08101446000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000436"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I said, I am always interested in ideas for
improving the arrangements for reuniting, but I acknowledge the step
change in activity this year. We want that progress to continue, and I
shall certainly be interested in talking to banks and building
societies about their reuniting activities. It should be a priority for
them to ensure that they reunite customers with their money, and we all
share an interest in ensuring that they are doing all that they
reasonably
can.</div><a name="08101446000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster raised a specific
constituency issue, and I shall trace the correspondence to ensure that
the Government are taking any action that we should be taking. To
reinforce the point, banks and building societies are committed to
reuniting and have made significant efforts to do
so.</div><a name="08101446000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point made by the hon. Member for Fareham, transferring accounts
that are not truly dormant is not in the interests of banks and
building societies, because they would have to bear the up-front costs
of any subsequent reuniting.</div>
<a name="08101446000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cities of London and Westminster made a point about
insurance companies paying for tracing services. As he knows, the Bill
is about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>dormant accounts of banks and building societies only&#151;other
assets and institutions pose questions for another
day.</div><a name="08101446000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000437"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister said that it would not be in a
bank&#146;s interest to transfer accounts that are not dormant
because they will bear the up-front cost of the transfer. However, when
an account is transferred to the reclaim fund, the cash and liability
are in effect transferred as well, so there is no cost to the
bank.</div><a name="08101446000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000438"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Certainly administrative and time costs are
associated with transferring funds to a reclaim fund and then back
again. The hon. Gentleman is right that the assets and liability are
transferred, which is one of the purposes of the Bill. I wish that I
could reassure him on Government amendment No. 16 and why we want to
delete subsection (3). I emphasise that we intend genuinely dormant
bank and building society accounts lost by the account holder to be
transferred into the scheme, but not accounts that are simply rarely
used or where the account holder is still aware of their account. That
will minimise the unnecessary costs associated with returning accounts
to customers after a
transfer.</div><a name="08101446000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that our definition of dormancy is simple, clear and
straightforward: an account open throughout a period of 15 years with
no customer-initiated transactions. However, the scheme allows banks
and building societies the flexibility to refer to customer-initiated
activities that might indicate that an account is not dormant even
where there have been no transactions on the account. If the
institution is aware of activity, such as the requesting of periodic
statements, we fully expect institutions not to transfer accounts.
Furthermore, those with particularly strong or individualised systems
can take that into account in their individual policies. That
flexibility is one the scheme&#146;s great strengths. I am happy to
confirm that institutions will be expected to use their knowledge of
such matters. That was indicated in our consultation and is set out
clearly in the explanatory notes. It is unnecessary to require in
legislation that institutions use their knowledge; that would add
nothing to the scheme and have a detrimental impact on the clarity of
the definition. That is why our approach has been supported by
industry.</div><a name="08101446000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000439"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to return to the Minister&#146;s point
about customer-initiated activity. He used the example of a customer
asking for a statement of their account. The point at which the
statement was requested might indicate whether the customer still knew
of the account. If the statement had been requested at the end of year
1 and we were now in year 16, with no customer activity in that
intervening period, one would expect that account to be deemed dormant.
However, does that activity have to be related specifically to that
account? What if a customer has, say, an insurance policy through a
bank that is wholly unrelated to the account? I assume that such
activity would not impact on the definition of dormancy made by the
bank.</div>
<a name="08101446000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000440"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is up to the bank to judge whether an account
is dormant. That is a key point. Banks and building societies will
publish their policies on their interpretation of a dormant account. We
believe that it is important to have a clear definition in legislation
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>dormancy, while allowing banks and building societies the discretion to
use their own judgment. In the Bill, it is immediately apparent when
the minimum definition of dormancy has been achieved: if there has been
a transaction within the past 15 years, the account cannot be
considered dormant; if there has not, it can be. The BSA has said that
the ability to take account of other forms of customer contact is
particularly important to it, and it supports the Bill as introduced.
The BBA has also welcomed the ability to take into account other
indications whether an account is genuinely dormant.</div>
<a name="08101446000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that there is any difference between our intentions. We are
saying clearly that subsection (3) and the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Taunton would muddy the waters and make the position less
clear. Our professional advice from those in the industry states that
they would much prefer to have a clear definition and the flexibility
to use their own judgments and publish their own policies, rather than
having requirements introduced under the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08101446000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="08101446000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000441"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> As my hon. Friend is probably aware, I am concerned
about the flexibility for banks and building societies to make their
own definitions of dormancy, thereby limiting the amount of money that
they may have to give up to the reclaim fund. One of my concerns
involves something that he just mentioned. I am interested to hear
whether there will be any compulsion on banks and building societies to
give their definition of a dormant bank account. If not, there may be a
problem of definition.</div>
<a name="08101446000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000442"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> There is a requirement on banks and building
societies, as part of the banking code, to publish their dormant
accounts policies. That is covered. Again, the key point is that it is
emphatically the case that banks will want to use their judgment to
make reasonable decisions on whether accounts are dormant. We want to
create a clear definition of dormancy and then allow banks and building
societies to exercise their judgment. Tests such as those in subsection
(3), which was inserted in the other place, are not regarded by the BSA
or the BBA as helpful. They would fetter the discretion of the
institutions to make reasonable judgments on whether accounts were
dormant and get in the way of general
practice.</div><a name="08101446000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support amendment No. 16 and oppose amendment No. 3. I emphasise that
it is not in anybody&#146;s interest to transfer accounts unless
people have lost touch and the accounts are considered dormant. If they
are not dormant, there is at least an administrative cost involved. I
also emphasise that this is customers&#146; money. If a customer goes
through the door of a bank or building society and says that he or she
wants their money, they will be able to get it, subject to the
necessary checks. If the money has been transferred as dormant, it will
be reclaimed by the bank from the reclaim fund, and as far as the
customer is concerned, they will just be withdrawing their money from
their bank account, as they have a right
to.</div><a name="08101446000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000443"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am not massively reassured by the
Minister&#146;s statement that the associations representing banks
and building societies are not keen for more onerous requirements to be
put on them; I had expected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>that. Nevertheless, I take his point, which is that it is difficult
specifically to define a more onerous requirement. When I moved the
amendment, that point was reasonably put to me in an intervention by
the hon. Member for Fareham.</div>
<a name="08101446000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said, all parties seem to share the overall objective of
trying to make the requirement as strong as possible, but given that it
is difficult to frame it legislatively, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000445"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 46, in
clause 11, page 7, line 3, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) Where
under the terms of the account withdrawals were prevented or there was
a penalty or other disincentive for making withdrawals, the period of
dormancy as set out in subsection (1)(a) above will start when
withdrawals can be made or when the penalty or other disincentive
expires&#146;.</div><a name="08101446000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000446"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a probing amendment on the wording of
subsection (2). I understand that if money is sitting in an account
from which withdrawals are not allowed, or if there is a penalty or a
disincentive to making withdrawals, the account cannot be deemed to be
dormant. The money will sit for ever on the bank&#146;s balance sheet
as an asset or a liability. Because the money is unlikely ever to be
declared, the bank will decide not to try to reunite it with its owner.
However, I realise that many accounts, for short periods, involve a
penalty for early withdrawal, including loss of interest. Even if those
penalties were effective for only a short time, those accounts would
never be deemed to be
dormant.</div><a name="08101446000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
looked on the internet to find some examples. I found the Alliance
&amp; Leicester eSaver issue 2 account, in which interest is foregone
in any month in which a withdrawal is made. That account would
therefore fall foul of subsection (2)(b)(ii), which states
that</div><a name="08101446000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
was a penalty or other disincentive for making
withdrawals&#148;.</div><a name="08101446000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, such an account could never be said to be
dormant.</div>
<a name="08101446000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another was a
fixed-rate bond account&#151;not at Alliance &amp;
Leicester&#151;that paid a high interest rate but with no access for
at least a year. That would fall foul of subsection
(2)(b)(i), which states that &#147;withdrawals are prevented&#148;.
I am not sure whether that is the intention of the provision, but it is
certainly the impression that it left in my mind. That is why I tabled
amendments Nos. 47 and 46, which suggest that the period of
dormancy should be calculated from the time when the penalty expires.
For the Alliance &amp; Leicester eSaver account, the period of dormancy
would start after a year, so rather than it being declared after 15
years, it would be 16 years after the account was
opened.</div><a name="08101446000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be grateful for some clarity on the thought processes behind
subsection (2).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div><a name="08101446000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000447"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall deal first with amendment No.
47, which I appreciate is probing. The amendment would delete the
words</div>
<a name="08101446000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at any time
during that period&#148;</div>
<a name="08101446000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">from subsection (2). We
understand that the intention is to clarify the fact that if an account
holder has requested no contact, or if the account is a of type that
prevents or includes a disincentive for making withdrawals, the period
for calculating dormancy can begin only once the restrictions are
lifted. We believe that the clause already achieves that, and that
omitting those words is unnecessary and makes the point less certain.
The amendment would remove the emphasis that if at any time an account
becomes subject to those restrictions, it cannot be considered
dormant.</div>
<a name="08101446000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
46 is designed to clarify the fact that a period of dormancy cannot
include any time during which any penalties or disincentives for
withdrawals apply. The hon. Member for Fareham gave several examples.
Although we agree with the intention, clause 11(2) already achieves
that effect. In the case of an account with fixed-term or no-mail
restrictions, the clause ensures that the 15-year period of inactivity
required to meet the dormancy definition cannot begin until those
restrictions have ended. These proposals are not necessary, as they
would not achieve anything that the Bill does not already ensure. I
therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08101446000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101446000448"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. He has set out why my amendments are unnecessary, and I
think that the clause is meant to achieve what my amendments are
designed to do. The only thing that slightly sticks in my own mind is
the phrase &#147;if at any time&#148;, because there may be a
one-year period when withdrawals are prevented, but the fact that there
is a one-year period means that the account cannot be declared
dormant.</div><a name="08101446000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
account may have been open for 15 years, but if at any time there was a
period when withdrawals were prevented, that account could not be made
dormant. I think that that is how the phrase &#147;if at any
time&#148; works in the context of the
clause.</div><a name="08101446000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Minister and I are on the same wavelength with what we
want to achieve, but I am not sure that the drafting of the clause
quite gets there yet. I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 47 and
not press amendment No. 46, but I hope that he will look again at the
wording of the clause to ensure that it does not inadvertently rule out
a swathe of accounts from being dormant. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="08101446000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08101446000277"></a>

Pearson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in clause 11,
page 7, line 3, at end insert &#145;in all
circumstances&#146;.</div><a name="08101446000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear that when defining dormancy as a period without
customer-initiated activity, we should not include accounts where no
activity on the account is an integral feature of it. In the case of
fixed-term accounts, whereby the money is locked in for a period of
years when no transactions are permitted without significant penalties,
the 15-year clock should start ticking only when those conditions
expire at the end of the term.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div><a name="08101446000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
covers all accounts. In the case of a fixed-term account, it ensures
that the 15-year period of inactivity required to meet the dormancy
definition cannot begin until the fixed-term restrictions have ended.
However, in respect of certain types of account that could be
considered to fall under this exclusion, such as those where a short
notice period is required before a withdrawal can be made, it has been
argued that the position is not totally clear. The hon. Member for
Fareham was getting at that point a moment
ago.</div><a name="08101446000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to make it clear that such notice accounts are eligible for
inclusion in the scheme. For those accounts, a period of 15 years
without customer-initiated activity will still be a good indicator of
dormancy, subject to the other conditions that the banks and building
societies have committed to taking into account through the banking
code. Our amendment clarifies the position to ensure that only accounts
where a genuine penalty or disincentive is applied to any withdrawal
are to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>prevented from being considered for dormant status. We hope that this
technical amendment clarifies the
situation.</div>

Although I welcome the amendment, it does not entirely remove the
objections that I referred to. Although the Minister has clarified what
the amendment is designed to do, and I think that we are working
towards the same end, I am still not sure that the wording &#147;if
