<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 93, in, page 5, line 27, after `of, insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 95, in page 5, line 34, at beginning insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. At this early hour, we are anxious to be brisk, but not perfunctory.
<P>
The amendments refer to a subject with which we all have some sympathy—the securing of adequate work experience, or, as it is entitled in the rubric to the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Links between education and training and employment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a common interest. We are anxious to deal with it in the best possible way, and not unreasonably to fetter the Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
I, like the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Foster), have taken a strong personal interest in education business partnerships. They are of great value. As my children went through their teenage years, they derived great benefit from work experience, which has opened up new horizons, and what might loosely be called social work experience, in which people with an academic or relatively privileged background have the opportunity of doing things in or for the community.
<P>
I cannot believe that the concept of the clause will cause difficulties. I should tell the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), that the specific reason for amendment No. 93 is that we want to ensure that whatever is offered by way of work experience is appropriate. I can conceive of a number of reasons why that may not happen.
<P>
First, not all young people have the same abilities, and certain types of work experience may be more suitable for some than for others. Because of my responsibility for disability issues, I have heard some disturbing stories. For example, young people with disabilities have been left behind because there has been no suitable work experience for them. It may be more difficult to organise for them than for other young people, but that it not an excuse for failing to secure such experience. That sort of discrimination is distasteful.
<P>
Secondly, we must ensure that work experience is safe, and that due regard is paid to the previous experience of young people to ensure that they do not put themselves at risk. Ministers will be aware—it has been debated in the House—that some young workers entering employment suffer accidents, even fatal accidents, in the early stages of their time at work, because training has not been offered or because the youngsters are not being worked up sufficiently. That is bound to be distressing, particularly with young people. Related questions are whether activities are suitable for young people, whether the Health and Safety Executive is involved and whether insurance is carried and by whom.
<P>
Thirdly, although it is not common, it is sometimes suggested that work experience may be considered as a source of cheap labour, as if employers were being exploitative of young people rather than offering them adequate experience. More realistically, both sides of the Committee will concede that most employers set out to offer reasonable work experience. However, it can be a rather costly and sometimes rather finicky operation to move people between departments or activities.
<P>
I flag up another point of general interest about the financing of education business partnerships. We may return to the subject in connection with the activities now carried out by training and enterprise councils and the residual assets that they may sustain. EBPs have always been part not of the private sector but of what might loosely be called the ``off formula'' activities of TECs. They may be more difficult to secure in the new arrangements unless residual private funding is available for them, or unless they can lever such funding in the new local learning and skills councils. We may want to return to the issue, but it may be helpful if the Minister gave a taste of his approach to that issue.
<P>
Amendment No. 95 is a paving amendment. Amendment No. 94 deals with the issue that has been discussed before about pushing the age limit up to 25 for young people generically. Amendment No. 96 deals specifically with the question of disabled young people.
<P>
The thinking behind the proposal for young people is to deal with situations in which they have been socially excluded or have otherwise undergone a period of difficulty. If one is trying to get them back into work, it is important that they should have a chance to see that the experience will not damage them, deeply upset them or scar them for life. One must show them that they can do it, and that they will be welcome and valuable members of society if they succeed. It is what I would call rehabilitation for them. The method could be valuable and could be a useful start if the Learning and Skills Council is able to provide resources to set up such a system.
<P>
Much the same thinking applies to disabled young people. There will be other opportunities to consider the issue of special educational needs, assessment and transition, especially with regard to clause 114. We have difficulties with the approach. Many of us with experience of the area feel that the work done by further education colleges with people—especially young people—with learning difficulties is valuable. However, it is difficult to credit and measure and, as a result, it is difficult to finance. Above all, people with learning difficulties may feel discouraged and apprehensive about entering the adult world of work. Given their difficulties, such people are entitled to a period of handicap, although that is hardly the appropriate word, and to a little consideration with regard to time limits.
<P>
I am sure that Ministers will take the same broad approach to this issue of encouraging work experience appropriate to the individual. The purpose of the subsidiary amendments is to enable the LSC at least to help with the work experience to start the relevant people off, even if there is a difficulty in moving to the age of 25 for the statutory entitlement for education and training. The same argument concerning a slightly higher and more flexible age group applies to people with disabilities, especially a learning difficulty, who may have great trouble and concern about going into the adult world and whose transition into that world needs to be handled extremely sensitively.
<P>
The amendments are intended to probe the Government's intention and are meant with good will. We are keen, in this sensitive and important area, for the Government and the new council to act as flexibly and as constructively as possible to meet the needs of the individual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I support most of what the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has said. I support in particular amendment No. 94. There is a common theme, and I echo his comments on special educational needs. Will the Minister give us some indication of the Government's thinking on the new SEN and disabilities Bill? Without seeing that legislation, it is difficult to know how this Bill fits in. For example, specific reference to young people with learning difficulties may have been deliberately omitted because it will feature in other legislation. If that is the case, we are happy to wait for an appropriate announcement.
<P>
I welcome this important clause. For many young people, work experience has been dodgy to say the least. In considering the clause and the remit of the Learning and Skills Council, we must bear in mind the need to strive for quality. From personal experience, I know that work experience is often used as an escape route for some young people and as a means of getting them out of the system in the hope that the workplace will somehow answer their particular difficulties. In some cases, it does provide such help; young people who have been exceptionally difficult in schools can suddenly blossom in a workplace, especially if it is supportive.
<P>
I am also aware from personal experience of the problems that quality employers—especially small ones—often face with insurance. A small firm, whether a garage run by a one or two man band or a small hairdresser, that employs a young person as part of a work experience package will have to pick up the associated insurance costs. Will the Minister consider that matter and provide some reassurance? The Learning and Skills Council could underwrite the insurance premiums for young people going into the workplace on approved work experience placements.
<P>
We must not return to the days of taking young people out of our schools at the age of 15. Rhodes Boyson said the other day that he thought that they should leave at the age of 14 and should be caned, although I am sure that he was not speaking for the Tory Front Bench. We must not return to those days; instead, we should emphasise the need for quality work experience. Will the Minister tell us what powers the Learning and Skills Council will have to approve and to inspect workplaces to ensure that young people receive that quality?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> I add my welcome to you, Mr. Benton.
<P>
We have a great deal of sympathy with the remarks that have been made and with Opposition Members' intentions, but we regard the amendments as unnecessary. Amendment No. 93 is identical to an amendment tabled in another place, and it is unnecessary for the reasons set out by Baroness Blackstone. It would be unreasonable for the Learning and Skills Council to secure facilities for the gaining of work experience that is inappropriate. As a general principle, and as we have discussed on a number of occasions and in various contexts, a statutory organisation must, by its own nature, act reasonably.
<P>
Amendment No. 94 is also unnecessary. One of several reasons for including work experience in the clause is to involve the Learning and Skills Council in the on-going work experience programme for young people in schools, building on the work done by training and enterprise councils. As school-age children may not work during schools hours, the young people in question would otherwise be restricted from spending time in the workplace. There are no such restrictions on people over the age of 19 and no equivalent programme for work experience. Not only would it be unnecessary to extend the upper age limit, but it would be meaningless in practical terms. One of the reasons why there are no formal work experience programmes for adult learners is that the majority of adult learning provision consists of vocational and prevocational courses, of which some form of work experience is an integral part. That applies across the board whether or not the student has learning difficulties or any other disadvantage.
<P>
I am not convinced of the rationale for amendments Nos. 95 and 96 either, partly for the same reason as I have just outlined in respect of amendment No. 94. The majority of adult learning provision—including that for people with learning disabilities or other difficulties—already includes contact with or experience of the world of work. However, we have some sympathy with the intentions behind the amendments. We all agree that work experience can be invaluable in giving young people some insight into the world of work in a variety of ways, some of which have been cogently outlined by the hon. Member for Daventry. It can be particularly valuable for people with learning difficulties or other disabilities, who sometimes encounter difficulties in taking up work experience opportunities, as we have heard.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My noble Friends in another place were able to make an important change to the Bill, which recognises this point. My noble Friend Baroness Blackstone introduced an amendment to clause 13, which requires the Learning and Skills Council to have regard to the particular needs of people with learning difficulties, especially those with assessments made under clause 114. The amendment extends the scope of the clause 13 duty to cover clause 8. Clause 13 now requires the Learning and Skills Council to have regard to the needs of people with learning difficulties and clause 114 assessments not only in discharging its main duties under clauses 2 and 3, but also in exercising its powers to fund work experience and education and business links under clause 8.
<P>
The Government amendment was welcomed and accepted in another place. It requires the Learning and Skills Council to ensure that young people with learning difficulties and/or other disabilities have access to appropriate work experience and other facilities. We believe that these changes, together with a recognition that contact with the world of work is an integral part of adult learning, make amendments Nos. 95 and 96 unnecessary.
<P>
A number of specific points were raised by Opposition Members. The hon. Member for Daventry asked about the continuation of funding for education and business partnerships. We all recognise their importance and the excellent work they have carried out. The Learning and Skills Council will be responsible for that provision, and therefore funding will be made available to secure their future.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) referred to insurance. We will look to the Learning and Skills Council to make provision for that, and we will expect them to put the appropriate mechanism in place. I recognise his point about the importance for many young people of gaining work experience in smaller companies. Obviously, smaller companies sometimes face problems in providing the infrastructure necessary for work experience placements. We will expect the Learning and Skill Council also to make provision for that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough also referred to the SEN Bill. As he will be aware, we have set out our approach on this matter, but we are unable to state at the present time when we will introduce the Bill. I think he is aware of the background on that, but I will be happy to keep the hon. Gentleman informed of any progress.
<P>
I hope that, following the explanations I have just given, the hon. Member for Daventry will now feel able to withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his specific assurances. We will want to study the Official Report to ensure that there is no lacuna. However, the duties do now appear to be adequately covered by the Learning and Skills Council. I am also grateful for his reassurances on the wider issue of the continuation of funding for partnerships via the council. Of course, what happens later in our debates on the individual budgets of local learning and skills councils will be important. However, having a commitment upfront is valuable. On the wider issues, we have a common approach.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough mentioned the SEN and disabilities Bill. We await future developments with interest. It is unfortunate that the subjects are not being taken together. However, as we have other pressing and important matters to discuss on this Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The clause gives the LSC powers to fund provision of work experience for young people aged between 15 and 19 who are engaged in learning, and to provide a range of other opportunities involving business, such as curriculum support, volunteering and teacher placements, for teachers and young people up to 19 who are in learning. Its intention, which is widely shared, is to maintain and develop existing and new initiatives that are designed to support young people's learning, to give them an insight into the world of work and to help them inform their career choices.
<P>
The LSC will have a key role in ensuring that local organisations responsible for organising and delivering education business link activities, such as education business partnerships and science and technology regional organisations, work in collaboration to provide high-quality opportunities for all young people. They must meet the needs of all schools, including primary, secondary and SEN, and business. It is clear from discussions that work experience plays an important role in the lives of learners. The LSC should encourage it. The clause is important.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Assessments and means tests</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 6, leave out lines 1 to 5.
<P>
The clause deals with two separate subjects: the assessment of providers of education—an important matter in its own right—and means testing. It is interesting that they have been combined. The amendment relates to subsection (3) and means testing, which is important and warrants exploration. This is a probing amendment to discover how LSCs will undertake means testing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Clause 9 gives the LSC powers to conduct means tests for the provision of student support, such as school and college access funds and training allowances for work-based training. It provides the LSC with powers to conduct and delegate assessment of financial circumstances to bodies such as colleges and schools. There is nothing extraordinary in that. The approach has been shown to be fair and transparent in allocating what are inevitably limited resources to those in greatest need.
<P>
Training and enterprise councils and the Further Education Funding Council provide student support according to learners' needs. For example, TECs provide training allowances and the FEFC provides access funds. Moreover, the guidance that the FEFC gives to colleges enables them to take into account a student's means in making judgments about whether he or she should receive financial help from access funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps the Minister can elucidate whether a college or an aide of the council will be subject to the same duties of confidentiality in carrying out a means test as the council has to apply to a declaration of income or other relevant circumstances. There must be a duty on the college, especially if it is in receipt of public funds, not improperly to disclose that information to third parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am happy to give that assurance. Of course colleges will be subject to that duty of confidentiality.
<P>
To continue with the present arrangements, the LSC needs the power to assess a learner's needs or to delegate that power. In some circumstances, it will be best for it to make such assessments itself, either nationally or through local LSCs. That might be the case where eligibility for some forms of student support is small and spread across a wide area. For example, should the LSC want to help some students between 16 and 19 with the cost of child care, it may be difficult to predict in advance where cases of need will arise. However, in most instances, such as in the case of access funds, research and experience shows that local institutions are often best placed to assess an individual's needs.
<P>
Of course, in discharging its powers under subsections (3) and (4), the LSC will have to be able to assure the Secretary of State and the Public Accounts Committee that money provided for the purposes of student support has been properly spent and achieves value for money. The amendment would prevent the LSC from being able to make effective arrangements for student support, which depend on providing help to those learners in the greatest need. Fewer learners would be able to access post-16 education and fewer would be able to complete their courses.
<P>
With the reassurance that I have given about confidentiality and the need to allow, for the most part, local institutions to make their own arrangements, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a short but worthwhile debate because it has enabled the Minister to explain where he believes the balance lies between local decision making and central guidance. That will prove helpful but, clearly, it must be worked out in practice. As the Committee will apprehend from the way in which I introduced the amendment, I do not propose to press it to a vote. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On the wider issues to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred in relation to means tests, the Minister has given satisfactory assurances about how the council may satisfy itself about the propriety of its micro-delivery. The clause begins with what might be termed the macro-delivery of the performance of individual colleges. It would hardly be appropriate for any Committee member to argue that performance assessment does not matter. I am sure that we will have long, serious and impassioned debates about the nature of the inspectorate and about whether colleges are doing their job or could be encouraged to do better. That is a common interest among Committee members and, therefore, the clause itself is uncontentious, although its delivery might not be.
<P>
There is always a dilemma when a publicly funded institution is not performing up to scratch. Without wishing to widen the debate unduly, an analogy with rail services occurs to me. Public money supports many rail services, and the regulator may be faced with the dilemma of whether to fine a rail operator and thereby make it increasingly impossible for it to operate effectively or to repair the deficiency in operations that formed the basis of the complaint. Many of us in politics, although perhaps not those in the wider world, will know the old slogan, which is generous in normal use but neatly reversed for politics; ``You never kick a man unless he's down.''
<P>
There is a problem with the clause regarding whether funding should be withdrawn if a college is not performing up to scratch, which would make it absolutely certain that the college would not be able to continue. I am sure that that is not what the Minister would want, although it might be necessary for the council—as the Further Education Funding Council has had to do in other cases—to grasp that nettle and arrange a transfer of undertakings to another organisation, which could bankrupt the operation and start again.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be useful if the Minister would explain how that provision might operate, especially in less extreme cases. If performance is substandard in one department or in one aspect of the activities of a college or other provider, it might not give the right signal to say, in a mechanistic way, ``This is being done rather badly, so funding will be withdrawn or attenuated.'' It might be better to say, ``We will continue the funding on the assumption that other measures will be taken, or an action plan prepared, to remedy performance.'' In my experience in education, that approach is more constructive; it is a matter of balancing the use of the carrot and of the stick.
<P>
These are sensitive issues. Without wishing to detract from the idea that proper performance assessment is necessary, and that some payment for performance related to quality is possible, I emphasise that the withdrawal of funding should not be the automatic recourse if it prevents the improvement of performance that we all support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall address the points that the hon. Member for Daventry has raised, but I want first to say a few words about why we believe that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
The clause gives the LSC power to assess the quality of the provision that it will fund and to make on-going judgments about provider performance. It is central in enabling the LSC to secure value for money and to ensure that learners are offered the highest quality provision. Assessment of provision will form a crucial part of the LSC's quality improvement strategy.
<P>
The LSC's judgments about the quality of provision will, of course, be informed by the findings of the two inspectorates. However, because the LSC will carry out inspections over a four-year inspection cycle, it will need to take steps to investigate on its own behalf the quality of the provision that it funds, for example, through the assessment of provider management and performance information.
<P>
The clause is a necessary part of the Government's aim of raising standards across post-16 education and training. The Government intend that the LSC should make public the means by which it makes assessments about providers. That is important because the provider must take the front-line responsibility for improvements in the quality of learning. If providers are to honour that front-line responsibility, it is right that the requirements that they must meet, and on which they will be judged, should be open, accessible and transparent.
<P>
The White Paper ``Learning to Succeed'' has already gone some way in setting out the Government's thinking on that issue. We believe that providers should be assessed according to, for example, the extent to which they deliver high completion and attainment rates, the extent to which they provide wide-ranging access to learning opportunities and their good management and leadership of the learning process. The Government will shortly publish a consultation document on the arrangements for improving the quality of post-16 learning. The LSC will use the results of that consultation document to develop its quality improvement strategy.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister's approach is helpful, and I look forward to seeing the consultation document. Will he bear in mind the fact that it is also important not to create the impression—perhaps partly as a result of past deficiencies in further education—that the operation is deeply intrusive? The Minister has been helpful in saying that it is primarily for the provider to put its house in order. Occasionally, however, concern has been expressed that the present FEFC, with excessively finicky requirements, may be contributing to the problem rather than its solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I can assure the hon. Member for Daventry that any procedure will have to be appropriate, so we would not expect it to do damage. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to be in any doubt about the importance that we place on the highest possible standards, or the degree of scrutiny to which all providers will be subject. I do not think that there is anything between the hon. Gentleman and me on that question, which mostly involves good managerial judgment. We expect people to be sensible of that requirement. We also expect providers to be held to the highest possible standards, which is the driving force behind the clause.
<P>
I repeat that the LSC will work closely with, and, where necessary, support providers as they seek to implement improvements. Providers that perform well and meet the LSC's quality requirements will be able to expand their provision. They will be rewarded. Those providers that do not meet the requirements will not have such opportunities, but the council will work with them in a sensitive, constructive and dedicated fashion to produce improvements.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to the balance between carrot and stick. Again, that is a matter of judgment, often local judgment. I do not want anyone to be in any doubt: we will work with providers to improve their performance, but we will not reward or support persistent failure.
<P>
As I said, higher standards of education and training will be a priority for the LSC. In my response to amendment No. 109, I explained why it is important for the LSC to have the powers to conduct means tests and to delegate means testing arrangements when it thinks fit. Means tests are an important aspect of any effective student support system, and deliver help to those who need it most. For those reasons, clause 9 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Qualifying accounts and grants</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 6, line 13, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) must publish at intervals not exceeding twelve months statistics as to the extent of holding of such accounts by individuals, provided that confidentiality relating to the state of individual accounts is maintained,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I need not detain the Committee long, although individual learning accounts are important. The Minister will recall that there was a compulsory transfer of £150 million into ILAs from past training and enterprise council funding to set up the accounts system. The amendment's formal purpose is to ensure that the council produces a proper annual report on how individual learning accounts are progressing and who is taking them up, to show whether the accounts are having a positive impact, doing their job and being effective.
<P>
This is new territory and we are still in the pilot phase, so we need to examine carefully whether the accounts are the best and most appropriate use of public money. I do not seek an advance conclusion about that, but we must judge whether the system is working. Clearly, the council's ability to report on the uptake and, although it is not made explicit in the amendment, the outcome of the ILAs, will be important. It is one thing to make provision in legislation, but another to make legislation work as intended.
<P>
I mention the second part of the amendment only because it relates to our exchanges on clause 9 and the importance of confidentiality. That is important, because we do not want statistics that can trace an individual's ownership of an account, let alone the state of that account.
<P>
More generally, it would be helpful if the Minister said a little about progress with the ILAs. I give notice that I do not intend to return to that when we debate clause stand part. As I recall, we were expecting a roll-out last month. I understand that in government there are sometimes delays. However, I hope that the Minister can assure us that they are not inordinate delays, because my understanding is that the TECs that had been offering the accounts locally have discontinued doing so. Persons who have applied to the local TEC have been put on a wait-list, pending the appointment of national contractors and the initiation of the national scheme.
<P>
I have probed some of those matters in parliamentary questions, and it is not fair to the Minister to expect him both to answer my numerous parliamentary questions and to rehearse the matter in Committee. However, it would be helpful if he gave us an idea about progress, bearing in mind the fact that people will need an assurance of continuity, so that they will not be hacked off by being placed on a wait-list until they can avail themselves of the account.
<P>
Will the Minister say a little about the nature of the accounts? We might want to refer to that again when we consider the detailed conditions for accounts under clause 96. As I understand it, they will not quite be bank accounts, but dedicated credits that can be drawn down. Their legal status is of interest, and it would be helpful if the Minister spoke about that.
<P>
This is a probing amendment in a sense. I hope that it is probing what would be the good practice of the council telling us what is going on in relation to ILAs. It is certainly probing the current position, because it is important that there is no hiatus. If the accounts are to work effectively, we need to reach the earliest possible understanding and get them up and running. As our amendment suggests, the accounts would then be properly monitored and seen to work effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I add my support to the comments made by the hon. Member for Daventry. Will the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), clarify the awarding of individual learning accounts through the university for industry? One of its key tasks currently is ownership or gatekeeper of individual learning accounts. The national framework is about to be introduced. It is sad that it is not in place while we are discussing the Bill, because Liberal Democrats feel that individual learning accounts are a sound idea. It may be that that framework could underpin—in both a figurative and a real, borrowing sense—student support through lifelong learning.
<P>
The UFI is always lurking at the margins of the Bill, without ever appearing in print. Will the Minister clarify the relationship between the UFI, individual learning accounts and the Learning and Skills Council?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> The hon. Member for Daventry has always taken a considerable interest in individual learning accounts, as his parliamentary questions show. He is right to do so, because learning accounts represent an important strand of our strategy to develop a lifelong learning society in which we need to strike the right balance between the responsibility of the state, of employers and of individuals. Of course, there are many other interested parties, such as the UFI, and many trade unions now take an active interest.
<P>
The greater part of the provisions for learning accounts falls in the fifth and final part. Clauses 96 and 97 provide the parameters of how learning accounts will operate and empower the Secretary of State to offer the incentives attached to accounts. Clause 10 simply provides for the LSC's role in relation to accounts. I look forward to a second and perhaps fuller debate on learning accounts when we come to those more substantive clauses. I shall want to deal with the issues in detail then, but I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Benton, if I spend a little time now on updating the Committee.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have made no secret of the number of accounts that have been opened through TECs. In England alone, more than 101,000 accounts had been opened by the end of February 2000 against a United Kingdom target of 100,000 accounts by April 2000, so we are more than on target. We are, rightly, proud of that achievement, which goes a significant way towards achieving the 1 million accounts promised in our manifesto.
<P>
In response to the question from the hon. Member for Daventry, a large number of TECs are continuing to offer learning accounts, but we are making interim arrangements for people living in areas where TECs are no longer offering accounts. We shall continue to publish regular statistics on the number of additional accounts opened through the national system, but we should bear in mind that, although the Bill will provide powers to enable the LSC to administer learning accounts directly, in the early stages its main role will be in promoting them, especially to the target groups that we believe will most benefit from them. The legislation will allow the Secretary of State to ask the LSC to take on a broader role for learning accounts at a later date. In the meantime, we intend that accounts will be administered through a customer service provider operated by a public-private partnership. That organisation will, under contract to my Department, hold the information required to publish statistics about learning accounts.
<P>
Implementation of the national system of accounts is progressing to timetable and I am happy to give that assurance. People can currently open accounts under the local arrangements with TECs, but from mid-June they will be able to open them through the national system and use them in September, when we hope that the Bill and the regulations made under it will enable us to offer the full range of incentives to account holders. I am happy to announce today that my Department has issued a letter of intent to the Capita Group to start the development of those services under the national system.
<P>
At all stages of the implementation process that I have outlined regular bulletins of information on the take-up of accounts will be published. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel free to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> There has been some progress on intention and even substance and we are grateful to the Minister for that. If he will continue to keep the Committee and Opposition spokesmen on the subject informed as matters develop, he will receive a warmer reception. It is not an issue of principle that divides us, but it is very important that this goes ahead. I hope that he will ensure that, until the national arrangements are in place, there will be temporary arrangements when TECs withdraw their local schemes so that no one is left hanging without access to some scheme.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Further education: governors</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 6, line 21, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The Council may only exercise the power conferred by this section in a case where it has reasonable cause to believe that the governing body of the institution is managing the affairs of the institution or discharging any duty imposed on them by them by or for the purposes of the Education Acts or this Act in a way which is having, or is likely to have, an adverse effect on
<P>
(a) the quality of education or training provided by the institution; or
<P>
(b) the proper use of public funds under the administration of the institution.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 11 provides the LSC with the power to appoint up to two additional governors to the governing body of an institution in the further education sector. The notes on clauses state that the LSC may wish to use the power if it is concerned about the way in which a college is being run—for example, if it believes that there might be mismanagement or potential mismanagement by the governing body or when there are signs that the education provision at a college is failing. Everyone would be concerned about such developments. The powers are important, and we need to examine how they will be exercised. As I said, I hope that all members of the Committee will wish to see such powers exercised in a timely fashion to deal with mismanagement.
<P>
We note that the powers in the Bill are open-ended—there are no qualifying clauses that would dictate how they are to be used. The amendment is designed to explore the case for establishing in the Bill the circumstances in which the power to appoint up to two additional governors may be used. The amendment is widely drawn and highlights—as do the Government's explanatory notes—the twin evils that are likely to result from mismanagement: an adverse effect on the quality of education and training provided by the institution, and the improper use of public funds.
<P>
The Under-Secretary may say that there is no advantage in spelling out those matters in the Bill and that it is better not to constrain the LSC, given that it may have to deal with a wide variety of circumstances. I do not want overly to anticipate his response, but were he to adopt that line of argument, it would be interesting to discover the sort of case that, in his view, should give rise to the use of those powers but would not be covered by the amendment. In any event, this is an important subject and the Under-Secretary should at least make the case for the way in which the power of appointment should be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I promise to be extremely brief, Mr. Benton. The Government claim that the Bill favours a bottom-up process, rather than a top-down process, but Ministers have so far declined invitations to explain why the measures are not of a centralising nature. As a result, we may have to adopt a different stance and invite explanation of the way in which the Bill will encourage a bottom-up process. The Under-Secretary's response to the amendment will be a good test of that principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere is almost identical in approach to an amendment tabled by his party in another place. Baroness Blackstone resisted such an approach and I shall continue to do so. However, the amendment gives us the opportunity to debate an important issue relating to governance.
<P>
It may be helpful if I briefly set out the clause's purpose. The clause will enable early intervention in cases where matters have started to go wrong and, perhaps more importantly, where immediate action may prevent matters from going wrong in the first place. More extensive powers are available to the Secretary of State in schedule 8, through which he may replace the entire governing body. One might describe that as the nuclear option. We are trying to put in place sensible mechanisms that will help solve problems more promptly and with a considerably lighter touch.
<P>
If it is to be effective, such intervention by the LSC must be swift. The Further Education and Funding Council already has the power to nominate additional governors under existing legislation, and we need do nothing in the Bill to grant the same power to the LSC. However, the power to nominate is not enough. It leaves responsibility for appointment in the hands of a governing body that may not meet for several weeks or months, thereby delaying the start of the process.
<P>
We introduced the present arrangements last October to help the FEFC deal with the very difficult circumstances that it faced at some colleges. In framing the Bill, we were mindful of recent experiences, and not just those that hit the headlines, as one or two have done. Often, it has been necessary to attempt to deal with the massive funding squeezes with which colleges were faced in the last couple of years of the previous Government. The report published earlier today by the National Audit Office, ``Managing Finances in English Further Education'', highlights the effects of those pressures in recent years. The FE sector's deficit was over £100 million in 1994–„95 and 1995–96. The Government have been able to turn that around, and in 1997–98 the sector showed a surplus for the first time. In 1999, over 50 per cent. of colleges were classified as financially healthy, but about 13 per cent. of colleges remain in the weakest category of financial health. The NAO considers that more needs to be done to improve the advice and support that is available to colleges.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins), who cannot be with us today, would no doubt remember the case of Stoke on Trent college in a neighbouring constituency in Staffordshire—an example of a governing body that had serious problems with which to contend but was able to resolve them itself. That involved the removal of the chair of governors, the principal and another senior manager. That is exactly the kind of case—in which the situation is not so serious as to warrant the intervention of the Secretary of State—where the LSC would be able to offer support and advice, perhaps by using its power to appoint additional governors. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Daventry has returned and wishes to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I apologise to the Under-Secretary for having to pop in and out to deal with another matter during his remarks.
<P>
If such governors are immediately appointed by the Secretary of State, their duty and responsibility as governors is to the governing body, not to the Secretary of State. That appears to be self-evident. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary could confirm that they will be there not to nark on their colleagues, but to support them in overcoming the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> They will certainly be there to support their colleagues and they will have the same rights and duties as other governors. Their purpose will be to help out a college that is in difficulty—generally at an early stage, rather than after things have gone catastrophically wrong, as has occasionally been the case.
<P>
Most colleges with problems will sort them out themselves, but where assistance is needed it is better for the LSC directly to appoint those with the skills required, so that they can take up post and get to work immediately. Given the existing power of nomination, that is not a radical change. It is essentially a technical measure that allows action to take place rapidly when necessary.
<P>
In contrast, the amendment would require criteria to be met before the LSC could act. It would also restrict the power to only two circumstances: where problems are adversely affecting either the quality of provision or the proper use of public funds. Of course, those are important factors, but they would not cover every possible circumstance in which it would be right and proper for the LSC to act. Most importantly, the amendment would not allow the LSC to make such appointments at the request of an institution that is in difficulty and seeking expert support and assistance from the LSC. In other words, the LSC would not be able to act proactively, including in collaboration with the college, but only reactively and where the damage is already in evidence.
<P>
The Secretary of State already has powers to intervene under section 57 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992—which is amended by the Bill—and may remove and replace individual governors, or an entire governing body if he considers that to be necessary. As is appropriate for such a sweeping power, it may be exercised only when certain preconditions have been met. It is a last resort to be used when things have gone badly wrong and drastic action is needed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry, but it is important to get this clear. Inevitably, in such circumstances, at least the beginning of a crisis situation will be in evidence. However, we need not debate those wider issues here. Can the Under-Secretary clarify when such an appointment will take place? Presumably it will be on the issuing of a letter from the council to the individual saying, ``I hereby appoint you as a governor''. There must be a duty on the council—which is implied, but not expressed in the Bill—to notify the governing body at that time that it has a new member. Normally, a person who has been appointed as a governor receives a letter from the clerk saying, ``You have become a governor of this college with immediate effect'', and then assumes the relevant liabilities.
<P>
The Bill could create an artificial situation in which, although the council had appointed a governor, an evidential argument might exist as to when that appointment had taken place, or the governing body, especially if it was in some distress, might seek to claim that it had not been told. It is important to clear this matter up, and for the Under-Secretary to give it some consideration.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Given that we are discussing circumstances in which extra support from governors will be required within days rather than weeks, the earliest notification to the college by the speediest means would be desirable. In that way, the new governors and the existing governing body could get to work as quickly as possible.
<P>
We want the LSC to have the power to intervene at an early stage, to avoid a more serious escalation, and it should not be constrained from so doing by conditions set in primary legislation. The amendment would render the provision ineffective. The hon. Gentleman may be concerned that this power represents a threat to the autonomy of colleges. I assure him and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) that that is not our intention. The LSC will not have the power to remove or replace governors. That will be a matter solely for the Secretary of State. Even in the smallest governing bodies, the LSC members will be a minority and will not be able to control proceedings on their own.
<P>
Although it is difficult to imagine the LSC using this power lightly or in wholly inappropriate circumstances, we have already provided a safeguard if that should happen. The Secretary of State will have the power to prevent the inappropriate use of powers by the LSC, by issuing directions under clause 25. We have already made it clear that if a college, or anyone else, considers that the LSC is using its powers unreasonably, it will be able to approach the Secretary of State. I hope that my explanation of the circumstances in which we expect the power to be used has satisfied any concerns that the hon. Gentleman has, and that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a short but useful debate, in which we have heard more from the Under-Secretary about the circumstances in which the Government envisage this power being used. As I hope I made clear earlier, we would like the power to be used in a timely fashion to bring about early intervention when appropriate.
<P>
It has also been useful to extract from the Under-Secretary the assurance that he gave in the light of the contribution from my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster, and the connection that he has made between the clause and the Secretary of State's directions under clause 25, and the way in which they may be used in particular circumstances. Plainly, some matters remain on which to reflect, as far as this subject is concerned, and further thought will no doubt be given to it by those interested in it. However, for the purposes of this debate and to facilitate progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is another functions clause that provides us with an opportunity for a Christmas tree approach to legislation, in which we add on everything that we would like, grind all our axes, and debate everything in which we may have a personal interest. I do not propose to abuse the Committee's time by taking that approach. However, it would be useful to obtain the Under-Secretary's response to the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 is more substantive than others in the group, and of a slightly different nature, because it would require not only the carrying out of research but its publication. I speak as one who has served on a research council and also run a reasonably substantial research charity. The business of carrying out research should, in normal circumstances, involve the publication and dissemination of the research, so that we can benefit from it. That is a sound principle, although it could be set aside if there were particular reasons of confidentiality or public interest or if it were private research—market research—carried out for another organisation. The provision need not be, as it were, universal.
<P>
There will be occasions on which there will be tensions in the public sector, and the Under-Secretary should say something about that. For example, the council might produce research on individual learning accounts that suggested that they were not going as well as had been anticipated. That would be an embarrassment to the council and to Ministers. It should not, however, be suppressed because of that embarrassment. It should come out, and the council or the relevant Minister should say, ``We got it wrong and we need to think again.'' There might be more difficult cases—such as the public-private partnerships that the Under-Secretary has mentioned—in which it might be difficult to disentangle the interests. I am not hostile to the concept of public-private partnership, but private contractors might have interests that would cause them to lean on the council not to produce the results, because those results might show that some aspect of their educational activities was not particularly constructive. That would be difficult, if the contractors were also acting in another capacity on behalf of the Government.
<P>
My key point, to which I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond, is that there should be a general presumption that if research is carried out with public money, it should be in the public domain. The Under-Secretary should set up machinery to operate in conjunction with the council, and to advise it not to use its residual powers of confidentiality to suppress information merely because it is embarrassing. Someone—I think it was an American—said that sunlight was the best disinfectant. That applies to public expenditure, and we should always deal with it in the open. That would be consonant with the approach that Ministers are trying to develop for the institutions of government. These are positive points, to which, I hope, the Under-Secretary will respond positively.
<P>
Far be it for me to speak for the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster), but he did make an interesting point. Many of us know why he is not here this morning. The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for North Swindon, is looking quizzical—I should think that the hon. Gentleman in question is involved in the local elections; it will be all hands to the pump in his constituency. The hon. Member for Worcester and I agree on the importance of further education, and have a common interest in improving the position of lecturers and others involved. There is no need to refight the battles of the last 10 years or take up pro- or anti-union positions—I hope that I am not seen as doing the latter—but I would say that there are difficulties with remuneration and conditions for people in the further education sector.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will take that matter seriously, especially the issue of how lecturers' remuneration compares with, for example, schoolteachers or those working in the private sector. The council should come up with general information on what is going on, and even offer some proactive criticism of Ministers who are not seen to be taking an interest in the position of lecturers and others. It is a matter of some concern, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will bear such friendly criticism in mind. Although it is always easier to say that from the Opposition Benches, it occasionally needs to be said.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 involves performance—it proposes that the cohort of each year should be examined to establish how many are starting or finishing an approved qualification and to monitor the sector's general performance. In a sense, that is second nature to the FEFC, and I hope that the LSC will continue the practice. As is often the case in this context, it is a matter of administration and of general educational interest. It can be hard to deliver general national vocational qualifications in the anticipated period. We often hear stories—I do not welcome them but I have learnt to live with them—that suggest that people are failing because it takes them longer than anticipated to obtain the qualification. I suspect that in fact they will eventually succeed. Attempts to elide the differences between A-levels and GNVQs may not always be the best way forward for the vocational sector. The relevant statistics should be as comprehensive and sensitive as possible.
<P>
On statistics and participation, we must ensure that remuneration is carried out on the basis of a half full rather than a half empty glass. On occasion, people will not be able to complete the qualification, and the funding methodology is not always friendly towards such uncompleted attempts. However, it may be necessary to show some friendliness towards, for example, disadvantaged people. Now that the sector is being shaken up, it is important to set off on the right track and to send the LSC the right signals.
<P>
In relation to the panoply of issues that this group of amendments raises, I doubt whether there is much that the LSC will not be able to do. I hope that it will be as open and outright as possible in relation to research, staff conditions and pay—that matter is referred to in amendment No. 120, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Worcester—and qualifications. It should also provide us with statistics about the numbers of people on courses and how many complete them. We should also bear in mind the fact that participation in education is valuable in itself, even if it does not always lead to the expected conclusion.
<P>
Although the amendments raise sensitive and important matters, they are meant to probe the Under-Secretary. I doubt whether it will be necessary to press them to a Division, but I hope that he will make it clear that he has given them some consideration.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Amendment No. 120, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Worcester, raises an important matter. A problem with, and a challenge for, the further education sector involves the quality of its work force, and their training and development. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education and Higher Educational Assistance recently published a survey of the qualifications of people who work in the sector, which showed that about 60 per cent. of part-time staff have no formal qualifications and that, among full-time staff, one in five has no formal qualifications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is strange that if one stood up in front of a class of five-year-olds in a school one would need qualified-teacher status—other than in exceptional circumstances—but anyone can lecture in further education? The Committee should recognise that that anomaly has existed for many years, but, as the Minister will no doubt say, there are welcome moves afoot to introduce a professional structure and training organisation.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. What he is saying is that for the 18 years in which his party were in control of further education, it did absolutely nothing to address such a significant issue. If the Learning and Skills Council is to achieve its objectives, which the Committee supports, training, development and career structure in the post-16 sector will be very important indeed.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will not ignore amendment No. 120; I hope that he will think about the Government's plans and support a career structure and an in-service and professional development structure in post-16 education and training. The quality of people delivering the product, whether they are in the public or the private sector, should be the best that can be offered to young, middle-aged and older people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The amendments relate to the critical issue of what the LSC will have the power or the duty to publish. The Bill must give us everything we need that is relevant to the collection and publication of information and research.
<P>
I share the hon. Gentleman's opinion on amendment No. 124, that the LSC should be able to publish any research that it carries out into education, training and other functions. We wholeheartedly subscribe to Mr. Justice Brandeis's remark about sunlight being the best disinfectant. The Further Education Funding Council for England has an important role in that respect and we expect the LSC, as the national expert organisation in post-16 learning, to continue and to build on that work. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the LSC will follow our long-standing practice of publishing all externally commissioned research unless it would be misleading for it to do so because of the quality of the research. I also assure the hon. Gentleman that, by virtue of its general powers in clause 18, the LSC does not need an explicit power in this clause to enable it to publish research.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester, who is not present today, for reasons that we are not quite clear about, but about which we can guess. I am aware of his anxieties—they were cogently expressed by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and raised by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education—about the need to support and develop the professionalism and quality of the work force in the different sectors that will deliver life-long learning. We all share those concerns and similar amendments were debated at length in another place.
<P>
I reassure all hon. Members that, as is clearly stated in the LSC prospectus, providers will have to show the local councils that their employees have appropriate, nationally recognised qualifications or at least have plans to acquire them. It is right that the LSC and the National Council for Education and Training for Wales should set high standards for providers to meet and ensure that those standards are not only maintained but improved upon. There is nothing between us on that matter. However, I am concerned that the amendments go too far. They would require publication of confidential staff information, including information on remuneration for all institutions and organisations that deliver programmes funded by the LSC. Many of those issues are matters for the organisations alone. But—and this is an important but—this does not mean that we intend to drop the LSC's existing good practice of collecting information on staff qualifications. We fully recognise the importance of this work and its continuing impact on the quality of provision.
<P>
I should like to reassure hon. Members that the Government are consulting further education and workplace training centres about the introduction of compulsory teaching training qualifications for staff. After completion of the consultation, a most likely next step will be requests to colleges and those who provide training to undertake their own audits of staff qualifications, to determine who meets our requirements. We may ask the LSC to collate the national picture in colleges, and information from providers of training may be examined by the adult learning inspectorate and Ofsted during their inspections.
<P>
To ensure quality provision, it is necessary to support an ongoing process of improvement, using the best quality management systems. Some of the information that amendments Nos. 120 and 121 would require would of course be a valuable tool. However, I do not think that making this a statutory provision would be of any value, especially given other concerns, for example, about confidentiality.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 is similar to but more tightly drawn than amendments that were debated but withdrawn during the Committee and Report stages in another place. The amendment would require the LSC to obtain and publish information about qualifications funded by the LSC and pursued by those under age 19 in institutions or through workplace learning with employers. As with the earlier amendments, amendment No. 111 is specific about the information to be gathered and published. I assure the Committee that we have considered the amendment carefully, but unfortunately have decided that it would have limited value. There exist statutory and other information requirements—for example, those imposed on FE college governing bodies by section 50 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, and the information collected and published by the Department for the 16–18 performance tables to measure progress towards the national learning targets. We think that the amendments' effect would be to overlap existing mechanisms while not replacing, or adding, proportionate value. My noble Friend Lord Bach said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we certainly intend that the LSC will be required to publish information at both local and national levels. But we do not require these provisions in primary legislation.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 13 March, 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1386].<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later this month the Department will publish for consultation an overview of the post-16 quality improvement arrangements. As part of this, we shall explore ways of assessing overall performance and the performance of providers, and examine whether it would be appropriate to assess a range of possible indicators reflecting participation, retention and achievement. I hope that that will alleviate some of the concerns of the hon. Member for Daventry. Information collected by providers and the LSC must be fit for purpose and coherent, and the overall administrative burden on providers must be kept to a minimum. The prescribing in isolation of one aspect of information requirements, namely, information about qualifications, could compromise our broader objectives. The amendment could inadvertently lead to the publication of the achievements of a single apprentice in a small business. That cannot be right, it would not meet the primary requirement of being fit for purpose. Setting such details in primary legislation could also mean delay and difficulty developing requirements over time to reflect changing circumstances and needs.
<P>
My noble Friend Lord Bach gave the noble Lady Baroness Blatch an assurance that the sort of information being sought would indeed be required, so she withdrew the amendment. I am happy to give hon. Members the same assurance today. I hope that that satisfies my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester and the hon. Gentleman, and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> These have been useful probing amendments and we have had a useful debate. I understand the Minister's difficulty in wanting to keep matters general and avoiding too many particular obligations, especially in cases where the objectives could be secured by other existing legislative arrangements. I shall not press the amendments to the vote. I am pleased that the importance of staff conditions and qualifications has been acknowledged by the Minister and across the Committee. There remain genuine areas of concern regarding performance related pay in the school sector, comparative remuneration and qualifications.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that we did not sit doing nothing when we were in government. His party, of course, has had extensive experience of having no executive responsibility. As to our stewardship, we managed to create the Further Education Development Agency and we began making progress towards what is now becoming the further education national training organisation, which deals with standards. The only caveat—it does not dilute earlier remarks—is that in further education, it may be good to pull in practitioners from the business sector to act on contract; in those circumstances, the necessary qualifications may not be evident. Equally, colleges have an obligation to ensure that they produce people who are capable of doing their jobs as teachers or instructors. We can debate those matters in other contexts.
<P>
In the light of our valuable exchanges in Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 6, line 26, after `he', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`reasonably'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 127, in page 6, line 36, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) The Secretary of State shall publish any request he makes under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment covers some of the same ground. Having listened to the Minister's responses, I am emboldened to suggest that amendment No. 112 will receive a warm response from him. He has just told us that he wishes to keep burdens—requests for information and so forth—on providers to a minimum. Amendment No. 112 would achieve precisely that, as it would require requests made by the Secretary of State to local LSCs to be reasonable. It must surely have caught the Minister's attention in view of his commitment to minimising burdens. He will be as mindful as we are of the way in which requests for information cascade down once they have been made. The council has a duty to provide the Secretary of State with information as requested, which often cascades down to providers at a lower level and becomes part and parcel of the burdens from time to time complained of by those in receipt of such requests.
<P>
Amendment No. 127 is similar. It requires the Secretary of State to publish requests made under subsection (2). The same arguments apply with the additional point this serves the interests of openness and transparency. I do not wish to be too controversial, but those qualities have been excluded by the concentrated top-down approach that runs through the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster has already drawn the Committee's attention to that important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right—amendment No. 112 did catch my eye and I did consider it but, unfortunately, I shall have to disappoint him and reject it. I want to spend a few moments explaining why, after careful consideration, we have decided to proceed without the amendment.
<P>
I should start by emphasising—as we have had to do frequently when the Opposition have sought to criticise the powers that the Bill gives the Secretary of State—that the approach in the clause differs little from the provisions in current legislation that apply to the FEFC. Section 8(1) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, which, I am sure, is at the forefront of the hon. Gentleman's mind—
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is at my fingertips.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As I thought. The hon. Gentleman will know that section 8(1), like clause 12, requires the FEFC to provide information and advice to the Secretary of State as he may require. No one would, I hope, suggest that the FEFC is put under an unreasonable burden by the Secretary of State's requests for information and advice—the hon. Gentleman is indicating assent—or that the Further Education Funding Council for Wales is unreasonably burdened by the National Assembly. The provision in clause 12 simply reflects the close working relationship that we expect between the LSC and the Secretary of State.
<P>
Under standard arrangements, the annual letter of guidance from the Secretary of State will specify the nature and extent of the information that he will request. Again, that is the standard approach towards an NDPB. The requests for information covered by clause 12(2) are, as the Government said in a debate in another place, likely to include information about progress towards the Government's national learning targets, advice on setting future targets, analysis of the learning and skills performance of England, in comparison with other countries, and information on national and local skills needs and the quality and quantity of provision that is available locally to meet learning needs.
<P>
However, it will sometimes be necessary to ask the LSC for other ad hoc information. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that ad hoc requests for information can be critical in informing the development of new policies in response to changing circumstances and the monitoring and evaluation of existing policies, which I think that we can all agree is necessary. However, a request is not unreasonable just because it is unexpected. Including an additional condition, as amendment No. 112 would do, adds nothing in practice to the relationship between the Secretary of State and the council, which must always be based on trust and co-operation. The hon. Gentleman will recognise that the Secretary of State is, as a matter of legal principle, bound to act reasonably.
<P>
That close relationship would be broken if there was an obligation to publish every request for information, as amendment No. 127 would require. In practical terms, the amendment would not make sense, because there will be regular exchanges of information and advice between the LSC and the Department. It would be a huge burden to publish that extensive exchange, which we would all want to avoid. Equally important, such a requirement could cut across good practice in relation to confidentiality. The Government's commitment to freedom of information recognises that due regard must be given to ensuring the privacy of personal and commercially important policy information, and there is nothing between us on that point. It might not always be appropriate for the Secretary of State to publish every request—for example, one that related to a future expense or other commercial in-confldence information.
<P>
In the light of those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister was right to anticipate that I would be disappointed. My disappointment is mitigated somewhat, although not as much as I would like, by his assertion that he has given the matter his careful consideration.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's response. While he was speaking about ad hoc requests for information and outlining the circumstances in which requests might flow from the Secretary of State to the council, I began to wonder about additional burdens being created lower down the line. I worried once again about the top-down approach when the Minister spoke about the close relationship between the LSC and the Secretary of State. Of course we want them to have a close and harmonious relationship, but we do not want it to be one in which decisions, requests and power come from the top to the bottom.
<P>
I will have to live with my disappointment, Mr. Benton. I am tempted to try to persuade the Committee to vote against the Minister's decision to reject the amendment. I might have some success, but I shall reflect further on it and the Committee may wish to do so too. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 6, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The Council may provide any person designated by the Secretary of State with such information as the Council thinks fit about any matter in relation to which it has a function.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 34, 39 and 40.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> These are technical amendments to put beyond doubt the ability of the LSC, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in England, the Council for Education and Training in Wales and the Qualification and Curriculum Authority for Wales to provide information to any person designated by the Secretary of State or, indeed, the National Assembly on any matter relating to the functions of these bodies.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 28 and 24 are designed to complement clauses 17 and 43, which enable the LSC and the CETW to make use of information supplied to them by any body designated by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly. Similarly, amendment No. 39 is designed to complement sections 26(2) and 32(2) of the Education Act 1997 which will enable both curriculum authorities to make use of the information supplied to them. Without these specific provisions it is doubtful whether the powers of the LSC and the CETW would be sufficient to enable them to exchange information with the relevant curriculum and qualifications bodies.
<P>
Together the four provisions will enable both councils and both curriculum authorities in England and Wales to exchange information on a range of issues to help ensure that the education and training qualifications offered are of a consistently high standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Am I right in thinking that that means that the relationships can work any one of four ways in the quadrilateral? It is open, for example, to the Welsh curriculum authority to provide information to the LSC in England or the converse. It is not simply a national relationship that is one to one in either case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am pleased to reassure the hon. Gentleman that that is the case. We are trying to ensure that the information can be shared because there is relevance between England and Wales, as well as between authorities in Wales and in England. In a sense the purpose of the provisions is to ensure that a range of issues can be exchanged so that the education and training qualifications offered are of a consistently high standard and are relevant, necessary and fit for their purpose. The exchange should also help to ensure that the awarding bodies and providers deliver a sound and professional service and that issues about financial probity can be identified and dealt with.
<P>
Concern has been expressed that the LSC and the council in Wales should not pass on information too readily to outside bodies. We have already made it clear that the data protection legislation will govern the exchange of information, so strong safeguards are in place. The provision in the amendment enabling the Secretary of State to designate bodies that should receive information both provides a further level of protection and ensures that the legislation maintains sufficient flexibility to allow the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly in Wales to designate further bodies if that proved necessary or appropriate.
<P>
Amendment No. 40 is a small change to the reference made in the Education Act 1997 necessitated by the insertion of amendment No. 39 before paragraph 32 in schedule 8.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation and the helpful reassurances he gave us about the quadrilateral nature of the relationship between the councils and the awarding bodies. Many of us have not lost our interest in civil liberties and when I looked at the text I was a little concerned about that, for the reasons that he mentioned. The Minister may wish to reflect on the matter and write to the Committee instead of giving a definitive answer now. The duties of confidentiality which apply to the heads of organisations will also apply, by definition, to the designated organisations that are in receipt of information as part of the necessary process. In addition—this is a difficult point—liability for any breach of confidentiality may lie on both organisations if one supplies it and the other misuses it or it comes out inadvertently. We should stress that although much information should be in the public domain, some should not—for example, if it relates to individuals. It is important that any powers of designation are not misinterpreted in a way that breaks the necessary requirements of confidentiality while fulfilling public policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised two important points. I am happy to be able to reassure him on both and I hope that that will assuage his fears.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 152.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> These amendments will bring about the same effect in England and Wales to make explicit the links between the responsibilities of the LSC and CETW to secure provision for people with learning difficulties, especially those with clause 114 assessments, and the provision of financial resources to providers and learners. Those links are not explicit in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. There is a presumption that the funding powers apply in respect of the duties and powers currently placed on the funding councils in respect of provision for persons with learning difficulties, but the Government believe that it would be helpful to put the matter beyond doubt for the LSC and CETW by including it in the Bill.
<P>
The amendments will draw in certain sorts of higher education at clauses 5(1)(d) and 34(1)(d) which are currently outside the scope of clauses 13 and 41—for example, courses to prepare for professional examinations at a higher level. When the LSC and CETW use their powers under clauses 5 and 34 to secure provision of education and training, they will be required to take account of the needs of people with learning difficulties.
<P>
The amendments are positive, albeit technical, and I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and if I do not respond in detail that is not because we do not wish to discuss or to emphasise the importance of adequate provision for people with learning difficulties. The amendments, rightly, widen the powers of provision and we are happy to give them a fair wind and to discuss the more substantive issues later.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I shall speak initially to Government amendments Nos. 151 and 153 and respond to amendments Nos. 114 and 115 when I have heard the Opposition's comments on them.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 151 and 153 clarify the position in respect of the responsibilities of the LSC and CETW to secure boarding accommodation. Clauses 13 and 31 require both councils to provide boarding accommodation for people with learning difficulties under the age of 25 when they cannot otherwise secure adequate standards of education and give discretion as to whether to provide such accommodation when someone is over 25.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The term ``adequate'' in clause 13, which appears in section 4(3) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, is not currently consistent with clauses 2 and 3, to which clause 13 is linked. Clauses 2 and 3 require that the LSC must secure ``proper'' education and training for those who are above the compulsory school-leaving age but below the age of 19, and ``reasonable'' education and training for those who have attained the age of 19.
<P>
The Government amendment will remove the reference to ``adequate'' education and training and make the clause consistent with clauses 2 and 3. It will maintain the obligation on the council, which is being carried forward from the 1992 Act, to secure boarding accommodation for persons under the age of 25 and the power to do so for those who are 25 or over.
<P>
The amendments that are consistent with clauses 2 and 3, and the amendments that we shall come to later that relate to Wales, require that when students have learning difficulties, the LSC and the CETW have a duty to secure boarding accommodation for such students who are over the compulsory school age but who have not attained the age of 19, if they cannot otherwise secure what would be termed ``proper'' education or training for those people. They will also ensure that the councils have a duty to secure boarding accommodation for a student who has attained the age of 19 but not the age of 25, if they cannot otherwise secure reasonable education and training for that person, which is in accordance with clause 3.
<P>
Finally, the councils may secure boarding accommodation for persons who are over the age of 25 when they cannot otherwise provide reasonable education or training for that person, which is in accordance with clause 3. As I said, amendment No. 153 will have an identical purpose for the relevant areas in Wales.
<P>
These technical amendments are designed to ensure that the wording is consistent throughout the Bill. They will not alter previous policy decisions about the provision of boarding accommodation. We continue to believe that such provision is important for some people with learning difficulties. I await the comments of Opposition Members on their amendments, but I commend the Government amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation. I have a certain affection for adequacy—we debated that matter extensively in relation to clauses 2 and 3—and it would have been a nice gesture if it had surfaced in this context. Oscar Wilde made a sound dictum about bishops—they say exactly the same things at the age of 80 as they said at the age of 18, which is what makes them so perfectly delightful. On that basis, it would be good if the Government used the same phraseology throughout the Bill—that would eliminate or reduce the risk of judicial review. The heightened or better-articulated obligation to secure boarding accommodation for persons with learning difficulties is important.
<P>
The Under-Secretary rightly said that there are two Opposition amendments. They will be familiar to him in principle because they propose changing the age qualifications. He is aware of our concerns in that regard, and I suspect that I do not need to repeat them. We welcome the Government amendment, and we hope that in later contexts he will bear in mind the spirit of our amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman welcomes the Government amendment. I shall outline our initial view of amendments Nos. 114 and 115, and hope that the hon. Gentleman will then not wish to press them. Essentially, the amendments would ensure that the LSC should have a duty in respect of persons with learning difficulties up to the age of 30 rather than 25.
<P>
Let me repeat that I am aware of the value of boarding accommodation and how it can support and benefit people with learning difficulties. However, there is a question of balance as to where to draw the line between circumstances in which the council has a duty and in which it has a power. In coming to the view that 25 is the appropriate age, the Government closely followed the precedent of the 1992 Act. That was accepted without question in extensive discussions in another place.
<P>
The duty in respect of 19 to 25-year-olds, which is outlined in the Government amendments on boarding provision, recognises that some people with learning difficulties will take longer to complete a course or be later in starting it than some of their peers. That point was acknowledge many times and strongly emphasised by my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone in another place. She made it clear that while there has to be a cut-off point for entitlement for those with learning difficulties, as indeed for others, the matter should be handled with sensitivity and common sense.
<P>
It is appropriate for me to reinforce that message here. We will continue to prepare guidance for the LSC and shall consult extensively with members of the post-16 disability consortium, among others, about how to manage the transition between the duty on the council to people under 25 and its powers in respect of people over 25. We intend that the guidance will prevent situations in which people find, on reaching the age of 25, that boarding provision is abruptly terminated before the end of their course.
<P>
We cannot give an absolute entitlement to provision to adults with learning difficulties, other than at the expense of other adults, many of whom would be potentially disadvantaged in another way.
<P>
As I have already said, the Government are sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's wish to see effective and improved arrangements, and the Bill will bring about such an improvement. However, I am not convinced that the amendment's proposal to change the age to 30 is appropriate.
<P>
I hope that my remarks will give the hon. Gentleman cause for reflection and enable him not to press the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of the Minister's helpful assurances, I do not wish to press my amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 7, line 16, leave out subsection 4.
<P>
This is essentially a probing amendment. I am concerned that the Bill may have the effect of excluding persons, perhaps from another country, who do not speak English as their native language, from being treated as having a learning disability in relation to their education or training activities. It may even stigmatise them. A person's linguistic inability in English or—as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales leaves momentarily—English and Welsh might create difficulties for them in the learning process. It is clearly important that that should be dealt with by adequate initial instruction in English, or the relevant language of education. Whether that is best secured by the clause or otherwise is debatable. Subsection (4) certainly limits the council's responsibilities in this respect.
<P>
I shall take the opportunity to flag up another concern that relates to persons with special educational needs. We should not assume that such needs necessarily relate to learning difficulties, on which the clause touches, or physical disabilities. In certain cases, persons may have long-term chronic conditions or habits that make it difficult for them to receive education or training. I am thinking of alcoholism, for example, which is not normally regarded as a disability. It is important that persons with such problems are not shunned or excluded, and that adequate provision is made for dealing with them. In no sense do I suggest that such problems are easily superable, but we must tackle them.
<P>
Moving out with the narrow definition of special educational needs and/or learning difficulties, which is the rubric of the clause, I hope that the Under-Secretary will respond sensitively to the issue of persons who experience language difficulties simply because English is not their native tongue and to those with chronic habits or other difficulties not normally defined as learning difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and his general comments on the need for sensitivity towards those with various disabilities or difficulties. Of course, I wholly appreciate that point, and we must be determined to enable all children and young people to benefit from education and training, whatever their difficulty or disability. Having said that, I cannot support the amendment, but I hope that I can to some extent reassure the hon. Gentleman in respect of our intentions.
<P>
The amendment would remove an important qualification that the clause will place on the definition of learning difficulties. The definition specifically excludes a person whose difficulties result solely from the fact that the language in which they will be taught differs from that which they use at home. That definition remains unchanged from the 1992 Act in respect of further education and was provided by the Further Education Funding Council. The qualification of the definition of learning difficulties is consistent with the legislation—section 312(3) of the Education Act 1996—that applies in schools to students with learning difficulties.
<P>
In case there is any doubt, I should point out that the definition does not refer only to people with learning disabilities or mental disabilities. People are deemed to have a learning difficulty if they have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of persons of their age, or if their disability either prevents or hinders the use of facilities that institutions generally provide. In summary, a learning difficulty is defined in terms of access to learning, and the definition is wide.
<P>
It is important that people are helped to develop their language skills. Existing arrangements in further education and work-based training already enable targeted additional support to be given to people who need to develop their language skills properly to engage in other learning or employment. That must continue, and the LSC will give the matter the attention that it deserves.
<P>
I resist the amendment because it would allow people to claim that they have a learning difficulty simply because tuition would be conducted in a language that is different from that which they speak at home. For example, under the amendment, a 17-„year-old child of a French business couple who live in England would be defined as having a learning difficulty. That would not be a sensible social policy to include in the Bill, and I doubt whether that is the intention behind the amendment. Of course, if, for example, the language used at home was sign language, provisions in clause 13 give the LSC a duty to have regard to the needs of that person, perhaps by providing access to a signer while learning. In addition, some individuals who need language support also have a learning difficulty. We will be sensitive to those circumstances.
<P>
That apart, it would not be sensible to expand the definition of learning difficulties so enormously. That would only damage the interests of people with learning difficulties as we currently understand them. It would divert resources from them and from people who also have limited mobility or difficulties seeing, hearing, concentrating or retaining information.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not appropriate that people solely with language needs should be drawn into the definition of learning difficulties and the legal provisions that underpin the LSC's support for that group. I would also have to apply that principle to other disadvantaged groups. The arrangements allow the LSC to fund a broad range of provision and the ConneXions service to provide personal adviser support. They provide a framework for learning that meets the needs of a wide range of people, including those who are disadvantaged, perhaps because of language difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I rise briefly to say that I am disappointed with the Government amendments. They fail to pick up on Lord Addington's splendid amendment in another place which had strong cross-party support, especially from Lord Baker and Lord Rix. We need to provide proper access to transport, especially for people with learning difficulties, sensory handicaps and physical impairments. It should be a key duty of the LSC to introduce mobility training. The problem for people with severe learning difficulties who lead a relatively normal life is not the ability physically to get on public transport, but the ability to have regular mobility training.
<P>
When Lord Addington and Lord Rix made that point in another place, Baroness Blackstone made it clear that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government recognise that more needs to be done to improve transport for post-16 year-olds—[Official Report, House of Lords, 10 February 2000; Vol. 608, c. 823.]<P>

and would continue to examine the issue of mobility training. Have the Government considered that problem, especially as it affects people with severe learning difficulties, sensory impairments and so on? Is it possible to reconsider the amendments that were moved in another place and to table an amendment on Report that makes it the duty of the LSC to provide facilities for mobility training?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> This is an important matter. I read the debate in another place with great care. Indeed, I discussed the subject with Lord Rix yesterday. There is no easy answer. The mobility needs of an individual will vary a great deal. The transport infrastructure and requirements will vary depending on the part of the country. I am talking not just about the particular needs of rural areas, but also, for example, of the difficulties of travelling in big cities. We must approach this in a number of ways.
<P>
As Baroness Blackstone said in another place, the LSC will be able to give mobility training. We will consider the implications of that. I would also point out that for the younger age group, 16 to 19, the development of education maintenance allowances, which we have been piloting across one third of the country, include in some of the pilots a transport element. In these pilots, we are assessing whether some incentive covering transport costs will increase participation rates. That is a general provision for students from a low-income background, but it also has relevance for students with disabilities or mobility difficulties. We are aware of the issue. It would be wrong of the Government to prescribe in the Bill or anywhere else a grand vision for post-16 education and training if, due to immobility and/or transport costs, many citizens were still denied them. I assure hon. Members that we are concerned about this problem and will be exploring the ways in which the LSC can address it. The new ConneXions service will work with the younger age group. It will provide personal advisers, who will work with those with disabilities and, in some cases, with those up to the age of 25. Its purpose is to enable students to have full access to training.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 8, line 8, leave out from `year' to end of line 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 149.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should like to say a few words in support of the amendments tabled by the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North. I hope that the Committee will welcome the simplification that the amendments are intended to achieve. Clause 15(4)(b) provides for the national council's plan for a financial year to include proposals on how it plans to keep to its budget in addition to the council's financial proposals. Clause 22(d) provides for a similar requirement to be placed on the local councils. The hon. Member for Daventry has been sent a letter stating our intention of tabling the amendment.
<P>
We think that the provisions are too prescriptive and inflexible. They perhaps give the impression that the sole objective of planning is budget monitoring. Financial accountability will be crucial, but the provisions create an overly top-down approach. Therefore, these changes are further evidence of our wish to avoid that and have a proper balance between top-down and bottom-up. I hope that hon. Members opposite will note this.
<P>
We wish to amend the clauses so that the LSC, both nationally and locally, can function in a situation where budgets may not have been finally determined by the time plans must be published, which is before the start of the financial year. As clauses 15 and 22 stand at present, by the time the LSC must produce its annual plan, it may not know its annual budget, so would not be able to state how it proposes to keep to it. Also, we need to recognise that a local council's budget may change during the year from the point when it was set out in the national council's guidance under clause 21.
<P>
I believe that the provisions relating to the national and local councils' budgets should simply require that their plans contain their financial proposals for the year. Such proposals will certainly include how the national and local councils will perform their duties with the financial resources available. I, therefore, commend the amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I cannot let this moment pass without briefly welcoming the Government's belated recognition of the need for a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. In arguing for such an approach, I am fortified by the sight of a giant inflatable figure of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) underneath a balloon on the Thames. It appears to be about to take off. I do not know what that augurs, but there we are.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I intervene briefly to ask the Minister a question. I agreed not to speak to amendment No. 99 which was grouped for consideration with amendment No. 118, which has not been moved. Nevertheless, it is important to point out that some of the expertise and experience that exists in the TECs should not be lost when the new organisation is introduced. The amendment sought to make the Government accept that training and skills should be at the heart of any attempt made by the public sector to support development or to plan or help in planning for it, especially in relation to the economy. That was one of the great successes of the TEC movement and we hope that the Minister will have cognisance of it when the new LSC is established.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I would not in any way wish to dissent from those remarks. The purpose of not moving amendment No 118 was not to diminish the importance of the subject. It was more a case of reculer pour mieux sauter. We would like to speak about the matters dealt with by the amendment on a future occasion, in relation to the local learning and skills councils.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My contribution will be brief. When my father was an undergraduate, there was a club in his college that lived its day backwards once a term. Its members would rise, drink a glass of whisky and soda, play some bridge and then eat porridge late at night. I apologise for introducing Greek into our deliberations, but it may interest hon. Members to know that the club was known as the Husteron Proteron club. I mention it because I am interested in why clause 16 features after clause 15 and not before it. Will the Minister tell us why that is the case? Some of us might think that the strategy came before the plan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before the Minister speaks, I should like to respond to my right hon. Friend's introduction of Greek into the debate. He has made what is in Latin a perfectly praeposterus suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am afraid that I cannot respond in Greek to the right hon. Gentleman's charming anecdote. I am surprised that the club was able to live its day backwards only once a year. [Interruption.] I have received a note that appears to be in Greek. As I have not received the privileges of the education from which the right hon. Gentleman benefits, I am afraid that the note is just Greek to me. Clause 16 follows clause 15 in accordance with legislative convention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is all very well for the Minister to say that the ordering is based on legislative convention and to regard that as solving the problem. There must be a reason for the legislative convention, which is, if I may say so, very odd.
<P>
My hon. Friend referred to the word ``praeposterus'', which was once explained to me in essays on Lucretius as representing someone entering a room backwards. The word ``perversus'' represented someone entering a room sideways. It is reasonable for me to say that it would be perverse if clause 16 came before clause 15 by legislative convention, although I might not say that it would be praeposterus.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 8, leave out lines 35 and 36.
<P>
We wish to probe the Government on the question of holding shares. Such matters were debated in another place. We are considering not companies held by corporations in the further education sector, but the LSC. Far be it from me to suggest that the public sector should expand itself extensively into the private sector. Ministers have private grief enough coming next week in respect of the National Air Traffic Services, but we will not debate matters in advance.
<P>
I intervene briefly to say that the matter seems somewhat contingent. It is possible for the council to acquire or dispose of land and other property almost without limit. It can and will need to secure for itself headquarters—Coventry has been suggested—and regional bases for the local councils and for other activities.
<P>
The mere introduction of a suggestion of participation in a shareholding company would require the Secretary of State's intervention. I mention that not least because the possibility is flagged up in subsection (3)(c), which I seek to delete by the amendment. That paragraph includes the reference:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or otherwise become a member of a company.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many of us involved in research or education know that many legal companies are limited by guarantee. I am a member of one such company and my obligation extends to a sum not exceeding £1 as may arise if the company is liquidated. The commitment is purely nominal. I wonder why the Government must interfere in a micro way with the holding of shares even though it is content to allow the council, apparently without limit, to discharge other duties in relation to assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As hon. Members might be aware, there was a full debate on clause 18 in another place. It was also the subject of correspondence between my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone, Lord Tope and Baroness Blatch. A point made by the noble Baroness Blatch was that the LSC's powers would be less flexible than those enjoyed by TECs, which can establish or have a significant stake in other companies without having to seek the Secretary of State's consent. It was suggested that the local councils should be able to operate in the same way as TECs have done.
<P>
I should mention in passing that the hon. Gentleman's amendments, if carried, would prevent the LSC becoming involved in companies, whether or not it had the Secretary of State's consent. I am sure that that was not his intention.
<P>
As my noble Friends explained, the starting point in framing the provisions in clause 18 was the supplementary powers secured for both the Further Education Funding Council and the Higher Education Funding Council by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The LSC, and the local councils in particular, however, will have contributions to make to local partnership working that the funding councils do not. The LSC will need to have powers to carry out some functions currently conducted by TECs. The LSC might, for example, want to take part in local economic development or regeneration initiatives. In those circumstances, a company structure would be helpful in levering in wider resources. Such arrangements should not be the norm. We would not want the LSC to engage in widespread commercial enterprises not associated with post-16 learning. We have, therefore, made the LSC's powers to hold shares in a company dependent on the Secretary of State's approval.
<P>
I share the hon. Gentleman's concern that the LSC should have all the flexibility that it needs to respond creatively to local circumstances. In response to an earlier comment of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, I should say that a close and harmonious working relationship has of itself no implications for a top-down or bottom-up approach. It is exactly what it says—a close and harmonious working relationship—and top-down or bottom-up need not enter into it.
<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Daventry that that close, working relationship will allow for prompt responses to requests from the council to hold shares in or become a member of a company. That is the flexibility that he seeks, and I hope that my assurances will enable him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I remain somewhat unconvinced. However, like the Minister, I am impatient to participate in parliamentary questions, so I shall indulge him on this occasion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
