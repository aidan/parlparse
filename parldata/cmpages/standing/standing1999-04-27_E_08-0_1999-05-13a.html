</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause gives effect to an undertaking by my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor to Lord Goodhart during the passage of the Bill in the other place.
<P>
We have discussed in Committee the notion of a contingency legal aid fund&#151;a CLAF&#151;that would offer financial help to individuals on a no-win, no-fee basis. In a successful case the fund would recover, in addition to the costs expended, a success fee to meet the costs of losing cases. At the moment, the Government take the view that, in direct competition with conditional fee arrangements, a CLAF could not be financially viable because of what is known as adverse selection. The best cases would find lawyers willing to offer conditional fee arrangements on better terms than a CLAF would offer to support the case.
<P>
I should add that, with a CLAF, lawyers will be paid whether they win, lose or draw. Perhaps not surprisingly, the profession, especially the Bar, has urged us down this route, claiming that a CLAF could be made viable. To demonstrate that we have listened to its views, we are minded to take a reserve power in clause 11(2)(c), to establish a fund along the lines of a CLAF in the event that it could prove to be necessary and workable. We have also said to the profession that if it firmly believes that such a fund could be made to work financially, it should have no difficulty convincing financial institutions to provide the necessary funds to establish and operate it.
<P>
On Report in the other place, Lord Goodhart sought an amendment to provide a statutory basis for a third party, such as an insurance company, to agree to fund litigation along the lines of a CLAF. In responding to the amendment, the Lord Chancellor accepted that there would need to be absolute clarity about whether agreements made with such a fund established in the private sector would be lawful. The ancient common law doctrines of champerty and maintenance are intended to prevent third parties who encourage actions by agreeing to finance people from commencing litigation, and sharing in its proceeds, to which they are not party.
<P>
It is important that clients funded in that way can still recover their costs from opponents if they are not successful. Except where statute law or the common law as developed by the courts otherwise provides, any agreement for such funding might be liable to challenge and might be struck down by the courts as unlawful and contrary to public policy. The Lord Chancellor therefore undertook that we would consider the terms of the amendment sought by Lord Goodhart and table one of our own. That is what we are doing today.
<P>
Proposed new section 58B of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 provides a comprehensive scheme by which the Lord Chancellor may authorise a person or body to offer what are described as litigation funding agreements. Subsection (1) provides that any litigation funding agreement that complies with the terms of the section is lawful. Subsection (2) defines a litigation funding agreement and subsection (3) establishes the conditions that apply to such an agreement. Subsection (4) provides powers by regulation to require those offering litigation funding agreements to be approved by the Lord Chancellor or someone prescribed by him.
<P>
Subsection (5) sets out certain requirements that the Lord Chancellor may apply to such an agreement by regulations under subsection (3)(d). Subsection (6) provides specific definitions of the terms ``advocacy services'' and ``litigation services'' that are to be used for the purposes of the proposed new section. Those terms are defined differently for other purposes elsewhere in the 1990 Act.
<P>
Subsection (7) provides that any regulations under the section shall not be made until the Lord Chancellor has consulted the people or organisations set out in the subsection. We believe that that will be useful to assist the Lord Chancellor before he makes any regulations authorising a person or an organisation to offer litigation funding agreements or to set terms in which such an organisation would operate. It is important that such a fund is established only after proper consultation with those who will be affected by its operation.
<P>
Subsection (8) includes provisions similar to those for conditional fee agreements under clause 29, and insurance premiums under clause 30. It will allow the fee charged by the funder to be recoverable from the other side together with other costs in successful cases.
<P>
Subsection (9) will allow provision to be made in the rules of court for the scrutiny by the courts of fees under a litigation funding agreement.
<P>
Those provisions taken together will provide a proper framework in which appropriate organisations or individuals can establish and operate a mutual fund to assist people to take proceedings. I believe that the new clause meets the aims that Lord Goodhart had in moving an amendment in the other place, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I have listened to the Minister with a certain wryness, because the new clause is a golden nugget at the end of this massive Bill. We have discussed parting from the established practices of legal aid and going down a new road, and many of us have serious reservations about the fairness of the new systems that will be introduced. The new clause represents a concession to an argument that has gone on for a long time.
<P>
The proposal could constitute the foundation of an alternative system that would have operated far better than the conditional fee agreements that the Minister has spent so much time extolling in Committee. As a principle and as a little golden nugget in the middle of what frankly resembles a large dunghill, I welcome it. However, it is difficult to understand how the proposal will have a constructive impact given that it will be married to a mish-mash of other agreements.
<P>
Such matters have been argued over many years. As I said, I have written a pamphlet on the subject, much of which was on this topic. There is clear evidence in other common-law jurisdictions that a contingency legal aid fund can provide legal services for all, but it is accepted that a problem exists with the principle of taking a proportion of someone's winnings to fund subsequent litigation. That important problem has exercised not only the Minister but the previous Lord Chancellor. Having argued that and been told that that problem exists, it is strangely ironic that that principle is now being conceded in the middle of a Bill that will take legal aid funding in a completely different direction.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): The hon. Gentleman has mentioned his pamphlet several times, and I am truly interested in it. Can we see a copy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall send the hon. Gentleman a copy. I am afraid that I do not have one with me. I am sure that there are several copies in my Room in the House and in all sorts of nooks and crannies in my chambers. There are probably several copies mouldering away on my shelves at home. It was produced in 1994 or 1995, but&#151;like most pamphlets&#151;there are a few remaindered copies, and I shall happily distribute them to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Signed, I hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It might be argued that unsigned copies are more valuable.
<P>
I welcome the new clause, but it is difficult to understand&#151;I look forward to the Minister's comments&#151;how it can work in competition with other systems, because the problem of cherry picking, which concerned us on conditional fee agreements, will apply. If the CLAF is to work, it is important that the funding mechanism ensures that the capital is built up from successful cases.
<P>
The proposal could have succeeded on its own but, inserted into a set of rules that provide alternatives for easier cases, it will not do so. I regret that. One benefit, however, may be that the provision will be in statute and if, as I fear, there are problems with legal aid and the operation of conditional fee agreements, perhaps someone&#151;along the lines set out in my pamphlet&#151;will dust down the clause and think creatively about how it could be expanded to replace the edifice created by the Government for legal aid.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I welcome the new clause, which was introduced at the behest of my noble and learned Friend, Lord Goodhart. We pressed the Government to proceed with a contingency legal aid fund in preference to conditional fees because it does not suffer the same conflicts of interest that are so rife in conditional fees arrangements. Conflicts of interest not only manifest themselves between the solicitor and the client, but between the solicitor, client and the insurer.
<P>
Unfortunately, for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), I do not hold out great hope that a contingency legal aid fund will be a success because conditional fee agreements will take the best and most winnable cases. As a result of what the hon. Gentleman described as cherry picking, a CLAF will not prosper. It would have been in the interests of justice and of the public if a CLAF had been used in preference to conditional fee agreements.
<P>
The conditional legal aid fund is in direct conflict with conditional fee agreements and, regrettably, the Government have not sought to promote CLAF over CFAs. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the Lord Chancellor has honoured his undertaking, and I also welcome the introduction of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield described the clause as a golden nugget, but who is supposed to provide the gold? He has always argued that it is for the taxpayer to provide the underpinning for any fund, but the Government are not persuaded that that should be the case. The new clause leaves it open for the Bar Council or any other organisation that wants to fund a CLAF to be able to do so. I have made that offer to the Bar and I repeat it today: if it wishes to run the risk of seeing whether its confidence in such a fund is merited, it has the opportunity to do so&#151;assuming that the new clause is accepted.
<P>
The hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) sounded logical when explaining the benefits of a CLAF, but they are not seeing their logic through. If they are really saying that the only way in which a CLAF could operate successfully is by eliminating the use of conditional fee agreements, they should say so. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon implied that conditional fees would have to be made illegal, so that everyone would be forced to use a CLAF.
<P>
Our objection to a CLAF is that good cases will be taken on conditional fees and bad cases will be left to go through a CLAF. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield conceded that point, but why should the taxpayer fund such a scheme when there is a proper way of dealing with cases through CFAs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The point of our putting forward a CLAF as a suitable alternative is that the system should be self-funding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman needs to apply his mind a little further and think about the problems that could arise. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield began to spell them out, saying that the good cases would be taken on conditional fee arrangements and the less strong cases would be put through the CLAF. The Government have some doubt as to whether a CLAF would be financially viable. If the Bar or any other organisation, perhaps even the Liberal Democrats, thinks that such a CLAF can be made to work successfully, the clause enables them of doing so.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 235.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> New clause 39 and amendment No. 235 amend the Supreme Court Act 1981 to enable the High Court to set an appropriate penalty when a magistrates court or the Crown court has unlawfully passed a sentence of imprisonment or detention on a fine defaulter. The change is required because of a loophole in section 43 of the 1981 Act, which came to light in a recent judgment by Lord Justice Brooke and Mr. Justice Sedley in the case of Regina v. St. Helens Justices, ex parte Marlene Ann Jones and others. Section 43 of the 1981 Act stipulates that, instead of quashing a conviction that has wrongfully been imposed by a lower court, the High Court may amend it by substituting any sentence that the lower court has the power to impose.
<P>
Prior to a number of judicial reviews in October 1998, the Treasury Solicitor, who represented the justices in fine-default cases, had been relying on section 43 to give the High Court the jurisdiction to quash the invalid committal sentence and to substitute another sentence. In the St. Helens case, that was held to be wrong; but Lord Justice Brooke reached that decision with regret. He concluded that the position that had been uncovered should be remedied at the earliest practicable moment. I understand that a number of similar cases in the Crown Office remain to be resolved.
<P>
The new clause will allow the High Court to quash the incorrect committal and reconsider the case, in the light of the present circumstances, of the wrongfully committed offender. The High Court will be able to remit the original fine, or if it does not consider it right to remit all of it, to remit part of the fine and to make a further order. Any sentence imposed by the High Court will, unless it otherwise directs, be treated as having begun when the person was committed by the lower court, except that the High Court will be able to disregard any time during which the offender was released on bail. Amendment no. 235 ensures that the provisions will come into force two months after Royal Assent.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new schedule 2&#151;Powers of Law Society&#151;and Government amendments No. 226 and 227.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> New clause 40 inserts new schedule 2 into the Bill. The purpose of the schedule is to extend the powers of the Law Society in relation to the practice, conduct and discipline of solicitors and clerks.
<P>
The Immigration and Asylum Bill currently before Parliament establishes an Immigration Services Commissioner. The commissioner will have certain powers to investigate persons registered with him. Solicitors will not have to register with the commissioner; the Law Society will continue its regulatory function and investigate solicitors suspected of professional misconduct. We aim to give the Law Society similar powers to those given to the Immigration Services Commissioner and to bring its investigative powers up to date. It is in the public interest that the Law Society should have those increased powers, so that it can deal effectively and efficiently with complaints, not only about immigration cases but across the whole spectrum of cases dealt with by solicitors.
<P>
I shall explain some of the key paragraphs in the new schedule. Paragraph 1 amends section 31 of the Solicitors Act 1974, which gives the Law Society the power to make rules on professional practice, conduct and discipline. The change will give the Law Society the power to monitor compliance by solicitors with those rules.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `.&#151;(1) Where on the date of coming into force of this Act a courthouse is provided by a paying authority, under section 56 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997, the Magistrates' Courts Committee shall presume that there is a continuing need for accommodation within the district of each paying authority.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Nothing infuriates Members of the House more than the summary and arbitrary closure of magistrates courts. Most Members will agree that justice should be done locally, and be seen to be done locally. One of the advantages of having local magistrates courts is that the magistracy knows the area and understands the inherent difficulties and problems of those who live there. It is too easy to steamroller through the closure of magistrates courts. My views are shared not only by many hon. Members but by the unpaid magistracy, many councillors and by the majority of our fellow citizens.
<P>
New clause 1 would make the following changes. First, when considering the closure of a magistrates court, a magistrates courts committee should presume that there is a continuing need for the court within the district of the paying authority. That presumption can and often will be rebutted. Presumptions are not new to legislation, and a useful analogy can be drawn from town and country planning Acts, particularly from planning policy guidance notes, which often refer to presumptions.
<P>
The presumption means simply that the burden of proof, presumably on the balance of probability, rests with those who assert that a court should be closed. For example, reverting to the analogy of planning policy guidance notes and planning procedure, the presumption is that no development should take place in a national park. That does not mean that no development ever takes place there; the presumption can be and often is rebutted. The new clause will ensure that the burden of justifying the closure of a magistrates court rests with those seeking the closure.
<P>
Subsection (2) would extend that presumption, with appeals against closure going to the Lord Chancellor. Subsection (3) would enable an appeal against the closure of a magistrates court to be made not only by the paying authority, but by any local authority whose residents are or may be affected by the decision to close the court.
<P>
I concede that the new clause needs tightening up. I intend that not only the paying authority&#151;usually the county council&#151;but also the district, borough, town and parish councils in the area where the court is sited should have the right to appeal against a decision of the magistrates courts committee to close a court. I am sure that members of the Committee would agree that it is important that district, borough, town and parish councils have a say in such proposals for closures. They usually know better than the paying authorities the importance or otherwise of their local courts to their districts, boroughs or parishes, and should have a right to appeal such proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I should like to make it clear that magistrates courts are never closed summarily or arbitrarily. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the exhaustive, if not exhausting, process that must be followed under the relevant legislation before such a decision is taken. Such decisions are local. They are made by local magistrates who sit on the local magistrates courts committee. It is perhaps rather ironic that a representative of a party that claims to believe in local decision making is trying to strengthen the hand of central Government in this respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am trying to strengthen the hand of magistrates courts committees by introducing the presumption to which I have referred. Furthermore, I am also trying to strengthen local government by giving authorities or councils other than paying authorities rights to appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Let us examine that in the context of the existing legislation. Proposed new subsection (1) would restrict magistrates courts committees' discretion to alter their courthouse locations at any point in future. Whether that alteration is made because of a lack of facilities, a lack of business locally or to accommodate the movement of the local population over time&#151;which is often the main reason for a change&#151;it would also hamper the efficient disposal of business, and increase delays. Under proposed new subsection (2), which would require the presumption of a continuing need for the courthouse, the appeal process would be at best circumvented, and at worst obviated. That would encroach on the Lord Chancellor's discretion as the appellate authority, and would interfere with due process.
<P>
Section 56(3) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1997 applies the existing appeal mechanism to a variety of issues, such as courthouse closures, court office closures, the reduction in the service offered at a courthouse or court office, the overall budget that the magistrates courts committees sets and the proposed siting of new premises for the magistrates courts committee. The new clause would therefore affect several types of appeal.
<P>
The existing legislation was deliberately drafted to provide paying authorities with a remedy against decisions in light of their financial contribution. Proposed new subsection (3) makes no distinction on the subject of the appeal. However, it would not be appropriate for an authority that makes no financial contribution to have appeal rights against the budget set or the salary of senior magistrates courts staff, for example.
<P>
Exercising the right of appeal would not necessarily mean greater scrutiny of the arguments that the parties involved would advance. Encouraging greater communication and co-operation between local authorities might, perhaps, be a more positive step.
<P>
The new clause is not in keeping with the spirit of the Bill. The Government are advocating a more strategic approach to criminal justice, coupled with the removal of restrictive jurisdictional practices in order to bring magistrates courts more closely in line with other criminal justice agencies. The new clause would give the right of appeal to councils for matters that other paying authorities already cover. I doubt that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon has discussed the matter with paying authorities, because I suspect that they would not welcome non-paying authorities having the same rights of appeal. Perhaps I am unnecessarily suspicious, but the little I know of local government tends to confirm that view. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Unfortunately, we are in a Committee in which the preponderance of votes are on the other side.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I do not want to repeat the arguments on Queen's counsels that I made the other day, but I will say that the new clause attempts to introduce some common sense into the use of QCs by bringing them within the overriding objective of the new civil justice rules. New rule 1 states that the civil justice system should work within the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``overriding objective . . . to deal with cases justly.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Dealing with a case justly is further defined by the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``so far as is practicable'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
ensuring that parties are on an equal footing, expense is saved, cases are dealt with proportionately, expeditiously and fairly and that the court actively manages cases to achieve those objectives.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
New rule 1 therefore already provides considerable restrictions within proportionality&#151;for example, on the use of experts in court and on disclosure, which used to be called discovery. It seems only fair that we should also look at the extent to which legal representation can militate against proportionality if QCs and two or more counsel are being used in the wrong sort of case, creating substantial unfairness.
<P>
I mentioned Sir Gavin Lightman in our previous sitting. One would think that, in the spirit of the new Woolf rules, the courts would already be operating the procedure on QCs, but that is unfortunately not the case. The Lawyer of 3 May reports that the issue has come before the courts:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the Chancery Division of the High Court Mr Justice Neuberger refused, under the new equal footing rules, an application which would have stopped one side instructing a QC''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
where the person applying for the order was legally aided. Such a person would therefore be at a considerable disadvantage. We do not have equality of alms in court through the procedural fairness and proportionality that the Woolf reforms purport to introduce.
<P>
If we restrict the use of experts, we should also look at the use of counsel, which can often knock the cost of using experts into a cocked hat.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am intrigued by the linking of the new clause with new clause 6. If new clause 6 were agreed, new clause 4 would be redundant on the cost issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am not sure that it would, because of the provision on two or more counsel. The arguments that I made the other day about the way in which the use of QCs operates disproportionately to put pressure on the non-QC party&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;also need addressing. It is not just an issue of costs; the overriding objective also deals with putting parties on an equal footing and dealing with cases proportionately. That is where the hon. Gentleman's argument falls down. If QCs or two or more counsel are used, the court should use its active case management role to approve that in advance to ensure the objects of the new civil justice rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I tend to agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that there is an obvious connection between the new clause and new clause 6. If my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) will be patient, I can assist him a little more on new clause 6 than I can on the new clause 4.
<P>
We have discussed many of the issues on QCs at length. It may not therefore come as a complete surprise to my hon. Friend to learn that the Government cannot accept the new clause. There are principled arguments against it, but it also presents drafting difficulties. The new clause appears to be aimed at civil cases but would probably also catch criminal cases; I do not know whether that was my hon. Friend's intention. Secondly, the use of the term ``counsel'' would presumably restrict the effect of the new clause to barristers. It would allow a party to instruct only one barrister without leave of the court, without preventing the same party from instruction of countless solicitor advocates. Again, I am sure that that was not my hon. Friend's intention but that would be its effect.
<P>
My hon. Friend seeks to limit the number of advocates who may be involved in a case, but he has not so far proposed that the number of litigators should be similarly limited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Does the Minister agree that one of the big changes in recent years, and a reason why in the old days instruction to leading and junior counsel was more common, is the absence of the litigation back-up that is now routinely provided through solicitors' offices?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. Gentleman has an advantage over me in that respect, but I suspect that that is broadly correct. Even assuming that the principle of new clause 4 is intended to apply to all advocates and only to civil cases, the Government cannot support the principle because, instead of promoting fairness, it could raise costs and place an extra burden on the courts and the judiciary at precisely the time when the Government are making every effort to simplify court procedures.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon acknowledged on Tuesday, some cases require a Queen's counsel and the Government do not propose to burden the courts by requiring QCs to seek a licence for every case in which they appear, regardless of its merits. It is part of the code of conduct for the Bar that a barrister must consider, on the basis of his experience and seniority, and on the circumstances of the case, whether the client's best interests would be served by instructing or continuing to instruct that barrister. The code also requires the barrister to consider whether the client's best interests would be served by representing the client in combination with other advocates. It is potentially a matter of misconduct for a Queen's counsel to retain instructions in a case that does not merit such representation.
<P>
I recognise that there is a problem of the ordinary citizen being faced by a corporation with seemingly limitless resources. If the corporation's case merits representation by Queen's counsel, so be it, but the ordinary citizen is protected from having to pay excessive costs if he or she loses. The new civil procedure rules specifically require the court, when deciding the amount of costs, to have regard to what is proportionate for the particular case.
<P>
An additional provision at this stage might serve only to fetter the judges' discretion. However, as I shall make it clear in our debate on new clause 6, the Government expect judges to be robust about the application of the principle of proportionality in relation to costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas (Clwyd, West):</B> I understand the logic of my hon. Friend the Minister's remarks that the sanctions to costs will be a disincentive to the inappropriate use of silks, but is he entirely satisfied that that will be the case if one is dealing with a large corporation with bottomless pocket? Surely that will not be a real disincentive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> That is why the new rules will give judges considerable powers to prescribe the nature of the use of advocates. That is inherent in the new case management rules. It is a matter for judges, but provided that they are robust in the application of the new rules, that problem will be much less than it is now. In those circumstances, I urge my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I fail to see how the amendment would result in increased costs. The other problem is that it deals with the quality of alms as well as the question of costs. Litigation back-up is already dealt with by proportionality under the Woolf rules. In view of the carrot that my hon. Friend the Minister has dangled before me on new clause 6, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is probably building on the substantive arguments that we had on the previous motion, so I shall try to be brief. The new clause would, in effect, take the letters ``QC'' out of the price-fixing mechanism. If a barrister is good enough, payment should be assessed by reference to his forensic skills, not this post nominal letters.
<P>
We talked about the kitemark, and if the Bar is right about that issue, it will make no difference to a QC's earnings. However, if I am right and the kitemark is nothing more than a cover story for the anti-competitive, forensic, price-maintenance plot that I believe it to be, costs will come down and the artificial inflation of the market will be removed.
<P>
I think that we are moving towards that in relation to legal aid, and I hope that we shall move towards it through the Crown Prosecution Service. I await my hon. Friend's delivery of the carrot with great anticipation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> My hon. Friend clearly has a future career not only as a Member of Parliament but as a phrase-maker for Millbank.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> The hon. Member for Hendon is not exactly on-message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I think that that depends on what I say in response to the new clause.
<P>
I have considerable sympathy with the concerns of my honourable Friends that silks should not receive more merely by reason of their status. We entirely agree that lawyers should be paid for the weight and complexity of the work that they have undertaken and not simply because of who or what they are. The Government are more than happy to consider suggestions to help to control the costs of going to law. This Bill is about improving access to justice. It is not an exaggeration to say that possibly the single biggest obstacle to justice is the high cost of employing lawyers.
<P>
I cannot accept the new clause as it stands. There already exist sufficient powers to cure the problem that has been highlighted through the rules of court. The present rules should ensure that the amounts being claimed are related to the work that has been done. The civil procedural rules that came into force on 26 April already provide that where costs are awarded to a successful party&#151;and they are to be assessed on what is known as the standard basis&#151;the court should be applying a threefold test. First, it must have been reasonable to incur the expense at all. Secondly, the sum being claimed must itself be reasonable in amount. Thirdly&#151;this is a new provision which was central to the changes made in the new rules&#151;the amount must be proportionate to the issues at stake and the complexity of the case. The burden of proof is on the party seeking costs to show that the sum being claimed passes these tests.
<P>
If these tests are applied robustly, they ought to be sufficient to meet my hon. Friend's concerns, but if he believes that we may need to go further, I am more than happy to consider with him what more might be needed. I am conscious that the position of silks claiming more by reason of their status sits uncomfortably in the new court culture where limiting costs is an avowed aim and proportionality is a consideration.
<P>
For this reason I would wish to consider the concerns behind the new clause with my hon. Friends to determine whether some of those concerns can be met by drafting rules of court, requiring courts to address specifically the use of counsel.
<P>
I hope that in the light of my remarks, my hon. Friend will not press his new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for saying that we need to consider the rules of court. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 8&#151;Register of judicial interests&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) The Lord Chancellor shall appoint a Registrar of Judicial Interests;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(2) The Lord Chancellor shall by order require every member of the judiciary to notify to the Registrar such particulars of his pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests and in such manner as the Lord Chancellor shall by order specify together with any alterations which may occur therein;
<P>
	(3) The Registrar shall cause these particulars to be entered in a Register of Judicial Interests which shall be available for inspection by the public in such places and at such times as the Lord Chancellor shall by order specify.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I shall be a little longer discussing these new clauses. There are three reasons why we should have a judicial appointments commission: first, because of the unrepresentative nature of the present bench, which is a product of the existing system; secondly, because of the changing and increasingly political role of judges&#151;with a big or small ``p''; and, thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, because of the need to maintain public confidence in the judiciary.
<P>
On the nature of the present judiciary, it is not just a matter of the Bar making occasional out-of-touch racist, sexist or homophobic pronouncements at dinner parties. Only a few judges tell jokes in such bad taste. It is more a question of the make-up of the judiciary itself.
<P>
I asked a series of parliamentary questions to get the up-to-date position. For example, on the gender and race balance on the bench, the House of Lords scores nil points, having no women and no one from ethnic minorities. The Court of Appeal scores only one point, having only one woman and no ethnic minorities. There are only seven women in the High Court and no ethnic minorities, and there are only four ethnic minority and 36 women circuit judges out of 562. No High Court masters are either women or from ethnic minorities, and there is only one ethnic minority stipendiary magistrate.
<P>
There is also the issue of age and background. I understand that the average age of High Court judges is 59 and, for circuit judges, it is 58. Both categories of judges spend almost 30 years practising primarily as barristers.
<P>
I understand from parliamentary questions that, last November, 247 judges were freemasons. That position seems to be getting worse because, by March 1999, the number had increased to 263. It is not surprising that we receive calls from several quarters&#151;including, most recently, the Society of Black Lawyers&#151;for action to redress that balance. One problem is that race and sex discrimination legislation does not apply to judicial appointments because, if it did, it would probably outlaw the secret sounding system that creates many difficulties and hinders progress.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I received a letter from a former Labour Member of Parliament who had applied for a judicial position. To give the Committee the flavour of the peculiar interviews that take place, my correspondent wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I was horrified on the frequently asked question . . . when I was asked whether I objected to administering Conservative Party law, no doubt because of my antecedents.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> That is a most extraordinary expression.There is no such thing as Conservative party law or Labour party law; it is either the law of England or it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. That was the point made by my correspondent. But he was asked that question when he attended the interview, which is what he objects to, as I do and, I believe the hon. Gentleman does.
<P>
I welcome the changes made so far and the publication, the Solicitors Journal, of 26 March 1998 made some good points. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In introducing the principle of advertising judicial appointments, including vacancies on the High Court bench . . . has done much to open up the process, at least in theory, to a wider pool of candidates . . . Although these moves towards a more open and transparent judicial appointments system are welcome, they are not a complete answer. They have helped to produce a wider spread of applicants, but the process of widening the overall composition of the judiciary is painfully slow.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It said that such matters amount to little more than ``tinkering with the system.'' I question whether 30 years as an advocate necessarily produces the best judges.
<P>
My second argument concerns the increasingly political role of judges and I found myself in strange company when adopting the arguments advanced by Lord Patten in the other place on 1 March 1999 and in his article in The Times on 16 March 1999. He identified four reasons for the way in which the judges are appointed. He mentioned first the substantial growth in judicial review; secondly, the incorporation into United Kingdom law of the rights under the European Convention on Human Rights in the new legislation that will put judges increasingly into political roles and, thirdly, the new relationship with the regions, in particular Scotland and Wales through the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. That could create a further political role for judges in that the House of Lords will, in effect, become a constitutional court.
<P>
Lord Patten's fourth reason was the considerable growth in judicial activism on, for example, moral issues. As he said, we need to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``build in more checks and balances, to guarantee that no one group of people, in this case our judges, become over-mighty subjects. The best way to start on this process is to ensure that our judges are closely scrutinised.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> May I add to my hon. Friend's enunciation of arguments for the commission? We have heard much about how the position of the Lord Chancellor bestrides all three strands of power in the country. Would not the commission introduce a buffer separating the independence of the judiciary from the other powers of the Lord Chancellor as a representative of Parliament and the Executive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> My hon. Friend's intelligent and interesting point supports my argument as does overseas experience. I refer to a book by Kate Malleson entitled ``The New Judiciary'', in which she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The experience of other judiciaries suggests that the link between growing judicial activism and the use of commission is a very strong one. A recurring theme in many countries has been the pressure for the judicial appointments system to be secure from partisan political pressure while at the same time more open and accountable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She goes on to describe experiences in other common law jurisdictions, such as India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States of America where it has become common.
<P>
The third argument is public confidence. The public are worried about distant and unrepresentative people on the bench and about the political pronouncements and loony sayings that they sometimes make. It is not only the Pinochet case that has brought the issues into focus, but the lack of accountability in relation to the interests of judges, which I shall talk about later. I also pray in aid a Labour party policy document from 1995, in which we say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The system for selecting and training those who preside as judges in civil and criminal cases must command public confidence. Winning this confidence is crucial to giving the public a real sense that justice is accessible through the courts. We are committed to the development of . . . a Judicial . . . Appointments . . . Commission''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> I follow my hon. Friend's eloquent flow on the subject with great interest. There is strength in his argument, especially in regard to the need to preserve the independence of the judiciary, which the new clause would go some way to doing. If such a commission were set up, how would parliamentary accountability be protected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I shall probably come on to that matter shortly. I am not necessarily saying that the model that I have put forward is the best one, but it draws on experience from Canada that has proved successful in achieving accountability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> What would be the method of achieving a degree of parliamentary accountability and scrutiny of the activities of the judicial appointments commission? Perhaps my hon. Friend does not perceive that as an issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I understand the point that my hon. Friend makes, and I know that there have been arguments about the need for a Select Committee to scrutinise senior appointments. I am concerned to maintain the separation of the judiciary and the legislature, and the new clause would do so while opening up appointments to public scrutiny and achieving parliamentary supervision through the Lord Chancellor as at present. I am happy to consider other ideas if hon. Members have better ones.
<P>
I shall continue my argument on public confidence by referring to my early-day motion on the issue, which attracted the support of more than 100 Members.
<P>
The arguments for a judicial appointments commission do not mean that we should move away from appointment on merit. I agree with the Lord Chancellor, who said in another place on 1 March that we must appoint those who best meet the criteria. What criteria should we apply to appointments? My new clause suggests that the commission could consider those criteria, perhaps adopting the suggestion made by Lord Borrie in the House of Lords on 1 March to open up the flow of talent to include tribunal chairs. As examples, 12 out of 46 social security commissioners are women, as are 209 out of 686 social security appeal chairmen. More than half of part-time employment tribunal chairmen are solicitors. All those people are gaining judicial experience, yet they are trapped by the glass ceiling that prevents them from moving into the judiciary proper. Unfortunately no statistics on ethnicity are kept, but my experience is that ethnic minorities are more represented in those fields.
<P>
Similarly, we could consider promoting district judges higher up the system, and perhaps consider academics as well. I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General, who used to be an academic, would agree.
<P>
Judicial appointments should cease to be part of the Bar's pension scheme, as they have in many ways become. One successful junior who I used to instruct&#151;he used to knock spots off QCs&#151;had not made any pension arrangements. He discovered that the only way to get a pension scheme was to join the judiciary, although he would have preferred to stay in practice.
<P>
A judicial appointments commission would work only if it were more representative. We could consider the suggestions that I made as to who should be on the commission, and perhaps draw on the overseas experience of such commissions. I understand from a research paper that women make up the majority of new judges in France and Italy and that the numbers of female judges are increasing in other European countries surveyed. Continental experience suggests that involving lower-ranking judges in the appointments process may encourage an increase in the appointment to the bench of women and people from miniorities and non-traditional educational backgrounds. We have much to learn from other common-law jurisdictions and the continental experience.
<P>
The model that I propose is based on the Canadian system, which is fairly effective. I have relied on the piece written by Neil Addison in The Times. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Judges are appointed by . . . the Attorney -General but only after they have been recommended for appointment by a Judicial Appointments Committee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those committees consider various criteria, including&#151;I am pleased to say&#151;``politeness and tact'',
<P>
which is sometimes lacking in the judiciary.
<P>
Under the new clause, we could draw on both experiences. We could involve the wider public and make the process more open and the criteria more objective. We could produce a panel from which the selections could be made.
<P>
A judicial appointments commission should assess judicial performance. A research note written in April simply states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There are some judges before whom a Plaintiff's legal team abandons hope before entering the court room.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has been my experience with one or two judges. My heart sank when I knew that some of my cases had been drawn to appear before them. I know that various good lawyer guides monitor judicial performance and produce league tables almost annually. Perhaps the time has come to formalise that under a judicial appointments commission.
<P>
A few years ago, a Society of Labour Lawyers pamphlet stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is hard to think of a more important issue than the selection of those who are to judge over their fellow citizens. Those standards have not been assisted by the present secretive methods of selection and the restricted range of people from amongst whom judges are chosen. As public expectations of the judiciary increase, so does the public need to be reassured about selection, and the training, of its judges.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 8 deals with the register of judicial interests. That is a matter of public confidence. The current system is not succeeding. Again, it is a matter not only of the Pinochet case, freemasons, or the recent investigation in The Sunday Times, which contained serious allegations about judges' business interests that apparently breach the guidelines, but of the judiciary's apparent complacency in the face of public concern.
<P>
Conflicts of interests will now be considered because of the Pinochet case, which caused much debate in the quality press and elsewhere. In a written answer in the other place, the Lord Chancellor told Lord Lamont of Lerwick that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is proposed that members''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of an Appeal Committee
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will consider together whether any of their number might appear to be subject to a conflict of interests; and, in order to ensure the impartiality, and the appearance of impartiality of the Committee, to require any Law Lord to disclose any such circumstances to the parties and not sit if any party objects and the Committee so determines.&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 11 January 1999; Vol. 596, c. WA 12.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not a satisfactory response. It is like hon. Members chatting among ourselves in the Tea Room, asking, ``Have you got an interest?'' and, if so, deciding privately whether or not to declare it before speaking in a debate.
<P>
The revelations in The Sunday Times, which appeared in a half-page article under a banner headline, raise some serious concerns about judges' business interests. I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions about them. I have found out that judges are allowed to hold shares and manage their family estates, but it seems that some judges go beyond that, given those revelations.
<P>
There are no controls over part-time judges, who are likely to be the biggest problem because, by definition, they have outside interests. I requested information about the extent of the outside interests of members of the judiciary, but was told that the information is simply not collected.
<P>
It is for the judge to recognise a possible conflict of interest and inform the parties concerned, but that does not deal with the point. After the publication of the article in The Sunday Times, I received correspondence from someone who was the subject of such a decision, and he certainly did not think that justice had been done.
<P>
Worst of all, there has been a knee-jerk reaction to the Pinochet case. The Judges' Council of the Supreme Court has issued an edict that any campaigning lawyer faces a ban from sitting on the Bench. That includes those who belong not only to Liberty or Justice, but to organisations such as the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, of which I am a member, and the parallel organisation that works for defendants' insurers. Therefore, those who know most about the subject are banned from trying personal injury cases.
<P>
I tabled some parliamentary questions about the Judges' Council, and I received an interesting series of answers. I am not allowed to know who they are, nor to whom they are accountable. I was told that it is an ``independent body,'' that it has ``no statutory basis,'' and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Its membership is a matter for the Council itself and those whose views it represents''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sorry to say that it is still entitled to make those appallingly important decisions.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>

I asked the Library to follow it up, and I was told:

However, the Library did manage to discover who some of its members were.
<P>
That is not good enough. A register of interests protects Members of Parliament from allegations of financial or other bias in our debates. The time has come to place similar restrictions on judges. We also need to consider part-time judges, because they are no different to local government councillors in terms of the work that they put in. Councilllors have to make declarations of interest: so should part-time judges, especially as their daily rate is rather better than that of local councillors, who receive only expenses and allowances.
<P>
The amendment proposes a system similar to that which applies for Members of Parliament. I drew from the wording of the Register of Members' Interests in preparing the amendment. We must move to restore public confidence in the judiciary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon on his cogent exposition of the deficiencies of the present system. It is essential to preserve the independence of the judiciary, especially as judges will be asked to make more finely balanced quasi-political decisions under the Human Rights Act 1998. It is also essential that public confidence in the judiciary should be maintained and preserved. That is why I support the sentiments behind new clauses 7 and 8.
<P>
What my hon. Friend's had to say about the Judges' Council came as a surprise. I tend to agree with him that the inappropriate knee-jerk reaction to the criticism of non-declaration of judicial interests in the recent publicity about the so-called ban on campaigning lawyers was an entirely inappropriate response. In a changing and modern age, we need a more rational and open system for making judicial appointments.
<P>
We also need a register of judicial interests, although I accept that there are practical difficulties. The analogy drawn by my hon. Friend between Members of Parliament and members of the judiciary is not entirely accurate, because one would expect judges to act in an impartial and judicious manner. Of course, a dissatisfied litigant could resort to a register of judicial interests for all sorts of reasons, which could lead to further entirely inappropriate litigation. I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> If the register is published in advance, a litigant can check whether the trial judge has a relevant interest&#151;which may not be apparent to the judge, as was pointed out in The Sunday Times. The litigant would then have to put up or shut up; he could not argue about it afterwards, which is what happens now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. It is not clear from new clause 8 that that would be part of the mechanism. That would go some way to answering my concern that a register of judicial interests could create practical difficulties.
<P>
I agree with the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. I signed the early-day motion on the judicial appointments commission&#151;that proposal was eminently sensible. One does not need to share the sort of iconoclasm&#151;I hope that my hon. Friend takes this in the right spirit&#151;that marks some of his comments. New clauses 7 and 8 are eminently sensible and I agree with their sentiments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): I speak in favour of the new clauses, particularly new clause 7. One of the well-known phrases of English jurisprudence is that we often judge the legality of actions against the conduct of the reasonable man on the Clapham omnibus. I note that it is always a man. When we consider the nature of the judiciary, we have a rather clearer idea of who that man might be. He usually has a public-school and Oxbridge education; he would certainly be middle or upper class; and, for many years, he would have been a high-earning member of the Bar and a member of the establishment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I came to Westminster on the Clapham omnibus&#151;the 77A&#151;as did my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead). I can assure my hon. Friend that at least half the passengers were women, and that between 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. of passengers were from ethnic minorities. That does not apply to the judiciary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stinchcombe:</B> That is precisely the point. The test by which we judge the lawfulness of behaviour is seen not through the eyes of the person who travels on public transport, but through the eyes of self-selected, upper-class public schoolboys of the rather old school. More recent judicial appointments show that characterisation is slowly changing. Indeed, I can see that quite clearly in some of the former members of my old chambers who have joined the judiciary. None the less, the judiciary is still nowhere near representative of the community whose rights it seeks to protect.
<P>
Less than 10 years ago, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister spoke against the incorporation of the European convention on human rights. He said that he thought it a bad idea because of suspicions about the background of our judiciary. That, at least, has changed. We must change the nature of appointments to the judiciary rather than eschew the protection of fundamental human rights. What better way to protect our citizens from political appointments than for wholly transparent appointments to be made by a judicial appointments commission?
<P>
I am an unashamed supporter of the judicial appointments commission. It is an essential step forward in our journey to the greater emancipation and protection of the people of this country. I hope that the Government will support it&#151;if not now, in the near future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): I support both new clauses, and I endorse the excellent way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon moved them.
<P>
New clause 7(2) sets out the desirability of appointing persons with experience in or knowledge of the judicial and legal professions, legal education and training, the maintenance of professional standards, consumer affairs and social conditions. That range of experience is important. The duties of the commission are also included; they include investigating and evaluating candidates for judicial office. Such a commission would create openness in the appointment of the judiciary; it would lead to a more inclusive society&#151;and more support for the judiciary, which is so important. The concept of modernising Britain was part of our manifesto, and the new clause would constitute an important step towards that.
<P>
New clause 8, which would introduce a register of judicial interests, goes hand in glove with new clause 7, for all the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon mentioned about openness and detailing the interests of people in the judiciary. I therefore warmly support both new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I, too, rise to support both new clauses, to which I referred on Second Reading. I support the principle that a judicial appointments commision and an open register of judges' interests should be established. Obviously, it will be important to consult widely, and it would be a mistake to introduce such a commission hastily. However, it is especially important following the incorporation of the European convention on human rights that the public and litigants know where they stand in relation to the judiciary.
<P>
Although our judiciary may not be perfect, we have judges of outstanding calibre and impartiality who have nothing to fear from such a commission and such a register. It is in the public interest that a commission be established. It would buttress judicial independence and constitute an important step forward in recognising that the public must have confidence in judges and their appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Although I shall ask my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon to withdraw the new clause, I emphasise that the Government have not ruled out the possibility of proceeding towards the creation of a judicial appointments commission. However, we have decided to give priority to our other radical reforms and to the changes that the Government consider most urgent to improve the openness, flexibility and effectiveness of the judicial appointments system.
<P>
Before making a final decision, the Government will have to consider carefully the possible constitutional implications of such a commission. Apart from issues of principle, it would also raise practical questions such as how it should be constituted and what its precise functions should be. We would not want to proceed without first conducting extensive consultation. In short, the establishment of a judicial appointments commission is too extensive and too complex a proposal to be included at such a late stage in the passage of the Bill. It would require separate primary legislation for which parliamentary time would have to be found in the context of other Government priorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> Does my hon. Friend envisage that primary legislation would be required if the possibility&#151;about which the Government seem open-minded&#151;of establishing a judicial appointments commission is realised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> One would follow on from the other. The Government would first have to decide to proceed with the consultation that would be required before such a commission could be established. However, I am confident that it would require primary legislation. Indeed, the purpose of introducing a new clause at this stage was to include the establishment of such a commission in this primary legislation.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor has made several changes, including the advertisement of High Court vacancies, greater flexibility in sittings arrangements for holders of part-time judicial office and a work-shadowing scheme. It would be unrealistic to suppose that the creation of a commission would broaden the composition of the judiciary. It could not automatically alter the composition of the legal profession or its age and gender profile. Nor could it appoint those who do not yet possess the necessary statutory qualifications for appointment as laid down by Parliament. The Lord Chancellor has made it clear over the past two years that he has been conducting a sustained campaign for more women and more candidates from ethnic minorities to apply for silk and for judicial appointments. His campaign has had considerble success, and, I am sure, will continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Can the Minister identify any reason why the judiciary should be more representative of society than should airline pilots, for example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Yes, I can. I firmly believe that it is extraordinarily important in a democratic and free society that people who make vital decisions, especially those that affect the liberty of the citizen, should broadly reflect the citizens on whom they sit in judgment.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor has not ruled out proceeding with consultation on the establishment of a commission, but we cannot simply insert the provision into the Bill to enable that to be achieved. I hope that my hon. Friends accept that those issues require further, profound consideration.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 8 would introduce a register of judicial interests similar to that which exists for Members of Parliament. The Government are not convinced that such a register is necessary. The role and function of judges are clearly different from those of peers, Members of Parliament, or other public figures currently obliged to register interests. Existing case law already requires judges to declare any potential conflict of interest arising in an individual case and to stand down if necessary. The rules have been developed by the most senior members of the judiciary so as to apply effectively to the particular function that judges discharge, and the particular framework within which they operate. Those rules address potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. A register would not necessarily provide the same safeguard, because a register could not list every connection that might conceivably give rise to a conflict of interest.
<P>
I am aware that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon mentioned, there has been concern about judges holding commercial directorships. That is a separate issue as it raises the question of whether certain activities are incompatible with judicial office in general. The Lord Chancellor has decided to review the precise terms of the guidance given to judges on that matter.
<P>
In summary, my hon. Friend's proposal for a register of judicial interests raises major issues of both principle and practicality&#151;not least, for instance, the definition of the interests that would be registrable. The Lord Chancellor is prepared to consider the issue further, but immediate legislative provision might be premature. It would not allow for any of the prior consultation and further careful consideration of the issues that would be necessary before final decisions could be taken. In the meantime, the Lord Chancellor is satisfied that public interest is safeguarded by existing arrangements, but the Government will continue to look at the issues. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the new clause.

<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I listened with interest to what my hon. Friend the Minister said; I am pleased that the Government are prepared actively to consider the new clauses. I take issue with him on the public confidence in the judiciary, which is not as strong as he suggests. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Court dress</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) The wearing of wigs in court by judges and advocates as part of court dress is abolished.<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
We are debating whether the style of dress introduced to mourn the death of Charles II, not Queen Anne, as popularly thought&#151;I have done some research&#151;is suitable for a modern justice system. I am not saying that we should not have formal dress in court&#151;I do not advocate the wearing of teeshirts and trainers&#151;but I question whether 17th-century garb is appropriate for modern courts. There have been changes in court dress over the centuries, before and after Charles II. Solicitors, for example, wore wigs until the end of the 18th century, when they went out of fashion. Solicitors kept up with fashion; unfortunately, barristers did not.
<P>
The new clause is about not just wigs, but wider issues. Those in favour of maintaining traditional court dress have a series of arguments. First, that it helps to identify who is who in court. I do not know whether that is necessary, but if it is it could be just as easily achieved by a more modern style of dress, such as a simple robe. It is also said that it removes distinctions between advocates and puts them on level terms, hiding the fact that women are women, young people are young and so on. I think that that is nonsense. There used to be a saying among young barristers that they stood out in any case as less experienced because their wigs were very white. QCs have a different set of clothing altogether and solicitors are discriminated against in not being allowed to wear the same rig as barristers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is wrong; I have appeared in court with a solicitor appearing against me wearing a wig. He told me that nobody had ever previously objected, on the countless occasions on which he had appeared, to his doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The solicitor was probably appearing under false pretences. In this week's The Lawyer, there is a reference to a solicitor-advocate who thought that he was discriminated against by the behaviour of a judge who constantly interrupted, threw down a file and displayed antipathy to him thoughout a case. It is an interesting piece that I do not have time to go through now.
<P>
The other argument is about security and the need to preserve the anonymity of judges and barristers in the outside world, so that they cannot be recognised and victimised when going about their business by the criminals who infest our every street. There is not much strength in that argument. Magistrates, who deal with the vast bulk of criminal work, live in the communities in which they adjudicate and do not wear wigs to disguise themselves. In fact, they are often well known people. If criminals were out to get a judge or barrister, they could easily find out who they were and where they lived.
<P>
Similarly, Department of Social Security officials, people who work in employment tribunals and many other public servants who are probably at much greater risk of threats of violence are not allowed to disguise themselves in that way. The logical conclusion to saying that a wig is a disguise is to say that we should allow ceremonial tights to be pulled over heads to create stocking masks, or we should issue false beards and dark glasses to judges so that they can hide their identities.
<P>
The arguments against the current court rig are overwhelming. It is not simply a question of cost, although it is difficult for new barristers to afford to get fully kitted out, which probably costs at least a couple of thousand pounds. I know a QC who did not have much money when he started up and bought his wig at the closing-down sale of a theatrical costumier, and it looked as though it had been bought there, too.
<P>
The system is discriminatory against those who are not QCs or barristers, as we do not have the equality of arms. Everyone should be on a level playing field in terms of the way in which they dress when advocating a case. People in court can be intimidated. There is a procedure now for wigs to be withdrawn when young children give evidence, but the effects of intimidation go beyond that. The costume is outdated and leads to endless lampooning of our judges, barristers and legal system in numerous cartoons and television programmes. There is a hygiene and comfort argument as well.
<P>
We need a modern form of court dress. All advocates should be on equal terms, and there is no place in our judicial system for an ancient, insanitary, decaying mass of congealed horsehair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I rise to support new clause 9 to show that it has bipartisan support, in the sense that it is supported not only by my hon. Friends the Members for Hendon and for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) for the lawyers, but by hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) and myself for the non-lawyers. We can be distinguished from them, in case anyone is in doubt, by the fact that we speak a different language.
<P>
I want to suggest two reasons for supporting the amendment. It perhaps takes a non-lawyer to point out the lesser reason, which is that wigs look ridiculous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> If wigs look so ridiculous, one might have thought that clients would wish not to be represented by people wearing them. The evidence, especially in the Crown and county court, is that clients want their barristers to wear wigs. That has been looked into again and again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I am sure that clients want their barristers&#151;their advocates&#151;to wear whatever the uniform is, so that they are sure that they have a proper advocate. I do not think that they are committed to wigs as such, and they would probably agree that wigs by themselves look ridiculous. Whenever I feel a need to lose my respect for my opponents in the heat of debate, I do not do what most people do and imagine them naked; I imagine them wearing wigs, and it works an absolute dream. I can imagine the hon. Member for Beaconsfield wearing a wig.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> He frequently does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I am sure that he does.
<P>
The new clause is not against uniforms. On the contrary, it asks the Lord Chancellor to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lay down rules for court dress'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which would clearly be a uniform. I am simply against the wearing of ridiculous uniforms. Originally, a wig was not a uniform but a fashion that has been frozen in time and a part of the battle against lice in the 17th century. The wigs were lice-free, but they were ineffective because they created a breeding ground for lice in the person's hair.
<P>
Pupils at my old school still wear yellow stockings as part of their school uniform. The coat also has a yellow lining because it was believed in Elizabethan times that that colour deterred lice. It is ineffective, but such uniform is still worn on that fallacious basis. Just as wearing yellow stockings was once thought to be functional, but is now considered ridiculous, so, too, is the wearing of wigs.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor has said how uncomfortable it is for him to wear a heavy wig at the Dispatch Box. He could extend that argument to judges and barristers. The new clause would put the remedy entirely in his hands. The Lord Chancellor could stipulate court dress and, hopefully, he could do the same for those in the House of Lords. It would be a good test of whether we have a radical Lord Chancellor.
<P>
I am not arguing against the wearing of wigs just for the sake of it, or because it is traditional dress. Wigs are the mark not of advocates in a court, but of barristers. Although some solicitors may have worn wigs, the wearing of them is peculiar to barristers. The logic of having rights of audience for barristers and solicitors on an equal basis is that they should wear the same court dress. The Bar's insistence on the wearing of wigs is a form of discrimination; it is certainly a form of clubmanship or one-upmanship. It is designed to underline the distinction that the Bar still likes to draw between being represented by an advocate who is a barrister and an advocate who is a solicitor.
<P>
The only argument in favour of wigs is one of conservatism. By that, I do not mean the political ideology of the Conservative party, but the reflex action of holding on to what one has and wanting to keep things the same. One of the ironies of our debates on the Bill is that the legal profession has been defending from pure conservative instincts a legal aid system that was introduced by Labour under the 1945-1950 Government. Fortunately, Labour Members understand that things have moved on since then and that we need to change the system but, by and large, the legal profession does not agree and wants to hold on not to a policy that was originally Conservative, but a reform brought in by Lord Rushcliffe's report in 1949 under a Labour Government.
<P>
Wigs may be said to have some sort of symbolic significance, but almost everyone agrees that the law should keep up to date and change with the times. The new clause would be a small, but important, step forward.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Jabez Foster </B>(Hastings and Rye): I support the new clause. The wearing of wigs is not only a silly practice, but discriminatory. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that clients like their briefs to wear wigs, which suggests that they do not like seeing their solicitor advocates in wigs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> As I said, I have seen solicitors wearing wigs in court on more than one occasion. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Some solicitors may have an inferiority complex and want to pretend that they are barristers, but in most courts judges do not permit solicitors to wear wigs. Indeed, in the Hastings county court, the judge who deals with domestic matters demands that no court dress such as wigs or gowns is worn&#151;for the comfort of the advocates and more especially for the benefit of the litigants. That systems works well and it suggests that justice does not depend on wearing fancy dress.
<P>
There is also a practical reason. Those who go into robing rooms will see that people spend the first 20 minutes of the day preening themselves, getting their collars and wigs right. That is a waste of money, and someone has to pay for it. The legal aid fund is paying for it much of the time.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Solicitors often forget their collars. I once had to borrow a Methodist preacher's collar when I turned up without mine, but no one noticed. Those 10 or 15 minutes spent at the beginning of every day are a waste of time. I have not done the calculations, but if we worked out how many advocates spend 10 minutes every morning dressing up and how much that costs the legal aid fund at &#163;50 an hour, we could probably avoid introducing the Bill because we could save enough money to retain legal aid for personal injury cases. The legal profession and the public would be well served if the new clause were accepted.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I have personal sympathy with the argument that the wearing of wigs promotes an out-of-date image of the law. Cost is an issue. I was fortunate to buy my wig from someone who was giving up the Bar and selling his wig off cheap. Wing collars are also an issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) might have grown up wearing studs; I did not, and would prefer to wear a bib with velcro.
<P>
When such matters were raised with the previous Lord Chancellor in 1992, extensive consultation was held and the majority opinion was in favour of continuing to wear wigs. The arguments that carried the day were those of anonymity, which some judges take seriously, and that the wearing of wigs contributes to the seriousness with which justice is dispensed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will my hon. and learned Friend tell us exactly who was consulted? Were solicitors and litigants consulted, or was it simply a matter of members of the Bar talking among themselves?
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> As I remember it, I received a copy of the consultation paper. It was prepared partly by a professor of legal history at Cambridge and contained some interesting historical information, on which some of my hon. Friends may have drawn. I cannot tell my hon. Friend who commented in that normal consultation process.
<P>
The Lord Chancellor is open to the idea of considering such matters again, together with the judiciary, if there is evidence that the balance of opinion has changed. The agitation of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon is an aspect of a change in public opinion, and I am sure that the Lord Chancellor will pay close attention to it. I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the motion, but I commend him for ventilating the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I certainly am extremely agitated about this issue, as are many of my hon. Friends and the public. However, given the reassurance that the Lord Chancellor is prepared to consider the matter, I beg to ask to leave to withdraw the motion.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I can move this new clause relatively briefly because it covers some of the ground that I referred to on Second Reading. When dealing with major disasters that are subject to public inquiries, one of the problems is the considerable distress that relatives and victims suffer when they have to re-live their experiences continually. That problem is caused by the current system, which may involve a public inquiry, and inquest and civil litigation, all of which increase not only the distress of the relatives but legal costs and delay. I propose a modest telescoping of the procedures to eliminate some of those problems.
<P>
When I was practising, I represented victims of the King's Cross fire and relatives of those who died. That inquiry lasted 93 days and covered every imaginable aspect of the disaster. Nevertheless, a few weeks later, we had an inquest that lasted well over a fortnight and covered the same ground. That was followed by a series of civil litigation cases, in which, again, we had theoretically to litigate the same ground, although after a while liability was conceded. The Marchioness disaster resulted in a series of inquests, public inquiries, prosecutions and non-prosecutions, and was an absolute travesty of justice for the victims and relatives. Similarly, all recent tragedies and disasters&#151;the Kegworth air crash, Piper Alpha, Hillsborough, the Clapham train crash&#151;resulted in that rather long, convoluted procedure.
<P>
The new clause is relatively modest. It is designed merely to cut out some of the bureaucracy, duplication, costs and genuine distress that the present system causes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): I shall be brief. Normally, when I want to know why I oppose a proposal, I listen to the hon. Member for Hendon to discover why he supports it. I am then entirely convinced and satisfied that I was right in the first place. On this rare occasion, when we have returned from the nursery to adult life, the hon. Member for Hendon has made a good suggestion, for which I have praised him before and shall do again.
<P>
In the light of the advancing time, if the Committee will forgive me, I shall not speak to new clause 26, which I have tabled. However, it is available for the Government to consider. Again, although I support new clause 10, it does not necessarily have to be acted on today, but it is a worthwhile suggestion, which the Government might care to take away and either return to on Report or introduce in discrete legislation or in some other way.
<P>
There are good, humane reasons for wanting to do what the hon. Member for Hendon suggests. The Marchioness disaster led to several days of agonising inquiry for the bereaved, as did the inquiry into the King's Cross disaster, with which the hon. Member for Hendon was involved. One can think of any number of other fatal accident inquiries both in this country and in Scotland in which unnecessary grief has been caused. I hope that the Government, although not necessarily accepting the proposal today, will carefully consider it for the near future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to support this compelling new clause. I hope that the Government will consider it very carefully and perhaps introduce such a new clause on Report.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> As ever, my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon has put his finger on an important issue. We understand and sympathise with the objective of trying to avoid the need for separate inquests into deaths that occur in such cases.
<P>
My hon. Friend has taken one of the recommendations in the report of the departmental working group on disasters and inquests, which was published in 1997. That report suggested a third, preferable option. We are considering whether it would be feasible in the time available to prepare amendments to give effect to its recommendations on Report. If that does not prove possible, we shall do so when a further legislative opportunity arises.
<P>
One aspect of new clause 26 relates to the relationship between public inquiries and criminal proceedings. That is a complex issue that is being considered in the context of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions consultation document on transport safety.
<P>
On the basis of that explanation, I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Garnier to move new clause 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In explaining why I do not want to move the new clause, I invite the Government to consider its terms carefully. We debated earlier the need for budgetary discipline and to set up proper accounting systems. We invited the Government to explain why they are not separating the budgets for the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service under the overall supervision of the commission. New clause 11 broadly replicates those arguments in rather more detail. Although I do not expect the Committee to deal with the matter today, it causes us considerable concern, and we may return to it at a later stage.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I am not sure how it has happened, but the new clause clearly contains some typographical or late-night drafting errors. Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission shall consist of'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it should have been ``the Review Body''.
<P>
The commission has certain priorities, one of which is to achieve good value for money. It was asked in the other place whether a review body would be needed to help the Lord Chancellor oversee the commission's activities. There is much to commend that.
<P>
Such a body need not be set up at present. It could wait until we see how the commission is operating. However, review bodies have been set up for many publicly funded services. They provide a useful forum for discussing problems with the bodies that they review. In view of the commission's enormous remit, a review body would be valuable. Its membership would be drawn from the widest possible spectrum, and it would be appointed by the Lord Chancellor, so there is no question of his being fettered. We see merit in the proposal and if it is not taken up now, it should be borne in mind.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I do not think that we have any difficulty with the principle of new clause 12, but it talks about the review body's function being to advise the Lord Chancellor on appropriate target incomes for those providing services&#151;in other words, for the private profession. That being the case, the new clause is quite inappropriate.
<P>
I would have explained to the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) in my reply to new clause 11 that that new clause is unnecessary because we are committed to ensuring that the commission operates in an open and transparent way. That is already provided for in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I fail to see why suggesting target levels should be completely inappropriate. To achieve value for money, the commission will often have to make difficult judgments. As with legal aid, those judgments must reflect the realities of the marketplace. If those realities are not reflected, the commission will not get the quality of service that it wants. It will not fetter the commission or the Lord Chancellor. The opportunity to exchange views on target levels seems desirable. Those views do not have to be followed; we simply seek a forum in which they can be expressed.
<P>
<B>The Solicitor-General:</B> I take the view that the service will be provided by professional solicitors and barristers, who will essentially be operating in the private sector. They are not public servants. They will be competing with other service providers to provide publicly funded legal services. The commission may from time to time consider the income of barristers and solicitors, but that does not justify the high priority given to it in the new clause. As I said, the commission will operate openly. It will constantly review its operations, in particular, whether it obtains best value.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am sorry to hear the Solicitor-General say that. He seems to assume that conditional fee arrangements will be the norm. However, legal aid will continue to be relevant in a huge number of cases. That is why a review body is desirable. It is a matter to which we may return later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. The new clause is entirely self-explanatory and eminently sensible. I ask the Minister to say why he thinks it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The new clause may be self-explanatory, but it is deeply disappointing. I am sorry that Opposition Members should subscribe to the view that employed lawyers cannot be trusted. That is entirely unfounded. Employed lawyers in national and local government, in business, in the Crown Prosecution Service, in law centres and in legal advice centres all do valuable work in accordance with the highest standards and traditions of the legal profession. That is hardly surprising because they are fully qualified barristers and solicitors, and they are regulated by the same professional bodies as lawyers in private practice. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> I have been an employed barrister and was once chairman of the employed Bar. The Minister may have misunderstood our concern. Although the matter will not divide the Committee, the Minister should recognise that we do not doubt the probity, independence or experience of members of the employed Bar, nor of employed solicitors&#151;as several hon. Members made clear earlier. That is agreed not only by the Opposition but by the Bar Council. We debated the matter extensively, and there is no need for me to repeat what I said then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) said. I am not entirely sure that the Minister gave us the sort of explanation that we were looking for.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
In common with all members of the Committee, I believe that there is a great deal of support for the not-for-profit sector. Law centres and citizens advice bureaux are lifelines for so many of our constituents, who sometimes have nowhere else to go or no one else to turn to. I feel sure that the Committee will join me in paying tribute to the staff and volunteers in the not-for-profit sector for their marvellous work.
<P>
One aspect of the Bill that we all support is the emphasis on and the promise of funding for the not-for-profit sector, and we are waiting for details on that from the Government. In the foreword to the White Paper ``Modernising Justice'', the Lord Chancellor stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``More money will reach . . . the not-for-profit sector (which has particular expertise at dealing with the types of problems faced by poor people)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are welcome words. The new clause would assist in that expressed ambition. It would enhance the not-for-profit sector and ensure that the most poor and vulnerable in our society have recourse to legal advice, especially in connection with the problems that they particularly face.
<P>
Outside the not-for-profit sector, there is little expertise in important areas of law that impact crucially, and often unfairly, on the poorest and most vulnerable. There is fragmentation in publicly funded legal services, which are provided by lawyers in private practice funded through legal aid, law centres funded through legal aid and local authorities, and citizens advice bureaux that are funded primarily by local authorities.
<P>
Paragraph 2.10 of the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In future, these two sorts of spending''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, legal aid spending and local authority spending&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will be considered as a whole.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 2.11 makes it clear that the Community Legal Service will develop, in co-operation with local authorities,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``local, regional and national plans to match the provision of legal services to identified needs and priorities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some local authorities are good at funding local advice centres, and some are not. If advice centres are to be integrated within the pattern of provision, inequalities and inconsistencies in local funding must be addressed. That can be done only by ensuring that the Legal Services Commission consults local authorities about the provision of services in their areas. New clause 17 would provide the funds for them to plan for and fund legal services in their areas. I hope that the Committee will support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I wish to stress the importance of local authorities doing their fair share in the funding of law centres. I represent a constituency in the London borough of Wandsworth which, I think, is the only local authority in the country that does not support its local law centre, although it does fund the citizens advice bureau. It is important that the Legal Services Commission can rely on the fact that local authorities do their fair share in funding law centres, otherwise the situation would be unfair between one local authority area and another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The new clause is based on a misunderstanding of the concept of the Community Legal Service. The intention is that Community Legal Service partnerships will be in every local authority area, providing a forum to bring together funders and service providers, including the local authority. It is therefore inappropriate to require the Community Legal Service, as such, to consult local authorities.
<P>
The Legal Services Commission will be responsible for funding services, using the resources available to the Community Legal Service fund established under clause 6. It is certainly not the intention that funding provided by that central Government agency should take over or supplant the wide range of funding, particularly of advice agencies, that is already provided by local authorities and others.
<P>
Subsection (2) of new clause 17 states that the Legal Services Commission may fund services that local authorities have agreed to provide. It is not clear in what sense the authority would be providing those services if it is not to fund them. Nevertheless, it may be appropriate for the commission to make grants or enter into contracts to suplement the funding of bodies and services provided primarily by the local authority. Clause 7(3) already provides the power to do that and, to that extent, subsection (2) of new clause 7 is unnecessary
<P>
Similarly, proposed subsection (3) repeats the terms of clause 6(2)(a), but limits them to local authorities. It would not be right to have a separate provision for the funding of local authority services by the Legal Services Commission. That would tie the hands of the commission, which must be free to fund services as part of the Community Legal Service that are based on the needs and priorities of local communities and assessments of how best the Community Legal Service fund can contribute to meeting them. I invite the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Although I am not overwhelmed by that reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I should first point out that although I am not a solicitor, my wife is. She is a salaried local authority solicitor with immense probity, and spends her time pursuing dodgy landlords. The new clause has a simple purpose, the principle of which should be agreed by all. It relates to present practice on fees by the Law Society. I understand that the Law Society charges each year for a practising certificate, without which a solicitor cannot practise. It levies the fee for that certificate with the sanction of the law, under the Solicitors Act 1974, and lawyers are required to pay it even if they do not join the Law Society. The Law Society can even add various levies to the fee&#151;which are also enforceable by law.
<P>
In many ways, that is an admirable system in that the Law Society does much good work in setting professional standards and in training and regulating the profession. It is wholly reasonable that that should continue; indeed, the Committee agreed earlier to expand the powers of the Law Society in that regard. However, the problem is what can be done with those fees once they have been charged and collected by law. Section 11(3) of the Solicitors Act 1974 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All fees received by the Society under subsection (1) shall be applied in such a manner as the Society may think fit for the purposes of the Society''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That confers almost unique powers on a UK society. I know of no other professional society that has the power in law to do what it will with money provided to it.
<P>
Hon. Members will remember that we debated at length in the House the powers and immunities of trade unions. Legislation was passed to ensure that if trade unions wanted to undertake political or campaigning action, or actions outside the central purposes of a trade union, they could set up a political fund and hold a ballot to ensure that the fund was operational. I do not suggest that that should be done in the case of the Law Society, but while it is wholly reasonable that the core purposes of the Law Society, for which it has been given authority to undertake actions, should properly be funded by the practising certificate fee, the funding of activities outside that should not be enshrined in law. The Law Society is perfectly at liberty to raise funds from its members by way of a membership fee or contribution. That is the purpose behind the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I have my name on the solicitors' roll but as I do not practise, I do not pay for a practising certificate. My hon. Friend slightly exaggerates the extent of the problem.
<P>
On the duties of the Law Society, does my hon. Friend accept that royal charters govern its duties and that, however imperfect, its council has a system of representative government?
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Yes, I accept that the charges are overwhelmingly properly levied and applied. My key point is not about the way in which the levies are provided and applied, but about the licence that the Law Society, almost unique among professional organisations, enjoys to do what it will with money supplied to it by law. My new clause would create a distinction between the two purposes of the Law Society so that its central, admirable purpose would continue to be protected by law, but its other activities, for which it may make arrangements as it sees fit, would be regulated by its internal arrangements. I hope that all hon. Members agree that that principle is equitable, fair and transparent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I, too, am a member of the Law Society and was concerned by the campaign that it waged in regard to the Bill.
<P>
I support my hon. Friend's new clause, but disagree on two points. First, I do not agree that the Law Society is doing a very good job of handling complaints and regulating the profession, as we know from the matter being raised time and again in our surgeries. We need to take firm action on that. I also disagree with the view that we should not expect the Law Society to set up the equivalent of a trade union political fund, with a proper ballot and provision for contracting in and contracting out, in the same way as other trade unions operate. If the Law Society operates as a trade union, the same rules should apply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> In my personal capacity, but also as someone who has been briefed by the Law Society, I wish to speak against new clause 22. I shall do so briefly by advising the Committee of the Law Society's view on the new clause. Its briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At present, the Solicitors Act provides that no person shall be qualified to act as a solicitor unless he has in force a practising certificate. The Act provides for fees to be prescribed for practising certificates. The fees are set by the Master of the Rolls, with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. However, the Society has some regulatory functions under the other statutes (including E.U. directives), rather than just under the Solicitors Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The income from practising certificates represents approximately 60 per cent. of the Law Society's total income. The remainder comes from fees and from various quasi-commercial activities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Law Society's funds are used for a wide range of activities. They include the operation of the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors, the arrangements made for legal education and training, work on law reform issues, and the administration of the democratic Council structure which is responsible for direction of the Society's activities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> It is not practical to make a sharp division between regulatory and non-regulatory activities. In practice, many activities are both regulatory and representative&#151;for example, the work done by the Law Society's International Directorate covers both issues such as regulations concerning money laundering and the establishment of foreign lawyers, as well as representation of the profession abroad.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> To require a sharp division of function into regulatory and non-regulatory would be likely to involve considerable duplication of activities, and additional overall cost. There is no corresponding benefit to be gained from such an approach&#151;particularly when, as at present, the level of the practising certificate fee is determined by the Master of the Rolls rather than solely by the Law Society.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no doubt that the Minister will have his own reservations about the good sense of new clause 22, and I understand that the Government are considering the matter in a far wider context.
<P>
Any attempt to prevent the Law Society from running the sort of campaign that it has done in the past 10 days could amount to unlawful suppression of freedom of expression and could conflict with article 10 of&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Let me finish the sentence. It could run contrary to the intention behind article 10 of the European convention on human rights, and it might prevent the Minister from certificating the Bill, as he has done at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I simply want to ask the hon. Gentleman how he voted on the trade union legislation, which did exactly the same sort of thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure whether I was a Member of Parliament in those days.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I shall be brief. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test that this is a simple new clause, but I fear that in its simplicity it misses a complex point. I have already mentioned the position of the royal charters and the council of the Law Society, which, however imperfectly, contains some elected representation. The new clause accepts that the control over the amount of fees is set by the Master of the Rolls, after consultation with others.
<P>
The idea that we can say strictly that the Law Society can spend its money on regulation and education, but on nothing else, except by raising voluntary subscriptions, is worrying. The Law Society does important work, and I fear for its future if it were subject to voluntary subscriptions. There was a topical example this morning in a news report of the concern of the Director of Public Prosecutions about the growing risk of miscarriages of justice because of the non-disclosure of evidence to the defence by the prosecution in criminal cases. There was a concomitant announcement in the same news story that the Law Society has embarked on a consultation of 4,000 criminal law practitioners about evidence at ground level of the danger of such miscarriage. That sort of work puts the Law Society in a positive light, which would not happen if there were voluntary subscription.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon about the inadequacies of the investigation of complaints about solicitors. Having visited the Office for the Supervisor of Solicitors last Friday, I have seen the immense pressures that it is under, partly because of the lack of resources, and partly because of the lack of powers. I am pleased to have heard the Solicitor-General say this morning that amendments will be tabled on Report to give extra powers to the Office for the Supervisor of Solictors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I oppose the new clause because it would curtail many vital functions of the Law Society. It funds many worthwhile activities, not least of which is the promotion of law reform. It also funds many specialist committees&#151;I should declare an interest in that for 12 years I was on the revenue law committee of the Law Society. Governments and parliamentary draftsmen, as well as Opposition parties, have every reason to be grateful to those specialist committees. They are not limited to esoteric matters, but cover many other aspects of the law and the promotion of law reform.
<P>
The revenue law committee did much work in the public interest. Time, attention and resources were devoted by that committee to promoting the public interest and briefing Opposition parties. The new clause is ill-considered and ill-advised, so I hope that it will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test for raising the significant issue of principle that the new clause addresses. If it is compulsory for solicitors exercising rights of litigation to have a practising certificate from the Law Society should there be some limitations over how the society spends that money? My honourable and learned Friend, The Lord Chancellor, said in another place that the Government would give active consideration to tabling an amendment to enable the Bar Council to levy a compulsory subscription from its members for the issue of practising certificates. The Government believe that it is reasonable in principle for a regulatory body to be able to charge compulsory fees to those whom it regulates. At present, unlike the Law Society, the Bar Council has no statutory power to require the payment of fees. Some practising barristers are therefore able to benefit from the Bar Council's regulation without having to contribute a single penny towards it.
<P>
However, there is an argument that if a regulatory body has power to raise compulsory fees, to spend money on an acitivity that is not strictly regulatory or educational is wrong in principle. The present position imposes an obligation on solicitors to fund trade union activities, which they may not support, and which may in fact be contrary to their interests. The day of pre-entry closed shops are ended for trade unions and should not apply to other bodies acting in a similar way.
<P>
That is the answer to the members of the Committee who have argued that the activities of the Law Society would somehow be curtailed. Every other membership organisation is expected freely to recruit members, who are expected to pay their subscriptions. Hon. Members cannot have it both ways&#151;they cannot say that they are opposed to pre-entry closed shops and the provisions that go with that, and at the same time, argue that there should be a legal underpinning for this type of provision.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Government recognise that they and the Law Society need to consider the position very carefully before disturbing an arrangement that has been in place for some years. We shall table an amendment on Report to provide the Bar Council with the power to levy compulsory subscriptions for practising certificates. There is a strong case for such a power to be restricted to the purposes of regulation, education and training. In the light of that, we need to consider carefully whether we should have a level playing field in this area. That would suggest that similar restrictions should be applied to the Law Society. If so, we should consider how and when they should take effect, and what flexibility should be built into the legislation to cater for a changing regulatory environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister has seen the article in The Times this morning, which says that the Lord Chancellor was rather supportive of new clause 22. Will he take this opportunity to distance himself from the thrust of that article, if I have interpreted it correctly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is not the Government's responsibility to respond to newspaper articles, whether they are true or not. I am perfectly happy to respond to questions from hon. Members, but I have made the Government's position clear. We intend to table amendments to improve the Bar Council's position. The amendments will be limited, and the question arises as to whether the same principles should be applied to the Law Society. Further consultation will be necessary about that. The Government recognise that those principles would have far-reaching effects on the Law Society, and we have not had the opportunity to discuss the matter properly with it. Given that, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test will agree to withdraw new clause 22.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I am greatly encouraged by my hon. Friend the Minister's agreement with the principle that I put forward and his willingness to examine further the consequences of regulation for the Bar Council and the Law Society. In that light, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 28&#151;Solicitors Act 1974 (No. 2)&#151;

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``( ) prepared or submits an application to an employment tribunal''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> These are short new clauses about whether further protection should be provided against the activities of so-called unqualified advisers in relation to personal injury actions and employment tribunal work. I will be interested to hear from the hon. Member for Hendon, if time permits. My experience as a barrister on personal injury work, with which his experience may tally, leads me to consider that the activities of unqualified advisers who offer to take over the handling of a case at an early stage after an accident and to recover moneys for the victim tend, so far as we see them, to be an unqualified disaster. Given the changes brought about by the Woolf report, the question therefore is whether something further ought to be done about them.
<P>
One cannot prevent people from going to unqualified advisers if they want to, but the first and perhaps only thing that such advisers do is engage in correspondence. One of the features of the Woolf report reforms is that correspondence is now part of the protocols leading into litigation, and once litigation has started, an unqualified adviser cannot act. New clause 27, which is a simple change to section 22(1) of the Solicitors Act 1974, would prevent the writing of a letter before action that forms part of the protocol, and would prohibit unqualified advisers from taking that action. As the writing of such letters is now an essential part of personal injury litigation, there are strong arguments for extending the prohibition on acting in litigation to cover it.
<P>
The same applies to the question of activities in employment tribunals, which have changed out of recognition over the past decade in terms of the scope, the money at stake and the issues to be decided. Therefore, it seems that there is a legitimate reason for considering whether unqualified advisers should be allowed to continue to act in that context as well.
<P>
I should make it clear that the new clause would not restrict law centres from providing advice, even if it is provided by someone within the ambit and control of the law centre who is not necessarily qualified. The new clause is not designed to restrict to solicitors the ability to provide advice, which can legitimately be provided at the moment by those other organisations. I should be grateful for the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> As the hon. Gentleman referred to me, I should say that there is a lot in what he said so far as new clause 27 is concerned. I have spoken about claim assessors previously.
<P>
I am concerned about new clause 28. As phrased, it would prevent trade unions from representing their members, which would be undesirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> To follow the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, I think that there are some technical problems with the way in which clause 28 is presently drafted and the effects that it would have. We have debated the position of claims assessors, so the hon. Member for Beaconsfield knows that the Government are concerned about the matter. I hope that all Members of the Committee are satisfied with the announcement that I made the other day of the setting up of a committee to investigate the work of non-qualified persons who act as claims assessors. I undertake to ensure that the work of that Committee will encompass the problem that may arise under clause 28, without necessarily jeopardising the work of the many people who provide valuable advice and assistance to those who take cases before employment tribunals. If the review considers the work of claims assessors in the round and includes employment tribunals, I hope that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield will ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. I am greatly cheered by what he has said. It was not our intention that new clause 28 should prohibit trade unions from providing such representation. If that is the unintended consequence of its drafting, I should not wish it to be inserted into the Bill. My understanding was that trade unions could continue to provide that representation under the new clause. Perhaps that matter could be considered at another time. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move, That the schedule be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 198 to 225 and 228 to 234.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> This new schedule and this enormous number of amendments are necessary to create the Greater London Magistrates Courts Authority. It will replace the existing 22 magistrates courts committees and provide strategic control of the magistrates courts system in Greater London. I can assure the Committee that the authority will be provided with appropriate powers to administrate magistrates courts across London.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I shall be brief because the Committee is collectively co-operating towards a finish. Will the City of London be treated separately from Greater London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The City of London will not be treated separately, except in relation to the courthouses there. For the sake of completeness, I should mention that the same applies to the courthouses in the royal borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. They will not be subject to the transfer scheme because of their unique circumstances. However, they will be obliged to provide courthouses for so long as they are needed by the Greater London authority.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule read a Second time, and added to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I should like to tell the Committee that my party has no further cause to take issue with any of the remaining matters before the Committee. Of course, we shall return to matters on Report. I have not consulted the other Opposition party, but if it would be convenient for you to put Questions en bloc, we would not object.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I should be entirely happy if the hon. Gentleman's suggestion were adopted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemans for the assistance that they offer. However, I might need to explain certain matters and it could take a long time to decide which matters to take en bloc and which to take in series. I am happy to proceed as quickly as is consistent with a proper explanation of the provisions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that the Committee should proceed with business in the usual way, and we can do that without delay.

<H4><center>Clause 57</center></H4>
<H4><center>Consequential provision</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I should explain that the first subsection of clause 57 removes the automatic right of the lord mayor and the aldermen of the City of London to be justices of the peace by virtue of their office. Under the clause, they will become justices of the peace only after passing through the same selection procedure as applies to all other magistrates throughout England and Wales.
<P>
Currently, the lord mayor and the aldermen have special rights that have been carried forward from a charter granted to them in 1741 by King George II. They are the only body of persons in the country who have the right to be magistrates through election as aldermen. They become magistrates by virtue of their office and not as a result of their appointment by the Lord Chancellor. I firmly believe that the lord mayor and the aldermen play an important role in the delivery of justice in the capital, but it cannot be right for the ancient rights and privileges of the lord mayor and the aldermen to be justices of the peace by virtue of their office to continue in perpetuity.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I wish to pay tribute to the stipendiary magistrate, the distinguished Graham Richards, who suggested that there should be a uniform bench of stipendiary magistrates with the new title of District Judge (Magistrates Courts). He first persuaded me of the merits of such an arrangement, and I am pleased to say that others thought that it was appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The clause struck me as a bit daft, but I do not suppose that it will make any difference. I suspect that those to whom the clause refers will still continue to be called stipendiary magistrates. I am grateful to the Minister for having provided an explanation of what otherwise I found completely inexplicable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If it is of any comfort to my hon. Friend&#151;and I hope that it will be&#151;I was also concerned about the matter on Second Reading. In my response to the consultation paper on the unification of the stipendiary benches, I agreed with the unification, but not with the change of title. I have since heard from members of the stipendiary bench and I gather that they would far rather be called District Judges (Magistrates Courts). If that is what they want, let us do our best to please them.

 (5) Anything done (or having effect as if done) by or in relation to the transferor before the time when a scheme comes into effect for the purposes of, or in connection with, anything transferred under the scheme shall, so far as is required for continuing its effect after that time, have effect as if done by or in relation to the Authority.

 (6) Any reference to the transferor in any document, including any enactment, constituting or relating to anything transferred under a scheme shall, so far as is required for giving effect to the scheme, be construed as a reference to the Authority.

<P>
(b) for the purposes of that Act, the employee's period of employment with the transferor shall count as a period of employment with the Authority, and the change of employment shall not break the continuity of the period of employment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> On behalf of all members of the Committee, I thank you, Mr. O'Brien, along with Mrs. Dunwoody and Mr. Atkinson, for the way in which you have conducted our work. It has been largely benign, and we all have very much appreciated the skilful way in which you have taken us through our proceedings.
<P>
I also thank the Clerk and all other members of staff who have allowed the Committee to operate so effectively. I thank members of the Committee for their contributions, and in particular both Whips for the expeditious way in which they have allowed proper scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
I add my personal thanks to my hon. Friend the Solicitor-General, who over and above the call of his usual duties, has been willing to advise the Lord Chancellor's Department. I thank the civil servants from the Lord Chancellor's Department for their contributions and those who have been involved in our proceedings. I thank all those who have made representations to members of the Committee, some of which we have heard at great length&#151;and some of which we have taken notice. I am particularly grateful to you, Mr. O'Brien, for your efforts.
<P>
<H5>1 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I join the Minister in thanking you, Mr. O'Brien, and your fellow Chairmen for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. I add my thanks, in particular, to those of the Minister to the Clerk and to the staff of the Public Bills Office who, to Opposition Members, are an invaluable service. As always, they have carried out their work in the finest traditions in the House by being entirely neutral, dispassionate and disinterested. I thank them for the assistance that they have given me and my hon. Friends.
<P>
I also join the Minister in thanking the other staff of the House who have made our life as comfortable as possible in the Room. I want to thank Hansard reporters, who have sometimes had a difficult task following my mumblings. Other members of the Committee, whose diction is even worse than mine, might have caused them problems, too. I thank my hon. Friends for their forbearance in listening to my remarks and I hope that I have not put them off from their aspirations for government. I hope that my remarks have enabled Labour Members to look forward to being in opposition, because they know that being Opposition Members in Committee is more fun than being Government Back Benchers in Committee. I recommend that they should do what we are trying to do and I hasten them in my direction.
<P>
Finally, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) for the caring way in which he has conducted his flock through our proceedings. In the spirit of cross-party amity, I also thank the hon. Member for Stretham (Mr. Hill) who, ever since his appointment as a Whip, has impressed me with his courtesy and good manners. I congratulate him on keeping a straight face, not only when I have been speaking but when some of his hon. Friends have been speaking.
<P>
If people have been in doubt about what has been happening&#151;certainly this morning, when it may have been thought that we were not scrutinising the Bill&#151;I remind them that the Committee stage is only part of our proceedings. The Bill will be debated on Report, when we can scrutinise it further. At present, we have an unfettered other place, which will be able to revisit the Bill when it returns to the House of Lords. If improvements to the Bill are suggeted there, I hope that the Government will be as conciliatory in that place as they have on some occasions been here, and as I hope they will be in our later proceedings in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am entirely happy to associate myself with the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough. I am extremely grateful to you, Mr. O'Brien, and your fellow Chairmen, and to the Clerk and those who report our proceedings. It is quite apparent that I have a voice like a foghorn and I do not know whether that helps or hinders those who have to pick up what I say. Nevertheless, I am grateful to everyone.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of my colleagues, I wish to thank members of the Committee for their kind remarks, and especially for the way in which they have helped us to conduct business. It has been a pleasure to serve on a Committee in which so much interesting debate has taken place. I also thank the Hansard people who report all that is said in Committee. They are working extra hard at present because of the amount of legislation that is before Parliament. I also thank the Clerk and his colleagues for guiding us through our business.

Question put and agreed to.
