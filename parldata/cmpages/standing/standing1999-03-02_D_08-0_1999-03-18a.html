Schedule 2, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders in England and Wales</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> Today we come to the part of the Bill that deals with pension sharing on divorce. Clause 15 gives effect to schedule 3, which amends part II of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The clause gives the courts in England and Wales the power to make pension-sharing orders on proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage. Pension sharing by agreement is dealt with by a separate route under clause 20.
<P>
We have already referred to the extensive dicussions on this clause and on the clauses that follow. In June 1998, the Government published a draft Bill, on which the Social Security Select Committee took substantial evidence it published its report in October. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) and for some of the time the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) were involved in the work of the Social Security Select Committee on this matter.
<P>
By common consent, the Select Committee did an excellent job. The Government responded to its report in January, the Bill was published in February and the Select Committee published a further report last week, commenting on the changes that have been introduced into the Bill. The report said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Pre-legislative scrutiny by departmental select committees is only one of the strands of modernising the House of Commons being piloted during this Parliament. The Government has benefited from prior exposure of its proposals and has responded to technical points raised by interested parties. Much has been done to improve the transparency of the process by which interested parties are consulted in the formulation of Government legislation."</font></ul>
<P>
Our task has been made much easier by the work of the Select Committee, to which I pay tribute.
<P>
The provisions in schedule 3 will allow pension rights to be treated like other assets when a couple divorce or if a marriage is annulled. They will allow a proportion or all of the value of the pension to be transferred from one spouse to the other as part of the overall financial settlement.
<P>
Pension sharing will increase the choice available to divorcing couples and give greater flexibility to the courts when they are deciding the fairest division of material assets. It will promote certainty and clarity for people who are going through divorce and make it easier for them to achieve financial independence through a clean break.
<P>
Pension sharing will not be compulsory. Couples can still earmark and offset pensions against other assets when those options are more appropriate. Pension sharing is not intended to be of particular benefit to either women or men. In practice, however, it is likely that it will help more women than men because more men will have pensions to be shared.
<P>
We do not underestimate the complexity of pension sharing. The detailed provisions in the Bill will be supported by clear rules and regulations to ensure that the process works successfully.
<P>
There are five main points to make about the schedule. First, it places pension sharing in England and Wales within the framework of the Family Law Act 1996. Couples will be able to apply to pension share as soon as the court receives the statement of marital breakdown. The court may make an order before the divorce, but the pension-sharing process will take effect only after the divorce.
<P>
Secondly, there will be a stay period, during which no action should be taken on the order. Either party can then appeal the order. The pension-sharing order will be stayed until the end of the appropriate period for giving notice of appeal. Pension-sharing orders will not, therefore, become effective until the divorce order has been made and the stay period has expired.
<P>
Thirdly, although it will be possible to appeal against pension-sharing orders up to and beyond the point of implementation, the court will not be able to set aside or vary an order if that would adversely affect the pension scheme. The court will be able to make further orders as it thinks fit to put the parties in the position that it considers appropriate.
<P>
Fourthly, the couple must meet the pension scheme's administrative charges that arise from pension sharing. If the couple are ordered to share, the court can apportion the administrative expenses that arise from sharing between the couple in a way that is appropriate. If the court chooses not to exercise that power, the member spouse will be expected to pay the charges. It is important that the charges do not fall on anyone else, such as other members of the scheme, the Government or the taxpayer.
<P>
Finally, the Bill restricts the combination of earmarking and pension-sharing orders and the making of multiple pension-sharing orders in relation to any given pension. That is important for several reasons. We want to encourage clean-break agreements. We want to be fair to both parties former spouses should not have several bites of the cherry and the scheme member's remaining pension should be safe.
<P>
We also need to protect the position of previous spouses, as illustrated by the case of a man and his second wife who are obtaining a divorce. When the man divorced his first wife, she may have been granted an earmarking order. If the second wife were then granted a pension share, the husband's pension fund would be reduced, which in turn would reduce the first wife's retirement income. We need to protect against that.
<P>
The provisions in the schedule are designed to ensure that pension sharing is processed efficiently through the courts, can be delivered effectively by the pension schemes and meets the requirements of the couple who are divorcing or whose marriage has been annulled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): As the Minister says, we are moving on to the second part of the Bill, which should have been a second Bill. The provisions that we are now examining have nothing to do with stakeholding or the running of the national insurance system, which is covered in the third part of the Bill. Some unpleasant measures are being taken against women and disabled people, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
As I have said all along, the Bill should have been three Bills. Conservative Members insist that we give all three separate parts of the Bill the full consideration that they deserve. We are not in any way bamboozled by the fact that the Government have used the trick of putting three separate items into one Bill partially, no doubt, to dilute the impact of the extremely unpopular measures in the third part of the Bill.
<P>
If the Government thought that we would believe that this was only one Bill and that we would therefore need to rush through it, they have another think coming. We believe that it is important that, before any decisions are taken, the House and particularly the Committee give the three subjects the consideration that they deserve.
<P>
I have not been sparing in my criticism of the Government in relation to stakeholder pensions. The Government promised to consult the public but, in introducing their proposals, they pre-empted the consultation process. In this case, however, I must, in all fairness I am a fair man, as I hope the Committee is discovering commend the Government. In the part of the Bill that deals with pension sharing it could almost be called a second Bill they decided to engage in a process of pre-legislative scrutiny.
<P>
A number of hon. Members, including me, pushed for such a process in the previous Parliament. We have thought for a number of years that such a process would be a sensible way of ensuring that legislation is better prepared. It would also make good use of the select Committee system.
<P>
As the Minister rightly said, the Government published a draft Bill last summer, on which they invited the Select Committee on Social Security to comment. That Committee held a number of hearings and both it and the wider public had the benefit of those proceedings. That seems a sensible way to prepare for legislation, and the Government are to be commended for having done that on this occasion. I do not know whether they did it in the first burst of democratic enthusiasm when they won the election, and as soon as they discovered that they had a vast majority and could do anything that they liked in the House, and began to place increasing reliance on the media manipulation machine to which I have referred before, they decided that it was not necessary to live up to the rhetoric of their early days. Perhaps we shall have no more pre-legislative scrutiny exercises as far as I am aware, there have been none recently. That would be very sad indeed. However, the Government were right to adopt that course in this instance.
<P>
Unfortunately, despite the commendable procedure of publishing a draft Bill and having pre-legislative scrutiny by the Select Committee, I do not think that the Government have fully thought through what they are now proposing to the House. Conservative Members see considerable difficulties in the principle of pension sharing. It may have perverse effects on our society. In certain cases, it may discourage people who would otherwise do so from getting married. The Labour Government are not particularly interested in the conventional notion of marriage, so perhaps they do not mind about that.
<P>
However, anyone wanting to protect his or her pension should not get married, if the Bill goes through. [Interruption.] I do not know whether, for once, there will be an intervention from Labour Members. It is clear from the Bill that if a person lives with someone without going through a ceremony of marriage, that person's pension will be immune from being split or shared if the relationship breaks up. If one has gone through a form of marriage, that will not be the case.
<P>
Pensions represent a substantial part of the household assets of people in this country, who have worked for them for many years and are very attached to them. People who conduct their lives rationally will have to take the effects of this proposal into account if they contemplate marriage. Let us suppose that two people had been living together for a long time.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been talking very generally so far more in the manner of a Second Reading debate. I do not think that he has yet referred to what is in the clause or the schedule, so I ask him to confine himself a little more to those subjects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I was taking my cue from the very general remarks made by the Minister when he introduced the clause, Mr. Malins. I thought that it would be reasonable to be guided by what the Minister said.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister was not only more brief, but made more relevant remarks in relation to the clause and the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The clause covers a schedule that represents the essence of the proposed legislative changes. There are considerable dangers in proceeding in this direction. The Bill will establish a number of perverse incentives. People who would otherwise marry might, in certain circumstances, not to do so. People who might not otherwise have done so might divorce. Indeed, it might be tax advantageous for a couple to go through a divorce, if one of them has a pension subject to a 40 per cent. income tax marginal rate. They will both be taxed at a much lower rate if the pension is split. That might be significant, and I shall present calculations of the savings to be made that way. Clearly, if one party in the marriage has a substantial annuity and contracts a fatal disease, there would be an obvious incentive to split that annuity by going through a pension share, rather than lose it altogether.
<P>
There is no evidence that the Government have thought about such points in the schedule or elsewhere in the Bill. The Minister referred to costs, but the Government have substantially underestimated the importance of costs.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is enormous scope for technical arguments about the value of a pension and how to split it. We have tabled two amendments addressing that. Nevertheless, I am not sure whether it is possible to find a genuine solution to that matter in the context of the Bill. There may well be a situation in which neither party to the marriage benefits fully from the pension because the sum available in aggregate to both of them is substantially reduced by the costs of the split. The Government have not thought about that.
<P>
In the Committee's first sitting, I commented on the extraordinary unfairness of the Government's approach, which is based on a crude feminist agenda. I had better say right away that I regard myself as a feminist. I am proud that the first political campaign in which I participated was getting women into the Cambridge Union [Laughter.] That was a quarter of a century ago, and it may seem amazing. Indeed, it is rather shocking.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My patience is limited, and the question of admitting women to the Cambridge Union is not pertinent to our debate. The hon. Gentleman may correct me if I am wrong, but he must return to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not claim that the schedule refers to the Cambridge Union. However, Labour Members did not treat my sincere statement that I was a feminist with the seriousness that it deserved. Therefore, it was necessary to bolster that statement and provide a demonstration of my sincerity. I could draw on other aspects of my career, but I shall rest on my first political campaign.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Obviously, my hon. Friend is in the prime of his life. However, the very people who tried to get into the Cambridge Union are now at the age at which they will be affected by the measure.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This will not do. Hon. Members must restrict themselves to debating that which is pertinent to the clause. I remind them of my powers, should they go too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am sincere in saying that we should legislate for adults, not just for men or women. I hope that it will be accepted that I do not want to get at women. The reverse is true. In our first sitting, I read out the introductory statement of the document to which the Minister referred earlier. That document was published last summer by the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), and it had a clear feminist agenda of giving women more pensions.
<P>
That kind of unfair agenda explains the Government's extraordinary decision that the pension scheme member who, as they say, is typically a man must pay all the costs when two parties going through a difficult divorce cannot agree on the allocation of costs. That seems wildly unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I wonder if the hon. Gentleman misheard me. The point that I made was that if the court chooses not to exercise the power to apportion costs, the member spouse will be expected to pay the charges, but it will be for the court, not the divorcing couple, to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We are coming to costs, and I shall come back to the Minister on that point. I shall not try your patience, Mr. Malins, by responding now, but I stand by what I said.
<P>
Even worse and more scandalous is the Government's suggestion that, whereas the beneficiary of a pension split characteristically, in the Government's own words, a woman will be able to take her share of her former spouse's pension and add to it as much as she wants up to the Inland Revenue limits on her subsequent income, the party who was the scheme member, who will characteristically, in the Government's view, be a man and who loses a part of his pension as a result of the pension split or share, will not be allowed to gain the full benefit of the Inland Revenue limits. He will be limited in the extent to which he can provide for his own pension, and build it back, by the Inland Revenue's deeming him to continue to enjoy the pension that had been taken from him. If that is not unfair I do not know what is. It is astonishingly unfair and we reject that sort of unfairness.
<P>
Another aspect of the provision that we utterly reject is the complete failure to consider children, who are not mentioned at all in the presentational document or the Bill. That is disgraceful.
<P>
The Minister mentioned earmarking this morning. We all know that one of the reasons for promoting the concept of pension sharing in certain quarters is that earmarking has not been a great success. It has not been very widely utilised. The evidence that was presented to the Select Committee and included in the document makes it clear that earmarking has not been much used.
<P>
I do not know whether, rather as in Christianity, earmarking has been tried and found wanting, or whether it has been found complicated and new, and not tried. I suspect the latter.
<P>
The feminist argument about earmarking is that it is unsatisfactory because the beneficiary of an earmarking order, who would on the Government's interpretation typically be a woman, ceases to benefit from it if her former husband dies. It is therefore said that it is better to hand over a share of the pension to be the inalienable property of the former spouse, so that it does not matter whether her former husband dies. On the other hand, in the event of the woman remarrying it is possible for an earmarking order to be varied or removed by the court, whereas under pension sharing or splitting the former spouse can remarry the next day if he or she and I think according to the Government's agenda it would be she wishes. The pension share being irrevocable, she still gets away with the considerable bonus of that capital sum even if the court intended her to be supported by her former husband only while there was no one else to support her.
<P>
An earmarking order might plausibly be thought more fair than what I have described. Sometimes someone leaves a husband or wife intending to remarry rapidly. That is no doubt concealed from the court while the divorce is in progress. However, as soon as a pension share or split is effected, he or she can go through with the marriage the next day with complete impunity. The court has, in a sense, had the wool pulled over its eyes. That is a serious point and represents a serious flaw in the whole concept of pension sharing which the Government have thus far failed to address or even seem aware of.
<P>
Those are some of the fundamental issues with which the Committee will have to engage over the coming hours, days and weeks. Unless we can be satisfied on these essential points, it would be wrong to proceed down this particular road. However, we keep a genuinely open mind and we may be persuaded that, on the balance of the argument, we should at least allow the courts to add to the panopoly of instruments that they already have and grant them, in the event of divorce, the possibility of making a pension-sharing or pension-splitting order.
<P>
Even in those circumstances, though, we shall require that that power shall be confided to the courts only with some additional protections and guidance, which are not currently in the Bill. That explains the basis of many of the amendments to the schedule, which we will be turning to in a few moments. It is not my intention to hold up debate on the clause any longer; we should proceed to the schedule where the real meat of the argument lies and where the real substance of the new regime is set out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond </B>(Gravesham): As my hon. Friend the Minister pointed out in opening our debate today, the Select Committee on Social Security examined the issue in considerable detail. I would like to pay tribute to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) for attending so many of the sittings to hear the arguments of members of the Committee and those giving evidence. I was therefore rather surprised to hear him challenge the principle of pension sharing, which most of those giving evidence to the Committee supported, as indeed did members on both sides of the House when the idea was first mooted under the previous Government.
<P>
It is a sad indictment to suggest that people will make decisions about marriage on the basis of what will happen when they divorce. I cannot believe that any of us go into the process with that expectation. However, if we are doing calculations, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford might work out that there is a balance of incentives a disincentive to marry on account of pension sharing on the one side, and an incentive to divorce on the other. One would assume that the whole matter would balance out.
<P>
One of the important issues that concerned the Select Committee was the effect of Inland Revenue rules on allowing a member of pension scheme to rebuild their pension subsequent to pension sharing on divorce. Those rules might cause problems for some individuals who might be unable to rebuild their pension to provide an element of security in their retirement. I am pleased that in their response to the Select Committee, the Government said that that matter would be subject to review and I hope that the Minister will now be able to tell us the outcome of that review.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough) : Clause 15 gives effect to schedule 3 which amends schedule 21 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. That seems a convoluted way of proceeding, so perhaps the Minister would explain why it is being done in that way. At an early hour, I went to look up the Matrimonial Causes Act, and such is the conscientious nature of our Chairman that I found him also in the Library seeking section 21 of that Act. This is a Chairman who is not content just to listen to our debates he actively pursues them.
<P>
I am saying all this to flatter you, Mr. Malins, in the hope that you will not interrupt me at a later stage if, for instance, I start to refer to the Cambridge Union and how my hon. Friend the Minister for Grantham and Stamford launched Arianna Stassinopoulos on to a waiting world. She was the first woman chairman of the Cambridge Union, so my hon. Friend has a lot to answer for. However, I shall move on quickly from the Cambridge Union.
<P>
The Minister referred at some length to our Select Committee report. I think he was trying to convince the Committee that this was an effective and ground-breaking procedure and that the Government took on much of what the Select Committee said. There is a lot of truth in that. However, if pension sharing has a such long history and will intimately affect hundreds of thousands of people, and if we are amending what is already a complex part of family law, it would have been far better if this could have been a separate Bill
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having sat through the Social Security Select Committee, I also think that it is useful for all-party committees to deal with this sort of legislation which is generally non-partisan. That does not mean that it is not dangerous. The Child Support Agency legislation was not partisan. Everyone supported it but it had a devastating effect on many people. It would have been better if the House of Commons could have adopted a different sort of procedure to deal with this Bill, instead of the partisan debates that we shall have. If the Committee could have formed itself into some kind of Select Committee and taken evidence as it was proceeding, we might have ended up with better leigslation. However, that is for the future: I just make that as a general point.
<P>
The Minister mentioned that the Government had taken on board some of what the Select Committee had suggested. It is true that the Government accepted some of our recommendations such as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"making absolutely sure that pension sharing will be available only to those who begin divorce proceedings after legislation has been brought into force;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>giving schemes the discretion to impose a single indexation requirement on the whole of the pension credit;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>allowing the Pension Ombudsman to rule on the reasonableness of administration charges;
evaluating and monitoring the impact of pension sharing legislation."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There were a number of other matters, but I will not go into them in any detail because presumably we will deal with them as our debates proceed. They include earmarking, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford referred, and unfunded public service pension schemes. That is an important issue which covers whether the Bill should be extended to former spouses of firefighters, teachers, soldiers, civil servants, nurses and police officers. We need to have a whole debate on that because the Government did not feel able to accept all the Select Committee's recommendations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gravesham mentioned the recommendations on time limits and Inland Revenue rules. What a delight it was to hear him speak; we hope to hear from him again. There are recommendations on transfer values, on unmarried survivors and the implementation of the legislation. After a long inquiry by the Select Committee there will still be many unresolved matters.
<P>
This is a dangerous area of legislation and I am not sure that we thought it through as well as we should. I do not wish to repeat what I said on Second Reading, not least because you would rule me out of order, Mr. Malins. But in the detailed consideration of the various amendments, bit by bit, we may be able to peel away the legislation and, as obviously did not happen with the CSA legislation, find out the practical effects.
<P>
We will come across enormous difficulties in trying to split what are already inadequate pensions. The legislation has a long history. It goes back as far as the Goode committee in 1993 which suggested that this sort of legislation should be introduced. The Minister referred to sections 166 and 167 of the Pensions Act 1995 which deal with this point and which were inserted during its passage through Parliament. I understand that they gave the courts new powers to attach benefits payable to a member of a pension scheme for direct payment to a former spouse.
<P>
As clause 15 is an important, introductory clause, we should be clear about the courts' powers under existing legislation. I want to know if those powers are sufficient and why the courts do not use them. If you will allow it, Mr. Malins, this would be a useful opportunity for the Minister to explain why the Bill is necessary and why the existing powers are not used.
<P>
I was on the Standing Committee during the passage of the Family Law Act 1996, to which I tabled many amendments. The matter was felt to be so complex that provisions such as those in the Bill were not attached to that Act. That begs the question why, if they could not be attached to an Act that was directly relevant to the issue, they should be attached to a Bill that deals with entirely different matters. That is a separate issue, but it would be useful for the Minister to give us a resumé of the existing powers of the courts and to say why they have been found wanting.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Having heard what the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, I feel compelled to make a brief contribution.
<P>
I hope that I speak on behalf of all feminists when I say that the clause is gender neutral. I was, therefore, surprised by the hon. Gentleman's comments. He asked why we need the clause and whether, because the problems are so complex, it would not be better to leave the matter alone.
<P>
Last year, I considered issues relating to welfare reform and its affect on women pensioners in whom I have a particular interest and on women generally. I found that women pensioners received lower pensions, and were less likely to apply for the income support to which they may be entitled, than any other group. It worried me that women pensioners were living miserable lives, especially when the former husbands of many divorced women were doing quite well, thank you very much.
<P>
It is accepted that women contribute to the household, whether or not they are part of the labour market and making a financial contribution to the home. It is a reasonable principle, therefore, that a lady should be entitled to a share of the household income on divorce. It is churlish to tell her that because of the complexities of the situation she must carry on into old age without her particular circumstances being considered.
<P>
The same would be true of a married gentleman who was not as well paid as his wife. Changes in the labour market, especially those affecting women's employment, mean that that is increasingly so. Many women now have their own pension schemes and, on divorce, their husbands may want to apply to share that pension if they have contributed to the household, as women have formerly done. Pensions do not necessarily have a feminist agenda, but there is an agenda of fairness and equality for all. Thus the clause is entirely reasonable.
<P>
I am surprised that Opposition Members consider themselves to be feminists when speaking about the issue. It is a version of feminism that I have not heard of before, but I am used to that version of discrimination and I deplore it.
<P>
This narrow part of the Bill is concerned with the principle of whether, on divorce, both partners should I think rightly share a pension to which both have contributed through the household funds. That is as far as the clause goes and that is why I support it.
<P>
When the hon. Gentleman speaks to his many amendments he will raise particular matters. He also expressed concern that we have not had sufficient time to debate the clauses, adding that they ought to be split up. I seem to remember the Committee being here for many hours just to discuss clause 1. Surely we have had plenty of opportunity to examine each clause in much detail, as we have done today. The accusation is somewhat narrow in its scope and not in itself a reason for rejecting the principle.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I do not want to get into a bidding war about who is the most feminist in the Committee, but I can lay claim to credentials that perhaps the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Ms. Kali Mountford) cannot, such as persuading the Chancellor of the Exchequer to introduce separate taxation for married women's taxation and I have a long history of campaigning on women's issues.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed a little discussion of these matters in the interests of fairness to everyone, but we must now return to the matter under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed, Mr. Malins. I was about to come to fairness and equality because much of my support for women's issues over the years has revolved around those issues. I, and no doubt most of my hon. Friends, have among their constituents, if not their friends, a number of divorced women who, because of their lack of work history, do not have their own pension. Hence, as they get older they see their ex-husbands with mostly reasonable pensions while they live in poverty. So, I support the clause because it introduces the concept of pension sharing. However, like my hon. Friends, I have a number of questions.
<P>
My reading of the schedule is that some perhaps unforeseen consequences will leave one or other party in an unfair position when a pension is split. We are right to take up those issues because we need to ensure that both sides get the best possible deal out of extraordinarily complex circumstances.
<P>
I welcome the recommendation that better training and actuarial advice be made available to people involved in pension splitting and to the courts. It is crucial that the courts understand the complexities. Part of the reason that the CSA got into difficulties was that the consequences were unforeseen by either the courts or ourselves. Therefore, we must examine the issues with care.
<P>
We must also consider the effect of those trends on employment. It is now women who go out to work, while we have the problem of young men not going out to work, but I do not want to be called to order because I accept that that is another issue. In the coming 20, 30 or 40 years, women will be building up very reasonable pensions.
<P>
Reading schedule 3, what I am not clear about perhaps because I am not sufficiently legally trained is whether the reference to more than one pension sharing order relates to both partners in a marriage having a pension, whether each pension will have to be divided  up by the courts, or whether as sometimes happens there is more than one pension. I have more than one pension. Are we talking about more than pension scheme? Perhaps I do not understand the legalese, but that sort of issue needs to be teased out and clarified, to ensure that both partners in a marriage get fair and equal treatment when pension sharing is introduced.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I will make a brief contribution in response to the hon. Member for Colne Valley, who said that the language used was gender neutral. However, that does not mean that there is not a serious problem in the overwhelming majority of cases, the proposal will affect women. The excellent report of the Select Committee on Social Security, which delved into most of the relevant issues, points out that the political impetus behind the legislation involves concern for the pension rights of divorced women.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
You were quite right earlier, Mr. Malins, to call me to order. I cannot apologise too much. My point, which I should have expressed in a different way, was that the problem is increasing. Divorced people currently constitute 3 per cent. of those who retire. That figure will steadily grow until about 2025, when it will reach about 13 per cent. As the number of divorces increases, the number of widows will decrease. The matter is of considerable importance.
<P>
The clause and a schedule that we shall presently discuss suggests that pension sharing, or pension splitting as it was formerly known, will become the norm and that every pension will be split on divorce. However, that is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the Government's intention. Rather, the Government  want to include the pension in the financial package that is available to the courts, which also includes property and available assets. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the normal rules of divorce will apply the first priority is to make adequate provision for children and the next is to ensure that the accommodation of those who care for the children is sorted out.
<P>
For the proposal to represent a genuinely clean break, we must not create a situation in which two people end up trying to subsist on wholly inadequate pension rights. The Select Committee report helpfully recognised the growing tendency for women who work to take out their own independent pension schemes. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham suggested, it would not help the courts if we started assessing individual pension schemes and said, "Let's compare the man's portfolio with the woman's. The woman has a stakeholder pension, but we don't want anything to do with that. Let's make another calculation." We should ensure that all assets are taken into account at the end of a marriage.
<P>
The report said that the average marriage lasts about 26 years. I found that figure startling when I realised I had been married for 24 years. However, I have every intention of remaining married. Those of us entering the second decade of our marriage are in a very dangerous period of our life. Given the length of time involved, a large number of pension rights will have built up.
<P>
Pensions have changed enormously, especially over the past 10 years. We must ensure that the proposals make it absolutely clear that the figure is an additional discretionary sum that will be available to the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I certainly endorse the last point that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) made, which was an important one about the approach that is being taken. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley was also right to express puzzlement at the brand of feminism owned by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. He began by saying that the provision reflects a feminist agenda and that that, in his mind, was a bad thing. However, he continued by declaring himself a feminist. The Committee will doubtless be somewhat confused by the hon. Gentleman's position.
<P>
We are grateful to the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) for expressing a view that is more broadly acceptable and for supporting the principle of pension sharing. In doing so, she spoke for the great majority of people. We shall watch with interest the conflict of views among Opposition members as the debate progresses. She is right: marriage involves sharing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There is no conflict among Opposition members. The point is a simple one: pensions, or anything else, should of course be shared if adequate resources are available to ensure that sharing meets the needs of divorcing people and their children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that pension sharing is a bad thing because it will not apply to cohabiting couples and will therefore create a disincentive for people to marry. The view expressed by the hon. Member for Beckenham was rather different. She is right and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is wrong.
<P>
The pension-sharing proposals simply reflect current family law, which does not recognise cohabitation for the purposes of matrimonial proceedings. If the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford believes that that law should be changed, he will again find himself in minority among his hon. Friends. The provision will ensure that, when two people divorce, pensions are treated alongside other assets. As the hon. Member for Beckenham said, that is absolutely right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> On that point, would the principle apply to pre-nuptial agreements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is not clear to me how it could apply to such agreements. The principle is that, when a divorce occurs, assets should be shared. Given that there are no assets in a pre-nuptial agreement, I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but he may wish to return to the matter in due course.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough said that the matter ought not to be dealt with in that way and that there should be a process of evidence taking. He and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that such a process should be used more widely and I agree with them. However, in this case, the Select Committee undertook precisely that process and we should not go through it again. He and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham have done the job and done it well.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked why the Government want to change existing legislation and for an explanation of the problems as we see them associated with, for example, earmarking arrangements. The hon. Gentleman has in front of him a copy of the Select Committee report, entitled, "Pensions on Divorce", which explains at length the current law. Minutes of evidence taken I note that the hon. Gentleman was present on that occasion and a memorandum submitted by Martin Pointer, QC, are reproduced on pages 50 to 63 of the report. In paragraph 1 of the memorandum, Martin Pointer says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it can, I think, fairly be said that family lawyers have for a long time felt that the court's power to do justice between divorcing couples has been inhibited by their inability to make orders affecting pension funds of which one spouse is a beneficiary".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continues by talking about the subject in more detail.
<P>
Earmarking attachments have significant limitations and, as yet, have not been used a great deal. In particular, they do not allow a clean break in most cases, because title to the pension rights remains with the spouse in whose name they have accrued. The Bill will change that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham pressed me on whether people would be allowed to rebuild pension rights. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford also raised that matter, as did the hon. Member for Gainsborough. As my hon. Friend said, my predecessor as minister indicated to the the Select Committee on Social Security that the Government would keep the issue under review. I am pleased to tell the Committee that Treasury Ministers have agreed an easement for members of occupational pensions schemes on moderate incomes up to £22,650 per annum which is 25 per cent of the earnings cap that will apply from 6 April this year. For that group, which accounts for the majority of members of occupational pension schemes, the pension debit will be ignored in calculating the maximum benefit limit for the member whose pension has been shared. 
<P>
The easement involves treating the pension debit in broadly the same way as pension benefits from earlier employments. The normal tax approval rule is that the maximum pension on retirement from all employments is two thirds of final pay, as my hon. Friend knows. If a scheme provides only modest benefits or the scheme member has modest earnings the pension benefits accrued in previous employments can be ignored within that limit. Treasury Ministers have agreed that the pension debit will be similarly ignored for those on modest earnings. The effect of that easement will be that a person on moderate income will be free to rebuild his or her pension towards the maximum permitted, but within the 15 per cent. annual limit on employee contributions that will continue to apply.
<P>
I hope that that will be of some help to my hon. Friend who has raised the matter in the Select Committee and in this Committee and that it will be widely welcomed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On a point of detail, to which we may return to as we go through the Bill, I understand that the Minister is saying that people with moderate earnings will be able to rebuild their pension fund up to 15 per cent., but is there not a facility for people to contribute more as they get older and closer to retirement age?  Will the Inland Revenue maintain the limit at 15 per cent. for people who are 55, or would such people be able to contribute more if they wanted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The 15 per cent. limitation applies throughout to occupational schemes. A higher limit applies to personal pensions, which will not be affected by the easement that I described. With personal pensions, the contribution limit rises to 40 per cent. of earnings per annum, which should provide scope for most people to rebuild their fund within the existing arrangement, although many people will be unable to afford to take full advantage of such limits. The limits in relation to personal pensions will not present a great problem. In any case, personal pension holders are not constrained by maximum benefit limits, unlike occupational pension scheme members.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I understand why such limits exist the Treasury must have such powers to stop people engaging in tax avoidance. The Minister has related to us news of the Treasury's concession. Given that we are considering moderate salaries, why is it necessary to stick to the 15 per cent. rule? Will not that constrain people's ability to build up their pension as we would want, given that they are experiencing difficulties as a result of divorce?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is asking me why the Government do not relax the 15 per cent. employee contribution limit, it is because the effect of that would be to create special tax reliefs for people whose pension had been shared, which would be unfair to other pension scheme members, including those who are divorced but do not pension share. It would be difficult to make the case for additional tax concessions for those whose pension has been shared, nor is it a case that I would support. The hon. Gentleman will agree that we do not want to give tax advantages to people in that position, because it would take us back into some of the problems that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred to at the outset.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> On that point, the hon. Member for Gainsborough will recognise that many people, especially those on moderate incomes, find it difficult even to build up to the 15 per cent. figure and many are far below that. Therefore, we are talking about an upper limit. I welcome the proposed formula, because it allows people to go up to the two thirds limit if they can do so, and it allows those on moderate incomes to rebuild. My concern is for those on moderate incomes who need the opportunity to rebuild and may not have other assets to fall back on.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister focused on occupational schemes, which are also important, because the industry was worried that, without an easement on such schemes, there would be an incentive to shift to personal pension schemes. Therefore, I welcome the concessions. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I have no doubt that his arguments influenced our colleagues in the Treasury in reaching that conclusion. He is right that the proposal, which will be in the Finance Bill rather than in this Bill, does the job identified by the Select Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister made an interesting point about the 15 per cent. We seem to be drifting back to people on modest incomes, which goes back to the original point made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley. I thought that this concession would be an additional shot in the locker. If we are to make it for people on modest incomes and it becomes almost the norm, it will be like the judgment of Solomon without its happy ending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that that is the case. The threshold of £22,650 a year 25 per cent. of the earnings cap from 6 April will cover the majority of occupational pension scheme members and target help on those who most need it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham said. The threshold will be linked to the normal rules for people changing jobs. If the limits for the threshold change, the provision will also extend to pension sharers. Therefore, we are building on an arrangement that has long been in place for people who change jobs and was operated by the previous Government. It is a sensible measure to deal with the problem that has rightly been identified.
<P>
I want to respond to two other points that were raised. The hon. Member for Gainsborough suggested that the schedule was much too complicated. He is not right about that. The Bill aims to achieve the necessary amendments in the clearest possible way. Schedule 3 sets out the amendments that need to be made elsewhere. It would not help to have them in the body of the Bill. A letter from the Institute of Legal Executives that was submitted to the Select Committee of which the hon. Gentleman is a member can be found on page 23 of the evidence submitted to the Social Security Committee. It said in paragraph 1:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A pleasing amount of the Bill is straightforward and understandable, even to those without a specialist pension background. Undoubtedly, the time spent on consultation, and the manner in which it was carried out and the use made of pensions and family law experts, contributed to this clarity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, those who understand these things are right to say that we are doing this in a clear way.
<P>
Lastly, the hon. Member for Beckenham asked for clarification on whether the proposals applied to all pension rights. She referred to people who are in a number of pension schemes. Pension sharing will be an option. No court will be required to impose a pension share. The courts, or the partners if they reach a negotiated agreement, will decide how the assets should be shared. If there are two sets of pension rights, they may both be shared, or one may be shared and the other left with the scheme member, but it is a matter for the courts to resolve, as it is for the courts to resolve the other financial arrangements arising from the divorce to achieve a fair overall settlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We have had an interesting debate. I did not say, as the hon. Member for Colne Valley seemed to think I did, that we had not managed adequately to cover the stakeholder issue in our earlier proceedings. We spent just about the right amount of time considering that issue and succeeded in exposing many of the shortcomings of the stakeholder concept. We did that with no contribution at all from Labour Members. I am glad to see that they have woken up and are now beginning to take part in the debate on pension sharing. That is only right because this is a democratic legislature. We are making laws on behalf of the people who sent us here. It would be a peculiar state of affairs if the Executive branch lay down what it wanted to do with absolutely no comment at all from Back Benchers. That is not how a legislature should work. If people always behaved in that way, we would not need a legislature; we could just have an Executive branch and be done with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): The hon. Gentleman's comments are a bit rich when almost half the Conservative members of the Committee have not bothered to be here this week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We were pleased that the hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Arundel and South Downs wanted to serve on the Committee. Unfortunately, when it was set up, they were already committed to Select Committee visits elsewhere. I am told that they will be back with us next week.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we get back to the matter in hand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I must comment on what the Minister said about feminism. Let there be no confusion about the use of that word. Of course I am a feminist, in so far as I firmly believe in eliminating any barriers to women in social and economic life or any barriers to people on the ground of sex or handicap and legal rights that apply to people by virtue of sex. I have given an example of that.
<P>
However, there is an active sort of feminism, which is not intended to establish equality but to provide special consideration or provision for women. I believe that that is just as wrong as the reverse. The previous Secretary of State for Social Security, the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) made it clear in her introduction to the document to
which the Minister referred this morning, that she was selling the pension-sharing idea as something that would be of great benefit to women. I mentioned that because I think that it is the wrong way to present legislation, which must be even handed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am becoming alarmed by the course of this debate apparently, we are all feminist now. I am not a feminist.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I cannot allow constant references to feminism. Interesting though they may be, they are not relevant to the issue under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Even-handedness is germane to our discussion and is lacking in too many parts of the Bill. The two parties to a pension split are not treated fairly. I mentioned the costs and the Revenue rules. The Minister has now made an interesting announcement that the Revenue will make a concession, but we will have to look carefully at the text of the document to confirm that. Perhaps he can give me a copy of the document this morning.
<P>
I was not satisfied with that concession on first hearing it. We are debating a matter of principle. Either it is right or it is wrong to treat both parties to the pension split equally. I believe that it is right but until now the Government appear to believe that it is wrong. They are not proposing to treat both parties equally. Their proposal focuses entirely on occupational pensions. The problems with other pension schemes are ignored. The Minister said that he does not want there to be any difference between people who have personal pension schemes and occupational pension schemes. He also said that the Revenue concession the easement of the rules would apply to people on modest incomes.
<P>
This is a matter of principle. If it is right to treat both parties equally I believe profoundly that it is then one party should not be subject to a means test. The Labour Government love means testing and this is a new context for a means test. The scheme member the person who has the pension and who will lose part of it to a former spouse should not find that he or she is in a less advantageous tax position than the former spouse if he or she earns more than the arbitrary limit.
<P>
Will the arbitrary limit apply at the moment of the divorce split? Will the scheme member lose the right to rebuild a pension when he or she ceases to have a modest income and begins to enjoy a higher income? That would be a stupid anomaly. The scheme member the loser from a pension split may earn more money in the future which would allow him or her to rebuild for the first time some of the lost pension. If the easement is to apply exclusively to people on a lower income, it will allow them to have the right to rebuild their pension only when their income is sufficiently low, when they will probably not be able to do so.
<P>
When their income rises and they can afford to make use of the right, it will no longer be available to them.
<P>
That is completely cuckoo and a typical new-Labour muddle. We do not want complexity, we want a simple statement from the Minister that there will be even-handedness. Why can I not get that simple concept of justice across to the Government? We have come across that problem in other parts of the Bill and will no doubt encounter it in future. This is a striking example not so much of the Government's obsession with complexity for its own sake, but of their inclination to use complexity as a mask for doing the wrong thing.
<P>
The Government are on the run. They know that their original proposals are unfair and unacceptable and they are aware of our intention to table amendments, so they produced a half-baked concession. If my interpretation of it is justified, we will not regard it as adequate and we will provide alternatives, either in this Committee or in the Standing Committee that considers the Finance Bill, or both.
<P>
We do not want to close our mind in principle to the advantages of giving the courts the power to split pensions. For many years, they have had the power to consider pension assets when they split assets and revenues section 21 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 allows them to do. However, we have deep concerns about the matter.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On that basis, we shall not vote against the clause. We can always vote against the schedule if we are dissatisfied with it after our amendments to it have been considered. Our amendments would help to make the pension-splitting regime fairer and more viable. Parliament would therefore be happier about enacting the Bill and the public could live more easily with a scheme that includes our amendments than with the Government's muddled, often ill-though-through regime.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 68, line 41, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(c) is made in terms to be prescribed in regulations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This may be the moment at which I completely destroy my good name with the Law Society. The object of the amendment is simple. It states that a pension-splitting order should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"made in terms to be prescribed in regulations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reason for doing that is to prevent the text of the pension-splitting order from becoming the subject of a prolonged legal dispute. It could easily become an issue between two teams of lawyers.
<P>
I am a great admirer of the English legal profession. The vast majority of lawyers whom I have come across have the highest degree of professionalism. They take seriously their public responsibilities and the idea that justice should not be unduly expensive or delayed. However, there are always exceptions the public have heard about too many such cases recently and the reputation of the British legal profession has been somewhat damaged.
<P>
We all recall how, during the previous Parliament, the firm Peter Carter-Ruck established what must have been a record at the time by charging Sir Norman Lamont, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, about £23,000 for a possession order. Perhaps the temptation to charge so much was particularly strong because the legal bills were apparently going to be paid out of public funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Exactly. That is why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes. That was not a happy moment.
<P>
We also heard the other day about Mr. Anthony Julius of Mishcon De Reya a firm that is well known to the Labour party who managed to charge a cool £500,000 for setting up a trust. Admittedly, he had first taken the precaution of having himself elected as chairman of the board of trustees. There are occasions when, I am afraid to say, a small minority of the legal profession behave irresponsibly and cynically and run up costs and we have to consider the possibility of such behaviour when drafting Bills. In legal circles, there will inevitably be ambiguity and, therefore, scope for judgment and negotiation. Lawyers will make great play of their skills when costs are correspondingly high. It is important for Parliament not to leave loose ends because, almost inevitably, less scrupulous members of the legal profession will exploit the scope for gratuitous work. That is the context in which we tabled the amendment.
<P>
There should be no difficulty in drafting a pension-splitting order to avoid scope for argument. If we are to go ahead with pension splitting, it is important to ensure that the costs of the exercise are not exaggerated in relation to the assets to be split. I shall revert to that theme in other contexts. 
<P>
Pension funds are an important part of people's total assets and lifetime savings, but are tiny in relation to the earnings of professionals such as lawyers, actuaries and accountants. Disputes and arguments between those highly competent technicians may take such a large amount of the value of the pension fund that it may cease to be worth splitting. It may become an appalling deal for both parties and a particularly cruel one for the party that loses the pension, or a substantial part of it, for which he or she may have worked hard for many years. The benefit may not go to the former spouse if it is abstracted by others along the way.
<P>
The amendment is not party political and would not subvert the thrust of the Government's proposal for pension splitting. I hope that the Minister has listened to my argument with an open mind and that he will accept the amendment. It will be peculiar if the Committee accepts no amendments, other than those from the Government, however well argued and sensible they may be and however little people quarrel with them, on the "not-invented-here" principle. It would be a sad day if that happened, so I hope that this simple, sensible, pragmatic measure will have a fair hearing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I support my hon. Friend because he made some good and relevant points and was right to castigate the legal profession. Direct evidence of the need to do so arose in the Social Security Select Committee during the examination conducted with Mrs. Hilary Siddle, chairman of the Family law Committee of the Law Society. I asked her a question that is directly relevant to the point raised by my hon. Friend. It appears on page 67 of the Committee's report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Is there any way in which we can try and reduce the costs by having stamped forms procedures? Have you done any work on this to try and reduce the costs to the public?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mrs Siddle replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have not done any work on that."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I then said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"You can understand that there might well be standard procedures that could be developed, forms and such like, to reduce costs?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Ellison replied and his answer is interesting in relation to what the Minister promised about the Bill's lack of complexity. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There seem to be costs in a number of areas. One is obviously the charges which the pension funds make which is not what we are capable of discussing today. One of the charges is the cost of advising clients on the complexity of it. A number of Members of the Committee this morning have referred to the complexity of the legislation. I know it is not directly to your question, but I wonder if I might just raise a couple of points on the complexity. The first is, as Hilary" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mrs. Siddle 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"mentioned, we do welcome the opportunity to discuss a draft Bill. I think this is the first time it has been done. Secondly, it is very helpful to have the accompanying discussion documents which explain how it is done. That is the good news. The bad news is that it is very complex. Normally, the legislative process in Britain has been that we have very detailed legislation but that ancillary documents, what are known in France as travaux préparatories, are not considered relevant. The system in Europe is different. Their legislation is very short and simple, but you can refer to the preliminary documents. There are pros and cons for both systems. What we seem to have in this process is very complex legislation and preliminary documents as well."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those views are expressed not just by anyone but by experts in the field whose job it will be to advise people on the legislation.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford makes a clear point: the complex subject of pensions will be imposed on a complex legislative framework. I am reminded of visits to the Council of Ministers, where a similarly complex matter was superimposed on complex European procedures. It was, as a former Prime Minster said, as difficult to understand as a game of "three-dimensional chess".
<P>
The Bill should make it clear that there will be standard forms, so that the legal profession will be unable to run up extra costs and pass them on to the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I should point out to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, who referred to the whereabouts of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, that four Labour members of the Select Committee on Social Security have made it their business to take part in today's proceedings. If the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is conducting Select Committee business elsewhere, the hon. Member for Grahtham and Stamford should raise the matter with him.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> For the record, I should make it clear that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs sits on more than one Select Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that clarification. Nevertheless, I thank those of my Friends who are members of the Select Committee on Social Security for taking part in our proceedings today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I wonder whether the Minister noticed that, last week, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs and other Opposition Committee members chose to participate in a debate in the Chamber rather than in this Committee's proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. While these exchanges bring smiles to our faces, they do not advance the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment seeks to prescribe the terms of a pension-sharing order in regulations. Opposition Members have made cogent points on the subject. It is in everyone's interests that pension-sharing orders are made in clear and consistent terms to avoid unnecessary delay in implementing the pension share. It is also important that information about the order, which will be made available to the pension provider, is standardised. However the amendment is unnecessary because we envisage that the terms of the order could be prescribed in rules of court, without introducing further powers to create secondary legislation. The Lord Chancellor's Ancillary Relief Advisory Group has been invited to consider the appropriate format of pension sharing orders and to advise the Lord Chancellor accordingly. The appropriate vehicle is rules of court, because an order of the court is the creation of the court. Proposals would be considered by the Lord Chancellor's Rules Committee and could, in the normal way, be the subject of wider consultation.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford accepts that the amendment is unnecessary and will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not accept that the amendment is unnecessary. I am happy for the form of a pension-sharing order to be decided by the Ancillary Relief Advisory Group. However if Parliament is to give guidance to the courts and save money by excluding an area of potential legal dispute and otiose cost, the Bill must provide for regulations that specify the form of the order. It is no use saying that the Lord Chancellor's ancillary relief advisory group can consider the matter; it does not need to do anything about it; nor does the Lord Chancellor need to make regulations.
