						 My name is
Nicholas Wikeley. I am a law professor at the university of
Southampton. My research specialisms include social security law and
child support or, as we should now call it, child maintenance law. I
have done both qualitative and quantitative research in the area, and I
have written extensively on the subject. I sit as an appeal tribunal
chairman in a part-time judicial capacity, although I do not hear child
support appeals, and I am also a social security and child support
commissioner. Therefore, I should make it clear that I am giving
evidence in a personal academic capacity, rather than a part-time
judicial
capacity.</div>

it was well trailed beforehand so it would be fair to say that there
were no huge surprises. In terms of what will work and what will not,
that is the fundamental question because operational efficiency is what
the system has been lacking. I am clear in my own mind that there need
to be changes to the enforcement procedures. Whether they are the
changes that I suggest is a separate issue, but clearly there need to
be changes.</div>

went back to first principles&#151;to the basic principles of child
support, which the Bill does not do. The root of some of our problems
is that the Child Support Act 1991 simply says that non-resident
parents have a duty to pay child support. It does not say that children
have a right to child support. It does not say that parents with care
have a right to child support on behalf of their children. That seems
to me a fundamental issue and it is sidestepped

						</i> It is difficult to see how you could step
much further backwards, given the mess that we are in at the moment. I
would like to say that it is a step forward, but maybe only one step.
However, as I say, I remain sceptical about the emphasis on private
ordering. I say that because when the 1991 Act was passed, we all
assumed, wrongly as it turned out, that the agency would take over the
role of the courts. That has not
happened.</div>
					<a name="07071835000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
has happened is that private arrangements, or private absence of
arrangements, have taken over the role of the courts. Obviously it is
better if people can make private arrangements and compliance rates are
better. However, the reality for most people&#151;well, those that
are not on benefits&#151;is that they have had that option for years
and have or have not been doing it as the case may be. I do think that
there is a huge pool of people out there desperate to do private
arrangements who have somehow been frustrated by the existing
system.</div>

						</i> I am not saying one instead of the other,
but that one is a correlative of the other. If you have a duty to do
something, presumably someone else has a right. It is a question of
articulating that right. That is part of ensuring that one creates a
culture of compliance. Children have a right to maintenance and you
must establish a societal acceptance of that right. The way that
existing legislation is phrased, it is seen simply as an onerous duty
imposed on non-resident parents as a means of saving the Treasury
money. We are obviously moving away from that, but it is a question of
building a culture of
compliance.</div>

						</i> They need things that are inherent in the
private arrangements, but there is also the question of the external
environment&#151;it is a combination of the two. So far as things
that are internal to the private arrangements are concerned, I do not
think that they will work unless people have proper, adequate advice.
The Bill is promising us information and guidance&#151;not advice. At
the end of the day, we are talking about people&#146;s legal rights
and duties, and that will require, at times, legal advice. Carrying on
from that, there is also a point about the relationship between the
parties. We know from existing research that parents with care will
take what they are offered, regardless of whether it is a fair and just
outcome for the children. That is because of the imbalance of power in
relationships. Having an external source of advice, rather than simply
information and guidance, is one way of redressing that power imbalance
so that you protect the interests of vulnerable people. Contrary to
popular misconception, that is largely what lawyers are about,
certainly in family law. Family lawyers do not like conflict&#151;it
is parents who like conflict.</div>
					<a name="07071835000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also issues about the
external environment. You would have to have an efficient agency that
is an adequate threat, which will step in if the private arrangement

Selous:
						</b> I have one more brief question. The Government
line, we heard this morning, is that the big stick to make private
arrangements work is the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission
system. From your experience of looking at child support around the
world, is that sufficient? Does it need more teeth, or is the threat of
being dragged into the tender embrace of CMEC going to be enough to
make non-resident parents in particular keep the money flowing on a
regular
basis?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>As I said, we need to look at
the enforcement system. It is a mistake to concentrate on the big
stick, because that sends the wrong message about compliance. It says
that anyone involved in child support is, by definition, a bad dad or a
deadbeat dad. It is about creating a culture in terms of responsiveness
towards people and their circumstances&#151;for example, making sure
that direct payment from salary is seen just as something you do like
paying utilities by direct debit, not as a punishment for someone who
has not performed their duties. Yes, there is a place for extra
sanctions, but it certainly is not the be-all and end-all.
Over-emphasis on that sends entirely the wrong message.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>
					<a name="07071835000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all
in this because we want compliance to be better, and there are various
strategies that we can use, one of which is to focus on deterrents.
However, it does not seem to me, from past experience, that that is
necessarily the most efficient way, either in child support or other
fields. You are much more likely to improve compliance if you build a
consensus about what is socially acceptable and socially unacceptable.
My recollection is that 20 or 30 years ago people used to drink and
drive and it was not really regarded as a serious problem, but it is
now. Other examples are the wearing of seatbelts and smoking in public
places.</div>

							<b class="B">Mrs.
Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): You said that
parents tend to take what they are offered. We had a conversation this
morning about parents being allocated a key worker or case worker who
would see their case through. The case worker would probably deliver a
better service, because they know that they will deal with that parent
on an ongoing basis, and the parents would be offered some additional
comfort. However, we were told that that is not possible. I would
imagine that one reason why parents take what they are offered is that
they feel vulnerable and think, &#147;Let&#146;s take this now
while it is on the table, because it may go off the table and there may
be nothing else.&#148; Would you support the case for parents having
one person within the department who deals with their case? It would
give them the additional confidence that they might need if they knew,
that if they did not take what they were offered, someone would be
there, continuously dealing with the case and helping them to get a
better
deal.</div>

about how far I can reasonably expect them to do all the tasks that the

						</i> First, you have to make the distinction
between offering information and guidance and offering
advice&#151;they are very different functions. In terms of
information and guidance, one can see that that could be done through a
number of methods and it has to be done in ways that meet the need of
the client group out there, whether by telephone, a web-based service
or face to face. Of course, the most vulnerable people will probably
need a face-to-face service, for whatever reason: they may not be able
to access either the telephone or the web-based service, or comprehend
the full import of what it involves. The best advice on specific
circumstances is always face to face, from someone you can exchange

						 Yes. Let me put it another
way. We have heard several times from Ministers and from the previous
Prime Minister that the problem with the child support system is that
the CSA is involved with assessment, collection and enforcement and
that it cannot do those three things. Well, the Inland Revenue does
those three things and CSA Australia does those three things. It is
possible for the same organisation to assess, collect and enforce.
Whether it is appropriate for the same organisation to advise is, I
agree, a separate issue. Would we necessarily expect the Revenue to
offer me impartial advice about my self-employed tax position? I think
I can rely on it to give me some sort of information and guidance, but
if I want advice, I will hire an

						</i> I certainly think there is a case for laying
down certain basic standards or criteria, basic terms or templates,
that the agreements could meet. I think of the Australian experience.
Unlike us, Australia has a universal system. Basically, everyone is in
the agency. More than 90 per cent. of eligible people are in the
agency, but of that huge pool about half are in only at the beginning
for an assessment. After that, they deal with collection privately. The
problem is that no research has been done, so we do not know how
effective those private agreements are. No one has asked. If you ask,
the agency will say, &#147;Well, if they weren&#146;t being
complied with we&#146;d hear about it, because they&#146;d apply
for agency collection.&#148; That may or may not be true. People

selective sample of quotes, but separated parents, both mothers and
fathers, are hugely appreciative of the practical nuts-and-bolts,
week-by-week guidance on how to make their relationship with their

that the Australian system is deeply unpopular, the Australians say
that in customer satisfaction ratings the agency rates quite
highly&#151;roughly an 80 per cent. satisfaction rating, which is
very high. Having said that, the agency still generates a lot of bad
press in Australia, and it still generates a lot of complaints to the
Commonwealth ombudsman. Yes, there is a hard core of seriously
disgruntled people.</div>
					<a name="07071835000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
accept the appreciation of the new initiatives that have been
undertaken, but it is not simply putting leaflets on the web. The
agency&#146;s people go into workplaces to talk to workers about how
the system works. Again, it is part of a bigger system. It is too early
to know how it is working, but, as I am sure you know, the Australian
Federal Government have set up a system of family relationship centres,
which is part of a wider development in family law. Again, family law
judges here receive a lot of criticism about secrecy and so on, but
Australian family law judges take far more criticism. The family
relationship centres are part of an initiative to nip those sorts of

is an alternative to court, and so you can see the Treasury&#146;s
argument for fees. On the other hand, we know that the difficulty in
child support is getting the money out of people, and getting
additional fees out of them would add to the problem. If the purpose,
or the primary purpose, of child support is to try and attack the child
poverty targets, we cannot levy fees on parents with care, because that
will be a disincentive to them using CMEC, if they cannot reach a
private agreement. The question is whether you just charge non-resident

Potentially, it will undermine that cultural acceptance of the payment

Henshaw&#146;s report quoted a figure that I must admit was contained
in research that I did some years ago with a number of colleagues at
Southampton and elsewhere. That suggested that, if the compulsion were
removed, something between a third and a half of those subject to it
might choose not to use the agency and might go private. More
recently, small-scale research commissioned by the Department suggests
that that figure might be lower&#151;more like 15 to 20 per cent. If
we consider the current eligible population, we know that the divide is
actually something like half and half&#151;as far as we know, about
half of the eligible population have no child support arrangements in
place. That means that there is a risk that, if section 6 is removed,
those people will enter the pool of those with no agreement, rather

I understand the Bill, part of it is about moving things into voluntary
arrangements, which, by your own admission, are far more successful and
far more likely to be adhered to. It is also about stopping things from
just falling by default into the remit of the CSA or in this case CMEC.
That shift is what David Henshaw&#146;s report was fundamentally
about, and the voluntary arrangements were one of the radical
departures mentioned in it. I would like to find out whether you think
that the proposals are fundamentally a move forward or backward,
because I feel that there is a slight contradiction in your evidence.

						 I am sorry that
it appears that way, and I shall try to explain my concern more

opportunity for people to make private arrangements, which private

						 Yes, but I am
thinking of genuinely private cases in which there is no issue of
claiming benefits. At the moment, those cases are in a sense outside of
the scope of the agency anyway, and a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>private agreement can be made in relation to them. Clearly that does not
happen in a substantial number of cases, because something like 50,000
cases a year do not make a private arrangement and end up with the
agency or
CMEC.</div>

						 In practice,
yes. At the moment, the agency gets some 50,000 such cases through its
doors each year. These are people who do not need to use the agency,
but they end up there because they cannot make a private arrangement
themselves. I  am not convinced that that number will fall
substantially&#151;it is just a fact of life. They have the
opportunity to make a private arrangement, and they, or one of them,
will not take

						</i>That is a very difficult
policy question. It seems strange that under the existing system there
are parents with care under the old scheme who have no disregard
whatsoever, there are parents with care under the new scheme who have a
grand &#163;10 a week disregard, and there are parents with care who
may also work on the checkouts at Asda for more than 16 hours a week
and claim working tax credit who have a complete disregard, although
their actual circumstances are not significantly different. It seems
difficult to justify giving the person working 16 hours a week a
complete disregard, so that all their child support is cash in hand,
whereas the parent with care who works 15 hours a week is subject to a
disregard of &#163;10 or even nothing. That seems unsustainable, and
I simply do not buy the labour incentive arguments. I think that there
are all sorts of other reasons why people want to be in
work&#151;partly monetary, partly social&#151;and those are much
more powerful than the level of the
disregard.</div>
					<a name="07071835000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
seem to suggest that I speak in support of a complete disregard.
However, there is obviously a cost attached to that which the Treasury
can doubtless calculate. If a particular figure is set, there is
clearly a danger that that becomes the maximum amount of child support,
even if the circumstances are actually such that more should be paid. I
know that Professor Parkinson from Australia, who chaired the
Australian taskforce and inquiry, is very critical of the British
proposals. His argument is that the only people who will benefit from a
large, fixed disregard are well-to-do non-resident

I see that in paragraph 18 of your useful paper, you criticise clause
40, which takes away the ability to recover public expenditure on

would overturn some 400 years of British social security custom. Can
you elaborate a little on that, and perhaps give a general perspective

						 Yes, I can see
the argument for that, although you may not be comparing like with
like, so I would reserve my opinion. In so far as clause 40 is
concerned, there is not much doubt that one of the agency&#146;s
major presentational problems over the years is that it has been seen
as simply a Treasury recovery mechanism. Personally, I welcome the
change, as combating child poverty will be seen as one of the major
objectives of the child support system&#151;if not the major
objective. It seems wrong to throw away completely, in all
circumstances, the issue of benefit recovery. Partly that is with a
view to creating public acceptance for the scheme; we know that most
people will form relationships with people of the same socio-economic
class&#151;that is the way that the world works. However, there may
still be situations where the parent with care ends up with the
children, on benefit and on a very low income, and the non-resident
parent has a substantial income.</div>

private arrangement, because they cannot or do not want one, for
whatever reason&#151;the mother may not want the father in the
children&#146;s lives any more&#151;then clause 40 is saying that
the state has no interest. That is even though the state is directly or
indirectly supporting the parent with care and the children, when the
man&#151;if it is a man&#151;has a substantial income which is not
being used to support the children. That seems difficult to justify to

because the point was discussed in 2000, and the Government White Paper
said that the net figure would be used, because it is closest to what
people actually have in their pockets&#151;it is what people
understand. Obviously that argument has now been put to one side, and

question is what we mean by income, and how income is calculated. I am
not privy to the discussions between the Department and Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, but it is clear to any outsider
who knows anything about the system that Revenue and Customs already
operates different methods of calculating income for different
purposes. Income is slightly different for income tax and national
insurance contributions and certainly for tax credits. We already have
problems within the child support scheme in defining income. Under the
old scheme, all income was counted as income unless it was disregarded.
Under the new scheme, it is counted only if it comes within one of the
specified categories. We, therefore, have major problems with benefits
in kind, dividend income and so on, which are not taken into account
under the new scheme

						</b> The 25 per cent. income variation has aroused a
certain amount of comment. Do you think that there is perhaps a case
for reducing it in terms of lower-income non-resident parents? If you
are poor and you have a 24 per cent. fall in your income, this is a
pretty significant rule. If you are on a hefty income, it does not make
so much difference, but it is a blunt instrument for people who are
counting the pennies week by week and trying to do the right thing.
Would it be possible to have some sort of scale, perhaps even varying
things a bit more at a higher level, so that overall this is not a cost

						</i> You have to remember why the suggestion has
been that we move to a 25 per cent. tolerance and to think about the
problems that we have with existing schemes. Those problems are that
both the new and the old schemes are built on the social security
model, so frequent changes and frequent reassessments occur, and you
get on to a hamster wheel where assessment chases assessment and change
chases change within the system. There is a trade-off between dealing
fairly with people&#146;s circumstances, making the system
operationally manageable and not having too many changes of
circumstances.</div>

					<a name="07071835000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question then becomes a
judgment call as to where you fit that level. As I indicated in my
evidence, the Australians use a 15 per cent. tolerance. If your income
is 15 per cent. or more down on the year, you can get a change. Another
way of doing it, rather than having a universal figure, would be, as
you have said, to have bands. For example, under &#163;20,000 your
tolerance level would be lower; between &#163;20,000 and
&#163;25,000 it might be intermediate; and above &#163;25,000 it
might be higher. The problem is that you then introduce extra
complexity into the system, and we know from experience that more
complexity makes the system more difficult to

						</i> I am not expert on the tax system. I have
talked to those who are, and my understanding is that the Revenue, not
surprisingly, concentrates its investigative resources on the cases
that it thinks are the most serious and that will produce the most
return to the Exchequer. That makes good sense. Such cases will not
involve whether a plumber is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>earning &#163;15,000, &#163;20,000 or &#163;25,000 a year. For
self-assessment purposes, if &#163;15,000 or less were involved, we
would be talking just about three-line accounts, which could hide all
measures of things. Even above that figure, if it is in the band of
what one might expect a plumber to earn, HMRC will leave it and will
not look at it from a tax point of view. I do not see how HMRC will
suddenly undergo a cultural shift and start examining these relatively
small cases from a child support
perspective.</div>

that we often hear from constituents is the fact that there are already
two systems running in parallel within the CSA, providing totally
different outcomes depending on when the case first went to it. We will
now have a third system, and it may be some time before things are
transferred over. Are you confident that there can be a successful

						</i> The obvious riposte is that the agency
already has extensive enforcement powers but, historically, has not
used them. In the debates on the 1991 Act, the complaint was that a new
agency with Gestapo-type powers was being created. There was a lot of
debate about that, especially in the House of Lords. What happened,
certainly in the first 10 years or so, is that, by and large, the
agency simply did not use those powers. The figures show that there has
definitely been a change in the past two or three years. The agency has
begun to put more resource into
enforcement.</div>
					<a name="07071835000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
perfectly respectable argument to ask why the agency should have any
new powers until it has proved that it can use its existing ones.
Having said that, we know from overseas regimes that different systems
use different sanctions, so there might be other appropriate penalties
in particular cases. When I gave evidence to the Work and Pensions
Committee in 2004, I put the case for withdrawing passports, or
something similar, in very extreme cases. The Australians use a
slightly different system, but it is basically the same sort of idea. I
can see the case for that as a high-order sanction that might be more
effective than imprisoning people or taking away their driving
licences, for
example.</div>

you stories of cases where the agency has failed to take enforcement
action and to make applications for liability orders when it should
have done. Equally, there are other cases where it has taken action
precipitously or on the basis of inaccurate assessments. Either way, it
has not worked out. If the decision is that the liability order should
be an administrative mechanism, we must have proper accountability and
a proper and efficient appeals system, and I am not convinced that the

the courts&#151;or, at least, removing the obligation on the agency
to make an application to the courts&#151;and bringing it in-house
within the agency is that the courts take too long, as stated in the
White Paper. I have not seen the empirical studies on which that was
based, and it is not clear to me whether that delay was caused by the
courts delaying the processing of the cases or by the agency&#146;s
inefficiency. Cases sometimes get more than one adjournment, and that
may well be the agency&#146;s responsibility and not the

effectiveness.</div>
					<a name="07071835000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that you can use curfew orders for two reasons. One is to keep
track of people; to locate them. I assume that that is not the purpose.
The other reason is as a simple penalty and an alternative to
imprisonment. We all know the problems with prisons. Anything that
keeps people out of prison&#151;if they are not a danger to
society&#151;is presumably a good thing.</div>
					<a name="07071835000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, I am slightly
concerned that curfew orders are part of the big stick mentality, which
may not necessarily help to engender a culture of compliance. There is
also an issue here of parity of treatment. Curfew orders were an option
that was considered for parents who unreasonably refused access to the
non-resident parent. That measure was dropped from what is now the
Children and Adoption Act 2006. There is a question here of treating
people equally in like circumstances. If the sanction is inappropriate

There are factors that will always be relevant: the person&#146;s
age, the number of dependents and the earning potential that they have

						</i> The Bill is a skeletal document. A lot of
the issues that will determine whether or not the new scheme is
successful relate to big questions that are hard for Parliament to
address. For example, the Department&#146;s budget will have a 5 per
cent. cut, year on year, between 2008 and 2011. There are big issues to
do with resources and delivery mechanisms, such as procurement policy,
IT systems and project management. Delivery has been the big failure of
child support. In the past, a lot of time was spent discussing policy
questions and getting the policy absolutely right; far too little
attention was paid to how it worked alongside effective delivery. A lot
of the big issues are not mentioned in the Bill, such as the transition
from two schemes running side by side to one new scheme or, in fact,
three variations. There will be an information and advice service to
support voluntary agreements, a cash collection service in another
tranche and a new scheme. That transition is a huge mountain for CMEC
to climb, but there is very little information in the Bill about any of
that.</div>

the Treasury about the level of that disregard, but there is a clear
interest in recognising the importance that child maintenance can play
in combating child poverty, which we are pleased about. Children in
lone-parent families are more at risk of poverty than other children.
There are good things in the Bill, and getting an effective child

						</i> I think that it is too early to say, to be
honest. The intentions are good, but a lot of the detail of delivery
still has to be worked out. On the new assessment process, everyone is
enthusiastic about using tax data from HMRC, but there is a danger of
everyone saying, &#147;Oh that&#146;s jolly good&#151;tick,
let&#146;s move on.&#148; That is what has happened in the past
with child support. Everyone has agreed with the principles and turned
away from considering how it will work in practice. Is HMRC up to it?
Is it going to deliver? We are still making up our minds, and it is too
early to tell whether it will work or not.</div>

						</i> Yes. We are in favour, for example, of the
abolition of section 6 and the requirement automatically to use the
agency if you are on benefit. We think that it is right that all
parents are given a choice about how they make the best maintenance
arrangements for their children. We are sceptical about the degree to
which voluntary arrangements will work for a large number of parents
who are bringing up children on their own, so we are keen to see a
really good statutory scheme for parents who need to use it, whether
they are parents with care or non-resident

						</b> When David Henshaw did his review of the Child
Support Agency, as it is now, one of his key recommendations was to
have an absolutely clean break within the new system. Did you support
the idea of a clean break from the CSA?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Janet
Allbeson:

						</i> We can certainly see the need to rebrand
the whole business of child support and child maintenance. The old
system&#151;the CSA&#151;had really lost the trust of parents and
the public. There is clearly a need to say, &#147;We&#146;re new,
we&#146;re different, we&#146;re going to do things
differently.&#148; As to whether that will be achieved&#151;there
is a window of opportunity but various things remain the same, as
Professor Wikeley has pointed out. It is the same staff, the same
computer system and a lot of the rules will be the same.</div>
					<a name="07071835000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will it be a clean break? There
is an opportunity to show that it is different. One thing would be to
give more through the child maintenance disregard, so that what you are
saying from the start is that the scheme is about money going to
children, not to the state. That gets the public on board and makes it
clear that, if a non-resident parent does not pay, he is cheating on
his children, not outfoxing Gordon Brown or, now, Alistair Darling.
That is very important. Can there be a clean break, for instance, from
the debt that is owed? We are concerned that CMEC should not walk away
from the legacy of non-payment and of children being brought up without
that money. We want more attention to be paid, in terms of the
objectives of CMEC, to recovering that money.</div>
					<a name="07071835000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue about whether
there can be a clean break will be whether it is seen to work right
from the start. In the case of both the last schemes, they went wrong
right from the start. It should not happen again this time. People will
be looking to the new scheme, and they are quite hopeful. Parents and
the staff, too, are hoping that it will work. The scheme started to
fall apart in 1993 and then in 2003, when the delayed new scheme came
in, and it was clear almost straight away that it was stumbling. If
there is going to be a fresh start, we are keen that the Department
should frontload and should not make the mistake of trying to pull
staff and resources too early out of the new department. It should put
the resources in at the start, and only after 2013, once it is really
starting to work and once it is over the mountain of transferring
cases, will it see whether it can reduce the staffing and resources put
in. Yes, let us make a fresh start, but a lot needs to be done to do
that.</div>

Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I think that we all will be
fairly familiar from our constituency postbag with cases&#151;I want
you to confirm that there are such cases&#151;where the absent parent
resorts to various tactics, such as physical mobility, job mobility,
redefinition of employment as self-employment and so on. You are
nodding, so I take it that you confirm, at least, that it is not
unfamiliar to you. Clearly, the result for the parent with care is
pretty ghastly. Can you give us any indication&#151;it might be
relevant to the future of the new scheme&#151;of how much you think
that is related to what might be termed &#147;malicious
contacts&#148;, whereby people take advice on the internet or
otherwise on how to subvert the existing system? Do you have any
confidence that the new system will be robust against such an organised
attack? Ministers have clearly given some attention to
that.</div>
					<a name="07071835000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">To single out a
particular case in which there is an inequity, what about the situation
in today&#146;s world of complex families whereby a parent is
paying maintenance in respect of a child from a previous relationship
but failing to receive it for a child whom they are now maintaining?
That seems to aggravate the sense of unfairness and unacceptability
about what has been happening and what none of us wants to happen in

						</i> There is a huge spectrum of non-compliance.
Non-payment is part of it, but there are also all the other ways in
which NRPs can avoid paying, such as by readjusting their financial
affairs, so that they seem to have little income. At one end of the
spectrum there are people who would cut off their right arms rather
than ever pay, but there are people at the other end who maybe do not
have much money or who have a lot of debt. They may be in a new
relationship and have a new family, and they might be in and out of
work and casual employment. It can be very hard to
pay.</div>
					<a name="07071835000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
CMEC has a role to play in a lot of circumstances. There could be a
situation in which someone is willing to pay but relations are so bad
between a couple, particularly about money, that both agree,
&#147;Let&#146;s get CMEC to sort it out, to take some of the
bitterness out, and we can deal with sorting out contact more amicably
without having to argue about money.&#148; So CMEC does have a
role.</div>
					<a name="07071835000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is incredibly
hard to get money from people who duck and dive and are reluctant to
pay, and there has been a sort of naivety about the ability to do that.
Sir David Henshaw, for example, said that it was a bit like collecting
electricity costs or parking fines. Well, it is not, because there is a
degree of emotion and bitterness that can build up and that we have to
acknowledge. That goes for some of the contracted-out things lower down
the line. We have to recognise that the case load is quite
specific.</div>
					<a name="07071835000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">CMEC must be
more than just a big stick, being hard-edged and going after people. It
must acknowledge that there is often a sense of bitterness and
grievance, to do with not seeing your child any more and having to
parent from distance. People need support in how to do that, and they
need their grievances addressed. They might need good information and
advice. They might have a sense of grievance that turns out to be
misplaced.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>
					<a name="07071835000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a departmental report
on compliance, and what became apparent from reading it through was how
many non-resident parents were really angry about their assessments but
had not appealed against them. They had not realised that they were
interim assessments, which was clear from looking at them, even to me.
They assumed that that was how much they had to pay; they never
realised that they could go back and sort it out. Those people may have
debts.</div>
					<a name="07071835000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you can
deal with some of the wider problems about why an NRP is not paying,
you can maybe get the maintenance flowing again. Ideally, a good
information and guidance service would offer that. As Professor Wikeley
was saying, that is not just information; it is advice. It is about
sitting down with someone and sorting out some of their problems, so
that you unplug the gaps and help them pay. CMEC can also be a good
service for people who find it difficult to pay regularly and have
chaotic lives. Let us offer it as a service, not just a big
stick.</div>

for a quick comment on your take on what happens when this begins to
break down? It may be that the parties have good faith and, through the
mediation or intervention of CMEC, have entered a private arrangement.
If one party to that arrangement either disputes its terms or is just
not compliant, or maybe gets into difficulties, will that be a CMEC
function? What is the best way of handling
it?</div>

Allbeson:

						</i> Ultimately, if a voluntary agreement breaks
down, CMEC must be there to step in. That is the simplest way of
dealing with it. We want CMEC to focus on running a good statutory
scheme. In our view, that is its primary responsibility, and if it can
get an efficient statutory scheme going, voluntary agreements will be
encouraged in the shadow of it, because people will know that, if they
do not stick to their voluntary agreement, the agency will step in
smoothly and efficiently&#151;not necessarily
belligerently&#151;and get the money going
again.</div>
					<a name="07071835000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">On offering a
really good service of information and advice for parents, often when
they are at the point of separation and relationship breakdown, there
will be a lot of bitterness and pain. There will be many issues to sort
out, of which child maintenance will be just one small part. There
might be debt, housing, and rights on cohabitation and contact
to sort out. CMEC is stepping in to a wider spectrum
where that maintenance arrangement will work only if that wider picture
is dealt with properly. The DWP cannot do that on its own.</div>
					<a name="07071835000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are proposing, at least,
that pilots be set up. Let us consider advice services run by other
Departments: we have a relationship breakdown programme run by the
Ministry of Justice and the Department for Children, Schools and
Families. The DCSF also runs a parent know-how fund, which gives advice
on parenting. The Department of Trade and Industry runs financial
inclusion of debt services. There are a lot of different pots of advice
and information out there.</div>
					<a name="07071835000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We wrote to the Chancellor, to
the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families and to the
Secretary of State for Justice saying that we wanted some pooling of
resources to pilot a service for separating and separated families that
would help them manage and support them in order to get the best
outcomes for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>children. Research suggests that non-resident
parents are more likely to pay maintenance if there is some parental
involvement. There has been a lot of fuss about lone parents supposedly
refusing contact. Well, lone parents have said to us: &#147;We want
more contact. Why does he not get more involved?&#148; There is a
sort of consensus that, if non-resident parents can be more
involved&#151;providing it is safe, of course&#151;it has very good
outcomes for children. We wrote a joint letter with Fathers Direct, and
got a lot of other parents organisations to sign up with us, asking for
cross-Government funding and backing for a new service for separated
and separating parents.</div>
					<a name="07071835000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to CMEC, we are
sceptical about how effective the information and guidance system will
be in supporting voluntary arrangements. A telephone line and a website
are a start, and we know from our own research into the advice needs of
lone parents that they like the telephone, because they can ring when
they get home from work or after they put their kids to bed. So it is a
good start. Often you can get a diagnosis over the phone about your
problems and advice on where to go, but where do you
go? There is a lack of capacity, because parents also want face-to-face
discussion about their options. Should they go for the mortgage being
paid or for child maintenance? What about getting their debts paid off
first? Would that help? People have individual situations that need to
be sorted out. There is a need for advice and information, but given
the limited resources that the DWP has to devote to this, we are
sceptical about whether it can do what is necessary in order to really
increase voluntary
arrangements.</div>

non-resident parents who would rather cut off their right arms than pay

constituency MPs is an unrealistic assessment by the non-resident
parent of how much it costs a week to support a child&#151;how much
of a contribution should be made. Sometimes it is not only how much the
assessment is but whether they think it too high. I have had parents
telling me that the CSA assessment was unrealistic and that &#163;30
a week was more than adequate to keep a child. Can we reconcile that
perception through CMEC or some other mechanism?

alternative to private arrangements, as people would know that there
was a backstop. If CMEC is efficient and deals with things competently,
will not people go to it as the first port of call? It would be more
straightforward than the CSA. Their experience of the CSA may not be
good, and they may not want to get involved, but if they went to CMEC
it could end up dealing with all cases. Alternatively, do you prefer
the Henshaw view that CMEC should deal with the smaller number of more
difficult cases, and that it would be better if the bulk of cases were
dealt with through private arrangements? Which of those two visions do

potential institutional bias where the organisation has a business
interest in steering people away from using its services because of the
cost. The Government&#146;s response to the Henshaw review was to say
that too much money is spent chasing too-small sums of money from poor
people. Of course, potentially, poor lone parents stand to benefit from
this system. We do not want to see children in lone-parent families, 50
per cent. of whom are poor in terms of the children, in any way steered
away from using a system that offers them the potential to get
maintenance. The regulatory impact assessment says, at paragraph 117,
that every 10 per cent. increase in case load would cost &#163;20

<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>come out of the DWP budget and that he would have to fund the whole

there is a need for such a service, but we are not convinced that the

in that the obvious place to levy them is against non-resident parents
who fail to pay. It is hard enough getting them to pay, let alone pay
fees. That is what interim maintenance payments were,
essentially&#151;a kind of penalty. In the past, fees were charged,
but had to be stopped because the service was so appalling. The
Minister spoke this morning about possibly levying fees against parents
with care who want to use the statutory system when the non-resident
parent says that he wants a voluntary arrangement.</div>
					<a name="07071835000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the research suggests that
voluntary arrangements are much more popular with non-resident parents:
the arrangements are more flexible, they can pay lower amounts and
there is no mechanism to step in instantly and enforce the arrangements
if they do not pay. Is it surprising that parents with care are not
quite so happy about voluntary arrangements, because flexibility means
that they do not get the money regularly, and reliable maintenance is
quite important? Of course they want a decent amount to support their
children, and ideally they want a firm hand, so that the non-resident
parent knows that if he does not pay, someone will step in and make
sure that he does.</div>
					<a name="07071835000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would be very reluctant to deny a parent with care the right to use the

wrong? Fees sound good in theory, but in practice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>we could end up having a whole new enforcement machinery simply to

on your own two feet and you decide that you can manage without. You
might also do it for more worrying reasons, or there could be a

						</i> Research shows that the vast majority of
lone parents by far want to work, and maintenance does make a
difference to that. Research looking at a group of lone parents, a
cohort, between 1991 and 2001, shows that receipt of
maintenance&#151;disregarding other things, such as education, home
ownership or other factors&#151;is a positive indicator of going into
work. Getting maintenance actually assists people in getting into work.
That is not surprising when you think about it, because the big hurdle
for going to work for a lot of lone parents is insecurity. If
maintenance is already flowing, that helps them begin to make decisions
about putting together a package of part-time earnings, tax credits and
maintenance, which can carry them over the hurdle into work and all the
expenses of starting work. They are having to pay child care, of
course. You only get a certain amount of help with child care&#151;I
think that it is 80 per cent. now; there is another 20 per cent. to
pay. Child maintenance can really make work a viable
proposition.</div>

operational considerations&#151;what is workable from the point of
view of CMEC&#151;and what is affordable from the points of view of
the NRP and the parent with care. Looking at the Government&#146;s
response to the White Paper consultation, my reading is that
operational considerations have determined the 25 per cent. amount.
Issues about affordability have not really played a big part. It is
about how many cases, pragmatically, CMEC thinks that it can
reassess.</div>

needs to be kept under review because One Parent Families has no

public back it. We want non-resident parents to be able to afford their
maintenance. We do not want them to become martyrs; that is not in
anyone&#146;s interests. It has to be a system that the public back
as fair, so the 25 per cent. figure needs to be

People have said that they are only 7 per cent. of cases and we have to

the self-employed are the group that cause the most problems to the

the public profile of the agency because the employed non-resident

for the child. HMRC&#146;s interest is in getting tax in for the
Revenue. There is a different interest. We think there should be a
scrutiny and verification unit inside CMEC that has the job of going
after NRPs who appear to be hiding income and also dealing with the
variation procedure. A scrutiny and verification unit would look into
that.</div>
					<a name="07071835000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stephen
Geraghty was saying this morning that it was up to the parent with
care: &#147;If she can prove it to us, we do it.&#148; When you
think about it, that is ridiculous. It is one of the big avenues of
avoidance. CMEC has enormous powers to go to credit reference agencies.
Instantly&#151;at a glance&#151;you can see if someone who says
their income is &#163;50 a week has all sorts of credit and
commitments. There are ways that it could go into bank accounts and
look at the income. The NRP should be obliged to disclose his bank
statements and that kind of thing so that you can see where the money
is going, in and out. One of the ways in which child maintenance works
is that the NRP will try to minimise his liability. If you do not
tackle that, in a sense, you are cheating the children who need the
money.</div>
					<a name="07071835000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want a
scrutiny and verification unit and an obligation on the NRP to prove
his income, because if you go through the variation procedure, the onus

prove his income, which does not make sense.</div>

capital settlements of

information on the threat of going to prison. That is very useful
information, but at the moment there is no procedure for it to be

						</i> Ultimately, getting money from some people
is difficult. Yes, it will cause resentment, but it has to be done
fairly. One has to be able to justify it. Obviously it is important
that the amount claimed has been correctly calculated and can be
justified, but ultimately the bottom line is that the money for
children has got to be paid, so do it. I feel the hordes of lone
parents at my back as I say that, because there is enormous anger about
the fact that so much money is owed to them, and so little has been
done to collect it. Under the CSA, so few cases got to debt
enforcement. Only a tiny proportion of the amount of cases with arrears
ever reached the debt enforcement section.</div>

end, but in the middle there was a hole made up of people in debt and
nothing seemed to happen. That must be a central focus; it is one of

						</i> No. The CSA is promoting the orders as a
useful way of paying. They are useful because there is even a protected
earnings floor if your earnings drop down. The orders mean that you can
pay and forget about it as the money is paid automatically. For a lot
of people whose money goes up and down, or who might be in and out of
changing jobs&#151;when obviously it would have to be transferred
over&#151;that is a useful way of ensuring that they meet their
obligations. That is what the orders should be sold

Harper:
						</b> Let me just pick up on two things. One is a
question about the curfew orders, and whether you think that they will
be effective in practice. The second concerns, as we have just
discussed, the range of enforcement areas. You have said several times
how important it is that parents accept their obligations. If you look
at clause 4, about the promotion of child maintenance, which was a
point that Professor Wikeley made in his memorandum, do you think that
the language in the Bill about the importance of taking responsibility
for maintenance is strong enough? He raised the point that under
Australian legislation, the parental duty to maintain children was a
primary duty, had priority over all other commitments, and was much
stronger. Given what you have said about comfort with tough
enforcement, because of that importance, do you think that clause 4
reflects such importance in the message that it sends to parents about
their responsibility to maintain their
children?</div>

						</i> It is certainly an interesting view about
the right of children to maintenance as a primary obligation. I can see
that fitting well within a redefinition. It is essentially about
children and about putting children at the centre of the system. To
that extent, that would be good.</div>

								Janet
Allbeson:

						</i> To be honest, there is a lot in the Bill
about enforcement and that has been one thing that the Department has
majored on. Our view is that the issue in relation to enforcement is
not about the little bit at the end of legal enforcement, but about
what happens earlier along the line. It is about intervening straight
away when a payment is missed. It is about setting up arrears
arrangements. It is about monitoring and stepping in immediately when a
payment is missed. You should not be getting to curfew
orders&#151;except, obviously, for the small percentage who are
determined not to pay. You should be getting arrangements in far
earlier to collect the money. Ultimately, lone parents want the money.
A curfew will not necessarily help that unless the threat of it means
that someone pays up. A lot of things need to be done earlier down the
line. It is better to get your liability order and consider what you
are going to do. Ultimately, there could be a charge on the house; you
go after the money. That is what it is all about,
really.</div>

Boswell:
						</b> You made two points very clear. The first is the
need for credibility in the system and the second is the centrality of
getting support to children. I do not think that anyone here would
dissent from those. Would you agree that the latter duty should also
apply to the parent who has care of the children? Sometimes we get the
canard that the constituent or correspondent says how much they are
paying and, possibly because of the affluence or otherwise of the new
partner of the parent who maintains the child, all that is going on
holidays or other forms of self-indulgence. Would it not be entirely
reasonable, if we want to stiffen the duties, to make it clear that
that is a duty of both parents, irrespective of their status as
resident or otherwise?</div>

						</i> Child maintenance is about enabling the
child to share the income of the non-resident parent. That is what we
back. There are other models. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>In Australia, they have gone down the road of
saying, &#147;This is the cost of a child. Here&#146;s one parent;
here&#146;s the other. Let&#146;s divvy it up.&#148; As for
re-partnering arrangements for a parent with care, the obligation has
to be between the parents themselves. I do not think that we can start
to bring in partners as that becomes far more complicated. The
Australian system started simple and has ended up more complicated, and
has gone down the road of looking at the cost of a child. We are not in
that position by any means. We are still trying to grope towards a
simple, deliverable system. On pragmatic grounds, we favour sticking
with the income of the non-resident parent and recognising that the
child has a share in that. The parent with care by definition supports
the child financially, because they live with
them.</div>

would be done only with the consent of the parent with care, if the
debt were owed to her. Obviously, if the debt were owed to the
Secretary of State, that would be different. However, if the debt were
owed to the parent with care, that money would be owed to her for the
children, and she should have some say on whether a deal is done or
whatever. Most lone parents are fairly pragmatic on that; if there is
some chance of getting some money, they will do it. It is surprising
that that is not on the face of the Bill. We think that it should be,

						</i> So far, the Department has taken quite a
cautious view about what it is writing off. It is writing off debts
where the parent concerned has died and interim maintenance
assessments. It is saying that the new powers that it is giving itself
in the Bill will give it a chance to see whether it can claw back more
than it has already. That is great. We think that by the time CMEC
takes over&#151;well, by the end of the operational improvement
programme in 2009&#151;it should be looking to make some final
decisions. It should be in a realistic position to decide how much of
the debt is recoverable and how much is not. At that point, it may need
to face up to the fact that some of it is not. Then the issue is to
notify the parent with care about that and, if it is partly responsible
for the fact that the debt is not collectible, invite her to claim
compensation from it.</div>

least be some mechanism for alerting the parent with care that in quite

irrecoverable&#151;because, for example, it has delayed taking action

are obviously quite restricted, because the relevant functions are

could usefully call back the officials in a year&#146;s time and in
two years&#146; time&#151;particularly to grill them on, for
instance, the contract with EDS, the IT contractor, which I think
expires at the end of August 2010. It would be useful to know what is
going to happen to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>that system. Will it just be renewed? There might be some pragmatic
