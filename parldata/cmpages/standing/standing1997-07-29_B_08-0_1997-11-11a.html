<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence, members of the Committee and others present will wish to know that I intend to suspend the Committee for 10 minutes at five minutes to 11 to allow all those who want to do so to observe the two minutes' silence. I will if necessary interrupt whoever is speaking at the time.
<P>
It will be for the benefit of the Committee to note several small alterations to the order of amendments. I refer hon. Members to clause 21. Amendment No. 252 will be the lead amendment, and with it we will take Government amendment No. 67. On clause 25, to which there are two groups of amendments, I will call first amendments Nos. 233, 234 to 238, and 254, and then I will call the other group. Hon. Members might want to note those changes now to avoid confusion. There has been a problem with the computers, but the revised selection list will shortly be available.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations as to Procedure</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): I beg to move amendment No. 217, in page 55, line 43, at end insert `for want of prosecution'.
<P>
We can now have the debate on the striking out of appeals which I attempted to introduce when we were discussing schedule 1. Having been thwarted then, I have returned to the topic. Our intention in amending paragraph 3 of schedule 5 would be to restrict the provision on the striking out of appeals to what we understand to be broadly the present situation: when someone fails to prosecute an appeal--the person might give up or fail to show any interest--it is legitimately struck out. We are concerned that if the schedule is not amended it will allow far wider provision for the striking out of proceedings, and this is a probing amendment to give the Minister an opportunity to set out his thinking on the sorts of cases that might be struck out.
<P>
We are concerned about several issues. First, the Minister kindly said earlier that the striking out will be done by a member of the panel. Presumably, not every appeal will go before a panel member to decide whether it should be struck out. One presumes that there will be a prior sift by administrators, and cases that seem likely to be struck out because they are apparently meritless will then be handed to a panel member.
<P>
We should like reassurance on several points. Will the panel member be legally qualified? On what basis will cases be deemed meritless? We have already discussed the case of a funeral payment in which application was made for burial outside the United Kingdom. Under this legislation, that would almost certainly have been struck out as meritless, but under the existing provision it went forward to an appeal and was eventually overturned by the European Court of Justice. That would not have happened if the case had been considered on the basis of the papers alone.
<P>
By definition, striking out is done on the basis of the papers--and we have already discussed the fact that a hearing, especially an oral hearing, gives an appellant a much better chance of success. Will people be denied justice through the striking-out procedure? If the case is struck out, will there be any appeal rights, and can it be reinstated? How long will people have?
<P>
Paragraph 3 allows enormous leeway to strike out the basic rights to appeal. We would like much more reassurance about how that will be done and about what is intended, if we are to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Keith Bradley)</b>: Good Morning, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) said, the amendment would prevent the Government's proposed extension of a tribunal's power to strike out proceedings. As he rightly said, tribunals currently have powers to strike out proceedings for want of prosecution. Extending the power to strike out cases will, however, enable certain cases to be disposed of more quickly without a hearing, and will speed up the process for those appeals that remain. At the heart of the Bill is the desire for a more efficient and speedy way of dealing with appeals, which should not be frustrated by appeals that do not need to proceed.
<P>
Regulations under the powers before us will allow appeals to be struck out under certain circumstances, and I shall give some examples to provide a flavour of those. First, an appeal may be struck out where a person fails to co-operate when he has been clearly told what is required of him. For example, he may not have provided a properly made appeal or the necessary information or evidence that he was asked to supply.
<P>
An appeal may be struck out when it could have no material effect on the decision. For example, the appellant is paying mortgage interest at a rate higher than the standard rate set out in law, and is trying merely to get the increased amount, although it is not available under the legal position as laid down in social security legislation.
<P>
An appeal may also be struck out when it has no prospect of success--as, for example, in the case of an appeal against a refusal of benefit where the person is clearly older than the age limit for that benefit. There is a clear distinction in law regarding eligibility--on age grounds in this case--and there is no discretion. That is a fact and the appeal may therefore be regarded as totally unwarranted.
<P>
An appeal may also be struck out when it is clearly frivolous or vexatious, and a person is making it simply because he is unhappy and wants to go through the process for its own sake.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon mentioned our debate on schedule 1, and it is worth repeating my commitment that decisions to strike out appeals will be taken by panel members, not by clerks.
<P>
The measures in the Bill will help to prevent the waste of considerable valuable resources while ensuring that the right to a fair hearing remains. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for fleshing out what he means by paragraph 3. He has still not answered my point about cases that are apparently hopeless on the basis of the papers, but which have proven not to be so. The instance of funeral payments made outside the United Kingdom is a case in point. That is the sort of case that looks hopeless and, according to the third of the Minister's options, has ``no prospect of success''. Yet that case succeeded when it was allowed to go through the due appeals process.
<P>
Although we sympathise with the desire to exclude frivolous or vexatious appeals, we are concerned that valid appeals might also be excluded by the rather sweeping provision in paragraph 3. An appellant may not know the relevant information that he should put into an appeal, or the point of law on which he should argue. Items may be missing from the papers, and on that basis, the appeal may look hopeless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The appellant will be informed in writing why the appeal has been struck out. Clearly, he can go back to the agency, explain why that is not appropriate and argue for the case to be reinstated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for adding the point about reinstatement, which his earlier remarks did not touch upon. We still think that the power is too sweeping, but following that additional clarification I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a very new Labour amendment--I have been spending too much time listening to the Minister and his thinking has started to affect my own. He used the phrase ``rights and responsibilities'', which represents a value--a principle--that I am beginning to share. Paragraph 5 (a) and (b) provide that applicants have a responsibility--that they shall provide information as and when it is requested. New Labour thinking is that for every responsibility there is a matching right, and for every right there is a matching responsibility. If claimants have a responsibility to provide information on time, the Secretary of State should have a reciprocal responsibility to deal with claims in a predetermined time.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to provide that regulations should specify not merely the duties of the claimant, but the duties of the Secretary of State concerning the time within which appeals and other determinations should be made. That would be a natural balance; if duties are to be imposed on one side it is only fair to impose them on the other side.
<P>
When a similar point was made previously, the Minister said that the requirement to be prompt would gum up the works, reducing the flexibility of the system and making it harder to prioritise. The Bill is about speeding things up, but allowing the Secretary of State to hang around is not an effective way of achieving that. Our amendment simply requires that the Secretary of State have performance targets. That is the spirit of the amendment, and I am sure that the Minister will share in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman shares the laudable aim of new Labour to put in place a quick and efficient appeals system. However, the amendment would not achieve that purpose.
<P>
Proposed new sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) in the amendment would impose an administrative time limit upon a judicial procedure. That is contrary to the established practice of law. An injustice could be done if a decision had to be reached within a time limit. For example, vital evidence could be missing, or a complex legal point given insufficient consideration. The time required by tribunals and commissioners to make decisions will vary, and rightly so, depending on the circumstances of each case.
<P>
The amendment would also set time limits for the agencies to implement decisions. The agencies already implement tribunal decisions as quickly as possible; it is in their interest to do so. They will develop processes for handling all aspects of appeals, including the implementation of decisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): Honourable Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That is within the spirit of his move to new Labour, I must stress. By the end of our proceedings, who knows where he may be sitting.
<P>
The Secretary of State will set targets for the clearance of appeals for the appeals service. That relates to the administrative side of handling appeals. There will be no obligation on judicial staff to make decisions without establishing the facts of the case, obtaining the relevant evidence and giving due consideration to law and case law.
<P>
The amendment will not achieve the purpose that the hon. Gentleman has in mind. We must distinguish between administrative and judicial decisions and implementation. After that explanation, and after the assurance that we will set tough targets on the administrative outcome of decisions, I hope that he will recognise that it is not appropriate to pursue the amendment because of the imposition on the judicial aspect of tribunal work.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> It is disappointing and surprising to learn that I am closer than the Minister to the spirit of new Labour.
<P>
There is a certain asymmetry in the Minister's remarks. He spoke about a vital piece of evidence. Appellants will be given only a month to produce information. It is not clear why, on the one hand, those determining the outcome of appeals can take as long as they like--I am reassured to hear that there will be strict performance requirements--while on the other hand, appellants, who have the incentive to provide information, will be set very tight deadlines. Surely, provision of information is just as much a part of the judicial process as the requirement of the Secretary of State to be prompt.
<P>
I am pleased to hear that there will be demanding targets. I hope that, when we see them, they match up to that adjective. With the assurance that they will, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 5 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Medical Examination Required by Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 12, line 33, leave out from `as' to `necessary' in line 34 and insert `is'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 251, in page 12, line 34, leave out `him' and insert `the Secretary of State'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The amendment is probing. The phrasing of clause 20(1)(b), lines 34 and 35, appears to give the Minister discretion about whether a medical examination and report is to be applied. The amendments aim to tease an assurance out of the Minister that that discretion will not be used to prevent medical examinations in circumstances in which they are appropriate. The amendment would require a claimant to have a medical examination if it was necessary. The Opposition cannot understand why the Government chose wording that allows the Secretary of State to rely on appearances rather than on reality. Will the Minister clarify the Government's intentions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Clause 20 is essentially a re-enactment of section 54 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It provides for people to be referred for a medical examination if that is necessary to make a decision about a claim. That is not a new requirement.
<P>
Decision makers acting for the Secretary of State have comprehensive, published guidance, issued by medical and disability experts, to assist them in deciding whether a medical examination is necessary. Decision makers will, as now, examine carefully the supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant. They will refer people for a medical examination only if the information cannot be obtained in any other way.
<P>
Medical examinations are a well established means of obtaining information that is needed to ensure that the correct amount of benefit is paid. That must, however, work both ways. Benefit should not be paid to someone who unreasonably fails to attend for a medical examination when requested to do so, and whose entitlement to benefit is therefore in doubt.
<P>
That is why clause 20 allows an adverse decision to be made if a person fails, without good cause, to comply with a request. An adverse decision does not always mean that benefit will cease entirely. It may mean that a requested increase in benefit in respect of an alleged deterioration in health cannot be paid. There is a right of appeal against any benefit decision that results from the medical examination.
<P>
The provision is not new. It is essential to ensure that the right benefit is awarded, not just at the claim stage but at all times. The amendment is unnecessary and I hope that, in the light of my explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We are grateful for that clarification, in particular for the reference to the publication of detailed guidance. I have to say that I am still unclear as to why the phrase ``as appears'' is preferable to ``is'', but after the Minister's assurances, I take it that the difference is nugatory. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendent, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Medical Examination Required by Appeal Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendent No. 252, in page 13, line 15, leave out from `tribunal' to `the' in line 16.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may consider Government amendment No. 67.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The amendment relates to the words ``except in prescribed circumstances'' in subsection (3).
<P>
We have frequently drawn the Committee's attention to the extent of regulatory decision making prescribed by the Bill, but unless we have misunderstood it, this phrase goes half a pace further. It does not mention regulations--it simply allows the exception of prescribed circumstances in the most open and vague manner possible.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt tell us what circumstances might be prescribed and how they might be prescribed. Perhaps he will also give a substantive explanation to what kind of circumstances the Government have in mind. According to the notes on clauses, which are clear on this, the intent of subsection (3) is to prevent a physical examination being carried out there and then at appeal. That is obviously a practice to be avoided, owing to possible subjectivity.
<P>
We are at a loss to think of what concrete circumstances might arise that would have to be prescribed. Will the Minister tell us how the power will be used and under what circumstances he imagines it will be used?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The general exclusion is sensible, but there will be cases when it would be a good idea for a member of the tribunal to carry out an examination.
<P>
As I said on clauses 6 and 8, over the years I have represented claimants at medical appeal tribunals on industrial disablement benefit appeals, and I should like to suggest one or two instances from my own experience where the provision might be appropriate.
<P>
Under the old system, it was the practice to examine claimants there and then at the appeal hearing, which seemed to work extremely effectively in cutting down on the delay and expense in obtaining separate medical reports. Does the Minister intend that procedure to continue? I realise that the Government intend to obtain medical evidence in advance in such tribunals, but inevitably there will be appeal hearings at which unanswered medical questions will arise. In such cases, if the appeal tribunal has on it an appropriately qualified and experienced doctor--which, from what the Minister said on clauses 6 and 8, is to be expected--it seems to be common sense for that doctor to perform an examination there and then. That would be to the advantage of the claimant, in allowing the appeal to be disposed of more quickly, and of the Department, in that it would not have the hassle of arranging further medical examinations and re-organising further hearings for an adjourned appeal. Are those the type of circumstances that the Minister has in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment would remove the appeal tribunal's power to carry out a medical examination at a hearing.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee will be reassured to hear that we do not want tribunals to examine appellants routinely. I therefore have some sympathy with the amendment. In certain exceptional cases, however, it is in everyone's interest--as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) said--for an appeal tribunal to be able to conduct examinations at hearings for cases of industrial injuries and severe disablement allowance appeals. Where a medical question is at issue and where it considers it necessary to reach a decision, it is intended that a tribunal should still be able to examine the appellant at the hearing. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the administration would ensure that such expertise was available when forming the tribunal.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<H5>10.55 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>11.5 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> as I was saying, the purpose of the amendment is to limit the power to have a medical examination at the time of the hearing. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon gave examples and spoke of the expertise that would be available. He was absolutely right: that is exactly how the Government intend to use that power.
<P>
The purpose of the Government amendment No. 67 is to clarify that the regulation-making power in the subsection covers both the types of exception and the cases in which a tribunal should be able to carry out such examinations at a hearing. The amendment is wholly sensible and will ensure the efficient and effective use of everyone's time, so that appeals will not have to be adjourned, or possibly adjourned again, when they could have been heard quickly, efficiently and more successfully if the available medical expertise had been used at the time, as my hon. Friend has described.
<P>
I hope that with that explanation the hon. Member for West Dorset will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and to the charming double act that we have witnessed, for that clarification. The Minister--or rather his hon. Friend the Member for Hendon--mentioned two types of case, those relating to disability and to injury, in which the regulation-making power might be used and in which the appeal tribunal might seek to have an examination on the spot. The Minister gave us no assurance that it was not intended to go beyond those particular types of case. His speech was necessarily interrupted by the bell, but I do not recall that he explained to the Committee what the maximum scope of the power would be. If it is used in the manner permitted by the Bill, and as widely as that permits, it could drive a coach and horses through the whole proposition of clause 21 and invalidate that clause. What is the maximum use of the power envisaged by the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am happy to try to reassure the hon. Member further. The intention is that the scope of the power would be exactly the same as it is now; it would be used for the two specific types of case that I identified--industrial injuries and severe disablement. The Bill does not specify limits for the power, however, because if there were changes in benefits or new benefits for people in those categories, such arrangements could not be made. Under the current benefit regime the power applies principally to those two types of claim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> That is a helpful clarification for which the Committee will be grateful. In the light of the Minister's reassurance that the regulations will apply in the circumstances that he has described and not in others--subject to changes in the character of benefits--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Parts of clause 22 worry us a good deal. The clause provides for regulations to suspend benefits in certain listed circumstances, or in prescribed circumstances. Amendment No. 226 is in the spirit of many of the observations made by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). The clause gives the Secretary of State sweeping powers simply to prescribe circumstances in which benefit may be suspended.
<P>
That is far too sweeping a power. The amendment would remove the general ability to prescribe circumstances and instead make clear in the Bill the circumstances in which benefit might be suspended.
<P>
Clause 22 allows for four circumstances in which benefit may be suspended, and we do not object to the first three. However, clause 22(2)(d) states that benefit might be suspended
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pending...the decision given in a different case by appeal tribunal''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I acknowledge that Government amendment No. 158 would remove the phrase ``an appeal tribunal''--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a Commissioner or a court''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that might have an effect on the case at issue.
<P>
Clause 22(2)(d) reinstates regulation 37(A) of the Social Security Claims and Payments Regulations 1987, which was declared ultra vires by the High Court in 1996. Still, that regulation operated for several years: to coin a phrase, in it we saw the future, and it did not work.
<P>
The power was used to suspend benefit for several thousand blind, partially sighted and deaf people, pending a decision in the Halliday case, about which the Minister no doubt knows more than I. In that case, a decision in favour of the claimants was made by the commissioners in October 1994, by the Court of Appeal in June 1995 and by the House of Lords in May this year. Had the regulation been left in place, it is possible that the people who ultimately were proved to be entitled to disability benefits and all their knock-on entitlements could have had their benfits suspended for nearly three years. That cannot be just, and we are disappointed that the Bill would reintroduce the provision.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 274 to 276 apply to clause 35 and would have the same effect with regard to housing benefit and council tax benefit as amendment No. 226 has in connection with disability benefit. Many of the same arguments apply, but there is an especially acute reason for not suspending housing benefit pending a higher appeal. The judicial review process can sometimes take a year, and the suspension of housing benefit for that length of time could cause serious rent arrears or the loss of housing.
<P>
The effects of a provision such as clause 22--and especially clause 22(2)(d)--are well known. Considerable hardship was caused to partially sighted and deaf people. The High Court decided that the original regulation should not give the Secretary of State such powers and threw it out, and we are sorry that the Government want to introduce a similar provision in clause 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I want to speak to amendments Nos. 227 and 229, which deal with much the same matters as have already been raised. This territory is of primary concern to the Law Society, and the effect of the amendments would be to delete the troublesome clause 22(2)(d). Where the Bill would reverse the Sutherland decision, our intention is to confirm it.
<P>
It is wrong in principle for a claimant, who claims ony if he or she is in immediate need, to have to wait a long time for precedent to be established by a pending case that is relevant. Cases should be decided on existing precedent, not on precedent yet to be made. I had experience of the latter practice in the Inland Revenue, where it has been known to take five years for a new precedent to emerge if a case is extremely complicated. That is bad enough when one is dealing with tax matters, worse still in cases of need.
<P>
The clause is wrong and should be struck out. The amendment, which would give power to the Secretary of State to decide when hardship might arise, is too loose in that, yet again, it would give excessive power to the Secretary of State and, in practice, to the bureaucracy, which might not work. The matter should be dealt with in the manner set out in amendments Nos. 227 to 229.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Clause 22 enables regulations to provide for the suspension of payments of benefit and for those payments subsequently to be made.
<P>
Clause 35 makes the same provisions in respect of housing and council tax benefit. The effects of amendments Nos. 274 to 276 to that clause would mirror those of amendments to clause 22 and I will therefore address my remarks primarily to clause 22.
<P>
Clause 22 will come into effect at the same time as the other decision-making and appeals changes. However, we intend to introduce the power to suspend payments in lookalike cases following Royal Assent. New clause 6, which I have mentioned before, contains the relevant provision and we will be able to discuss that at a later stage.
<P>
The purpose of amendments Nos. 226 and 227, as hon. Members have explained, is to ensure that suspensions can be imposed only in those circumstances prescribed in clause 22(2), and that further circumstances cannot be added by regulations. I can say at this stage that it is unlikely that there will be any circumstances other than those listed in subsection (2) where we may want to suspend payment of benefit. However, we consider that there is some merit in retaining a degree of flexibility in being able to make regulations in other cases if the need arises.
<P>
It is conceivable that we shall need to act quickly to safeguard public expenditure in the future as unforeseen situations develop. In the early 1990s an urgent need emerged to be able to suspend payments in lookalike cases. There was no flexibility in the primary legislation at that time. Ideally, the primary legislation should have been amended, but that would have taken time, during which millions of pounds could have gone from the departmental budget. A regulation was introduced to deal with the situation but the High Court later held that the existing primary power would not support such a provision. We are therefore taking new primary powers that will allow us appropriate flexibility for the future.
<P>
As the Committee will appreciate, the advantage of secondary legislation in such cases is the speed with which it can be introduced, subject of course to parliamentary scrutiny as appropriate. 
<P>
There are futher important reasons why the Committee should reject amendments Nos. 274 and 275, which apply to regulation-making powers in clause 35. In future we will want to make regulations to parallel those currently made under existing powers to withhold benefit; they are contained in sections 5(1) (o) and 6 (1) (o) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Those powers are being repealed as a consequence of the new decision-making and appeals provisions in the Bill, and their role will be combined within the power to suspend, which is in clause 35.
<P>
We need the general power in clause 35(1)(a) to make those parallel regulations because the circumstances specified in clause 35(2) are concerned with questions of entitlement, reviews, appeals and lookalike cases, and do not provide the power to suspend on issues relating to payment of benefit. For example, authorities would not be able to suspend benefit when satisfied that the claimant was not paying his rent. It is clearly important for authorities to have such powers to ensure that benefit is used for the purpose for which it is intended.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 228 and 229 would remove the regulation power in clause 22(2), which provides for the suspension of benefit in lookalike cases. That power is a key tool for protecting the integrity of public expenditure. Sometimes, an entitlement issue arises in a leading test case which, when resolved by the courts, will clarify the law for many hundreds, or thousands, of other benefit decisions which turn on the same legal issue. That provision will enable the Secretary of State to suspend payment of benefit in other cases, where the identical issue arises, until the final decision in the test case is known.
<P>
The effect of the amendments to clause 22, however, would mean that benefit would continue to be paid in all lookalike cases even though the identical legal issue arising in the lead case had not been resolved, and benefit had quite properly been suspended in the lead case. That cannot be right. It is our duty to ensure that benefit goes to those who are entitled to it and not to those who are not so entitled.
<P>
When entitlement to benefit is in doubt and is being resolved, the power to suspend payment in lookalike cases means the Department can avoid making substantial overpayments of public money which could not then be recovered. The Government believe that it would be irresponsible and imprudent to pay out in cases where it is later decided that there was no underlying entitlement.
<P>
Amendment No. 276 would remove the regulation power in clause 35(2) which provides for the suspension of housing and council tax benefits in lookalike cases. That mirrors amendments Nos. 228 and 229 to clause 22, which I have just discussed, and the same arguments apply.
<P>
As a rule of thumb we can anticipate about one major case a year. A recent example is that of Graham, which involved certain women who claimed invalidity benefit. It resulted in just under 50,000 instances of suspension in lookalike cases pending a reference to the European Court of Justice in the lead case.
<P>
The answer to the question about the time a suspension can last depends on the individual case. At one end it can be a matter of days--indeed, that is where the bulk of suspensions will fall--but at the other it will equate to the time it takes for a case to work through the various appeals procedures, as the hon. Member for Northavon said. As an extreme example, in the case of Bate, there was an appeal against the adjudication officer's decision that she was not entitled to a severe disability premium in September 1990. In May 1996, the House of Lords confirmed that she was not entitled to the premium. Clearly that was exceptional, but I should stress that in every case payment of benefit was only partially suspended throughout that period. Basic income support and other relevant premiums were not affected and therefore continued in payment. Where the lead case is about only part of the benefit--that is often so--it does not mean that all benefit is suspended throughout the period.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon mentioned the build-up of arrears leading to eviction in housing cases. Clear guidance will be given to local authorities on those matters. Local authorities will consider particular issues of hardship which may fall into the category that the hon. Gentleman identified. They will consider the circumstances of individual cases--whether other income or capital can be used--and the state of individuals: how frail they are, their overall circumstances and whether children are in the family. All those matters will be taken into account before a suspension is made.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the hardship provision that he has just described in the context of housing benefit and council tax benefit will apply also to the benefits covered by clause 22?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Yes, that is clearly the case. To put the matter the other way round, the hardship provision mirrors what currently happens in income support and similar cases. The Bill extends the provision to housing benefit and council tax benefit--it flows in that direction.
<P>
I hope that the members of the Committee will accept my assurances with regard to hardship. I hope also that they will bear in mind the wider issue of preventing overpayments that are not recoverable. We need to protect public expenditure against what could be a great sum being wrongly paid out when there is a clear lead case and clear lookalikes. As we have mentioned in previous debates, people will obviously have the opportunity to make representations and to say that theirs should not be considered a lookalike case; and that will be taken into account.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon asked whether people should be provided with benefit to which they are entitled by law. His point was that the fact that a higher court may overturn a decision does not mean that a person is not entitled to benefit in the meantime. The fact that a decision is appealed to the courts means that a question of law has been identified which needs to be resolved. A decision on entitlement may have been made, but not finally settled. Until the case has been resolved, it is right that payment should be suspended to protect public funds. It would be irresponsible to pay out money when it may prove irrecoverable because of an overpayment.
<P>
I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point. In the light of that explanation and the assurances that I have given, I hope that hon. Members from both Opposition parties will be able to withdraw their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for filling out the point--this is in part a probing amendment. The arguments for saving money are obviously attractive and I appreciate the legal point that the cases that we are discussing will arise only if there is a question of law. It is, however, not as easy as that. Even the implementation of the clause as it stands will present practical problems, as has been the case in the past. Although the issue of law may be challenged, precedent and practice to date will exist in most cases. Situations will arise in which claims are pressing and people are in need. It is not satisfactory to leave people in need waiting for a new precedent to be set. I do not know how we shall handle such problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I would argue that cases are going through as new test cases because there is no precendent. We cannot rely on previous decisions because we are dealing with new disputes about facts, which need to be tested in the way that the procedure now allows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I understand that, but that will not always be the case. Cases will often arise because of a possible new interpretation of the law. I am not familiar with all the case studies from the past, but it is not my understanding that we lack precedent or case law to the extent that it would not be possible to decide such cases. There is perhaps at least a theoretical separation between the two, but I repeat my major concern, which is that at the bottom of this heap are people in need, who are applying only because there is the self-evident expectation that they have a case. I fear that if there are big legal issues, the establishment of future precedent will take time.
<P>
Thus there is still a practical problem which may render the system unworkable in practice. Although we understand the Government's arguments, Opposition Members feel that the amendment should not be withdrawn because there is a major point of principle vis-a-vis individuals.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The experience of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) is telling in the context of the Inland Revenue, but the same principles apply in this case.
<P>
Pending a decision in a lead case, either one risks spending public money on someone who will prove not to have been entitled when the lead case is decided--clearly, that will result in money being spent that perhaps should not have been--or one suspends payment, as the Government want to do, even though the person may well prove, after a possible 18-month or two-year wait, to have been entitled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We are not arguing that payments should be suspended because people may be entitled; they will be suspended because people may not be entitled. Do the Liberal Democrats argue that in all cases, no matter how many thousands of people it may affect, if a point of law is being challenged, regardless of the point of law and the outcome, benefit that is not recoverable should be paid out in all cases, even if at the end of the day, it is proved that none of that money has been paid on the correct legal basis?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> It seems to us that the basis on which a person's current receipt of benefit should be determined should be the state of law at that point. The Minister is saying that at that point there is some question as to the law, but until the law is positively proven to be other than it is assumed to be, the presumption should be in favour of payment of benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I just want to put my case in context. If the Department had not won the Bate case, which I mentioned earlier, it would have cost it &#163;90 million. Do the Liberal Democrats think that that sort of money should be paid out in all cases, regardless of the outcome of the lead case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Liberal Democrat position, in line with that of the Government, is that the appeals system in that case was a complete shambles. We therefore support a good deal of the Bill, which would make that process quicker. I recall from the Minister's remarks, that the reason why the case cost &#163;90 million was that it took six years to sort out.
<P>
I was about to observe that if the system had an incentive to get things through quickly, as the amendments would ensure, the incentives would all work in the right direction. No one wants to see public money spent on someone who will ultimately prove not to be entitled, but if the system allows those who are genuinely in need and eventually prove to have been entitled to receive their money now, it has every incentive to throw all its weight behind getting a decision made quickly. That is the right incentive structure, which protects the vulnerable. With the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, we therefore want to press the amendment to a vote.

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 230, in page 13, line 28, at end insert--
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but any such regulations shall provide that payment of a relevant benefit may not be suspended until the person concerned has been given sufficient opportunity to make representations in writing as to why payment should not be suspended'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> We had not expected the other amendment to be defeated, but as it did not quite squeak through, we feel that a fallback is necessary, and that is provided by amendments Nos. 230 and 231. [Interruption.] I thought that the pensions Minister was about to intervene.
<P>
I would be delighted if, given the Mininster's previous remarks, the amendments before us should prove wholly unnecessary. They make two requirements before a suspension can be made. The first is that consideration should be given to the hardship that might result. The second, which raises a slightly different point, is that before a suspension takes place, a claimant should have an opportunity to appeal in writing and explain why suspension should not take place--for example, when a person maintains that his or her case does not look like the lead case.
<P>
The Child Poverty Action Group reports that when the initial suspension had been made in the Halliday case, advisers found it difficult to persuade the Department, or the Benefits Agency, that other cases did not look like it. There was a general presumption that cases looked alike, and few appeals against that were accepted. That shows us what happens in practice. In the Halliday case hardship was suffered, and the evidence is that only a small number of suspensions were overturned on hardship grounds. Many blind, partially sighted and deaf people were deprived of benefit to which they were entitled, over a number of years. That cannot be right, and the amendments' provisions need to be written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has rightly said, referring to my earlier comments, that the Government believe that the amendments are unnecessary.
<P>
The decision to suspend payment of benefit under clause 22, in the current scheme, will be discretionary--with the single exception of jobseeker's allowance cases in which there is doubt about availability for work, or about whether a claimant is actively seeking work.
<P>
When deciding whether to suspend an individual's benefit, an officer, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, will consider whether, in his opinion, the decision will cause hardship. If the officer considers that that will be the case, he can decide not to implement the benefit suspension. Indeed, the letters currently issued advising individuals that payment of their benefit has been suspended, invite them to contact the Benefits Agency if the decision will cause them hardship.
<P>
Benefits Agency staff are able to exercise discretion in assessing a person's situation and in deciding whether to make a payment. Staff have guidance to help them make such decisions.
<P>
There is a second point relating to lookalike cases. I referred to the matter in an earlier debate and in my letter to the Law Society. I wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Under clause 22(2)(d) of the Bill the Secretary of State may suspend benefit only in cases which would be directly affected by a lead case; the clause provides that she must believe that if the appeal in the lead case were decided in a particular way, she would have to revise or suspend her decision in the case at issue. A `lookalike' case covered by this provision, therefore, must involve an earlier decision based on the point of law at issue in the lead case.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	I can assure you''--
<P>
that is, the Law Society--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the intention behind clause 22(2)(d) of the Bill is that it will only apply to genuine look-alike cases.''

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the person who decides whether a case is lookalike must be legally qulified?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The Department will decide about lookalike cases. If there is any doubt about a point of law, the guidance will tell officers that they should seek a legal opinion. That will ensure a robust safeguard that the lookalike case is based on the point of law determined by the lead case.
<P>
I hope that that assurance, and my assurance about hardship, will convince the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I think that ``robust'' is the last adjective that I would use to describe the proposed system of safeguards. The Minister appears to be saying that a person who does not have legal expertise will decide whether a case is a lookalike, and that legal advice will be taken only if that person is in any doubt. Is that what the Minister means?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> What I am saying is that a person may dispute with the agency whether his or her case is a lookalike. In such circumstances, an officer will seek legal opinion to ensure that the same legal question is involved as in the lead case. As I have told the Law Society, that mechanism will assure people that only genuine lookalike cases are treated as such.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I get more worried the more the Minister says. I am sure that the Minister sees constituents when he is not in the House. One can imagine a person going to his surgery with a letter from the Benefits Agency saying that an application for benefit will be suspended pending a decision in a different case in another court that raises the same point of law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The problem is even worse than the hon. Member for Northavon fears. Could not the constituent whom he describes have benefit suspended if the Secretary of State merely considered it possible that a point of law was involved? There is no requirement for the point of law to be real.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am not sure about that, but a worse eventuality than the one that I described would arise if a constituent did not take the problem to the constituency surgery. Because social security law is a mystery to most people, many, on receipt of a letter in a brown envelope saying that their benefit has been suspended on a point of law, will not decide to appeal the decision on the grounds that it is incorrect in law.
<P>
I am appalled by the process that the Minister has described. It is not robust at all. Decisions about points of law are to be made by people who are not legal specialists. The only safeguard that the Minister can offer is the fact that people can appeal, but all hon. Members know that some people who should appeal do not do so.
<P>
I shall not waste the Committee's time by pressing the amendment to a Division, but the Minister's response is one of the lamest that I have heard. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 13, line 39, leave out `an appeal tribunal,'.
<P>
As the Committee is aware, clause 22 enables regulations to be made that provide both for the suspension of benefit and for payments subsequently to be made.
<P>
The principle is that, where a challenge is made to a decision that sets a precedent, that decision should not be put into effect in lookalike cases until the position has been resolved. A decision of an appeal tribunal does not set a precedent, so there is no need for the clause to refer to an appeal tribunal.
<P>
I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Minister may be reassured to know that the Child Poverty Action Group described the amendment as ``welcome''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am grateful for the support of the CPAG for the amendment. Indeed, that group has given the Bill general support in its aim of simplifying and expediting the procedures for appeals and decision making.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 14, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where a period of not less than three months has elapsed since the information requirement was made'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to probe the Minister, and to tease out of him his expectations about the regulations proposed by clause 23. The most important question is how long the Minster expects to allow people before the relevant information is provided. The amendment proposes three months. I would be content if the Minster set an even longer time scale. It would be a pity not to have a statement from the Minster about what he expects of the regulations. As has been said, there are varied circumstances in which information may be difficult to obtain or cannot be obtained quickly.
<P>
As well as the length of time, will the Minister explain the prescribed circumstances in which entitlement will cease entirely, and the warning that people will be given before their benefits are cut off? I imagine that the Minister intends to put those things into the regulations. Will he explain them further?
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment would mean that entitlement to benefit could not be terminated within three months of a request for information.
<P>
I shall explain how we intend to use the regulation-making power in clause 23. As I have said on several occasions, we will always try to give the regulations' flavour, even if we do not have them before us. The regulations will provide that benefit payments may be fully or partially suspended if a person fails to provide requested information within one calendar month. That will be the general time limit, but there will be flexibility to allow for individual customers' circumstances.
<P>
Following suspenson, if a customer provides the information requested, and it confirms that he is still entitled to benefit, the amount that has been suspended will be paid. If, on the other hand, a customer fails, without explanation, to provide the requested information, we intend that he will have a further month to respond, following the date on which benefit is suspended, before entitlement to benefit ceases. Once again, there will be flexibility to vary that period, depending on individual circumstances. For example, such flexibility would be possible when a customer informs the Department that he is experiencing delays in obtaining information from a third party.
<P>
Our proposals will mean that customers will normally have a total of two months from the date on which information is first requested before benefit can cease entirely. In some cases it will be longer. If the amendment were agreed to, customers would have a minimum of three months before a decision could be made to terminate benefit. That time limit would be set out in the Bill, which would mean that there would be no scope to vary it in future.
<P>
I believe that what amounts to a two month time limit before entitlement to benefit can cease provides claimants with ample opportunity to respond to agency inquiries and will encourage customers to respond promptly. I accept that some customers will have good reasons for failing to provide the information within a month and in those cases the time limit will be extended. Having explained what we intend to include in regulations--obviously, more precise details will follow--and having given those assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for those assurances, which to some extent overcome our concerns, particularly the assurance that there will be some flexibility. That is absolutely critical because clearly there will be some cases in which, through no fault of the claimant, it is not impossible to obtain the information within the time scales to which we referred--one month before suspension and two months before the final cut-off. I may have missed something in what the Minister said, but I do not think that I did. Will he tell us a little more about the warning that will be given to people? I understand that there will be requests for the information, but will the claimants positively be told in writing that those time scales apply? That should be explicit in the letters that are sent to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is the intention that in cases where there is doubt about the claim, those time scales will be explained to customers in discussions with them from the first request for information. We do not want to put that in writing immediately if it can be made clear through personal contact. Clearly, if that request is not complied with, we will write to the customer making clear the position concerning suspension and the ceasing of ultimate entitlement to the benefit unless he complies. Again, the caveat is that flexibility regarding individual circumstances will be built in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I hope that I can assume from what the Minister has said that the letter will also make clear that if there are particular circumstances, they should be explained so that people know that the one-month limit is amendable, given the flexibility in the hands of the Secretary of State. With those assurances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> It would be inelegant of me to describe the clause as the first of the hypocrisy clauses, and I prefer to call it the first of the self-denial clauses. Over the past few months we have seen how the rhetoric of the Government when in opposition does not live up to the reality when they are in government. That was evident in the wind-chill factor episode--the rhetoric of last December raised people's expectations that action would be taken, but when the review was completed this month it confirmed that the previous Government's policy was correct, and this Government decided to do nothing. The Government, when in opposition, also raised expectations about the lone-parent premium and then abandoned their position in government and adopted that of the previous Government. The same occurs with clause 23. The purpose of clause 23 is clearly set out in subsection (1), which gives powers that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are exercisable in relation to persons who fail to comply with information requirements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the previous Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) produced measures designed to shift the responsibility to prove a benefit claim onto the individual and to suspend a benefit. Those were utterly condemned by the Labour party when it was in opposition. Yet now it is in government it has put those measures, lock, stock and barrel, into the Bill. The Conservative party's position is consistent in government and in opposition--we support the clause. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden proposed the measures, the new Government have adopted them and we support them because we supported them when we were in government. It would have been hypocritical to table amendments and to fight the clause hook, line and sinker.
<P>
What interests me most--I should like a specific answer from the Minister--is that in opposition his party vigorously opposed the proposal, arguing that requiring more evidence to substantiate a benefit claim was a hindrance, not a help, to receiving the appropriate benefit entitlement. With regard to the powers in the clause, only a few months ago, the current Secretary of State for Social Security said on the Floor of the House:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``putting more responsibility on claimants for the correct completion of the form, and . . . requiring more evidence to support the claims . . . will deter thousands more pensioners from claiming the money to which they are entitled.''--[Official Report, 19 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 947.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that when right hon. Lady was an Opposition spokesperson, she opposed the measure--the quote is clear and straightforward. Now, she seems to be wholeheartedly signed up to the proposal because this Bill of her's contains clause 23. Will the Minister say when, why and in which circumstances she changed her views?

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> It is totally inappropriate for me to answer on behalf of my right hon. Friend. She is capable of answering for herself. But I will say--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No. Our proposals must be judged in the wider context of the Bill, which will deliver more streamlined, robust proposals than in the original Bill to ensure that rights and responibilities are effective, on behalf of the Department and of the customer. The hon. Gentleman's statements cannot be taken out of context from our proposals for a wide-ranging, active, modern service and our intended streamlining of the social security system. That is why the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister has tried to explain, but he was caught on the hop and his civil servants could not get a note to him in time. It is incredible that he is not prepared or able to explain the Secretary of State's change of heart on the road to Damascus. The Bill is Government policy, but, in opposition, the right hon. Lady criticised the clause when we sought to bring it into law. The Minister now accepts the proposals, but seems totally at sea as to why the right hon. Lady has completley changed her view.
<P>
The Minister talks mumbo-jumbo about the measure being put in the context of the Bill. Once again, I remind him that, with the exception of clause 70, this is our Bill. The context has not changed. I am sorry that I caught the Minister on the hop and that he was incapable of answering the question. I warn him now, so that he can do his homework, that we are coming to a clause about which the Minister, when in opposition, was on record, as having a different view. Perhaps he will be able to give us an answer then.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I apologise to the Minister, because he has not had much time to work out what explanation he will give of the quote I intend to cite which shows that he has completely flip-flopped on clause 24. As he is aware, the clause gives powers for the suspension and termination of benefit for failure to submit medical evidence. As he is also aware, in opposition, his party attacked the introduction of tests governing incapacity benefit--again, a proposal of my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden. The Minister will also be aware that that new benefit was designed to ensure that only genuine applicants received it. But on the introduction of the measures to the House on 24 January 1997--not long ago--the Minister attacked the Bill, and the medical test, by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government's sole motive is to save money


. . . I assure the Secretary of State''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that, whatever he believes, the Labour party will oppose the Bill line by line vigorously in Parliament and throughout the country.''--[Official Report, 24 January 1994; Vol. 236, c. 112-113.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of that unequivocal opposition, why does the Bill include clause 24, which will have the same effect on incapacity benefit as what we proposed--and what he so vigorously opposed?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I am rather bemused, because the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Bill became an Act before 1997 so I could not have said then that we would oppose it line by line--it was already law. At the time, I was Opposition spokesperson on transport so it is unlikely that I would be responsible for attacking the measure line by line in 1997. But I will--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> May I just help the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr Bradley:</B> No, I do not need any help. I am responding--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I help the Minister? I should have said 1994, not 1997. I apologise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> that is not a point of order, it is a point of information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The position on the clause is part of our agenda to ensure that people with disabilities--those people who need benefits--are efficiently and effectively dealt with. That is the context for our proposal on incapacity benefit, not the draconian way in which the 1994 Bill was presented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> That is a rather weak explanation of the Minister's change of heart between opposition and government. My recollection of the 1994 Bill is that we introduced medical tests for incapacity benefit. There is little, if any, difference between that principle and the one in the clause.
<P>
I understand the Minister's difficulties. His Department is making many U-turns and adopting policies that we proposed when in government--that is not unique to the Department of Social Security, but it seems to happen more there at the moment than, say, at the Department of Health where there has been a U-turn on tobacco advertising; I should also mention the wind-chill factor for the benefit of the Government Whip who was out of the Room earlier--and which Labour Members vigorously opposed, simply because they were in the run-up to a general election and wanted to raise the expectations of the electorate.
<P>
We look forward to tomorrow afternoon when another flip-flop will come before a Committee of the House. We shall remind the electorate time and again that new Labour says one thing in opposition and changes its view in government.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
No. 254, in page 15, leave out lines 10 and 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> To some extent, the amendment relates to some of the issues that we have already discussed, so I will mention them only briefly.
<P>
Clause 25 deals with the power to stay a decision pending another decision in a lead or test case. Our amendments would restrict that power. Amendment No. 233 would limit the power to stay a case to the specific examples that are listed in the Bill, rather than leaving it to general regulation. The Bill allows the Secretary of State far too wide a discretion. It states that if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State considers it possible''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
merely possible, not likely or very clear--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the result of the appeal''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would produce no entitlement to benefit, he or she can stay a decision. That is a sweeping power. Amendment No. 234 would remove the words ``it possible'' so the provision would require the Secretary of State to consider that there would be an effect.
<P>
The Bill should also require a determination to be in the Secretary of State's favour, but it instead states that the Secretary of State may stay a decision even if she thinks that that decision will have some effect on the outcome of the appeal in question--not to reduce it to zero by simply to have some effect--even, in principle, if it were to have a beneficial effect.
<P>
The Minister has given us some reassurance, but will he confirm that if a person is clearly entitled to income support but there is some question as to whether a disability premium would be applicable and the disability issue is subject to a lead case, the income support would be paid anyway? Such cases lie behind our amendments. We are concerned that subsection (3) is so widely drawn that any effect on the decision could enable the Secretary of State to take a staying decision. Can the Minister reassure us that it would not be applied in that way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should like to support amendment No. 254, which bears close similarity to amendment No. 238, though it is more restricted in scope. Now I look again at subsection (3), to which both amendments refer, I am minded to say that we should have adopted the wider view taken by amendment No. 238.
<P>
Our particular anxiety arose as a result of section (b) of subsection (3). Of all the phrases in the Bill that we have investigated to date--many of which, as we have said repeatedly, contain vaguely described but wide powers--subsection (3) is the victor ludorum.
<P>
In case Labour Members have begun quietly to attend to their correspondence and are unaware of the scope of this provision, I remind them that it begins by stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the Secretary of State considers it possible''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When I asked earlier whether the Secretary of State merely had to think something possible, the Minister replied from a sedentary position that that was not the case. Will he now clarify the difference between the phrases ``considers it possible'' and ``it appearing to him that''. I take it that if it was not the case before and it is the case now--that the Secretary of State merely has to consider it possible--some great matter of moment has led the draftsman to insert the words ``considers it possible''. That must refer to some remote possibility being used as the basis for a decision on a case. Opposition Members find it extraordinary that the Secretary of State should be able to make a decision of any kind because it has occurred to him in the car on the way to the Department, for example, or as a matter of abstract possibility--a metaphysical proposition--that a result could be affected in some way.
<P>
Section (b) of subsection (3)--I apologise if my nomenclature is not quite right, because I do not know what to call it. It is a subsubsection?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a paragraph.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for that helpful clarification. Paragraph (b) constitutes the victor ludorum. It says that, if the Secretary of State considered it possible that the decision would be affected in some way had the appeal already been determined--he cannot, of course, determine that eventuality--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``he may, in such cases or circumstances as may be prescribed''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in other words, by regulation--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``make the decision on such a basis as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State therefore has the power to make a decision in the light of the possibility that a case will arise that will result in an as yet unknown outcome. Under those circumstances, he will be able to prescribe for himself regulations that will determine those cases to which he may apply that possible outcome and on what basis he may make a decision about it. Such provisions are as remote from a Bill that is intended to clarify and substantiate a duty or power as any provisions in English law. It is extraordinary that paragraph (b) is included. Subsection (3) and, indeed, subsection (4)--the Liberal Democrat's amendment No. 238 applies to both--constitute a very wide power. It should at least be possible for the Minister to admit that paragraph (b) goes too far. 
<P>
Indeed, it goes so far that it makes the already tendentious aspect of the Bill positively ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I am assured that the subsection is required. I sometimes have difficulty with such matters myself. I well remember a phrase from the Jobseekers Bill to the effect that income should be capital and capital should be income. One thinks, ``Yes, but what does that mean exactly?'' I have, therefore, some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman for not immediately grasping why the provisions before us are necessary. I am assured that they are, but to give him some comfort, I shall write to him to explain why that is the case. That should give him some hope that he will receive further explanation on the matter.
<P>
	The group of amendments seeks to alter in various ways the provisions contained in clause 25, (2), (3) and (4).
<P>
Clause 25 introduces a new provision to deal with cases that turn on an issue of law that is being challenged in the courts in another case. It allows the Secretary of State to delay making a decision--in other words to stay a case--where she considers that the outcome of the lead case could mean that there would be no entitlement to benefit, or to a part of a claimant's total benefit. As the hon. Member for Northavon said, we have discussed the merits of that approach, and we do not need to go over those arguments again. Once the lead case is decided, the Secretary of State is obliged to make, or revise, any decision as appropriate, and pay any moneys due.
<P>
 The Government's aim in bringing forward these new provisions is to provide a greater degree of clarity in how look-alike cases should be handled for the sake of customers and staff.
<P>
 Amendments Nos. 233 and 236 require the Secretary of State not to exercise the power in subsection (2) to stay a case relating to a relevent benefit pending the outcome of a lead case, if she considers it possible that hardship might be suffered by any person.
<P>
 I listened carefully to the explanation of the hon. Member for Northavon of why he thinks it necessary to introduce such a provision. As I have explained, the staying or delaying of decisions will replace most of the suspension decisions that used to be made on look-alike cases. However, delaying a decision such as a suspension will be a discretionary measure, and there will be full guidance to officers on how to use their descretion appropriately. Commonly, only part of the benefit involved will be at issue--so, in such cases, customers will continue to receive some benefit.
<P>
 Amendment No. 237 proposes that the Secretary of State should not exercise the power under clause 25 (2) to stay a case relating to a relevant benefit until the customer has been given 14 days in which to make written representations about why the power should not be exercised in that way.
<P>
The Government believe that the amendment is not necessary as it introduces an additional administrative step into all cases that are to be stayed in that way, even when there is no disagreement that an individual case is a lookalike case. The Committee has already discussed the administrative processes enabling representations to be made.
<P>
Amendment No. 234 would narrow the circumstances in which the Secretary of State need not make a decision on a look-alike case by removing the words ``it possible'' from subsection (2). I do not believe that it would be helpful to remove those qualifying words. Where there is an appeal pending in a lead case, in which the Secretary of State is an interested party, she will have either made, or joined in, that appeal on the basis of legal advice as to the proper interpretation of the issue of law in question. She would therefore normally expect it to be likely that her interpretation would be upheld. However, the law is not an exact science and may be open to wider interpretation than may have been intended originally.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Until the decision in the lead case is known, the approach to dealing with lookalike cases can only be on the basis of whether it is possible that there be no entitlement to benefit. Removing the words ``it possible'' would require an impossible degree of certainty as to the outcome of the lead case and would render the provision unworkable.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 would ensure that subsection (2) applies only where the lead case would be determined in favour of the Secretary of State. I shall explain why I consider that the amendment would render the clause too restrictive. The commissioners and the courts decide points of law. The effect of the first relevant determination might be to award benefit where none had been intended. That could be regarded as a loss for the Secretary of State. However, the Secretary of State may win an appeal to the Court of Appeal, or the decision may be different or not necessarily in the Secretary of State's favour.
<P>
I should like to respond briefly to amendment No. 238, which would omit subsections (3) and (4). As I have explained, clause 25 will improve the current position by reducing confusion and by avoiding unnecessary double handling in many cases. Any benefit not affected by the lead case will be in payment at a safe rate while the lead case awaits determination. However the amendment would stop the possibility of making safe awards. It is not in the interests of the Department or customers to do so.
<P>
With amendment No. 254, the Opposition wish to omit clause 25 (3)(b). The amendment would remove the Secretary of State's ability to make the necessary regulations enabling her to make decisions that will provide payments at a safe rate.
<P>
The regulations will allow the Secretary of State to decide a case in order to pay any element of benefit entitlement not in dispute in the decision of the lead case. This is likely to vary from benefit to benefit and between particular types of cases. For example, a lead case may concern only entitlement to a particular income support premium. Therefore, if the customer was entitled to the main income support components, those would be paid. Only the lead case has been decided, the Secretary of State is required to reconsider and, if appropriate, revise those decisions and calculate arrears of benefit or overpayments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister's recent remarks provide some reassurance, but it would be helpful if he could explain why the clause is phrased as it is. Why does it not use the form of words that the Minister has just used?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Unfortunately, I am forced to accept that my arguments are sometimes clearer than what is legally required of the Bill. The clause will have the effect that I have described. I am assured that it is phrased in a way that will allow my explanation to the hon. Gentleman--clear as it is--to be put into effect. I hope that he is comforted by my words, but I see that he is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Although one understands the majesty of the law and the great expertise of lawyers, the fact is that there is such a thing as language, which has a meaning. Even lawyers in courts find it difficult to deal with situations in which meaning is wholly at odds with purpose.
<P>
The Minister's statement was about a restricted activity, and all Committee members sympathise with the problem. However, the relevant subsection is wide beyond the dreams of anyone working in the courts, and I doubt whether he could give us the assurance that we want. If a future Secretary of State wanted to make regulations with a wholly different purpose, there is nothing in the clause that would constrain him. Would that future Secretary of State be constrained in any other way by the Minister's admirably clear, concise and effective statement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The intention of subsection (3)(b) is entirely consistent with my explanation of its intention. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the notes on clauses, which have been supplied to all Committee members, for further explanation. I hope that with the wider explanation that I have given to each of the amendments the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister is giving way or sitting down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I thought you might be giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind Committee members to address their remarks to the Chair. Mr. Letwin is speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to respond to the Minister's statement that the notes on clauses are helpful. They constitute an admirable document and in many cases they do elucidate, but in this instance they do nothing of the kind. Page 27, which I have repeatedly studied in the vain hope of seeking clarification, states that subsection (3)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``allows regulations to be made''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is no more than the truth
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whereby the Secretary of State could partially decide a case, in order to pay part of an award which would not be affected by the decision in the lead case.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We do not contend that that is untrue, but the subsection will do far more than that--it will allow all sorts of regulations to be made that have nothing to do with the case in hand.

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will know, the Pepper v. Hart case stated that the words in Hansard can be used to give an additional explanation of a clause's purpose. I hope that my explanation clarified the matter to the hon. Gentleman--it could also be used in subsequent efforts to clarify the clause's purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Minister has responded to many of my points. Some of our objections about the process still stand, but we will clearly not get our way in that regard. There is much force behind amendment No. 234. The Secretary of State has merely to consider it possible that there will be a knock-on effect from a lead case to take action. The Minister implied that if we were to take out the words ``it possible'', there would be such a burden of certainty that subsection (3) would become unworkable. I am not wholly convinced by his argument. As the Bill is drafted the Secretary of State can stay anything, because anything is ``possible''. We simply want to put a slightly greater burden of proof on the Secretary of State. I am not sure that the right way to do that is to state in the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State considers that the result of an appeal will be such that''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Considering a matter is not knowing it or being certain about it; it is merely considering it, and considering comes somewhere between being possible and being definite. I am not convinced by the Minister's response.
<P>
The Minister has broadly dealt with my queries. I should be grateful if he would send me a copy of his letter to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)--and I am sure that it will have been handwritten by the Minister himself. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

As drafted, clauses 25, 26 and 43 make it explicit that appeals to courts are included when it comes to staying cases pending a decision on a lead case, and that includes an application for judicial review. An application may be made to the High Court for judicial review, and it is right that these cases should be treated in the same way as others before court. The amendments make that clear.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The amendments follow on closely from those that we have just discussed in relation to clause 25, but clause 26 deals with appeals that may be affected by other test cases. Since the arguments are similar, I shall not take too much of the Committee's time. However, it is important to reiterate that amendments Nos. 239 and 240, in a way similar to that explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) a moment ago, would give the Secretary of State rather more flexibility. It should not be only that the other case may have some effect, which would almost always be true of other test cases going to appeal at the same time, but that the Secretary of State believes that the appellant is likely to win the other case under consideration and that it may affect the claimant's case. It is reasonable to require the Secretary of State to believe that he is at least likely to win rather than that there may be a possibility that he will win. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon referred to a middle way and his argument applies equally to clause 26.
<P>
Amendment No. 241 makes it clear that the Secretary of State must not only win the test case but that it would be wholly detrimental to the claimant to leave him with no benefit.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Minister can offer us reassurance that when some benefit should be allowed and is not affected by the other test case, it should be paid and that decisions should be affected only when they are likely to affect the all of the benefit that is being applied for.
<P>
On amendment No. 242 we suspect that subsection (4) is unnecessary and that appeals should be allowed to go ahead. If necessary, the Secretary of State has the right to suspend part of a payment if it is likely to be affected by a test case and that is how the matter should be handled. If there is likely to be an effect on part of a benefit, that part should be suspended and the rest should be allowed. The appeal should go ahead and be decided; if necessary and if the Secretary of State believes that part of the payment should be suspended, he can do so at that point. Subsection (4) is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is important to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that we are in terrain of great danger involving the rights of the citizen. The Minister is unlikely to accept the amendment, but it is of the utmost importance to state clearly on the record that some members of the Committee are alive to the great danger arising from the degree of speculation to which I have referred, perhaps with too great a spirit of levity to register the point sufficiently seriously.
<P>
We are discussing circumstances in which the Secretary of State will estimate the likely outcome at law. It is risky to introduce that into our legal arrangements, but beyond that the Secretary of State will use those estimates to affect the entitlements of individuals. We are not dealing with estimates leading to general changes against which individual rights are protected; we are dealing with estimates that will have a direct impact on the entitlement of individuals.
<P>
Going one stage further, the Bill allows the Secretary of State to make those estimates even when he is by no means certain that the estimate is good. That can be the only basis for including the words ``it possible''. The only purpose of those words can be to give the Secretary of State the ability to make an estimate in a case in which he is uncertain of the outcome. To base a decision about an individual's entitlement on an uncertain estimate is to erode fundamental principles governing the treatment of individuals by the state. The Minister should consider, as a human being and as a Member of Parliament rather than merely as the spokesperson for a vast official machine, whether he really wishes to be responsible in repeated clauses for introducing that concept into English law.
<P>
I have referred to the possibility of some clauses becoming known as the ``Keith Bradley memorial clauses'' and I fear that the concept would come to be known as the ``Keith Bradley memorial concept''. It would be sad for the Minister's reputation if that were to come about because it would drive a wedge between the concept of rights and their protection by law, which would be regrettable. I am sure that the Minister, as a human being and a Member of Parliament, would not believe that to be right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I shall reply as a Member of Parliament and a human being. It will be nice to be remembered for something in this place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> May I reassure the Minister that he and his ministerial colleagues will be remembered for the flip-flops that they constantly perform in their Department?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is always a mistake to give way to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Newbury said when he moved the amendment, we debated similar amendments when we discussed clause 25. The reasons I gave for not accepting those amendments apply equally to clause 26.
<P>
It might be helpful if I explain briefly how the measures in clause 26 will work. The clause introduces a provision similar to that introduced by clause 25 to deal with cases which rest on an issue of law that is being challenged in the courts in another case. Clause 25 is about lookalike cases being dealt with in the Department of Social Security. Clause 26 makes similar arrangements for cases which have gone to appeal. Its purpose is to unblock the system which has become clogged up with too many lookalike cases which could be dealt with more efficiently by the Department. Its provisions will also allow the expertise of the commissioners to be used more effectively so that more substantive appeals can be dealt with more speedily.
<P>
Under the new provisions, the Secretary of State will identify which cases are lookalikes, and if an appeal to the tribunal or commissioners rests entirely on the same issue of law as in the lead case, the clause allows her to require an appeal tribunal or commissioner to return the cases to her. Appellants will be advised that their appeals will not proceed and that the Secretary of State will revise or supersede the decision under appeal in accordance with the decision in the lead case, once that case is decided.
<P>
Alternatively, the Secretary of State may require the appeal tribunal or commissioner either to defer hearing the appeal or to determine the appeal where they consider it to be in the interests of the appellant to do so. If the tribunal or commissioner do determine the appeal, they will be required to decide the case as if the issues in the lead case had already been decided in the way that was most unfavourable to the appellant. What this means in practice is that the appeal can be decided without pre-empting the issues in the lead case.
<P>
The provisions in the clause simply reflect the sensible provisions of the preceding clause for the purposes of appeals to tribunals and to commissioners. The system will be speeded up; customers will not be disadvantaged. If a person's entitlement to benefit is only partially dependent on the outcome of a lead case, then the other issues being appealed can be decided. When the lead case is finally determined, any benefit due will be paid quicker than under current arrangements.
<P>
Collectively, the amendments reduce the number of cases where the Secretary of State has power to require tribunals or commissioners to refer cases back to her. Some cases would thus be decided inappropriately by an appeal tribunal or commissioner--leading to double handling and increased administration and complexity. I do not believe that that would be sensible. Provisions in clause 26, however, are sensible. In the light of that explanation, and bearing in mind the comparison with the debate on clause 25, I hope that the hon. Member for Newbury will withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response, but the arguments in relation to clause 25 are not the same. The premise that the Government are right on clause 25 so they must be right on clause 26 is not necessarily one that holds great sway with the Opposition. Nevertheless, I have listened to the Minister's points and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 255, in page 15, line 35, leave out from `Commissioner' to `to' in line 37.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 256, in page 16, line 2, leave out from `shall' to `if' in line 4.
<P>
No. 257, in page 16, line 5, leave out from `A' to end of line 8 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`according to the current interpretation of the law'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments are related to those debated on clauses 22 and 25. Clause 26 would force an appellant either to await the result of a test case or, more strangely, to allow the commissioner to prejudice the outcome of a case before the test case was decided. Amendment No. 257 relates to the latter instance.
<P>
Amendment No. 255 seeks to delete the power of the Secretary of State to require matters to be referred to back to her for determination. I recollect saying in a previous debate that the Bill gives power to the Secretary of State to set precedent. That was denied by the Minister and I was advised that the power lay wholly with the commissioners. If clause 26 stands unamended, the Secretary of State will be given the power to set precedent.
<P>
Clause 257 seems legally unsound, in that it gives the commissioner the power--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman meant amendment No. 257.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Yes. The clause gives the commissioner the power to decide on issues of legal principle before another case has been decided, which is it hoped will set a precedent. The commissioner's decision may be at odds with the outcome of that awaited test case or may prejudice its outcome. That could lead to a quite appalling and expensive legal muddle. It must surely be wrong in principle to try to achieve what one understands to be the objective by a route that is legally unsound. The better course, as suggested in amendment No. 257, is to leave matters
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the current interpretation of the law''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A wider point needs to be considered. The Bill is drafted in the most contorted and devious legal fashion. One understands the basic point, which is that the administration of a system of legal rights and appeals is mighty expensive, and that to cut back on that one has to cut back on the whole process. However, it would be much wiser and more honest to address the problem frontally, changing matters by administrative power without the process of legal rights and appeals. That would be better than contorted legal drafting. This instance seems wholly unsound legally and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which in any other area of law could never be considered and would be ruled totally out of court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendments would frustrate the Secretary of State's aim to simplify and speed up the process of administering lookalike cases. Under current arrangements, no formal legislative provision exists to delay or stay appeal to appeal tribunals or to commissioners when the appeal concerns an issue of law which is being challenged in another case. In practice, however, tribunals and commissioners have often delayed listing cases of this sort. Even so, at tribunal level, thousands of cases are heard and decided when they involve the same point as the lead case. Cases already decided by a tribunal must, thereafter, be appealed to the commissioner in order to have the erroneous decision overturned. That is expensive, time-consuming, inefficient and wasteful.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said, clause 26 will help to make more effective use of commissioners' time and expertise, and it will reduce the potential for a backlog of cases at the commissioners. That is an aim that I am sure we all want fulfilled. Having given an explanation of the context of clause 26 and the reassurance that the issues raised by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will not be affected by it, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We all agree on the objectives. The territory covered by amendment No. 257 seems to risk the very reverse of the streamlining objective. For example, if a commissioner has used his judgment in anticipation of a test case, which then decides in the opposite direction, the situation becomes quite complicated. It would be much simpler to lay down that the decision should be on the basis of precedent at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that decisions under clause 26 will not prejudice the lead case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for that. I should be interested to know how that would come about under the clause as drafted. Subject to a written explanation of that, which is at the heart of my concern, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 69, in page 16, line 26, leave out subsection (7) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) In this section--
<P>
(a) the reference in subsection (1)(a) above to an appeal to a Commissioner includes a reference to an application for leave to appeal to a Commissioner; and
<P>
(b) any reference in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (6) above to an appeal, or to an application for leave to appeal, against a decision includes a reference to--
<P>
(i) an application for, or for leave to apply for, judicial review of the decision under section 31 of the Supreme Court Act 1981; or
<P>
(ii) an application to the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session in respect of the decision.'.--[Mr. Keith Bradley.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I should like to make a point of principle about the clause as a whole. If the Secretary of State is allowed to intervene in the appeals process, there is a danger that the independence of such appeals may be compromised to some extent, which is a pity. It looks as if the Secretary of State can take matters out of the hands of the independent system, which is clearly different from only the tribunal system itself being able to decide whether an appeal should go ahead or be delayed because of another test case happening at the same time.
<P>
I could accept that the tribunal should perhaps be given permission to decide that another test case was so important that it should adjourn its own hearing, and that the Secretary of State might need powers to suspend payment of part or the whole of benefit while the tribunal decided what it should do about the test case; but on a point of principle, it should be the tribunal and the appeals system that take that decision, not the Secretary of State. That would maintain the independence of the tribunal system in a way that the clause does not.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 26, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 243, in page 16, line 40, leave out from `State' to `in' in line 41.

<P>
No. 271, in page 17, line 46, after `Ireland,', insert `or'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The clause relates to a complicated issue which fundamentally affects natural justice, so it is important to debate it. I shall deal with what is commonly known as the ante-test rule--that is, the matter of when claim for benefit should become payable if it is decided that a similar case, which might have gone to appeal, has an effect on it.
<P>
There are various ways in which the clause might be unfair. It is likely to be unfair to all whose rights of appeal are still outstanding when a test case is being decided. There is an argument for paying benefits to those whose cases are reviewed following a test case from the date on which the test case is decided. However, when someone has applied for a benefit and when the claim has gone to appeal, it is against natural justice for that person to have his or her benefit paid, if the test case is beneficial to the claim, only from the date of the decision in the test case, whereas the person who originated the test case has his or her benefit paid from the date on which the original claim was made.
<P>
If it is fair that someone whose claim becomes a test case, perhaps by chance, has his or her payments backdated to the time of the original claim, surely it is fair that the payments to those whose claims are held up by the test case should be similarly backdated. If we do not allow that to happen, we shall discriminate against claimants on the grounds of the time at which their cases are heard. That is, in effect, a lottery; there are many reasons why one case is heard before another or why one becomes a test case. Therefor the clause is unfair to those whose claims are delayed by test cases.
<P>
This can affect people significantly. If claimants should have been paid from the moment they first claimed but the decisions are delayed pending the outcome of another case, their debts might begin to increase, they might delay spending on an item which might become more expensive because of inflation, or they might have to suffer a lower standard of living than they would otherwise have had. If officials of the state make mistakes in their original decisions, it is unfair--indeed, perhaps even immoral--for the state to take advantage of that by not backdating payments to the time of the original claim.
<P>
The entire clause should be removed from the Bill, but if we do not achieve that aim, the amendments would have the effect of restricting the extent to which the ante-test case rule applies, and might therefor mitigate some of its worst effects. Each amendment would have a different effect. Amendment No. 243 would restrict the effects to decision made by the Secretary of State, not by tribunals, commissions or the courts.
<P>
Amendment No. 244 would restrict the effects to revisions of decisions made specifically in consequence of test cases. Clearly, without that amendment, there would be a lottery based on whose case is determined first.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 245 and 246 would restrict the effect to cases in which the initial decision is taken in accordance with case law which was binding on the Secretary of State at the time. The amendment would thus protect claimants in cases where the Secretary of State has simply misinterpreted the law.
<P>
Amendment No. 247 would remove cases where the claimant has applied for the decision to be superseded. In effect, if the claimant said that he knew that the decision was wrong and was of that opinion when he made the claim, it would be only fair that a final decision in his favour should be backdated to the time when he made the claim.
<P>
Amendment No. 248, which would delete subsection (4), would remove the effect of these proposed regulations from regulations that have been found to be ultra vires. Again, if the state has tried to do something ultra vires--in other words, if the state has acted unlawfully--it would be wrong for the state and the taxpayer to be rewarded for that unlawful behaviour at the expense of claimants who may have acted entirely properly in making their claims.
<P>
Amendment No. 271 is consequential on amendment No. 249. The latter would remove the Secretary of State's right to ignore the effect of decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Community. It seems rather unlikely that the Secretary of State has the power to ignore decisions of that court--that could lead to all sorts of interesting legal wrangles. For that reason alone, amendment No. 249 should be acceptable. To avoid what might later be thought to be considerable legal difficulties, it would be better to take out reference to that court now.
<P>
The fundamental argument that lies behind all the amendments is that natural justice demands that if a claim is later proved correct and the claimant is found to be entitled to the benefits claimed, the money should be backdated to when the claim was made. Payment should not depend on whether the claim happened to have been made before or after someone else's claim, which was later used as a test case.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Clause 27 is not a new provision. It essentially re-enacts and clarifies existing provisions in sections 68 and 69 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Those provisions restrict entitlement to benefit following a decision by a commissioner or a court that overturns the interpretation of the law previously applied by the Secretary of State. The person whose case is re-interpreted is entitled to increased benefit from the date of the original decision which led to his appeal. However, others affected by the re-interpretation will have any change to benefit paid from a common start date--the date of the determination of the commissioner or court in the lead case.
<P>
Over the years there have been a number of important legal challenges to the long and complex provisions of sections 68 and 69 of the 1992 Act. Those have sought to put a different interpretation on the provisions from that originally intended by Parliament. Clause 27 aims to reflect Parliament's original intention more clearly. It is not designed to deny people the benefit that Parliament meant them to have.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 243, 244 and 247 would allow unlimited arrears for people who happened to have lodged appeals, applied for revised decisions or applied for a decision on their entitlements to be superseded before the date of the commissioner's or the court's determination in the lead case. If claimants did not appeal before the determination, any award of, or increase in, benefit would be limited. That would lead to inconsistent and unfair treatment between claimants.
<P>
The amendments also have other implications. As hon. Members have recognised, a considerable time may have elapsed before a commissioner or a court re-interprets the law. Potential arrears of benefit may be considerable. That money would have to be found elsewhere.
<P>
Amendment No. 245 seems to provide for a decision of the Secretary of State in a look-alike case to be made in accordance with an earlier relevant decision. That is exactly what will happen. I believe that the amendment is superfluous, as is the original amendment No. 246. Hon. Members will be pleased to know that amendment No. 246 is a replica of Government amendment No. 71, to which we shall come to shortly.
