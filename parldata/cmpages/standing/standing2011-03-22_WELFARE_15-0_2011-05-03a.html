section 1 of the Welfare Reform Act 2007, which provides that a person
is not entitled to employment and support allowance if they are a
member of a couple who are entitled to a joint-claim award of
jobseeker’s allowance. The purpose of the joint-claims provision
is to ensure that both members of a couple are subject to JSA
conditionality. However, there are circumstances in which a member of a
joint-claim couple is entitled to JSA without meeting all the
conditions of entitlement—for example, where one member is
unable to work due to ill heath or disability. The JSA regulations set
out such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000023">&#160;</a>

policy intention is that such a person should be entitled to claim
contributory ESA, as well as joint-claim JSA, but the Department has
realised that the current provisions do not work as intended owing to a
defect in the primary powers. The clause will rectify that by ensuring
that such people can claim contributory ESA, which, of course, is
payable at a higher rate, while being a member of a couple who are
entitled to a joint claim for JSA.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000024">&#160;</a>

claimants in such cases on to a proper legal footing. I hope that

key amendment of the group is amendment 154, which, with amendment 165,
addresses the limitation of contributory employment and support
allowance to one year for people in the work-related activities group.
The other amendments raise two important related issues, and I welcome
the two amendments in the group that the hon. Member for Cardiff
Central tabled to address the same issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Time-limiting
contributory ESA is a major change to how the benefit’s system
works—no one should be under any illusion about that. The
Government expect to save billions of pounds. This morning, I received
a written answer from the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Basingstoke, which said that they will
save more than £1 billion a year by 2014, as a result of the
change. It was always assumed that national insurance meant that, if
someone fell ill and was unable to work, they would receive their
contributory benefit until they were better, but not anymore. Under the
Bill, they will receive contributory benefits for a year and that is
it. It is a very big change
indeed.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me summarise the case that I want to put to the Committee. First, as
with jobseeker’s allowance, to be justified, any time limit
should be greater than most people need to get off the benefit.
Secondly, only a small minority of those who enter the work-related
activity group leave ESA within a year. The Government have yet to tell
us how many, but I suspect that the figure is probably less than 20%,
so it is a small minority. Thirdly, as an absolute minimum, the
Government should make the time limit amendable by regulations, rather
than writing “365 days” in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
amendments 154 and 165, I am not opposing the principle of
time-limiting. The principle governing the design of ESA was work for
those who are able to work and support for those who are not. When we
introduced ESA—I was the responsible Minister when ESA came into
effect—it distinguished for the first time between people who
could reasonably be expected to get back to work, who were placed in
the work-related activity group, and those who could not, who were
placed in the support group. The latter will continue to receive
contributory ESA for as long as they are incapable of work, if
necessary until they receive their state pension. The change will not
affect them, but it will affect people in the work-related activity
group.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree that there is a persuasive logic in the case for people in the
work-related activity group not being paid contributory benefits
indefinitely. Since the 1980s, contributory jobseeker’s
allowance has not been paid indefinitely. JSA is paid for only six
months, by which time we know that the vast majority of people find new
jobs. I have rarely heard complaints that that arrangement is
unreasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Too
many people have been stuck on incapacity benefit when they could have
been working and whose health would be a lot better today if they had
been working. I particularly enjoyed meeting a number of people who
returned to work through the previous Government’s pathways to
work programme after long periods. One or two of them had been out of
work on 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>health grounds for 10 years, and some had been out of work for longer
than that. Their enthusiasm for the improvement in their circumstances,
particularly their health and general well-being, as a result of being
in work was a
tonic.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
has a long history. In the 1980s, as unemployment rose inexorably to 3
million on two separate occasions, the then Government were desperate
to get the headline numbers down. Jobcentre staff were given points for
stopping people from getting on to unemployment benefits. I have spoken
to people who worked in jobcentres at the time, and they told me how it
worked. They earned those points if people went on to incapacity
benefit. So large numbers of people whose health problems were not
insuperable were dumped on to incapacity benefit and abandoned. Some of
them are still on incapacity benefit, and even more stayed on
incapacity benefit until they reached state pension age at some point
between then and now. That was the period when the numbers on
incapacity benefit mushroomed. It was a scandalous episode in the
history of the welfare
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000047">&#160;</a>

pointed out to me a particularly tendentious press release on the
Conservative party website in the Minister’s name. It claims
that the new Government elected in 1997 did nothing about the issue.
That is completely untrue. Pilots of the new deal for disabled people,
which was the first attempt by any UK Government to help people on
incapacity benefit into work, started in 1998, not long after the
commencement of the new deal for young people. I know because I was the
Minister responsible. It was a new area of endeavour for the state.
Before that, the previous Government had made no effort at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000048">&#160;</a>

Gentleman. First, will he confirm to the Committee that the total

years that Labour was in office and certainly over the period before
the introduction of ESA? Secondly, will he confirm that during those 13
years, while he introduced assessment for new claimants, no assessment
was carried out of those people who were existing incapacity benefit
claimants, with a view to undertaking the return-to-work process that
was carried out subsequently for new
claimants?<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000049">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful. I will respond briefly: the period
in which the huge increase took place was, of course, during the
previous Conservative Administration. I think the Minister is
implicitly acknowledging that the number fell by a small amount under
the previous Government. It was rising sharply in 1997 and then started
to come down, thanks to the changes that we made. We built on the new
deal for young people with pathways to work and with the creation of
ESA. The result was a very dramatic improvement on the previous
Government’s record. The Minister is right that it took some
time. It had not been tried at all before 1997 to help people out of
work for health reasons. It took some experimentation to find out how
to do it, and we therefore learned how to help those people. This
Government have rightly attempted to build on that in setting up the
Work programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to suggest to the Committee that, for people who can reasonably be
expected, notwithstanding their health problems, to look for a
job—of course, the work capability assessment for placing people
in the work-related activity group needs to be right, and we do not
seem to be quite there yet, although I welcome Professor
Harrington’s recommendation—it is perfectly reasonable,
by analogy with contributory JSA, to limit the period for which
contributory ESA is paid. The crucial question is the length of that
period. The argument for time-limiting JSA has always been that the
vast majority of job seekers return to work within six months of losing
their job. To justify a time limit in ESA, we need to be satisfied that
it is reasonable to expect people to return to work within that period
and that most people will be able to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What should
the period be? One possibility is that contributory ESA should be paid
for just six months, as with contributory JSA. I agree with the
Government’s decision not to do that. It would be quite wrong to
allow only the same period in which contributory JSA is payable. ESA
was designed to strike the right balance between providing adequate
support on the one hand, recognising the significant barriers to work
faced by many people with health problems, and on the other hand having
high but realistic expectations of those who can plan for a return to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People with
health problems often face very serious barriers to work, not only in
doing a job but also in securing one in the first place, and it is
right that we give people additional support in recognition of that. It
would be completely unrealistic to build a system that expected people
with health problems to get back to work within six months in the same
way that jobseekers without health problems are expected to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am glad that
the Government are not expecting such people to return to work within
six months, but I also want to suggest to the Committee that a year is
not the right period either. That is crystal clear. If we are going to
set a time limit to ESA, it is very important to set it at a duration
that is fair, drawing on the evidence about what is a reasonable period
in which people with health impairments can be expected to get back to
work. The crucial question is whether it is reasonable to
expect people in the work-related activity group to return to work
within one year, and my answer is that it is

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
period of 12 months was chosen because it strikes the best balance
between allowing people with longer-term conditions to adjust to their
health condition and providing a level of access that is appropriate
for contributory benefits. Around 60% of all those claiming ESA already
come off this benefit within a year”.—[<em>Official

                        <p class="tabbed">That
is an interesting statistic—60% of people back in work within a

                           </div>a year, I would agree that that would give some kind of rationale for
limiting contributory entitlement to a year. The Minister’s
claim, however, appears to be based on data on the Department for Work
and Pensions website, which show that around 40% of those who were
receiving ESA in May 2009 were still receiving it in May
2010—60%, therefore, were not. However, that includes people in
the assessment phase, most of whose applications for ESA are
unsuccessful. While in the assessment phase, people receive the JSA
rate of benefit. If their application is unsuccessful, they will never
go on to the higher rate of ESA, which is payable in either the
work-related activity group, or the slightly higher one again, which is
payable in the support group. In other words, such people never made it
on to ESA, because they stayed on the JSA rate—while in the
assessment period, they receive benefit at the JSA rate, and they never
make it on to the higher rate payable to people who satisfy the work
capability assessment. According to my calculations, in May 2010, about
60% of the total number of active ESA claims were in the assessment
phase.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposals
before us today will affect neither people in the assessment phase, nor
in the support group; they will affect only those in the work-related
activity group. The question that we need to answer, therefore, is not
what proportion of those who applied for ESA are not receiving it 12
months later. The question must be what proportion of ESA claimants,
who make it into the work-related activity group, leave the benefit and
move into work within a year. After receiving the initial answer, I
asked that question instead, and I received the following response from
the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the right hon.

                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In such
circumstances, I suggest to the Committee that we need to tread very
carefully. Given the scale of the proposed change, we need to proceed
with care and on the basis of evidence, and the evidence to support
this change is simply not available. The data from pathways to work
show that between 2005 and 2009 the annual proportion of Jobcentre Plus
pathways customers who found work within one year ranged from 13% to
18%. In 2008-09, the proportion of provider-led pathways customers who
found work within one year was 14%, and many of those people would have
been on the benefit for a significant period before they got into
pathways. The Government will no doubt tell us that the Work programme
will be more successful, and I hope that it will. The opportunity is
there to learn from, and build on, what happened in
pathways.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If we look
with great care at the assumptions that are built into the invitations
to tender for the Work programme, we find an optimistic but not wholly
unreasonable assumption for the rate of job conversion of people who
are on ESA in the work-related activity group. That figure—I am
grateful to those who dug this out from the Government’s
spreadsheets, which, I gather, required some technical
cleverness—is 22%. The assumed job conversion rate for former
incapacity benefit claimants who are in the work-related activity group
is only 9%. The proportion of people in the work-related activity
group, going on to the Work programme, whom the Government expect to be
back at work within one year is 9% for some and 22% for others. It is
certainly not the majority; it is a small proportion.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Incidentally,
the Work programme can last for longer than one year. If the
benefit’s duration is limited to a year, as the Bill proposes,
many people will find that it stops while they are still on the Work
programme. The DWP impact assessment also suggests that a high
proportion of claimants are currently on the benefit for longer than a
year:<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is estimated that around 90 per cent of contributory ESA customers of
duration greater than 3 months and in the work-related activity group
will be affected by a one-year time limit.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the
Government’s own assessment, therefore, more than 90% will be
affected. Interestingly, table 1 in the impact assessment is based on
the average annual difference in the ESA contributory case load with
and without time limiting. I have tabled a written question asking for
the former as a percentage of the latter, and I have not yet received
an
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
do not know for sure how many people in the work-related activity group
enter work within one year. It is certainly not 60%, which is the
figure in the written answer that I received, because that includes the
large number of people who never really make it on to ESA at all. I
have noted, for example, the figures from
Macmillan:<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Three
quarters (75%) of people with cancer placed in the ESA Work-Related
Activity Group are still claiming ESA 12 months later.
Almost two thirds (61%) still need the benefit 18 months after first
claiming
it.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>There
are particular worries about the effect of a one-year time limit on
people who are recovering from cancer, and the Committee needs to weigh
this issue carefully. Those worries are the reason why the chief
executives of 30 cancer charities wrote an open letter to the Secretary
of State last month, which stated that:<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000069">&#160;</a>

enough.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000311">&#160;</a>

nodes. She is married with no children. After surgery Jane has to wait
two months before she is ready to start adjuvant chemotherapy, which
lasts for six months. Following her course of chemotherapy Jane has to

based on the scant data available, is that the proportion of people
returning to work from the ESA work-related activity group within one
year is in fact less than 20%. Under the proposal in the Bill,
everybody will lose their contributory benefit within a year. That
means that more than 80% of those availing themselves of their national
insurance benefit will lose it before they get back into work. JSA was
designed so that the vast majority will be back in work before their
contributory allowance expires. The Bill proposes that, for people with
health problems, their contributory benefit will stop before the great
majority are back at work. The Minister may be able to suggest a figure
other than 20%, but it is certainly not much more than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a very good question. The answer is that we
do not know. ESA has not been in place for much longer than two years
so it is not surprising that those data are not available. The hon.
Gentleman is right. That is a difficulty, which I think needs to be
reflected in what we put into the Bill. It might be possible to
separate people into a group for whom one period was appropriate and
others for whom a longer period was appropriate and to say, for
example, that people suffering from cancer received their contributory
benefit for a longer period than others. The Bill as it stands rules
out a differentiated approach, which would allow a greater level of
support for people suffering from cancer or from mental health
problems. We have talked about those in Committee, too. The amendment
would allow that differentiated approach to be
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Committee needs to weigh this with care. At present—the hon.
Gentleman put his name to an amendment about this—people who
receive oral chemotherapy or radiotherapy for treatment of cancer are
placed in the work-related activity group. But there is no way that
they would get back to work within a year and nobody on the Committee
would argue that they should. Yet even if they have been paying their
national insurance contributions absolutely consistently for many years
before suddenly, and probably without any warning, being struck down by
cancer, they will, on the basis of this proposal, lose their national
insurance benefit after one year, right in the middle of their chemo or
radiotherapy. For some that loss of income in the middle of their
treatment will be a catastrophe. We should not legislate to do that
kind of thing to people who are suffering from cancer and there are
some other impairments that I put in the same
category.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000079">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s understanding that those with a terminal illness, be

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. Some cancers are
officially designated as terminal. In the case that I mentioned earlier
that Macmillan has drawn to our attention, the man called Chris, who
described his cancer as incurable, is in the work-related activity
group. He can realistically plan for a return to work on the basis that
his cancer will be controlled. Cancer has a wide variety of effects on
people and wide variety of severities. My point is that it is simply
not plausible that many of those people can get back to work within a
year, and the system should not be designed on the basis that they
will.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000082">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have not been able to say how many ESA claimants in the
work-related activity group currently enter work within a year, but all
the evidence that I have seen points in the same direction: one year is
simply not long enough. If, as it appears, the vast majority of people
cannot reasonably be expected to enter work within a year, it cannot be
reasonable for us to penalise them for failing to do so, as the Bill
currently proposes.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000083">&#160;</a>

would remove the reference to time-limiting ESA to 365 days and state
in its place that contributory ESA would be time-limited to a

was deliberately designed to reflect the fact that we do not yet know
precisely what the right period

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to put a very serious request to the Minister: if there has been
even an ounce of sincerity behind his oft-repeated homily about the
books and bookcases, he must recognise that it is wrong for clause 51
to specify 365 days as the maximum period for receipt of contributory
ESA. If he believes, as he has very frequently told us, that the right
approach in the Bill is to include the framework in primary legislation
and the detail in secondary legislation, he should at the very least
remove clause 51(1) and clause 52(4), and replace the figure
of 365 days with the power to make a regulation to set a
limit.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
appeal directly to the Minister, solely on the basis of everything that
he has told us in the past month about the basis for the Bill.
Otherwise, it will take a new Act of Parliament to introduce an
arrangement that reflects the evidence, as it develops, about what the
right limit is. I suggest to him that not a single Committee member
believes that someone in the middle of a course of cancer treatment
after a year in the work-related activity group on ESA should lose
their benefit just because they reach the end of the year.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is no
evidence to justify a one-year limit; it has been chosen simply as a
cost-saving measure and is arbitrary. It was presumably dictated by the
Treasury as a contribution to be taken from sick people towards
over-hasty reduction of the deficit. The Minister could, however, at
least keep faith with his own speeches if he imposed the one-year limit
through secondary rather than primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have not yet been able to provide evidence about what the
right maximum period is. To be fair to them, that is not too
surprising, as the benefit has not been operating for very long. I do
not think, however, that a limit could be justified unless we knew that
a majority of those who enter the work-related activity group would be
back in work within that period. Fewer than 25%, and probably fewer
than 20%, of those who enter the work-related activity group can
currently be expected to be back in work within a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
maximum period should not be less than two years. I expect that the
majority of people who go into the work-related activity group will
have a good chance of being back in work within two years, but, as the
hon. Member for Meon Valley rightly pointed out, I do not have the data
to substantiate that claim because they are not yet available. That is
why amendment 154 would replace “365 days”
with<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000093">&#160;</a>

significant support and time in order to adapt to his new situation.
[He] is placed in the work-related activity group, as although he faces
very significant challenges to reintegrate into the labour market, the
impact of his impairment is not considered severe enough for him to be
placed in the support group. It would be unrealistic to expect him to
take part in work-related activity, as well as adapt to his new
situation, within a one year time-limit. In [his] case he would need to
re-train as the type of work for which is qualified is no longer
accessible to him. This training would most likely include learning how

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is right. It is surprising when the
Conservative party told us so frequently before the election that they
did not agree with couple penalties, but here yet another one is being
introduced. We might add that anybody with £16,000 in the bank
will also get nothing once their contributory benefit
stops.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000110">&#160;</a>

people run into health problems having done the right
thing—worked and paid into the national insurance fund for many
years, and perhaps saved conscientiously as well. Under the proposals,
a significant number of people who suffered a health catastrophe a year
ago, such as being struck down with cancer or mental illness, will be
hit by a financial catastrophe, which is quite likely to be slap bang
in the middle of their course of treatment. To lose all income because
your partner brings in £7,500 a year or because your family has
savings of £16,000 before there has been a realistic chance of
getting back to work will mean financial catastrophe for many. We
should not pass legislation that has that effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000111">&#160;</a>

the Secretary of State how many pathways to work participants entered

information shows that one year is not enough time and, as the hon.
Member for Meon Valley correctly points out, does not allow us to say
with certainty that two years is enough. That is why amendment 158,
which is in the next group, calls for independent annual monitoring of
how the picture unfolds. If we were in government, we would not want a
limit of less than two years on contributory ESA, but we would
certainly want to monitor the impact of the policy very carefully. We
would be open to extending it, if, once the evidence became available,
it was clear that two years was not enough. The reference in the
amendment to a prescribed period is to allow us to extend the time
limit easily if necessary without a fresh Act of Parliament, which will
be required under the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000113">&#160;</a>

proposed by the Government will have severe consequences for people
with fluctuating conditions. As the Bill stands, any time will count
towards the 12-month limit, regardless of whether it is continuous. A
good example would be somebody with cancer who spends 10 months in the
work-related activity group and then moves into the support group as a
result of a deterioration in their condition, which would not be a
particularly unusual development. If they then recover and re-enter the
work-related activity group they will have just two months to find work

the Minister answered a question from me this morning. Sadly, I do not
think I have them to hand, but I will get to them before I sit down.
The hon. Lady makes a perfectly fair point about how all this will be
paid for. I now have the figures in front of me, so perhaps I should
read them into the record. The Government expect to save £1.1
billion in 2014-15 as a result of placing a one-year time limit on
contributory employment and support allowance. With a two-year limit
the saving would be £650 million, a difference of £450
million. That is the saving that would not accrue under our
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000118">&#160;</a>

Government should not legislate to take that money away from people who
could not possibly have expected to get back to work within a year of

take money away from sick people.

understand exactly how that pays out and the terms of the contract I am
entering into. At the risk of angering my Whip slightly, could I ask
the shadow Minister to take me briefly through where he thinks it is
reasonable for contributions to start and stop, for what they should
and should not pay, and how long these things can

                           </strong> Indeed. Someone who paid their national insurance
contributions should expect to be able to receive their contributory
benefit for a period within which it would be reasonable to expect them
to return to work. I do not argue that they should expect to carry on
receiving benefit for ever. That is how incapacity benefit has worked,
and I am not suggesting we should stick with that. However, if the
contributory principle means anything, they should receive their
contributory allowance for a long enough period for it to be reasonable
to expect them to get back to work. That is rather how it works with
JSA. They get contributory JSA for six months—I think that more
than 90% of people who receive it are back at work within that period.
I am not suggesting that the figure should even necessarily be 90%, but
most people should surely be expected to be back in work before the
contributory benefit ends.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000125">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The reason why I bring up that clearly very
wide issue is to focus it back on the amendment. The right hon.
Gentleman characterises the policy as taking £640 million away
from people who can ill afford it. However, a good proportion of those
people can afford it. That is the source of the tension between the
contributory principle, the assets and what people currently
have.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can see that there is a tension there, but I want
to stand firmly behind the contributory principle. If people have paid
their contributions conscientiously, in many cases, for many years,
they should be entitled to expect the system to support them for at
least long enough for them to have a reasonable chance to get back into
work. Of course, it is perfectly possible to take an entirely different
view and say that only those who are destitute should get any money. As
we have said, under the proposal, people whose partner earns
£7,500 a year will get absolutely nothing as a result of their
incapacity through ill health. That is not how the system should work.
If they have paid in, they should be able to expect the system to
support them for a reasonable period, which must be long enough for the
majority to get back into work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000127">&#160;</a>

philosophical difference here across the Committee. When I was first in
the Minister’s shoes, Conservative Members used to press me
about standing by the contributory principle. A school that has long
been present in the Conservative party takes the view that if one has
paid in, one should be able to expect support. I do not know how big
that school is these days, but if we are now in a world where
Conservative Members think that people should get money only if they
are destitute, I regret that. I much preferred the one-nation

                        <p>However,
by the time Royal Assent is obtained, which I think will be in the
autumn, it will be only a few months before people start to lose their
money. The amendment helps to prevent that alarming and worrying state
of affairs. If the Minister does not agree with our proposal, we need
to be told how the Department will ensure that claimants are aware of
the changes in good time before they take effect in April next
year.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 156

                        </p>
                        <p>The assessment period is
the initial 13 weeks of the claim, before the claimant knows whether
their application will be successful or whether they will be placed in
the support group. As we know, most applicants will be unsuccessful. I
am pleased that amendment 160, which the hon. Member for Cardiff
Central tabled, has the same effect as ours.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
several reasons why those days should not be included in the
time-limited period. First, the claimant will not know, at that point,
what requirements will be placed on them and whether a time limit will
apply. They may well expect, at that stage, to be placed in the support
group rather than in the work-related activity group. To be told after
three months in assessment that they will receive only nine months of
contributory benefit would be unreasonable even if we took the view
that a year was a reasonable period. People should at least be given
the full period, rather than a reduced period to secure
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
during this period claimants receive a reduced amount of ESA rather
than the full amount—it is equivalent, I believe, to the rate of
JSA for that period—so without the amendment, they will not even
get the full amount of ESA for a full year. It will start only after
the assessment has finished, and will last only until 12
months after the application for benefit was
made.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, I
would welcome some explanation from the Government about how the limit
will apply to people who are placed in the work-related activity group
only after appeal. At the moment, people who appeal remain in the
assessment phase while their case is being considered. If they win the
appeal, will they be entitled to receive ESA for the full period of the
time limit? If somebody wins their appeal after 10 months in the
assessment phase, for example—we know that appeals are taking a
long time in many such circumstances—it does not seem fair that
they should be given only two months at the full rate, during which
time they would be expected to secure a job. Perhaps I have
misunderstood the Government’s intentions—I hope I
have—but if the Minister could explain to us how people who go
through an appeal process are going to be treated under this
arrangement, I would be
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All the
amendments that I have outlined so far apply to both adult contributory
ESA and youth contributory ESA. The final couple of amendments in this
group are intended to remove the abolition of contributory ESA for
young people. I must say that I am shocked and dismayed to find clause
52 in the Bill. It is possible that I have missed something, and if I
have I would be grateful if the Minister could point it out, but we all
understand that contributory benefit depends on the payment of national
insurance contributions—a discussion that I have just had with
the hon. Member for Meon Valley. That is quite right, but it has long
been accepted by Governments of both parties that there should be one
significant exception: young people who have been disabled from birth
or have had heath problems from childhood, and who, as a result, have
never had the opportunity to work, pay contributions, and obtain
contributory benefit in the conventional way.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The ESA
maintained the long-established rule that applies to incapacity
benefit—a rule that, as far as I know, dates back to the
establishment of the benefit by the previous Conservative
Government—that children disabled from birth can qualify for
contributory benefit on the basis of the condition relating to youth to
which clause 52 refers, rather than by paying contributions, which they
clearly cannot do if their disability means that they cannot
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
52, however, summarily abolishes that provision. That greatly
undermines a long-established arrangement that was entirely
uncontentious, as far as I was aware. When I took Welfare Reform Bills
through the House, no one ever said to me that we should remove the
arrangements for supporting adults who have been disabled since birth
or childhood. The clause abolishes the provision that the system has
long made for young people who are disabled or incapacitated from birth
or childhood. I find it very hard to understand what justification
there could be for that attack on the incomes of those who are
surely—we would all agree—among the most disadvantaged of
all, as it is literally impossible for them to work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People who
have been disabled since birth, or early in life, should not be
penalised for having been unable to make national insurance
contributions, and should not be unable to receive contributory ESA.

                        <p>I
find it very hard to understand the Government’s justification
for abolishing ESA for those people. It would be unreasonably punitive.
I hope that they will not do so, and will agree to the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have taken some time in speaking to the amendments, but I think it is
right for the Committee to weigh them very carefully before proceeding.
As it stands, the Bill will add financial catastrophe to the hardships
endured by cancer sufferers who are receiving treatment, people
overcoming mental health problems and their families, and others. Those
are people who have always worked hard, paid their dues, and done the
right thing in the belief that national insurance would protect them if
things went wrong. The Bill will mean that in future, that protection
will be there for just 365 days. I press the Minister, in particular,
to reflect on all the speeches that he has given the Committee about
books and bookcases. At the very least, as a matter of good faith, I
urge him to take the maximum period for receipt of contributory ESA out
of the Bill and to make that a matter for
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000148">&#160;</a>

                           </span> As the right hon.
Gentleman has said, there are two amendments in my name. They are both
probing amendments and I do not intend to press them to a Division, but
they make important points and I would be grateful for the
Minister’s response. Amendment 161 is about restarting the time
period for the limit on contributory ESA each time somebody goes into
the support group, and amendment 160 is about excluding the assessment
period from that time limit. Many of the arguments have been made by
the right hon. Member for East Ham, so I do not intend to keep the
Committee long.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
the assessment period to be removed from the time limit. For that
13-week period—when it is 13 weeks—the amount of benefit
that an individual receives is significantly lower than the amount that
they would receive in the work-related activity group. At that point,
they do not know whether they will go into the work-related activity
group or into the support group, so it seems unfair to count that time
towards their time limit if they move into the work-related activity
group later on. Excluding the assessment period from the calculation
would, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, make the issue of people
who appeal a decision when they do not get passed to enter the
work-related activity group much clearer.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It can take an
extremely long time for an appeal to take place, and people are on a
very low rate of benefit while they wait for that to happen, as the
right hon. Gentleman mentioned. About three weeks ago, a constituent
came to see me who, for a number of reasons, has been waiting for his
appeal for over a year. For the whole of that period, he has been
receiving the assessment-phase rate of employment support allowance.
There are a number of concerns. If the measures were implemented, he
would, if he was moved into the work-related activity group on appeal,
effectively never have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 646<a class="bkMark" name="Column646">&#160;</a>
                           </div>received the work-related activity group rate, and by then, he would no
longer be eligible for it; the whole period would have been spent on
the assessment-phase rate, which is significantly lower. He would not
have benefited at all from the fact that he has paid his
contributions—he would not have received that extra
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
other questions, too. Would my constituent have to pay back anything
that he received after 12 months, should it take longer than
that to have his appeal granted? Although such issues will probably
affect only a small number of people, they are worrying for them, and I
would be grateful if the Minister would let us know whether the
Department has looked at ways to ensure that the assessment period is
removed.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that there are concerns about deducting the period from the beginning,
because people might abuse the system by moving in and out of an
assessment phase to enable them to keep their contributory benefit for
longer. However, it may be possible to add at the end of the period the
time that people spent in the assessment period at the beginning. If
there was three months spent in the assessment period, the time-limited
period could be extended by three months, so people would effectively
get 12 months on the benefit. There are ways to limit the amount of
potential abuse, if that is something that the Department is
concerned about, and it would make the system fairer for those
affected. Otherwise, people might feel that the system is treating them
extremely unfairly.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My second
amendment is about restarting the limit whenever somebody went into the
support group. As the right hon. Gentleman said, that would be fairer
to those with fluctuating conditions. I understand why the Government
do not want to make it possible for someone to move on to
jobseeker’s allowance or something similar for a period of time
in order to restart their one-year contributory ESA payments—I
see that the Government are trying to get around that issue. However,
for somebody who is moving into the support group from the work-related
activity group, the scenario is completely different.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To go into the
support group, a person must have a very serious medical condition, and
such a person is clearly in a different position from somebody who is
moving on to jobseeker’s allowance and then back into the
work-related activity group. As the right hon. Gentleman highlighted,
somebody with a fluctuating condition that is periodically getting
worse could move into the support group, and when they finally recover
and move back into the work-related activity group, they could have
little or none of their allocation left. They could, therefore, end up
losing all their benefits just when they are starting to
recover.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
acknowledge that those who have just come out of the support group and
into the work-related activity group are not yet work-ready, but are
working towards being work-ready. However, if people lose their
benefits within a short period of leaving the support group, it could
put their recovery back and make it more difficult to return to work.
By definition, the fact that they have recently been in a support group
means that they are the furthest away from the job market, and have a
long distance to go before they are well enough to find work. Resetting
the time period whenever somebody goes into

medical conditions and need that extra
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister can take those points into account when looking
at the proposals. I am not a big fan of the proposal to time-limit ESA,
but there are ways that we could make it a fairer system, so that we do
not penalise those who have the most serious medical need and ensure
that those who are stuck in an appeals process, for example, do not end
up being penalised as well. The measures will be controversial: people
do not like the prospect of the time limit. There are ways that the
Government could make it fairer, and I hope that the Minister will take
them into account.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000157">&#160;</a>

                           </span> One question we have to
ask is: what sort of people are harmed by the proposals? What effect do
they have on households? It is easy to raise the straw man of the
person with the rich spouse, and to suggest that it is somehow unfair
for such people to get benefits for extended periods. However, most of
those who would be affected by the measures are not unduly well off.
They are most likely to be the kind of people who have worked and
contributed, often for many years, and who are likely to be older,
given the age prevalence of many illnesses. It is older people in their
40s and 50s who have had the most opportunity to be a couple in dual
employment. Perhaps the child-caring partner has gone back to work at a
later stage in life, or perhaps they were able to build up savings.
Those savings may not be hugely extensive.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000158">&#160;</a>

consider savings of £6,000-plus—that is the amount at
which we begin to eliminate any means-tested ESA—as being
particularly excessive. Many people have built up those savings to give
them some protection against things that can happen—to the home,
for instance. I live in a city of many old, stone-built buildings. The
council wants to keep them in good repair and has a system of slapping
statutory notices on buildings from time to time to ensure that they
are. I have constituents who have received bills for such repairs
ranging from £5,000 to £26,000 in the year that I have
been in this House. That is the sort of contingency for which people
may have wanted to save. Other reasons for saving are retirement or to
guard against future illness. I would contend that the people whom we
are talking about are not necessarily particularly well off; they have
been careful and have made savings, or they are a couple who have both
worked, but are not necessarily on high
earnings.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000159">&#160;</a>

as a £52 return on £250, which is an interest rate of

benefits because of savings are finding that the opposite is the case.
We have to think about people who, in the case that we are considering,
are ill. Most people would accept that accidents and illness produce
additional costs. They also mean the end, at

of making future provision. When people lose their employment because
they are unfit to work, they lose not just their earnings, which may be
significant, but the opportunity to contribute to a pension scheme or a
savings scheme that they may have set up. At the same time, expenses
may increase.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
expenses may relate directly to the illness; people may have to use
their heating system more, because instead of being out at work for
much of the day, they are at home recuperating. Many people remark on
how much their energy bills go up by when they retire, but it is a
serious consideration when people are unwell, too. There may be
attendances at a hospital that is at some distance. There may be
special diets. There is a host of additional expenses that can be
incurred, as well as the loss of earnings. It is a double
whammy—a loss of earnings and of the potential to build up
savings, together with additional expenses. Before people have had the
opportunity to fully recover, the loss of the benefit kicks in because
of their savings or their partner’s income.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">People may
have savings, and that is why they are ineligible for the
income-related benefits, but the important point is that if they use up
those savings during that period when things are very expensive, their
future is badly affected. It is not just that they are using up that
money in the here and now; those future savings that they might have
had to assist them through later life will simply not be there. That
may mean that they have to make greater claims in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000163">&#160;</a>

day-to-day costs of people who are out of work due to illness will not
necessarily be reduced. I suggest that they will increase. Such people
will almost certainly still be paying rent or a mortgage or have other
household outgoings like that. If they had thought they were going to
be ill, those outgoings might have been lower, but having undertaken
those commitments, they still have to meet them when illness strikes.
If they cannot, they may have even further problems. Do they borrow
further to meet those commitments? Do they exhaust their savings to do
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000164">&#160;</a>

are talking about people at a particularly vulnerable time in their
lives. None of us knows when illness might strike. Those of us who have
been fortunate tend to think that it will never happen to us. I have
met many constituents who made exactly that point: “I never
expected it to happen to me, and here I am in this situation.” I
do not have the figures on this, and the number of people affected in
different age groups, but I suspect that many will be older, and their
opportunity to rebuild savings that are exhausted while they are
recovering from illness will be much more limited than those for
younger

and what the amendments seek to do is important. I accept that the
right hon. Member for East Ham has acknowledged the need for a time
limit. He is aware that the reason why we have made the 12-month
decision certainly has a strong financial dimension to it. Part of the
reason is to do with the fact that we have a huge financial challenge
to deal with. The difference between the provisions in the amendments
and those that we have introduced in the Bill and in the spending
review, which took place last year, is approximately
£1.2 billion over the spending review period. That is
the difference between the 12-month and two-year time limits. There is
also an additional £200 million cost in the spending review
period for some of the other measures that the right hon. Gentleman
proposes in the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000178">&#160;</a>

a valid or acceptable argument, and it would not have left us in a
position to restore the credibility that we need in the financial
markets. His proposals will, of course, be scrutinised in the context
of the external scrutiny that will take place over the course of this

right hon. Gentleman has made an extensive argument for the 12-month
time limit and about health conditions. I start from a different
perspective. We have time limits in the contributory
system—currently, we have a six-month time limit on contributory
jobseeker’s allowance—because we are dealing here with
people who have an alternative means of support, either through their
savings or the income of another person in the household. It is a
long-standing principle of our contributory system and the JSA system
that we allow those who have paid in to draw back out money for a
period of time, but that there is a limit to the amount that they can
draw out again. There has been an enormous inconsistency between JSA
and ESA and its predecessors, in that somebody who manages to get
themselves on to our sickness benefits is there indefinitely, whereas
somebody who is on JSA is there only temporarily. That creates a
perverse incentive in the system.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000182">&#160;</a>

estimate of the amount of time that it takes an individual to recover
from a health condition. That

			Column number: 651<a class="bkMark" name="Column651">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is not, in my view, the principle on which the system is based. We are
paying support, and will continue to do so, to those who have no other
financial means of it. However, if they have an alternative financial
means of support, there will be a limit to the amount of time that they
can draw extra funding from their contributions. In reality, we
estimate that about 60% of those caught up by the new time limit will
continue to receive ESA on an income-related basis. Of course, that
support is there, and many people will receive other forms of support
as well, through universal credit, the housing element, and some of the
disability support that is in place. If they have a partner working
full time, working tax credit may be paid in addition because of the
changes to the household income. There is a variety of different ways
in which people on low income can receive financial support from the
state. However, we are saying that in principle there should be a time
limit for the receipt of ESA.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We could
simply have taken the view that the six-month time limit is an accepted
part of the jobseeker’s system and that it should be replicated
across the benefit system. That is effectively a pay back. When people
pay their national insurance contributions, they pay towards a variety
of different support that they may receive. The national insurance
system will provide people with ongoing support if they find themselves
with no further means of it. For our income-related benefits, that
support will always be there. People also contribute, of course, to the
money that they receive through the state pension after they retire.
With JSA, we say that people who have paid contributions are entitled
to support even if they have other means of it, such as substantial
amounts of money in the bank or a partner earning a good income. They
will receive for six months a series of support payments in recognition
of contributions that they have
made.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We could
equally have said that that is an appropriate length of time for ESA.
This is not a question about how long it takes people to recover and
get into a job. The hon. Gentleman made reference to a training course.
It is not the case that our benefits system is there to support people
where there are extended training courses. That has never been the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> At the moment, we do not have a specific answer
to that, but I return to the point that this is not about recovery
times. It is not about a decision that 12 months is an appropriate time
for recovery. These are people who have other means of financial
support, so what we have sought to do in difficult times financially,
and by taking tough decisions, is to say, “Right, we need to
start to replicate in the ESA system the kind of approach we take in
the JSA system.” We have decided to set a 12-month time limit
rather than a six-month time limit in recognition of the fact that if
people face a health challenge it make take longer to sort out their
affairs and may even take longer than the two year period. This is one
of the tough decisions we need to take in government. We form a view
and try to achieve a sensible balance. It is not based on an estimate
of a typical recovery time, but on the principle that these are people
who have other means of financial support. In around 60% of cases we
expect people to need additional financial support through the
income-based system, which they will of course receive.<a class="bkMark" name="11050326000004">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
40% who fall outside the support mechanism that would exist for their
equivalent on JSA are expected, as the system has always provided, to
live off their other means. They may not qualify for income-related JSA
if, for example, they have capital of £16,000 or more. I would
say to the hon. Member for Edinburgh East that of course people put
aside money for a rainy day, to deal with challenges to their lives or
with the unexpected. It is surely not unreasonable for the state to
expect people to use some of that money when faced with that kind of
challenge. If they have a partner who works full time—the
definition is for 24 hours a week or more—they are expected to
live off that alternative income. However, that is not necessarily the
only income they will receive. Depending on their circumstances, they
may be eligible for support for mortgage interest, for housing benefit,
for working tax credit, and for other forms of state support.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Had we
listened to the right hon. Gentleman, we might imagine that these are
people for whom state support will disappear in a puff of smoke: there
will be no other alternative. The answer is that of course there are
other alternatives. We provide support for people on low household
incomes in various different ways. We will improve the system with the
introduction of universal credit. However, the reality is that these
are people who have alternative means of support. We have made a
decision to mirror the situation for JSA, but in recognition of the
fact that people with health issues need longer to sort out their
affairs, we have given a 12-month rather than a six-month time limit.
This is not related to recovery times or to estimates of how long it
takes to get over cancer. It is about the individual and the
household’s financial circumstances and whether they have other
means to support
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
range of support will be provided to people who are in the work-related
activity group. For example, one of the early decisions we made in
designing the Work programme was that there is a danger that some
people in the WRAG will fall through the net of the Work programme
because they will move off ESA(C), and there will not be a
corresponding benefit saving to enable us to fund the AME/DEL switch in
the Work programme. We have made specific provision in the budgeting
for the Work programme for those people to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 653<a class="bkMark" name="Column653">&#160;</a>
                           </div>volunteer if they choose to do so and continue to receive the specialist
support through the Work programme that they would not otherwise
receive because of the introduction of this measure.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will continue to provide support for people in the work-related
activity group through Jobcentre Plus. There is no reason why anybody
should fall through the net of back-to-work support as a result of the
measure, and we have been careful to ensure that that does not happen.
The right hon. Gentleman made a number of other points. He and my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff Central mentioned the assessment phase.
The work capability assessment typically takes place after
13 weeks and determines whether someone is entitled to ESA
and, if so, to which group they are
allocated.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have to be careful. I am genuinely concerned about the way in which the
assessment phase is being used. Having looked over the shoulder of
Jobcentre Plus employees to see the work they are doing with people at
that stage, I have seen one or two highly suspect claims. Now that the
Work programme contracting is out of the way and we have started the
ESA migration, one of the things I intend to do is look carefully at
the way in which we operate those first 13 weeks. As my hon. Friend
will have seen in the figures published last week, a disturbing number
of cases, almost 40% of claims, stop just
before—<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Has the Minister been able to provide a detailed
follow-up, or does he plan to provide one, on what happens to the often
quoted 40% of people? The implication in many press releases and
statements is that all such people are cheats who have withdrawn their
claim at the last minute because they realise that they are about to be
rumbled. That might be the case, I do not know. There is no clear
follow-up. Some people may have genuinely recovered and gone back to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000192">&#160;</a>

case—there will be a full back payment; if it is midway through
the 12 month process, there will be a payment in arrears and a payment
going forward, so nobody who appeals successfully will lose out

                        <p class="tabbed">Likewise,
my starting point is that I do not want people moving into and out of
the support group, because the implication would be that we have got
the decision-making process wrong. Professor Harrington’s work
on fluctuating conditions will create a stronger and more robust
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000200">&#160;</a>

the issues raised by my hon. Friend, my worry is that her amendments
would create an incentive to try to get back into the support group,
which would move people in the wrong way. Somebody in the WRAG will
have a financial incentive to try to get back into the support group,
whereas we want to help them to move back towards the workplace. I am
happy to make a commitment to go away and look at the issue that she
has raised and to come back to her. She has made some thoughtful
contributions, and we should take the time to look closely at what she
is suggesting. There is certainly time to see if the points that she
has raised have any implications for the way in which the Bill is put
together. I am happy to give her an undertaking to do so. Some of those
points were raised by the right hon.

                           </strong> I was coming to that. This is the way in which
our contributory system has worked. The six-month limit for JSA is
written into the Jobseekers Act 1995, and we are simply replicating
that situation in this Bill for ESA provision. It is standard practice,
and it is the right thing to do. This is a clear, long-term decision by
this Government, which we do not intend to vary. A future Government
may choose to reverse the decision, but it is absolutely consistent
with the way in which the other half of our contributory system works.
It is clearly open to a future Government to adopt a different view,
but whereas in most cases we need the flexibility to adjust, this is a
clear, long-term decision about how we should operate our contributory
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000203">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
address the other point that the right hon. Gentleman has raised, which
concerned young people. It seems to be an oddity that a young person
with a disability or a health challenge, regardless of their
circumstances, should automatically be able to migrate to contributory
ESA even if they have never worked. This may not have been debated
hotly in the past, but it is strange if somebody who reaches the age of
18 can 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 655<a class="bkMark" name="Column655">&#160;</a>
                           </div>simply enter the contributory system without ever having contributed.
Such young people have access to income-based ESA, which provides them
with the same level of support as contributory ESA, so we are not
telling them that there is no support for them.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Across
the board, for those who need financial support, none of these measures
takes away that financial support. It is important to stress and to
restress that. In all the cases that the right hon. Gentleman has set
out, and in all the cases that have been brought to us, if those people
have no other means of financial support, the support that we provide
them will continue. That is the case for those young people.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We estimate
that about 90% of the young people who can currently migrate to
contributory benefit are entitled to receive an income-based benefit
instead, so their situation will not change. It is only in the case of
those who have alternative financial means in their household that the
automatic passporting will not continue. That does no more than extend
the principles that we are applying across the contributory system to
that group of young people. It is not at all apparent why somebody who
reaches the age of 18 should simply be able to receive a
contribution-based benefit. We provide the safety net of the
income-based system, which will continue; this measure does not change
that. We want a simplified, streamlined system that provides support
where we think it is necessary, which is why we are making this
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The right hon.
Gentleman disagrees with us about this proposal, and I know that he
would have chosen not to make the reduction. We may disagree about the
emphasis that is required to deal with the deficit, but we have taken
what we think is the fairest possible approach in the context of these
financially difficult times. It is a tough decision, which we might not
have wished to be in a position to take, but this Government faces many
such decisions. In the context of those difficult decisions, we think
that this is a sensible measure; it is a sensible step forward, which
achieves a proper balance in a system that already includes time limits
for people who are out of work. On that basis, I urge the Committee to
reject the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000207">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That was a desperately inadequate response, and I
find it deeply depressing that the Minister’s only justification
for this provision is that saving money is a good thing. He has offered
us no evidence at all that one year is an adequate period. Indeed, he
has told us frankly that he does not know or care whether people can be
expected to get back to work in that period. This is purely a
cost-saving measure, and on that basis, I suppose, anything goes. I
presume it is a question of the shortest period of time the Government
can get away with, and that is reflected in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000208">&#160;</a>

the Minister does not feel any awkwardness about it, many who follow
our proceedings will. He did not mention the position of people with
mental health problems, although he has attempted to be understanding
of such issues in the past. The Minister has responsibility for the

I did not bring a full spending programme to present to the Committee,
and I do not think it would be pleased if I had done so. Let me make it
clear, however, that the amendment has the full authority of my
party’s leadership and it is the right thing to do. What is
being done in this legislation is wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000211">&#160;</a>

to the Committee? First, will he confirm that he did not know how much
the measures in his amendment would cost before he tabled it, and
secondly that according to his proposals he would have to increase
public borrowing to fund
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000212">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is true that the answer I cited arrived only
this morning, but other costs were published earlier by the Government.
Lord Freud wrote to the Committee a few days ago to point out that the
costings had all changed. I had evidence and information about the
costs of the amendment when it was tabled, but the Government changed
the situation. I do not criticise that; no doubt there was some
difficulty for the Government in establishing what the provision will
amount to. That is why the figures I gave this morning are
different—although not significantly different—from those
I had in mind when I tabled the amendment. The Government changed their
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000213">&#160;</a>

certainly does. I urge members of the Committee to support the

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">‘(3) The
Secretary of State shall ensure that the impact of subsection (1) is
independently monitored and reported on annually, for at least the five
years following its implementation, in order to review their impact on
specific groups of
people.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would require the Secretary of State to put in place a system
to monitor independently the effect of time limiting contributory ESA.
The Minister has been frank with us; he does not know how many people
will be affected. Slightly more surprisingly, he indicated that he does
not really care how long people will take to get back to work. He said
that that is not a matter of concern for
him.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is a major change and there is clearly strong disagreement in the
Committee about it. Those on the Government Benches argue that the
decision to limit ESA to one year will be fair and will not push people
into unnecessary hardship, but we cannot agree. All the evidence
indicates that one year is not enough for the majority of people who
lose their jobs through ill health to expect to get back into work.
That seems to be the only basis on which one can judge whether a year
is the right period. The Minister indicated that he does not think that
it is a significant consideration, but it seems to me that it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are dealing with many unknowns. We do not know how long it currently
takes people in the work-related activity group to enter work, although
it clearly seems to be more than a year. We do not know the full extent
of the barriers that people currently on incapacity benefit will face,
particularly if they received the benefit for many years. They will go
through the work capability assessment and on to ESA and the Work
programme, and we do not know how successful the Work programme will be
in supporting those individuals back into work. The assumption in the
tender documents for the Work programme seems to be that 9% of people
on incapacity benefit will get back into work within a year, but we do
not know what it will prove to be.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Time
limiting will have far-reaching effects on the lives of many people. I
would prefer the response to the unknowns to have been a more careful
and cautious approach, but at the very least we should ensure that we
can review the impact of the policy properly in future, because policy
making should be based on evidence and reflect the position of the
individuals whom it will affect. If we had legislated for a two-year
time limit, we would have put in place a proper review to ensure that
we could respond in future as new information became available. That is
why we argued for the length of the time limit to be determined through
regulations. We all know the effect of a six-month time limit on
contributory JSA; we do not know the effect of a one-year time limit on
ESA, so I do not accept the Minister’s argument that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 658<a class="bkMark" name="Column658">&#160;</a>
                           </div>because it was done in that way for JSA, it is all right to do it for
ESA. Had the evidence suggested that two years was too short—as
the hon. Member for Meon Valley suggested it might be—we should
certainly have wanted the flexibility to extend the
period.</p>

pm<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000247">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would require the Secretary of State to implement a review
process. I hope that the Minister will see the attractions of that, and
I like to think he might support it. I will quickly run through the
characteristics of the review process that the amendment suggests.
First, it should be independent. All Committee members will have
received representations on behalf of disabled people and people with
health impairments who are very anxious about the Government’s
proposals. It is important that they have confidence in the review
process if, as I hope, we have one. I have in mind something along the
lines of the review of the work capability assessment that Professor
Harrington carried out for the Government, which the Minister welcomed,
endorsed, and supported, as did groups supporting disabled people. I do
not want to be too prescriptive, but it may be that some other form of
review—such as through official statistics—might be
appropriate, but it must be
independent.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the review should report annually, though, depending on the design of
the review process, it may be that it should report more frequently. I
think that it should report at least annually, and should continue for
at least five years. The Government intend to set a very short period
of eligibility for contributory ESA. People will be affected by the
changes very quickly, and we will need information and data about those
effects. We have already established that, although ESA has been in
place for almost three years, there are some very important statistics
about its effects that we do not know, so the amendment calls for the
review to report for at least five years, by which time we can be
confident that the necessary information will be available. We will
then be able to assess the effectiveness of this change beyond the
initial transition
period.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
the amendment calls for the review to monitor the impact on specific
groups of people. I have in mind the impact on different types of
disability and health impairment. It may well be that the time limit is
particularly inappropriate for people with certain conditions, and if
there is—as I suspect—a good case for extending the time
limit for people suffering from specific conditions then we need to
know, and the review must tell us. The Committee is sharply divided on
the merits of those provisions as they stand, but I hope that we all
agree that policy making should be based on evidence, and that it is
right for us to take steps to obtain the crucial evidence required to
evaluate the change and its future
effects.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000250">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> First, I completely agree with the right hon.
Gentleman on the need to monitor the impact of policy and understand
the effect of the changes that we make. In reality, however, I do not
believe that it is necessary to put the kind of complex process he
describes—with all the inevitable costs—in place for a
change such as this. As a matter of routine, we monitor the impact of
all our policies, as he did when he held his position in the
Department. We use 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 659<a class="bkMark" name="Column659">&#160;</a>
                           </div>evidence on the experiences and outcomes of the affected groups from
several sources. All that information is published very openly, and can
accessed by the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, or by
independent groups looking at these issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We use
administrative datasets to monitor trends in the ESA case loads and in
the level and distribution of benefit entitlement. We use survey data,
such as the family resources and labour force survey, to assess trends
in the incomes of those affected. We will use qualitative research and
feedback from stakeholder groups to assess whether there are unintended
consequences and whether the policy results in adverse consequences for
particular groups. We will also use feedback from departmental employee
networks and internal management information. So, for example, we will
monitor the level of appeals and complaints in order to assess the
broader impact of the policy.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the Work
programme, we will have clear understanding of those people who come
through on an ESA(C) basis because they fall under a specific category
within the contracting of the Work programme. We will draw on broader
DWP research work, where appropriate, as well as any research
commissioned specifically as part of the evaluation of the measure. We
collect all that data and if we were to find the resources to pay for a
separate, independent assessment process, it would cost a few hundred
thousand pounds. That is the equivalent of a handful of jobs in
Jobcentre Plus. Right now my goal has been to keep the monitoring
process to the level that is necessary to deliver the information that
we need, but not to over-engineer, because over-engineering in reality
means job cuts elsewhere in the organisation—the jobs of those
who could otherwise provide real support to people on benefits and
those we want to help move back into the workplace.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am therefore
afraid that I cannot accept the right hon. Gentleman’s
amendment. There is no question but that we will monitor the impact of
these changes. We will know and understand their consequences. However,
let me take him back. He talks about the need to have a structured
system around specific conditions. Clearly, those people in the support
group will continue to receive support. There has never been any
question about that. However, for the work-related activity group, the
issue is what the alternative financial resources available to the
household are, not the nature of the condition. That is the basis on
which we have approached this and it will continue to be
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000254">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Many of us feel that a time limit on ESA needs to
be justified on the basis that most people can expect to be back in
work before it expires. The Minister has suggested that he would favour
the shortest period he can get away with. Many of us would not agree
with that and feel that analysis and evidence is needed. However, the
Minister has given us some modest encouragement that the Government
will monitor the effects of this change, so I will not press the
amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

                           </strong> The amendments relate to lone parents in receipt of
income support and the age of their youngest child in terms of the
requirements placed on them under the new conditionality regime. After
I had tabled the amendments, I received a helpful briefing from the
Department about lone parents on training courses, but it would be
useful if we could have some clarity from the Minister about exactly
what is intended.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
extremely difficult for a lone parent on day one of their child
starting school to put everything in place so that they can participate
fully in work preparation activities, go out to employment or undertake
a course of education or training. However, we know that undertaking
relevant and effective programmes of education or training
significantly improves the propensity of lone parents to secure and
remain in sustainable employment that genuinely lifts them and their
children out of poverty. I think that Members on both sides of the
House feel very strongly and positively about the difference that can
be made to families, in terms of employment outcomes and long-term
prosperity, if lone parents access good-quality education and training
that leads them into work, rather than that is undertaken for the sake
of it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously,
when a lone parent has a child who is too young to go to school, their
attention is likely to be predominantly towards child care. That is why
the Government’s proposals on conditionality for lone parents
kick in when the youngest child reaches the age of five. I say in
passing that I am worried that a lone parent is expected to do a lot on
day one when her child starts school. Most of us would be very
reluctant to start a new job on the same day that our child went to
school for the first time. There would be a lot to organise to put in
place child care and to ensure that the child was happy and settled
while one’s own attention was on one’s new employment. I
am sure, however, that there will be in practice a more flexible and
imaginative approach to the expectations placed on lone parents on the
day that their youngest child turns five, although I would be pleased
to hear the Minister’s assurances about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is quite likely that a lone parent will want to embark on the steps
towards work at the moment her youngest child is in full-time school.
Indeed, that is very much the grain of the Government’s
proposals. It is likely that many lone parents will use the first
period in which their youngest child begins school to start refreshing

                           </div>their skills, which could be seriously out of date if they have had a
long period out of the workplace while caring for children, and
preparing to return to the workplace, perhaps by trying to achieve the
qualifications that would be more likely to lead them into good
prospects and sustainable work. The amendments would allow for that
period of preparing for work through undertaking good-quality education
or training, thereby offering the lone parent a realistic opportunity
to undertake such education or training that would make a meaningful
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendments
suggest that two years would a period during which educational training
would enable a lone parent properly to be competitive and attractive in
the labour market so that she could secure the kind of good job that
would lift her family out of poverty. Rather than requiring a lone
parent who is undertaking education or training to be subject to full
conditionality when her youngest child turns five, I propose that there
should be a period during which she may successfully and effectively
complete that training before she is subject to the fuller
conditionality that the Government intend to
introduce.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000265">&#160;</a>

regarding lone parents on income support who are in education or
training. It would be useful to understand whether that will apply to
lone parents who are currently in education or training, or whether it
is to be read across in the long run. I would be grateful to hear the
Minister’s views on whether there is an expectation that lone
parents will undertake education or training in the first couple of
years after their youngest child turns five, given that we all
recognise the importance of good-quality education or training and the
significant benefits that it can
bring.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000266">&#160;</a>

                           </span> It is good to be able to make an active
contribution to our proceedings, which my right hon. Friend the
Minister of State has conducted so well up to this point. The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston has made some extremely important
points, and there is a great deal of shared ground on the importance of
work for lone and coupled parents. I am glad that she has found the
Department’s briefing notes for Opposition Members so
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000269">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 172
would enable lone parents with a youngest child between the ages of
five and seven to remain entitled to income support if they are
undertaking education or training. Amendment 173 relates to mandatory
work-related activity for certain lone parents whose youngest child is
under seven.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
set out well what the amendments would achieve. She will be aware that
transitional protection was applied to the regulations that were
introduced progressively to reduce the age of the youngest child that
enabled lone parents to be entitled to income 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 662<a class="bkMark" name="Column662">&#160;</a>
                           </div>support. Such protection applied to full-time students or those
following a full-time course of study arranged by Jobcentre Plus prior
to that change, meaning that they could remain on income support. I
assure the hon. Lady and other members of the Committee that when the
new changes are introduced and we lower the age threshold to five, a
similar arrangement will apply. A lone parent whose youngest child
turns five will remain entitled to income support if they are
undertaking such activity until their youngest child is seven or their
course finishes, whichever comes first. Lone parents whose youngest
child is five or older who want to claim benefit after the transitional
protection ends will have to claim JSA if they are capable of work, or
ESA if they have limited work capability, in the same way as other lone
parents with children of school age.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That does not
mean that lone parents cannot access training—far from it. We
are keen to give all the support that is required to update skills and
to ensure that training is in place for lone parents who are in receipt
of ESA, JSA or income support. If, after discussion with their personal
advisers at Jobcentre Plus, it is identified that access to
work-related training could improve lone parents’ employability,
they will be able to apply from day one. That is really important. For
those claiming JSA and ESA, the support will be available via Jobcentre
Plus contracted provision or, if they are eligible, through the Work
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Lady will be aware, lone parents who are in receipt of income support
are required to attend work-focused interviews. Their personal adviser
will encourage them to access work-related training to improve their
job prospects in readiness for them to move on to JSA or, it is hoped,
into employment. That allows the lone parent to think about work early
on, and it is consistent with the previous Government’s
intentions in the area. JSA is not available to people undertaking
full-time education that is not work-related, although it possible for
claimants to undertake part-time training and education if they are
still able to show that they are actively seeking and available for
work. Jobseekers may also undertake up to two weeks’ full-time
training in any 12-month period with the agreement of their personal
adviser.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With regard to
amendment 173, the provision to allow for work-related activity for
lone parents with children whose youngest child is three was put on the
statute book by the previous Government. While we are not intending to
use that legislation at the moment, we can see a virtue in retaining it
as a way of future-proofing employment support for this group. The hon.
Lady’s intentions are similar to those we discussed with regard
to amendment 172: to provide that lone parents who have a child under
seven and are on training courses should be exempt from the requirement
to undertake activities and to look or prepare for work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The protection
that the hon. Lady proposes for this group is unnecessary for a number
of reasons. If the requirement were ever to be introduced, we would
ensure that there was sufficient flexibility to accommodate lone
parents’ individual circumstances with regard to work-related
training and other activities. That would cover any training that they
were undertaking. If that were not the case, we could not achieve our
objective of enabling lone parents to update their skills in a way that
helps them to find employment. That said, it is possible 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 663<a class="bkMark" name="Column663">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to imagine circumstances in which an existing course has no prospect of
improving someone’s employability. In such cases, I imagine
there would need to be negotiations between the lone parent and their
adviser to examine such things as the remaining duration of the course
and its effect on their job search. We will gain more experience
through the work being undertaken on the Work programme by my right
hon. Friend the Minister of State, through which certain people
claiming ESA will undertake mandatory work-related
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lone
parents with young children face different circumstances. Such barriers
relate to caring rather than health, but there will be common elements
from which we can learn. We will include such learning in the support
materials and regulations that will be brought forward when dealing
with previous welfare provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that I
have reassured the hon. Lady that we have the shared intention of
supporting lone parents to stay close to the workplace by ensuring that
they have the right support. If they are undertaking training at the
time, they can have the sort of protection for which she is asking.
Having received my reassurances, I hope that she will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000277">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for those helpful and
encouraging assurances on lone parents’ education and training,
and their requirement to be available for work. It is welcome that the
Minister strongly shares our belief in the value of good-quality
employment-related education and training in improving lone
parents’ long-term prospects. It was good to hear her say that
she does not envisage activating existing provisions on lone parents
with much younger children. On the basis of those welcome assurances
and what the Minister calls a shared understanding of what we wish to
achieve, particularly on education and training for lone parents, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000278">&#160;</a>

She will take some comfort from the <em>Hansard</em> report of a debate

intended to call the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr Cameron) but

                        <p class="tabbed">I wish
briefly—I stress that I will be brief—to set out the
reason why clause 59 is in the Bill. It repeals provisions introduced
under the Welfare Reform Act 2009 relating 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 664<a class="bkMark" name="Column664">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to JSA and ESA claimants who are dependent on drugs if their dependency
affects their prospects of obtaining or remaining in work. As
constituency Members, we all know about drug and alcohol addiction
problems; there are 400,000 problem drug users and 630,000 severe
alcoholics. The problem is still growing, and an effective action
strategy is a priority for the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The provisions
that we are repealing allowed regulations to be made to expect
Jobcentre Plus advisers to question individuals about drug use and
mandated claimants to undertake activities that included assessments
and even drug testing. Any failure to comply would have led to
sanctions. Drug users who refused to take up treatment would have been
subject to mandatory rehabilitation programmes, and the provisions
included powers to deal similarly with alcohol problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That approach
was heavily criticised by medical professionals and experts in drug
rehabilitation because it put Jobcentre Plus advisers in the role of
medics, and we would all be concerned about mandatory rehabilitation.
The previous Government planned to pilot regulations under the 2009 Act
that would have applied to heroin and crack cocaine users in five
locations in England. Last summer, we reviewed those plans and decided
that the pilots did not meet our aims and ambitions. They were too
narrowly focused, impractical and expensive.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We all agree
that drug and alcohol addictions are among the most damaging roots of
poverty. They cause untold harm and misery for individuals and their
families, and for communities. The difference is that this Government
are committed to helping people who are trapped on benefits by their
addiction to recover and to find employment. Many ex-addicts say that
getting a job was a key factor in sustaining their recovery. In our
drugs strategy, which we published last December, we outlined our first
steps to ensure that the benefit system supports effective engagement
with recovery services, which is more successful than coercion. When
substance misuse is a barrier to work, claimants will be offered a
choice. If they go into structured treatment, they will be able to get
their benefit conditions tailored to allow them time and space to focus
on their treatment and recovery. We are aware that benefit
conditionality, particularly in the jobseeker’s regime, can
sometimes hinder that process, and we want the benefit system to
support the individual to stick to their treatment plan and strive for
full recovery, rather than to distract them from it. However, if they
do not take up treatment, they will be expected to sign up to the
normal rules to receive benefits. Under the new approach, the effects
of substance misuse will not be accepted as an excuse for any failure
to meet the
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will be introducing the new arrangements in jobseeker’s
allowance and ESA by making regulations under other existing powers.
The provisions in the 2009 Act are inappropriate for that purpose and
will not be used, which is why we are repealing them. We will also make
similar arrangements in the universal credit, so Parliament will have
the opportunity to consider the details. We felt that it was important
to set out why we were repealing these particular provisions and to
underline the Government’s commitment in this area so that
people have clarity on our
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000290">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>My remarks will also relate to clauses 61
and 62 as we consider the proposal to take away entitlement to benefits
from people whose immigration status does not allow them to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000294">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention behind the provisions is to prevent illegal workers from
claiming contributory benefits—benefits for which entitlement is
based on national insurance contributions paid in past tax
years—and employment-related benefits. I draw that conclusion
from the impact assessment that the Government published in February.
My concern is that the measures would not achieve that intention.
Instead of disqualifying people who are working illegally—in
other words those who, at the point of paying national insurance
contributions, did not have the right to work—they in fact
disqualify people who do not have the right to work at the point that
they are claiming benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="1105037000295">&#160;</a>

                           </div>identify whether people were illegal workers at the time they were
paying national insurance contributions. The option of excluding people
who do not have the right to work while they are actually working was
necessarily discounted, but I understand that the provisions will have
an impact on people who have worked completely legally and paid
national insurance legitimately in the past because they will be denied
benefit. Such people might be asylum seekers who were given a right to
work because of a delay in deciding their application, although I
understand that the Department is considering the possibility of
exceptions and that it might make regulations for that group. The
situation might apply to people who had the right to work for a
particular employer but then either left or lost that employment and
were applying to change employment. It might apply to people who were
applying for their leave to remain to be renewed or their status to be
changed, which could arise in all sorts of circumstances. People who
have worked legally and paid contributions in the past could, under the
Bill, be left with no source of support while they wait for a UK Border
Agency decision in relation to their application.
