<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/013/2000013.htm">Carers and Disabled Children Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Pendry </B>(Stalybridge and Hyde): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Carers and Disabled Children Bill, the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I begin by expressing our appreciation of the fact that you will be the Chairman during our proceedings, Mr. Stevenson. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all members of the Committee. It is customary for Members to make such remarks from the Front Bench, but my words are sincerely meant. I have known you since you entered the House in 1992, and in that time I have known you to be a fair and dedicated House of Commons man. I am sure that those qualities will be in evidence during our proceedings today.
<P>
I must say, as an aside, how much I felt for you and for your parliamentary colleagues who represent Stoke-on-Trent and its neighbouring constituencies last week, on the occasion of the funeral of that great wizard of the dribble, Sir Stanley Matthews. I am sure that all your colleagues understand the shock felt by your constituents at their loss. Sir Stanley was a personal friend of mine, and I know how deeply loved he was in his native potteries, and how much he loved the people there.
<P>
About a hundred years ago I used to pilot Bills through the House as a Minister, but this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of introducing a private Member's Bill. If my rustiness shows, Mr. Stevenson, I will rely on your good nature to show me tolerance and understanding, which are virtues that I know that you possess. This is a truly all-„party measure, as was demonstrated on Second Reading, when Members in all parts of the House spoke in favour of it. I am very appreciative of that. I regret the absence from our proceedings of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), who was so helpful on that occasion, but I am pleased that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) is here in his place. I am sure that she will be equally accommodating.
<P>
It is right and proper that several issues should be debated, and clarification sought. I am no expert on the finer details of the various Acts relating to social services, or on how they impact on the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister, who has recently been generous in assisting me, will assist as we proceed—assuming that he catches your eye, Mr. Stevenson. I recognise, too, the assistance that the Carers National Association and other carers' organisations have given me.
<P>
The Second Reading debate went so well because all Members on both sides of the House are conscious that the carers in our society are valuable. Carers' needs are rightly recognised by all, as they do vital work in our constituencies. If the Bill becomes law by the end of the Session, it will be a victory for Parliament, which will be seen in a better light than has often been the case of late. I will say no more, because I want to make progress today. I commend the sittings motion to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): As a newcomer to the discussion on the Bill, may I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry) on his success in the private Members' ballot, and on choosing this subject? I know that that is a convention of the House, but as a relatively new Member I sometimes feel that one should commiserate with an hon. Member on the work load that ensues when they are successful in the private Member's Bills ballot. We recognise that promoting a Bill entails a great deal of conscientious effort on the part of the Member concerned. I imagined myself in the shoes of the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, and I was mindful of the pressures that he has been under recently because of the tragic events in his constituency. I thought that it was a lot for him to have to cope with promoting the Bill as well as having to attend to the needs of his constituents, probably even more assiduously than usual.
<P>
It is a pleasure to serve under you for the first time, Mr. Stevenson. I look forward to being gently corrected by you, as I am still a relatively new Front Bencher and I can get the procedures wrong at times. I shall watch attentively for your guidance.
<P>
I did not participate on Second Reading, but I read that debate in preparation for the Committee and was struck by the quality of all the contributions. The debate gave hon. Members the opportunity, which was perhaps long overdue, to make public their appreciation for the role played by all carers in our society. But for their good will and love for those whom they look after, a considerable bill would land on the desk of the Secretary of State for Health. Perhaps that is a mercenary view, but it is realistic. The contribution of carers to the way in which needs are met in the community is invaluable.
<P>
The pressure to meet those needs can only become greater, given modern working methods. I could not help but note that 58 per cent. of women are carers, but as women increasingly go out to work, it becomes harder to do the job of caring. Inevitably, the state will end up shouldering more of the burden, and we shall be even more dependent on those who are prepared to make the sacrifice—it very often is a sacrifice—of taking on the vital role of caring.
<P>
Our debate on the sittings motion may be a good time to comment on two points, which might not be dealt with in today's debate and which I would not want to be out of order for raising. On Second Reading, two main issues arose. I believe that there will be no need for the Opposition to table amendments on those subjects, because the Government have taken on board the issues that caused concern in that debate. The first was charging. The Minister may speak about that, and so I will not raise our concerns, even in a stand part debate.
<P>
The second issue is that parents of children under 16 do not come within the provisions of the Bill, and they are still finding it extremely difficult to receive help as carers under the Children Act 1989. The Minister may also speak about that, but I wanted to raise it at the outset to show that I have not disregarded the issue. However, I recognise that the Government have taken on board the contributions made on Second Reading and that they will respond to them separately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I associate myself with the comments made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson, and looking forward to serving under your chairmanship. This is an important private Member's Bill, and, as I did on Second Reading, I congratulate the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde on selecting the subject. The hon. Member for Meriden referred to two important issues and I look forward to hearing the Minister's statements about them in due course. We have tabled a couple of starred amendments on charging, but if the Minister deals adequately with matters, I will not have to move them. I am sure that we will have enough time and sufficient sittings to do the Bill justice and to ensure that it delivers what the hon. Gentleman rightly seeks.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Carers and Disabled Children Bill, the Committee do<P>
</UL></FONT> meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must inform members of the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. Adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Right of carers to assessment</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 13, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) The Secretary of State (or, in relation to Wales, the National Assembly for Wales) shall issue guidance to local authorities as to how they are to satisfy themselves as required by subsection (1) above in cases where the person cared for has refused assessment.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is separate from the second set of amendments. I am pleased that they have not been grouped together, because amendment No. 4 relates to an assessment of a cared-for person, whereas amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 relate to assessment of the carer. It is therefore right that the two groups should be separate.
<P>
This is a probing amendment, which would require the Secretary of State to issue guidance to local authorities on how to satisfy themselves that carers regularly provided a substantial amount of care and ensure that such an assessment had regard to a person's ability to provide care. There could be practical problems unless the clause is amended. Realistically, it could be difficult to carry out an assessment without practical guidance. The assessment of a cared-for person would have to be undertaken at arm's length, so to speak, if the person refused to allow an assessment to be made. That would mean that local authorities might have to take things on trust. How could an objective assessment be made at arm's length? Without adequate guidance, would the cared-for person feel that such an assessment was intrusive? Would such an assessment have to rely on a standard estimate of what was required for a particular condition? Without guidance, the right to assessment could result in a strain on the relationship between the carer and the person receiving care. That point came out on Second Reading.
<P>
Providing the right to assessment will arouse a level of expectation, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) said on Second Reading. We are concerned that those expectations could be exaggerated unless the right to assessment is accompanied by guidance. That should include the capacity for local authorities to revisit the question of the cared-for person's needs and the carer's ability to provide for them, because, as the explanatory notes to clause 1 say, the assessment needs to consider the ability of the carer ``to continue to provide'' care.
<P>
One problem that befalls carers—this is no doubt one reason why the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde introduced the Bill—is that they become burnt out. Although an assessment may establish that a carer is coping with a low level of support, the carer may, without any appreciable deterioration in the cared-for person's condition, become less able to meet that person's needs. In addition, the condition of the cared-for person may deteriorate. Unfortunately, many people who require care have conditions that deteriorate over time, hence the need to revisit the assessment. I hope that the guidance that we seek would contain that provision.
<P>
Such guidance would also help to ensure consistency in standards of care, and the Minister made it clear on Second Reading that he was concerned about that. I am sure that we all want standards of care to be, as far as possible, uniform throughout the country. Someone in one local authority area may compare notes with relatives or friends in another local authority area only to find that provisions vary. That is unacceptable and leaves the carer feeling badly done by. I hope that guidance will reinforce consistency in standards of care, so that such variation can be avoided.
<P>
Without such guidance, how will local authorities determine accurately at arm's length whether the cared-for person qualifies? Will the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde describe the circumstances in which an assessment would be carried out without guidance? Calling for guidance from the Secretary of State would place more responsibility on central Government to solve the problem of arm's-length assessment.
<P>
It is somewhat unfair to ask local authorities to solve that problem without guidance. It is a Government responsibility to give clear guidelines on how such assessments are to be carried out, so that there is not a wide disparity between the methodologies used by different local authorities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for her kind words when she spoke on the sittings motion. I appreciate the way in which she moved the amendment, because clarification and some consistency are needed. I understand that the amendment is intended to ensure that local authorities are given guidance on how to decide whether the cared-for person is someone for whom they may provide community care services under the appropriate legislation, if the person being cared for has refused an assessment.
<P>
The Secretary of State can issue guidance to local authorities under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, and in the exercise of their social services functions, local authorities must act under the general guidance of the Secretary of State. I have been assured that if the Bill receives Royal Assent, the Department of Health, under section 7 policy guidance, will issue practice guidance on its implementation.
<P>
I am sure that that commitment will satisfy the hon. Lady, and it is not new; it was given by my hon. Friend the Minister of State on Second Reading. Where a disabled person has refused assessment, a local authority will wish to satisfy itself that the carer is caring for someone for whom it may provide, or arrange for the provision of, community care services according to local eligibility criteria. Again, I have been assured by the Department of Health that it will give some examples of how local authorities may be satisfied for the purposes of meeting the conditions in clause 1.
<P>
As the hon. Lady said, the cared-for person who is refusing the assessment could have been referred for assessment in one of the usual ways—by a local general practitioner, a district nurse or some other medical professional. Information will be available from those sources about his or her needs. Referrals from GPs, carers support centres or carers voluntary organisations would often be sufficient reason for the authority to approach the cared-for person to ascertain whether he or she were willing to be assessed, and if not, to gather enough supported evidence from the carer to make a reasonable judgment.
<P>
The issue has been thought through since Second Reading, and there is no need to mention guidance in the Bill. My hon. Friend the Minister may wish to clarify the details further. I hope that the Committee will consider that the amendment is not worth pressing to a vote, and that the hon. Lady will, on reflection, withdraw it.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton) rose—[Interruption.]</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whose is that bleeper?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): Sir, I apologise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To use parliamentary language, knock it off, please. Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Some speeches may be worth waiting for, Mr. Stevenson, but this one may not be.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden has raised several wider questions in speaking to the amendment, so it may be helpful if I set one or two things on the record, so that the Committee will be aware of the Government's thinking on those important issues.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde dealt comprehensively with the concerns that the hon. Lady raised in connection with the commitment to issue guidance for local authorities. Given the nature of the Bill, we have always accepted that there is an obvious need for local authorities to have the fullest guidance available, especially in the circumstances that both my hon. Friend and the hon. Lady have mentioned.
<P>
When a cared-for person is refusing an assessment, the situation can be complex. Obviously, it is our intention—and, I am sure, that of local authorities, too—to enable the best judgments to be made about the care and support services that it is felt appropriate to provide for the carers. We shall issue guidance covering all the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde raised.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden spoke about variations in standards—another issue that goes to the grain of all our concerns. We all accept that variations do occur We have seen examples in our constituencies and have talked to colleagues in the House, and we are aware of other examples of local authorities often providing different solutions to similar problems. All of us who care about social services begin from the proposition that that is unacceptable. Just as we are anxious to ensure that there is consistency between standards and models of care provided to patients in national health service, health authorities and trusts, so it is with social services, because social services and the NHS form one care system. Inconsistencies are unacceptable to both the NHS and social services.
<P>
A number of initiatives of which the hon. Member for Meriden may not be aware are on the way. I hope that they will make a difference in the near future. We hope to consult later in the year about new guidance to local authorities on how they can achieve greater consistency in their local eligibility criteria. The hon. Lady mentioned her concerns, which we share. We have worked with some local authorities in the past year to refine and develop the guidance that we hope to issue later this year. I cannot be specific about precisely when it will be issued. I am not trying to be secretive. A fair amount of work needs to be done. This is a complex area. There are 150 local authority eligibility rules. We are attempting to achieve greater consistency between them and relate that to long-term care eligibility criteria for the NHS.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley </B>(South-West Surrey): I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comments about guidance because I am sure that it is time for further clarification of guidance on community care and relatively recent social services legislation. I do not wish to be provocative or unduly controversial, but may I ask the Minister whether the guidance will have regard to resources? The hon. Gentleman knows that an acute problem in prosperous areas of the country on account of the funding squeeze allows only the most minimal services to be provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is not the right hon. Lady's style to be provocative and I do not regard her question in that light. Resources will be dealt with as part of the Government's current spending review exercise, and announcements will be made later in the summer. We have had this exchange previously in a number of settings. The Government are making additional resources of £500 million available to local authorities this year in the spending review: that is more than 5 per cent. cash growth and more than 3 per cent. real-terms growth in local authorities' social services spending. But I assure the right hon. Lady that future resources for social services will be dealt with in the spending review.
<P>
The other initiative of which members of the Committee may wish to be aware in relation to consistency and commonality in social services' approach is that, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in October, we are committed to publishing a new quality Green Paper on social services later in the year which will outline ways of providing better guidance to local authorities, as we do for the NHS in relation to cost-effective quality social care interventions. There is a strong need for this guidance on social care, as there is for guidance on health care. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence will provide the latter. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has floated the possibility of a new social care institute of excellence that would perform a similar range of functions for social services.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has covered fully the issues relating to the amendment. The wider issue of how to develop greater consistency in social services is being addressed by the two initiatives that I mentioned. I hope that the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley) and other members of the Committee will be reassured that the Government are serious about addressing the present unacceptable state of affairs. We have proposed at least two measures to deal directly with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Sylvia Heal </B>(Halesowen and Rowley Regis): I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure me on two points. I ought to declare an interest, as I was employed by the Carers National Association for several years.
<P>
First, will the guidance issued to local authorities make it clear that carers of people with all sorts of disabilities, including the mentally ill, will be covered? Secondly, the Minister will be aware that one of the greatest difficulties faced by carers is a lack of information, particularly about their rights under existing legislation such as the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995. Will he consider including in the guidance to local authorities information regarding their duties and responsibilities to carers? An assessment should be made of those carers who are providing regular and substantial amounts of care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, I think that I can provide my hon. Friend with the assurances that she seeks, although I obviously cannot write the guidance today. I do not wish to pre-empt the question of what exactly the guidance will say, but my hon. Friend has made a fair point about the importance of the assessment procedure, which provides the gateway into receiving the care, support, advice and information that local authorities and other agencies can provide to carers and, indeed, to the cared-for person. My answer to my hon. Friend is yes, we want the guidance issued to local authorities to be as comprehensive as possible. I hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured by that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> We have had a very helpful exchange on the amendment, which has helped to evoke some of the crucial wider themes in the Bill. I was reassured to hear the Minister confirm that he intends to issue guidance to local authorities,and he immediately flagged up an important point about the attempt to ensure consistency through guidance. The problem of variation in funding arises. As stated by the hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>according to the Carers National Association, one year after the 1995 Act was implemented, three quarters of authorities said that lack of funding had restricted their ability to implement the legislation.—[Official Report, 4 February 2000; Vol. 343, c. 1365.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has done us a good service in bringing realism into the debate. Guidance may be issued but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey said, variation in funding will be an Achilles' heel in the attempt to achieve consistency of standards. I am nevertheless reassured on the matter of guidance, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, 23, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 3, in page 1, line 24, leave out `or' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1, in page 1, leave out lines 25 and 26.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> As I said earlier, these amendments are a separate set, which deal with assessment for the carer. They are probing amendments and I hope that they will raise and refine important issues about issues surrounding the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 may seem a small change—from ``may'' to ``shall''—but it is important because it strengthens the requirement on the Secretary of State to give directions about the manner in which an assessment is made. It would make it less optional for the Secretary of State to do so and begs the question of who is really in charge in making the assessment. Will the process be controlled by the Secretary of State or will the power rest with local authorities? As long as that remains unclear, there is a danger of conflict. For example, will there be penalties if the local authority lacks the resources to carry out a proper assessment? By reinforcing the Secretary of State's powers to give direction, the proposal makes the position clearer.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would remove the potential for conflict of local authority powers to decide the appropriate form and manner of assessment co-existing with the powers residing with the Secretary of State, who ``may'' give direction. For example, if local authorities are inundated with demands for assessment, which is possible, they may need to change the form and manner of such assessments. There may be many variations in the form and manner of multi-agency assessments. For that reason, and to clarify the position, we advocate that the word ``may'' should be changed to ``shall''.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 3 is also important; it reduces the option of dealing either with the form or the manner of the assessment, but calls for both to be subject to clear direction. There may be disputes or complaints about how such assessments are made. For example, if, from the carer's point of view, there is a negative conclusion that extra help is not needed when an assessment is carried out, the form and manner of that assessment will be the subject of considerable scrutiny by the carer. We know that when other assessments are carried out by social services, of special educational needs, for example, and the carers believe that the conclusion is unsatisfactory, there is often a dispute about the outcome which eventually leads to a tribunal.
<P>
These are minor and probing amendments, which are designed to ensure that we learn from experience, that conflict is removed from the assessment process, that direction is clearly given by the Secretary of State and that both the form and the manner of the assessment are considered as needing direction, guidance and clarity, for the avoidance of disputes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Meriden again for tabling the amendment. The wording of clause 1(4), however, mirrors part of section 1(4) of the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995. It is designed to give the Secretary of State powers to give directions on the manner in which assessments are to be carried out, or the form that they should take. The powers mean that the Secretary of State can issue directions on one or both of those aspects or on neither. Clause 1(5) makes it clear, however, that there is scope for a local authority to innovate.
<P>
The amendments would require the Secretary of State to give directions about both the form and manner of the carers' assessments under the Bill and remove local authorities' flexibility to develop good practice. As I said on Second Reading, one of the Bill's great virtues is its flexibility; it would be less flexible if the amendments were accepted.
<P>
On Royal Assent, the Department of Health will issue section 7 policy guidance, and practice guidance on implementation, which will help local authorities informally to develop good practice. As with other aspects of the social services, the Department will monitor how local authorities implement the Carers and Disabled Children Bill by means of the performance assessment framework, social services inspections and joint reviews by the social services inspectorate and the Audit Commission. I am assured that most legislation that refers to regulation-making powers is drafted in this way and does not commonly place a duty on the Secretary of State to issue regulations. Innovation from local authority social services departments is important because it is the mechanism by which good practice develops. The development of good practice feeds into future guidance from the Department of Health. There is nothing to be gained by restricting the continued development of good practice. I hope that the Committee will recognise that this flexibility is necessary and will reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Do you intend to take a clause stand part debate on this or would it be in order for me to make some remarks slightly broader than the terms of the amendment now?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I intend to take a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In that case, I will confine myself entirely to the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that you will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is why I raised the point of order first, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde said, the amendments remove any opportunity for local authorities to innovate and have some discretion. I agree with the hon. Member for Meriden that the Bill needs to be tweaked or tightened slightly to move on from the previous carers legislation on the question of whether the Secretary of State ``may'' or ``shall'' issue guidance. There needs to be a sense of urgency that guidance will be issued. It is also appropriate to link the form and content of such assessments. I agree with the hon. Lady about the need to issue guidance that gives a greater impetus to multi-disciplinary assessments.
<P>
There are shining examples of best practice where multi-disciplinary assessments take place and there is a clear gateway into the different services, whether in health or social care. But, there are plenty of other places where, for one reason or another, there is not that integration and that key point where the different care pathways are being determined. Anything that can be done in guidance, either through this Bill or elsewhere, would be helpful. The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde referred to the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995. The wording is almost exactly the same. Has any guidance been issued under that Act and if so how long after the Act gained Royal Assent was it issued?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The probing amendments have had their desired effect. I was keen to establish the Government's intentions with regard to the directions. I would certainly wish to quash any idea that the purpose of tightening the requirement was to provide some form of standardised national assessment or standardised criteria. That is probably as far removed ideologically from where my party stands as it is possible to be. I was heartened to hear the hon. Gentleman explain how important he considered innovation to be in social services and caring and how the directions that are given are designed to enable innovation, best practice and cross-fertilisation of those good practices across different local authorities.
<P>
As subsections (4) and (5) stand, they could allow anything on the spectrum from total central control to total local discretion. One of my problems as a new Member of Parliament was that our reliance on the Government's assurance that this will all be finessed in guidance is somewhat blind to how it will work out. I am therefore reassured to hear that local innovation will not be stifled in the guidance. That is important. Equally, through guidance and an attempt to achieve greater consistency, there will at least be minimum standards. That is the least for which carers and those cared for would expect us, as parliamentarians, to legislate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Does my right hon. Friend want to intervene? I was about to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Bottomley:</B> I wanted to make a speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Hutton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It may help if I make one or two comments on this group of amendments, in part to respond to a request for information by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). He asked me when, under the 1995 Act, guidance was issued to local authorities. That was done in 1996; if the hon. Gentleman has not seen it, I shall be happy to send him a copy.
<P>
To respond more fully to the point made by the hon. Member for Meriden, in addition to helping local authorities with the assessment process and giving them guidance on it, we have always made it clear that we intend to provide a booklet to carers themselves about the assessment procedure. All our experience of this legislation and the operation of these procedures has led us to conclude that if we do not ensure that carers form part of the loop when information is being shared around, the system will not work effectively. It is important that carers know exactly what is going on and know their own position in relation to the assessment procedure.
<P>
In that respect, carers might partly be helped by the launch of the new carers' website, for which my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde joined me in the Department a few weeks ago. Information will be made available electronically to carers, too. The sharing of information and the database is important, and we are committed to that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden has argued the toss between ``may'' or ``shall'' in amendment No. 2. I can reassure her and the Committee that the issue is not ``may'' or ``shall'', but ``will''. The Secretary of State will issue these guidance notes to local authorities and will explain to carers their position in relation to the assessment procedure and what they can expect from it. I hope that there is no substantive argument between the two sides of the Committee. The issue is not between whether we may or shall issue the guidance. As I said, it is a question of when we will issue it, and we will do so as soon as we possibly can.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley:</B> I wanted clarification on many points. The Minister's comments have reassured me on several of those, but I hope for further clarification before my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden withdraws her amendment, if she is minded to do so.
<P>
The hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis said that she used to work for the Carers National Association. I should have declared my interest, having been a vice-chairman for many years with the late Baroness Seear. Sixteen years ago we appointed someone who appeared to be a revolutionary new director, in the form of Baroness Pitkeathley. She did a huge amount to improve recognition for carers. I remember that once when I went somewhere to speak about carers, I was introduced as ``the lady from the careers service'', so poorly understood was the concept of a carer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis made a valid point. Carers are exhausted and there are no hours left in their day or week. So many report that, had they known at the start what they eventually discovered, they could have managed. The final straw is the idea that there are services concealed in secret areas and corners that they cannot access.
<P>
About 30 years ago, when I used to work for the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) in my first job, social security benefits were almost entirely inaccessible. The least educated, most deprived and most disadvantaged people had the greatest difficulty finding out what financial services were available, but the situation was even worse for carers. I seek an assurance that the guidance will state that such assessments must be widely known.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept that information on assessments must be measured. It would be deplorable to raise unrealistic expectations. Knowing the reality of social services delivery, especially in areas with high costs of living and high rents, and the great difficulty of employing people until pay is more flexible, it would be irresponsible to advertise assessments if people were subsequently to be told that services were not available and that they would be put on a waiting list. If that happened, frustration would follow disappointment. I accept that such matters come under subsequent clauses on service delivery, but I hope that those points will be recognised in the guidance that the Minister has undertaken to provide through the excellent Department.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I hope that the Hansard writers might be able to help me with my little local difficulty in trying to end this debate prematurely.
<P>
The debate has essentially been helpful and has brought new insights into the Government's thinking on such matters. It was reassuring to hear the Minister use the word ``will'', but perhaps it is a shame that the legislation has not been drafted using that word. As a politician, I have found that, in practice, the word ``may'' can sometimes lack the clout of the word ``will''. If that is how the Minister interprets such matters, we will take his word for it, so the amendment will become unnecessary.
<P>
I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey for her contribution to the debate, because of her practical experience. Given what she said about the practicalities of such assessments, especially the raised expectations that they will produce, what the Minister said about guidance being issued to carers becomes all-important. As politicians, we should be under no illusions about this. The fact that carers will have written statements of their entitlements will put more of a requirement on the local authority to provide those services, and people will be able to measure whether local authorities are providing them. That will put into relief the question of whether local authorities have adequate resources to provide the services that carers can reasonably expect because of the assessments that they have been given.
<P>
We should all be aware that we are rightly creating a much more demanding framework in the interests of cared-for people and their carers. The Minister has given sufficient assurances to show that the Government's intentions are entirely good. My residual concern relates purely to the practical financial ability to deliver such services. Given what the Minister and the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde have said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I propose the Question that clause 1 stand part of the Bill, I should say that probing amendments are sometimes like probing points of order, and I am sure that the Committee will not want simply to repeat the points made in the debate.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have one question about clause 1. It was raised on Second Reading and the Minister and the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde provided some reassurance then, but I hope that we can have more put on the record today. The Bill sits in a network of other Acts—the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 and the Children Act 1989—and it sometimes becomes difficult to follow its implications for different carers.
<P>
One category of carers—parents looking after children under 18—appear in the Bill, but are not included under the enhanced rights to assessment that the clause will confer under subsection (l)(a). I assume that because those people have rights under the Children Act 1989, it is felt that their needs can be addressed through that system. However, concerns have been raised and fed back to me that that noble intention is not always realised in practice.
<P>
Are there any plans to review whether the Children Act 1989 enables assessments of care needs for carers to be undertaken? If not, could the problem be dealt with through further guidance issued under that Act? No change to primary legislation would seem to be required; only a change of practice at a local level. The Department would be best placed to effect such a change of practice where current carers of children are not receiving the support that they need and that the Bill would otherwise have provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> This is a splendid Bill and I wish it well. I have no intention of delaying matters. The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde proposed the Bill, and the Minister may wish to reflect on some important issues in his reply. I now represent Southend and I know that the Minister comes from Southend. He will recall that we met some time ago at an all-party meeting of the council, which was controlled by the Labour and Liberal parties, but was said to be in crisis.
<P>
I have reflected on what my right hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey said about resources and I have heard what the Minister said about guidance. Unless I have not been paying attention, I have heard no detail about the processes of assessment or the practicalities that we Members of Parliament are engaged in all the time. When someone wants an assessment, we all know that local authorities have a habit of dragging out the procedures, especially when money is tight.
<P>
It may not be unique to Southend, but I know of considerable delays when the local authority is asked for any sort of assessments. The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has provided us with an excellent opportunity to underpin all these procedures, but, unless I have missed it, we have not debated the practicalities in our debate on clause 1.
<P>
The Minister and his hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde may take the view that it is all down to local authorities and that everyone will have a different experience. Since I have represented Southend, West, the situation seems to have become a nightmare. It does not seem to have been such a challenging constituency when it was under the Guinness family for 100 years. Many issues are being raised by carers in Southend on behalf of those for whom they are caring, which are not being dealt with as swiftly as one would hope.
<P>
I have flannelled for about four minutes and I know that one or two hon. Members hate Conservative Members going on about resources. I genuinely wish the Bill well. Every moment is important for the person being cared for. However, if the local authority mucks about until the end of the financial year, does clause 1 make provision for giving it a duty to speed up the process? In my experience, local authorities drag their heels. However, the Bill is splendid and I welcome clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The hon. Member for Meriden was absolutely right in saying that probing amendments have a useful function. The amendments to which she spoke so eloquently have given us much food for thought. I am sure that the Minister recognises that.
<P>
Unfortunately, the hon. Member for South-West Surrey is not here at the moment, but she made an important contribution to our debate. The hon. Member for Southend, West was not asleep. As I said when moving the sittings motion, I have not provided much detail. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam recognised my inadequacy in relation to the fine detail of social security Bills and so on. I will leave my hon. Friend the Minister to answer the detailed points.
<P>
The clause deals with informal carers aged 16 or over who provide, or intend to provide, a substantial amount of care to another person. That is accepted throughout the House as the right provision. The right to a carer is assessed and will enable the local authority to carry out an assessment even when the person cared for refuses assessment or the provision of services following assessment.
<P>
The clause is vital to the Bill. Local authorities will decide whether to provide services to the carer based on the assessment for which it makes provision. The Minister has already said that the Government are considering whether to table an amendment on Report to make it clear that parent carers have the same right as other carers to ask for assessment. I welcome that commitment, as other Committee members do, I am sure. Indeed, carers' associations have accepted it as forward-looking.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 1 would remove local authorities' flexibility. Like the hon. Member for Meriden, I accept that amendment No. 2 would restrict local authorities' attempts to be flexible. On amendment No. 4, we have been assured that the Department of Health will issue section 7 policy guidance and will consult all carers' organisations, voluntary organisations, local authorities and other interested parties before doing so. The matter has been thought through, and there is no need to mention guidance in the Bill.
<P>
Following assessment under clause 1, carers of adults will, for the first time, have access to support to meet their needs as carers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond briefly.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde is right to say that clause 1 is at the heart of the Bill, as, for the first time, it effectively establishes that all carers are entitled to assessment. My hon. Friend acknowledged that that has been warmly welcomed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southend, West asked an important question about when assessments would be carried out. He asked why the Bill does not specifically refer to the time scale within which assessment must be carried out. We are broadly trying to mirror the structure and form of the 1995 Act. As local social services are responsible for the delivery of such services, we are trying to strike a balance between the appropriate responsibilities of the Department of Health and the local authority.
<P>
Later this month, we hope to issue a framework for assessing the needs of families with children in need. That framework will state that the initial assessment should take place within seven days and that the core assessment should take place within 28 days. That should give hon. Members some idea of how we envisage the process operating locally.
<P>
I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members who are interested in these matters are sent a copy of the assessment framework for children in need and their families, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take comfort from that. From our point of view and, I am sure, from that of all hon. Members, once a carer has approached a local authority with a view to an assessment, that assessment should take place as quickly as possible. That is in everyone's best interests, and we intend to proceed and issue guidance on that basis.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam mentioned parent carers. It is our view, and I know that it is my hon. Friend's view, too, that existing legislation—the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 and the Children Act 1989—provides the framework within which parent carers' needs can be properly assessed. However, for the avoidance of doubt, and to deal with the anxieties that many carers' organisations have expressed, we intend to introduce on Report a declaratory amendment to make explicit parent carers' right to receive an assessment.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will find that acceptable. We are obviously anxious to use the opportunity that my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has given us in promoting the Bill to ensure that we put in place a proper comprehensive legislative framework that meets carers' anxieties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> I do not want to delay proceedings, but I thank the Minister for that information, which is splendid news. I do not expect him to answer now, but on Report he might reflect on whether we might specify in the Bill where the responsibility for assessment lies. On a practical basis, as a Member of Parliament, I find it unsatisfactory that at the moment it lies with the local authority social services department. I am not saying that responsibility should rest with the director of social services, but I am slightly worried about the buck-passing that is going on at the moment. Perhaps the Minister will deal the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I cannot say that we expect to introduce an amendment to deal with those points. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to be in doubt about that. Those issues will be dealt with in the guidance and will be made clear. Responsibility for assessment rests with the local authority, and that is an entirely appropriate stance for us to take.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke: </B>(Coatbridge and Chryston): I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Minister and the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde. I planned to say nothing to that our business would proceed quickly, but I am tempted in this case because of the interesting exchange. If we go further than we had planned in the Bill, which would be a great mistake, we face a grave danger of bureaucracy riding high. We have already discussed the problems of resources. As resources will, we hope, be applied to existing problems and carers' needs, form-filling and more assessments than are necessary would be rather unwelcome. Having had years of experience, local authorities would not find it easy to accommodate the further bureaucracy that would result from such a provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a good point about bureaucracy. We do not intend to weigh down local authorities, but the assessment procedure must be effective, and the Department of Health should help local authorities through the process. However, we want to do so in a way that is not bureaucratic or burdensome to local authorities.
<P>
Several hon. Members mentioned resources, which are, obviously, outside the scope of the clause. I do not want to detain the Committee, but the additional resources being made available to support carers have not been mentioned. The local authority in the constituency of the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey, for example, will receive nearly £1 million this year, which has been ring-fenced to provide additional respite care breaks or services for carers.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that his Government are brilliant at packaging small sums of money while reducing the overall amount. Surrey social services may have £1 million for carers, but his Government removed at a stroke the ring-fenced community care money. Surrey saw a substantial deterioration of several million pounds. We can debate whether it is £10 million or £12 million less than the Surrey social services had expected. What the present Government call tackling inequalities in fact means widening the gap so that the gap between the amount per head for social services in Surrey, compared, to take a random example—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are getting a little long. I hope that the right hon. Lady will come to her point, and then I will have something to say about the debate itself
<P>
<B>Mrs. Bottomley:</B> I was asking the Minister to be more truthful about setting the £1 million package in the context of an overall reduction of what social services like mine expect to pay.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is perfectly legitimate for hon. Members to ask whether the resources are there to do the assessments. But I am a little worried about getting into a general debate about what each local authority is doing, what it has been allocated and so on. I am sure that hon. Members understand the point that I am making, and I should be extremely grateful if they would assist me on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am here to help in every way that I possibly can. The spirit of cross-party consensus and good will might be about to break down rather tragically as a result of the right hon. Lady's observations. Resources for Surrey social services have not been reduced. They continue to receive additional resources year on year. The additional £900,000 for carers is ring-fenced and cannot be spent anywhere else. I have met many carers in Surrey and they are extremely glad to have that at their disposal.
<P>
I hope that I have managed to deal with the technical issues that have arisen during the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde and I have both accepted the need to make the provisions of the clause clearer in respect of parent carers. We are working closely with the carers' organisations and others to make sure that the clause does what we want it to do, which is to enhance the entitlement of all carers, whether they are looking after adults or children, to the improved service that we want them to receive. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I just want to make a short contribution to the stand part debate, Mr. Stevenson. I am glad that you have allowed a wide-ranging discussion of the clause. It is an important clause because it addresses the lack of interpretation of the needs of carers. It is ground-breaking in that it assesses in practical terms what carers can expect the state to provide to support them in the important task that they do. A piece of legislation can sometimes appear as an empty box, and I believe that much of the value in the probing amendments and the discussion that they provoke is the fact that we can begin to understand what is going into that box.
<P>
We have had clarification of what the guidance will be and we have heard that the important category of carers identified by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who are currently not covered by the Bill, will be the subject of a declaratory amendment on Report. That is vital in terms of putting the furniture into the box so that we have a better understanding of what the legislation will bring in practical terms. As a new parliamentarian, I am concerned that we have to rely a great deal on empty boxes and on these debates to find out what the Government's intentions are.
<P>
The Hansard writers have a great responsibility in recording the Government's intentions. That will be the only way in which we are able to hold the Government to account if we are not clear about what the guidance will contain.
<P>
I support the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam in his request for a review of the efficacy of the Children Act 1989 in providing sufficient help to carers of children. I am not sure whether, in technical terms, a declaratory amendment on Report would give us the opportunity to review how well that works for parent carers. Carers' organisations have flagged up this category to all of us. At the approach to any threshold there is nearly always a group that is suffering. The case was put to me of parent carers of a 15-year-old autistic child or one with severe mental health problems The hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis identified that group in an earlier intervention and asked the Minister whether they would be catered for. Anyone approaching a threshold where different provisions apply can suddenly find themselves in the worst position of all. Therefore a review by the Government of this category of parent carers would be a valuable contribution to improving the lot of carers as a whole.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 20, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the person cared for has specifically consented to the provision of such a service of an intimate nature.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 2 is another important part of the Bill. We recognise the practical reality that a carer may get no break at all due to a blanket ban on services of an intimate nature being given by a substitute.
<P>
Perhaps some of the most deserving cases of carers will be ruled out under the present wording. For example, those cared for who are incontinent would be restricted from enabling their usual carers to take a break. Intimate services are not defined in the Bill. Only in the somewhat vague explanatory notes does it say that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>might include dressing, feeding, lifting, washing or bathing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That lack of clarity might result in help being precluded from those who most need it. Obviously services such as washing and dressing could apply to a wide range of those who are cared for. I should hate to see people who undertake those tasks being precluded from the opportunity for relief, help or a break.
<P>
If we are worried about the vulnerability of the cared-for person, maybe the law needs to be strengthened in other areas, as in the Care Standards Bill, where there is consideration of those at risk. In that Bill, personal care is more clearly defined and the practical problems for vulnerable children and adults are recognised.
<P>
The amendment includes the caveat that specific consent would have to be given by the person cared for. That would offer a high level of protection, but what about the category of persons cared for who would be unable to give such consent? It is possible to think of cases of people who need intimate services but who do not have the mental capacity to provide specific consent. The clause as drafted and unamended would preclude a number of people in deserving categories.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady referred to a difficult category of cases, in which the cared-for person might lack consent. I do not understand how the amendment would deal with the issue.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> That is a second issue that I raised as part of the amendment. It relates to the same category of people who might unwittingly block an assessment that clause 1 will unlock. However, there is still a problem in the clause as drafted: when the cared-for person is not able to give consent, the clause may not be effective. It is a balance between trying to protect—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> I am following the hon. Lady's well-made arguments carefully. Has she considered expanding the role of the many advocates who deal with those situations?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He reiterates the view of the Council for Disabled Children, to which I pay tribute, which also envisages a much stronger role for advocates. The right hon. Gentleman is right; there is an important role to be played, especially in increasing levels of protection for the person who is cared for. Sadly, both children and adults can be vulnerable when substitute health care is provided. That is an anxiety for the carer and for the state. There are far too many examples of a cared-for person being the victim of a crime when a substitute carer is brought in before his or her suitability has been sufficiently checked. We need to ensure that there is adequate protection for the person cared for, but we must also resolve the problem that ruling out substitution for services of an intimate nature will preclude many carers from receiving relief and assistance, which they sorely need precisely because of the dependency of the person for whom they care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I was not sure whether the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam wanted to speak, but I caught your eye first, Mr. Stevenson, and you are the boss. The hon. Lady spoke to the amendment in a most helpful way and I hope that she will feel able to withdraw it.
<P>
Clause 2(3)(b) expressly provides that a carer's service to a person cared for may not, except in prescribed circumstances, include anything of an intimate nature. The amendment would enable intimate services to be provided for the person cared for only if he or she consents. We had intended to deal with the exceptions in regulations to ensure maximum flexibility—I use that word again. Users and carers would naturally have been consulted on such regulations. However, it is important to stress that, having listened to the views of carers, with whom we had meetings, the Minister and I are minded to amend the Bill to avoid the possibility of carers being charged for services to users. That would entail amending clause 2(3)(b) and we shall do so after we take on board the points made in Committee and the views of carers, who will be consulted on the matter.
<P>
The change has been discussed with carers' organisations, who seem pleased to have the Minister's assurance that there is no intention to charge carers for services to users. If we follow the course of action that I outlined, the amendment will be unnecessary and on that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady will seek leave to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I welcome what the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde said. Carers' representations have not fallen on stony ground, as the Minister and the hon. Gentleman have clearly listened to them. That is good news. I look forward to moving but not pressing the amendments that I have tabled on that important subject. The more clarification that we have about it and the workings of the charging regime, the better, even if the charging regime does not work in the way in which the hon. Gentleman described.
<P>
The amendment is about definitions. The Care Standards Bill will also play a role in providing some of the framework in which all care services will be provided in future. There seem to be subtle differences between the definitions of personal care, in the context of the intimate nature of care provided as referred to in clause 2(3)(b), in its explanatory notes and those to this Bill. For that reason, the hon. Member for Meriden was right to probe the matter, as some services of an intimate nature might be provided on the basis of such definitions. It is good to have as much clarity as possible in the explanatory notes, or preferably in the Bill.
<P>
The explanatory notes to the Care Standards Bill describe personal care as including
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assistance with the activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing and eating for people who are unable to do these things without assistance and extends to advice and encouragement . . . It is intended to include direct physical assistance as well as psychological support, for instance reminding someone to carry out daily activities such as washing and eating.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The explanatory notes to the Bill that we are discussing provide a much narrower definition of what is included in the context of an intimate nature. They say that it might include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>dressing, feeding, lifting, washing or bathing the person cared for.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I fear that we may have inadvertently constricted that definition too much, which means that we will rely too much on the regulation-making powers after the event, given that the Bill deals with prescribed circumstances. I hope that the Minister will shed a little light on what the Government envisage that those prescribed circumstances might be.
<P>
Continence care is a specific example of an important intimate service. Along with other hon. Members, I have taken an interest in the issue, and the Government are producing new guidance on it that is due to be published soon. That guidance will be important in helping us to understand how the clause will operate. Will the Minister say when it will be published? What status will it have? Could such matters be taken into account in the prescribed circumstances in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I also hope to hear more from the Minister about that. I am sorry, but I am not sure that the response given by the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde dealt with my point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful to the hon. Lady. Clause 7 is about charging, so I looked at it when the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde mentioned the subject, but I could not put the two together. Perhaps that matter could be made clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I said ``charge'' when I meant ``change''. I must have the wrong glasses.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is helpful to me and, I hope, to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Perhaps I shall need to re-read the Hansard report of our proceedings tomorrow morning fully to understand what the hon. Gentleman said. He gave us a glimpse of something important to which we shall refer later in our discussions. We want to hear about charging, so we may have had a foretaste of better things to come.
<P>
The amendment is a probing amendment and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam repeated the flaw in the Bill which, we have tried to flag up, that may unwittingly preclude a group from receiving care. I fully acknowledge that the amendment still has the weakness of there being yet another group of people who would be unable to give consent and could be precluded because they required services of an intimate nature. We wanted to draw attention to that flaw. We do not wish to prevent the Bill from completing its Committee stage. However, will the Minister think a little more about that category of cared-for people and their carers, who are heavily dependent on services of an intimate nature, to ensure that the Bill does not unwittingly cut them out of much-needed help?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I am sure that the Minister wishes to clarify this matter in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall now put the Question—[Hon. Members]: ``the amendment has been withdrawn.''] I apologise. I did not hear the hon. Lady ask leave to withdraw her amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am happy to withdraw the amendment on hearing from the hon. Gentleman, particularly the assurance that the Minister will address the point in the clause stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 22, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The Secretary of State (or, in relation to Wales, the National Assembly for Wales) shall issue guidance to local authorities in respect of decisions under subsection (1) above with the objective of ensuring consistent decision-making throughout England and Wales as the case may be.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment brings us back to the general theme of obtaining a consistent level of service nationwide by the means of guidance from the Secretary of State. On Second Reading, the Minister referred to the need for a consistent approach in ensuring that different groups are treated fairly. He admitted that allowing local authorities too much discretion produces an unacceptable variation in standards of care. We have heard much this morning about how the issuing of guidance should help to resolve such matters, and I hope to hear in response to my argument that that guidance will clarify the risk of unacceptable variations in standards of care. I shall listen attentively to the hon. Member Stalybridge and Hyde.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The amendment brings me back to our earlier discussions about flexibility. I repeat that if the Bill receives Royal Assent, section 7 policy guidance will be issued. Members of the Committee may be aware that the Department is about to consult on the draft guidance on fair access to carers' services. The aim is to ensure greater consistency in the decision-making of local authorities, for which the hon. Member for Meriden asked.
<P>
All local authorities will be required to say how they are implementing such guidance by April 2002. The Department will want to ensure that those principles apply to services under the Bill, just as they apply to all community care services. I hope that I have given the hon. Lady the assurances that she seeks. The Department intends to make a determined effort to ensure that the guidance gives rise to greater consistency in the decision-making of local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> No doubt we shall return to the matter of consistency in the clause stand part debate, but on the basis of what the hon. Gentleman said, beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 2, line 22, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Where a local authority has made an assessment in accordance with section 1 above and reached a positive determination in relation to sections 2(1)(a) and 2(1)(b) above, but has decided not to provide services to the carer, the local authority shall provide in a written statement to the carer details of any services it has decided to provide instead directly to the person cared for as a result of the assessment or, where it has decided not to provide services to the person cared for or to the carer, its reasons for deciding not to provide such services.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
During our debate on amendment No. 3, I was trying to think of a situation in which the person cared for or the carer might dispute the local authority's assessment. It is perfectly realistic to anticipate disputes over assessments and the decisions taken as a result of them. As I said, that has become a problem with special needs provision; such disputes can end up in a tribunal. To avoid that, it is important that there should be transparency about the decision not to provide services. A written statement may form an important part of that process of transparency. If the carer receives written guidance on what assessment to expect realistically, it is particularly important that there should be a written statement on why help is not forthcoming as a counterweight. I am sorry that the amendment focuses on the negative example of a carer being dissatisfied with the outcome of the assessment process, but such a situation is more likely to be disputed.
<P>
It is important that reasons are given in the written statement. If a third party in a disputed assessment had to decide whether the conclusion of the assessment was correct, he or she could do so only if the original reason for the assessment was understood. To have a provision that safeguards the interests of those providing the assessment and of those on the receiving end of it would be useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> To prepare for the amendment, I thumbed through the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 to clarify in my mind the various stages of an assessment that would lead to a care plan. Unfortunately, my thumbing did not reach a conclusion, so I now pose it as a question. Presumably, if we are mirroring for carers the process that applies to the person cared for, the outcome of the assessment will be a care plan for the carer or an equivalent document. Some form of the amendment would ensure the greater transparency and accountability of the local authority, as the agency undertaking the assessment, and, more widely, would help it in discharging those responsibilities. Proper assessment of what services will be provided should also be documented for the carer. There should be a care plan—or carer's plan to use different jargon—forming a record that can be consulted.
<P>
The assessments are on-going. It is not the case that beyond a certain point no change is possible. However, it would be interesting to know from the Minister whether in the underpinning guidance there will be parallel documentation for carers so that they have the equivalent of a care plan that they can refer to and, if necessary, use in a tribunal appeal as an instrument for securing the services that the authority has assessed them as needing. The amendment would be useful as a way of testing whether that will happen. Everything that helps transparency and accountability in that area would be useful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I hope that I will be able to satisfy the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Meriden. If not, I am sure that the Minister will do so. I say again—no doubt I shall keep saying it—that if the Bill receives Royal Assent, section 7 policy guidance will be issued. That will link with the existing assessment and care management guidance, which recommends that, at the end of the assessment, the user and carer are provided with a statutory summary of their needs, which should state whether they are eligible for help. When services are to be provided directly to the person cared for, that will form their care plan.
<P>
Unless the carer objects, the care plan will usually be shared with the carer. If the local authority has decided not to provide services to the person cared for or to the carer, that decision should be included in the summary statement of their needs. If the local authority considers that their needs are not eligible for help, the statement should include the reasons. The decision should be transparent and in line with the local authority's eligibility criteria.
<P>
The fair access to care guidance also recommends that users and carers who are not eligible should be put in touch with other agencies or services that may be more appropriate to their needs. Local authorities should also encourage users and carers to contact social services if their needs or circumstances change. I hope that that information is useful and that it answers the points raised this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde for reassuring those who have expressed concerns, particularly the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who spoke about the need for a written care plan. It is widely accepted that that should be the norm. My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has drawn attention to one or two ways in which such a plan can be prepared under existing arrangements. It is our view that the requirement for a written care plan is already covered by the guidance that we issue to local authorities. My hon. Friend might like to know of two further examples of the benefits of having a written care plan.
<P>
The mental health national service framework that we published in September, which addressed the needs of carers, made it clear that the carer should receive a written care plan following a proper assessment of care needs. That was widely welcomed. In the long-term care charter, ``Better Care, Higher Standards'', which we published recently, we made it clear that those who are looking after people with long-term or continuing health care needs should receive a proper and fully described written statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Do those care plans stand apart, separate from the care plan for the cared-for person—or are they part and parcel of the same document?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I understand that it is a care plan for the carer; that is certainly true in relation to the mental health national service framework and the carer of a person who is in need of long-term care. That was true also in relation to carers under the 1996 guidance issued under the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995. My understanding is that that is already covered. However, if it is not covered, we shall make it clear in the guidance that is to be issued under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Once again, the amendment has resulted in some useful clarification. It was good to hear that the summary statement will give reasons, which certainly satisfies one of our purposes. As the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde said, the summary statement must be in line with eligibility criteria, which brings us back to the subject of consistency. We have debated that subject and I do not intend to return to it. I am satisfied to hear that the summary statement will give reasons. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I have already said, Mr. Stevenson, that the Minister may wish to catch your eye. He may inform the Committee more clearly than I could of one or two aspects of the provisions of clause 1.
<P>
The clause enables local authorities to provide certain services to direct carers, following a carer's assessment. The services to carers are not defined in the Bill. The local authority may provide any services that it thinks will support carers in their caring role or help to maintain their health and well-being. As was said on Second Reading, such services may take the form of physical help or could involve assistance around the house and other forms of support such as training or counselling for the carer.
<P>
The clause has generated some sensible amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Meriden. I hope that the Government have responded to them with some effect. The debate has been informed, intelligent and sensitive to issues of concern for carers and the people for whom they care. However, anxiety has been expressed not just here but on Second Reading that the devil is in the detail. The clause sets out new freedoms and flexibilities for local authorities. I mentioned that freedom on Second Reading, and it runs right through the Bill. It allows local authorities to decide what services will best meet carers' needs and help them to maintain their important role. However, the Bill also places a limitation on that freedom. In order to respect the individual liberty of disabled, vulnerable or frail older people, carer services delivered to the person cared for may not include anything of an intimate nature. That safeguard is intended to ensure that the new freedoms for carers do not disempower disabled people.
<P>
The clause allows for exceptions in prescribed circumstances. Flexibility was built into the Bill in case circumstances were identified in which it would be helpful to users and to carers. The Bill provides the power to make regulations on what counts as a service of an intimate nature. Such services might include dressing, feeding, lifting, washing or bathing a person who is cared for. Discussions about the extent of intimate services are on-going and involve the Department and carers' organisations. The limitation of the new freedom is designed to ensure that local authority support for carers does not become a tool to erode the hard-won independence of disabled people. Some services that carers view as assisting them in their role could be delivered for cared-for people under community care legislation. I am thinking of home help, cleaning, laundry and other such services. Some carers may prefer to be recipients of services, and might want to access the flexibility of a direct payment that would allow them to buy into a service at a convenient time.
<P>
As the Minister said, the provision has caused difficulties. Carers have indicated that they do not want to be charged for services. That point has been made before. I welcome the fact that the Minister will consider tabling an amendment dealing with the subject on Report. He will doubtless refer to it when he responds.
<P>
Cared-for people will not be forced to accept services that they do not wish to receive. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge expressed concern about that on Second Reading. In some circumstances, however, the provisions may accept a level of contact with social services that is not threatening and helps the person who provides the care. Carers welcome the opportunity to benefit from services that meet their needs and are delivered to them in recognition of their valuable role. The clause enables local authorities to provide support to carers, whom it will benefit when the cared-for person has refused services by allowing the local authority to deliver to the carer the widest possible range of non-controversial support, perhaps of a domestic nature. It will benefit carers who want greater flexibility and control on how services are delivered to better enable them to continue to lead their own lives. I am thinking especially of carers looking after elderly parents who have their own families and of those with outside interests or jobs to hold down.
<P>
The issues are complex, and I am sure that we shall become increasingly aware of that complexity as we discuss the Bill. I did not know about it when I started formulating my proposals. Not all carers are the same and the circumstances in which they care vary. Local authorities generally welcome the proposals, as they will give them flexibility to support carers in new ways. For the first time, the needs of carers will be met. Sensitive support will be delivered and we will recognise the difficult personal circumstances in which carers often care.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I had a sense that everyone was waiting for me to say something.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause. It is crucial because it gives local authorities the power to provide a range of services that better meet carers' needs. The provision must be included or the Bill will become toothless, and I am sure that no one wants that.
<P>
Specific issues have been raised. The hon. Member for Meriden described clause 2(3)(a) as a flaw in the Bill. It is not designed to make the Bill more complicated or confusing, or to impose restrictions on services that could be provided to carers; far from it. Subsection (3)(a) attempts to find a way, which is currently not available, to provide services that benefit a disabled person—the person who is being cared for—to the carer in a way that might be more convenient for both of them. We could all think of examples of that, especially in relation to laundry services or home help.
<P>
It is true—my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde was right to mention this—that after the Bill was published, many people expressed concern that the clause might allow a local authority to charge a carer for services for which the cared-for person has been assessed. I accept your stricture, Mr. Stevenson, that we will discuss charging later, but there are serious anxieties, which we acknowledge, about how subsection (3)(a) will relate to charging. It has always been reasonable for a local authority to charge for services that are delivered to a disabled person, and it will be acceptable for a local authority to pose a reasonable charge in relation to carer services. It would, however, be unacceptable for a carer to be liable to contribute towards charges for their own services and those of the disabled person. The hon. Member for Meriden, who was concerned in particular about subsection (3)(a), will find it helpful to know that the Government intend to introduce a suitable amendment on Report to make it clear that the carer cannot be charged, or be assessed as being liable to a charge, for community care services that are provided for the disabled person. The clause is important. We intend to amend subsection (3)(a) on Report to clear up its ambiguous meaning. I hope that hon. Members are satisfied with that reassurance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam raised the technical matter of the nature of intimate services, which is mentioned in subsection (3)(b). He drew a parallel between the Bill and the Care Standards Bill. The Care Standards Bill does not purport to contain an exhaustive definition of personal care. During its passage in another place, it became clear that it might need to be amended. The hon. Gentleman should not read too much into the style and approach of the two Bills. The Carers and Disabled Children Bill broadly follows the approach of the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995, on which similar concerns were raised. Regulatory powers give the Government and local authorities greater flexibility to adapt if there is something wrong with the way in which the rules are working. I shall not pretend that they are not inherently difficult.
<P>
It is obviously difficult to set specific and workable criteria for intimate and highly personal services. The greater flexibility that the regulation-making procedure gives to iron out the problems provides the best way to attempt to resolve the issues. We must address the issues, for a simple and obvious reason. Such intimate services might involve physical contact with a cared-for person with a disability. It is right for such a person to have the final say on the care services being extended to them. No member of the Committee would want it any other way. We are challenged with finding the right way in which to sort out the issue in the Bill that my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has introduced. We must resolve it because reasonable concerns are being expressed about it. I should give members of the Committee notice that we intend to improve clause 2 on Report.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam possibly stretched the scope of the debate by asking when the Government intended to issue their advice on continence services. That issue is not only for local authorities but for the national health service. We intend to issue the continence guidance as soon as possible. We want it to be effective and to lever up the quality of services for people who need that help and care from the NHS and social services.
<P>
I urge the Committee to support this clause, which is a very important part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Virginia Bottomley:</B> I want the clause to stand part of the Bill. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden for her amendment, which clarifies many issues. I am reassured by the Minister's comments because it has emerged during the discussion of the clause that the relationship between a carer and a disabled person is not necessarily simple. In an ideal world, the carer might be saintly and uncomplicated and the disabled person might be reconciled to their difficulties, but we do not live in an ideal world. The relationship between those two people frequently becomes extremely complex and possibly hostile. A subtle approach is required. The ambiguities and the enormous difficulty of the task have been recognised during the discussion.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde, who admirably introduced the Bill, said that the local authority associations welcomed the Bill. The Local Government Association has welcomed the Bill but, like many others, it has made many comments about the resource implications. Clause 2 is concerned with assessment and the services that a local authority might consider. Just as the relationship between a carer and a disabled person is fraught with grey areas, hidden agendas and possible misunderstandings, there can be an underworld of cost shunting in the delivery of services.
<P>
A health or education service, or a housing department, might provide a service instead of social services. For all the good will behind the Bill, I hope that the potential contamination of assessments and recommendations by questions regarding which body will foot the bill and availability will be appreciated when the Department introduces more detailed guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I, too, want the clause to stand part of the Bill—absolutely! The Minister has done much to reassure me on the precise intention of some of its provisions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde said that a fine balance must be struck when providing new rights to carers; we must be sure not to be seen to be withdrawing rights from disabled people. I know that some people were worried about that. Everyone welcomes the Bill, but when we start looking at the details, we must clarify matters and answer people's questions. That is the spirit in which the Committee operates. This is the first time that I have followed a private Member's Bill into Committee. It is a quite different environment from that in Standing Committees considering Government Bills.
<P>
The Minister has helpfully dealt with our questions about the charging regime. My only other question, which could have been the substance of an earlier intervention, is about the need for flexibility. The Minister rightly said that flexibility is needed at a time of potential change. Problems need to be dealt with as they occur, and the response must fit the situation. The wishes of disabled people and carers must always be taken into account, because cultural issues are involved that can result in change.
<P>
That necessitates a robust consultation mechanism. I am sure that the Minister will tell me that such provisions are already in place. It would help if, perhaps on a later clause, he said a little about the regulations that govern such procedures. Local authorities will have a view, but so will carers and disabled people. It would help greatly if those views could be built into the regulations and guidance.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I support the call for consultation, as does the Carers National Association. I am sure that the Minister will answer that point.
<P>
I was keen to listen to the Minister's response. He made it clear that the Government have spotted the risk that charging could occur. Both sides agree that that would be undesirable for carers. We look forward to clause 2 being amended on Report, and I do not intend to dwell on that matter.
<P>
I come to the logic of how the clause is drafted. The local authority will be required to decide whether to provide services to meet the needs identified by an assessment. That puts it in a strong position. It will have to be in a fairly strong position to make the assessment, but under subsection (1)(c), it could use cost as a reason for not providing the help suggested in the assessment.
<P>
The point of the Committee stage is to put the iron in the fire, so that we can be sure that the Bill will withstand high temperatures. Let us assume that the local authority decides that the answer to paragraph (a) is yes; it decides that the carer
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has needs in relation to the care which he provides or intends to provide.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let suppose next that the local authority says yes to paragraph (b); it decides, at least in theory, that those needs could be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>satisfied . . . by services which the local authority may provide.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
But when it comes to paragraph (c), which states that the authority must decide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if they could be so satisfied, whether or not to provide services to the carer,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is possible, if the local authority was short of money, that the answer would be no. What would happen if the local authority's decisions were yes, yes and no? Would there be penalties for a failure to provide services identified as needed by the carer? If we do not try to thrash out the practicalities and workability of the provisions, we shall be failing to acknowledge that services are rationed and that, even with the extra money to help carers, there will be limits on what local authorities can provide.
<P>
It is perfectly plausible that a local authority could, in the rationing context, answer yes, yes and no, but nothing in the Bill makes it clear what the carer could do when refused help by the local authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady makes some good points, but I should point out that, as I am sure that she is aware, every local authority has an established complaints procedure. A mechanism is already available for people who feel unfairly treated.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I think that hon. Members know, through our surgery work, that complaints procedures that remain in-house, if I can describe it that way, do not always produce satisfactory outcomes for the person who has been denied the service. That is what I meant earlier when I described how a third party might be involved in such a decision.
<P>
It is possible to imagine that a very well-intentioned local authority, which had identified a need that, theoretically, it could meet, would have inadequate money to do so through local taxation and central Government funding. The clause might lead to that. I would not vote against it because of that. It is important to enable local authorities to make the relevant assessment, weigh up their capacity to provide a service and, wherever possible, to provide that service when the assessment has shown that it is needed by the carer. However, I remain concerned that we are planning, as if in a perfect world, to meet every need. I know from my work in health that that way of thinking is a big problem for public service. Expectations are raised when Governments offer extra help and they will be raised by assessments. They could then be dashed by lack of financial provision.
<P>
I endorse the view of the Local Government Association, which has clearly stated that the assessments will create extra work, requiring extra resources and staff. It would be a shame if a well-intentioned Bill tackling a real need, should eventually be found by the people most directly concerned to be less than effective, simply because of lack of financial resources. We do not want to vote against the clause, but just to flag up possible consequences of the way it is drafted.

Question put and agreed to.
