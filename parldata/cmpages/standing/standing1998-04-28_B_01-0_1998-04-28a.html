<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning everyone. Welcome to the first sitting of consideration in Committee of the Crime and Disorder Bill. Before I call the Minister to move the sittings motion, I must announce that I have not selected the amendment tabled to it by the Opposition.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the Crime and Disorder Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I look forward to the pleasure of sitting under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie. This is the first time that I have done so. I am sure that the Bill will stimulate a great deal of constructive debate.
<P>
I note, Mrs. Michie, that you have not selected the Opposition amendment to the sittings motion. The Committee will require flexibility. The duration of our sittings will depend on decisons that are made through the usual channels and on the extent to which hon. Members wish to debate the issues raised by the Bill. We are ready to discuss the Bill for extended periods if that is the wish of the Committee. The provisons of the Bill are worthy of support and we look forward to debates in Committee.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary implied during Second Reading, the Government aim to achieve Royal Assent before the summer. The public want to see progress in the fight against crime and disorder and will be unforgiving if there is needless delay. We must move quickly to ensure that the provisons of the Bill are enacted.
<P>
The Government want to bring a number of provisions into effect quickly and to pilot a number of youth justice provisions from the autumn. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said, we also want the youth justice board to be in place from October.
<P>
I should like to think that we can address the issues from a position of knowledge and understanding. That is why I have offered the hon. Members for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) explanatory briefings with myself or my officials, and I gladly repeat my offer. I known from my experience in opposition that the meaning of legislation is not always clear when one comes to it fresh. I want the Committee to debate and argue about those matters on which we disagree, but not on matters which arise from a misunderstanding of the conents of the Bill.
<P>
I was grateful to the official Opposition for their support for the Bill during its unopposed Second Reading and for the constructive contributions made by Liberal Democrat Members.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine):</B> Will the Minister confirm that the Scottish Office will be involved in these informal briefings, to ensure that the Scottish aspects of the Bill will also be explained?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, that is certainly the case. The order of consideration groups together the clauses relating to Scotland. That will enable Scottish Members, and the Minister, to take part coherently in the debates, with the best level of information that we are able to provide.
<P>
The Bill will make a real difference to the lives of many of our constitutents, who are plagued by the evils of crime. I hope that we can co-operate constructively to ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book as quckly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison (Hertsmere):</B> I join the Minister in saying what a great pleasure it is to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Michie. The Opposition look forward to serving in this Committee under your chairmanship and that of Mr. O'Hara. We are grateful to the Government for their offer of assistance by way of briefing on some of the technical matters in the Bill. We realise that it is best to debate such technical and detailed matters from a basis of common understanding, so that it will be clear where real, substantive disagreements exist. Technical and detailed matters can give rise to important questions, so such an approach is necessary.
<P>
The Committee will be pleased to know that I intend to speak only briefly on the sittings motion. I should mention--in a gentle and friendly way--that I was somewhat surprised at the motion, in view of the Minister's philosophy on sittings, as I remember it. He argued strongly, in the Committee that considered the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, in favour of sitting in the mornings only. The Minister--in his then capacity as Opposition spokesman--said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I have various points to make to persuade the Committee and, I hope, the Minister--I always live in hope--that the right way of dealing with the matter would be to meet in the mornings only for a period.''--[Official Report, Standing Committe B, 18 January 1994; c. 5.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He has had a change of heart about that, apparently, and I do not want to go into how that came about.
<P>
Our purpose in tabling an amendment, which has not been selected, was to urge the Minister not to go from one extreme to another in his attitude to sittings. Our only aim in Committee will be to give the Bill proper consideration, and we want its sittings to be structured to allow that. We want to deal properly with the wide range of important subjects covered by the Bill, such as the fight against drugs and dealing with sex offenders and youth crime, to maximise the help that we give to people who work in the relevant parts of the justice system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): In view of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, perhaps he will confirm that he intends to help the Government to pass the Bill as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not know how many Standing Committees the hon. Gentleman has served on, or whether he considered previous criminal justice Bills in Committee, but he will know that many matters need to be examined in such proceedings. I was about to finish my remarks by emphasising that Conservative Members' aim--and our proper duty as an Opposition--is to give the Bill full consideration. We shall do that to the best of our ability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): It falls to the Liberal Democrat Members in Committee to be third in declaring our pleasure at your presence in the Chair today, Mrs. Michie. However, that pleasure is not diminished.
<P>
We generally support the Bill whose timetable we are now considering. It will be interesting to observe the official Opposition and the Government getting used to their new roles during debates on the Bill. I understand that previous criminal justice Bills, of which I have no experience, took up considerable time. Liberal Democrat Members intend to table amendments only on issues about which we want serious debate. We shall take advantage of the opportunity for further briefing on matters that we suspect need only technical clarification. The Committee should maximise the time it spends considering serious issues of fundamental importance, and spend as little as possible on arcane debates that are not relevant to the passage of the Bill. We hope that the Bill will reach the statute book, for the benefit of the constituents of all hon. Members.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the Crime and Disorder Bill [Lords] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution connected to the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I also remind the Committee that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
Amendments may not be tabled this Friday, which is a non-sitting day. In order for amendments to be unstarred, and, therefore, able to be selected for next Tuesday, they should be tabled no later than the rise of the House on Thursday 30 April. The House is expected to rise at 7.30 pm on that day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am sure that the news that you have imparted, Mrs. Michie, will be music to the ears of some of my colleagues. It is good to know that we have an optimist in the Chair.
<P>
I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 18; Clauses 25 to 29; Clause 77; Clauses 31 to 38; Schedule 2; Clauses 39 to 48; Schedule 3; Clauses 49 to 60; Schedule 4; Clauses 61 to 64; Schedule 5; Clauses 65 to 76; Clause 78; Clauses 89 to 97; Clauses 100 to 108; Clauses 19 to 24; Schedule 1; Clause 30; Clause 88; Clauses 79 to 86; Schedule 6; Clause 87; Clauses 98 and 99; new Clauses; Schedules 7 to 10; new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To reply to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, of course we sometimes suggested when we were in Opposition that muddled and confused legislation should be tackled only in the mornings, but we have presented a precise, coherent measure, which will allow the Committee to deal with the necessary business more quickly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recall the constructive and helpful way in which we tackled the previous Government's legislation on law and order. We suggested improvements, which were not always accepted, but we also supported provisions that would benefit the public.
<P>
Despite the Bill's coherence, any measure has to be drafted in a way that makes sense to lawyers. Therefore, there are technical considerations in the construction of a measure. The order of consideration groups related items together for the Committee's benefit.
<P>
In essence, we are proposing that all the Scottish provisions should be considered together after we have discussed the provisions for England and Wales. That will allow the Committee to focus on the important provisions for Scotland. My hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish), will lead on those clauses. I am wise enough to know that a Welshman should think long and hard before trespassing into the territory of Scottish law, although that is probably marginally--I stress marginally--more acceptable than the same trespass by an English Member of Parliament.
<P>
The order of consideration provides for the main schedules to be considered immediately after the relevant clauses, thus enabling us to deal with a topic coherently.
<P>
We propose that clause 77 should be grouped with earlier clauses on the new racially aggravated offences, and that clauses 30 and 88, which deal with racially aggravated offences in Scotland, could usefully be considered sequentially. I commend the order of consideration to the Committee, and hope that it will provide a sensible structure for our deliberations on the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is a sensible order of consideration. I am tempted to respond to the Minister's comments on the sittings motion. I permit myself one slightly controversial remark: the Minister knows that some provisions of the Bill--at least those for secure training centres--are the same as those in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.
<P>
However, the order of consideration is sensible. Those of us who are not entirely familiar with Scots law will find it helpful to deal with the Scottish provision as part of a whole rather than switching backwards and forwards between them and the English provisions. The Committee would find that confusing, so the Government's proposals make sense.
<P>
I also welcome the Minister of State's comments about dealing with the new racially aggravated offences at the same time as clause 77, which preserves existing law on racially aggravated offences. It makes sense to deal with them together. We have tabled amendments to the provisions, which we will be better able to debate if we take clause 77 at the same time as the other provisions.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is a serious subject and we shall invite the Government to consider carefully what we say about it. We are not trying to stirke a discordant note, and it is important that we make it clear at the outset that we want to send out a common message. Some of the arguments behind our amendments on racially aggravated offences are at least worthy of consideration, and we take the Minister of State's comments about listening to the Opposition as a good omen. I take them to be part of the philosophy that he has just enunciated. We look forward to that philosophy taking practical effect and to the Government listening to our comments and perhaps accepting some of our amendments. They have been tabled to improve the Bill and to enable proper consideration to take place. We hope that the Government will seriously consider them. We are not saying for a moment that they are all perfect--far from it. Each of them raises important issues, however, and we hope that the Government will be prepared to consider them. Some important aspects of the Bill need substantial improvement and we look forward to the Government listening constructively to our arguments about how that can be achieved.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I think that I welcome the Government's somewhat schizophrenic approach to handling the Scottish provisions. They had it in their power to avoid the problem by drafting two Bills. They claimed, however, that the provisions needed to be integrally linked and that it was crucial to put them through the House of Commons in one Bill. They now seek to pull the provisions apart and to treat them, in effect, as two separate Bills.
<P>
I was concerned that the Minister argued that the Committee should meet briefly and that he hoped to become an expert in Scottish law before we reached the first Scottish clause. Are there any procedures of the House of Commons that the Government could consider before we reach that point to increase scrutiny of the Scottish clauses by Scottish Members? At present, the only directly elected Scottish Members are myself and the Scottish Office Minister, who is not present now, although he will be for the Scottish clauses. At some point in the past, the honourable Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran) sought to become my Member of Parliament in Scotland. He has the legal training to deal with Scottish law, but he does not have an electoral relationship with Scottish people.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consider the procedures of the House and new ways of working. They claimed during consideration of the Scotland Bill on the Floor of the House that they wanted Scottish legislation to be scrutinised in a way that related to Scottish people. There is still time before we reach clause 19 for them to consider the procedures of the House and of the Committee and to find a way to increase Scottish scrutiny, which would be welcome. The Minister's comments are, however, at least a pragmatic step in the right direction. It is recognised that the Bill's Scottish provisions are distinctive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall say one negative thing and one positive thing. The honourable Member for Hertsmere mentioned secure training centres, but it was cheeky of him to suggest that the Bill was consistent with the previous Government's views. It is consistent with what we suggested during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and with our warnings to the previous Government about the danger of creating incoherence within the secure estate. Had they taken our advice, there would have been no need to revisit the topic. We are seeking to introduce coherence and effectiveness into the secure estate. That will benefit the way in which young offenders are dealt with and the protection of the public.
<P>
As regards the Scottish provisions, I reassure the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine Sir R. Smith that I do not aspire to become an expert in Scottish law. My hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office, will deal with Scottish elements of the Bill. Debate about such elements will be constructive, as the Committee will learn from it. We can always learn from Scottish law, which has aspects that those of us subject to the law of England and Wales look at with interest.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister is optimistic. Not many more opportunities for such debate will arise in the passage of other legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I was about to point out that wide scope exists for debate outside the Committee. I shall draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office. It will be appreciated that time is at a premium for a reforming Government who wish to improve a wide range of legislation. The Government are offering the best way forward, by allowing the Scottish element of the Bill to be dealt with coherently. I am sure that legislation that will affect Scotland is just as important to Scottish hon. Members and constitutents as aspects of the Bill that will affect England and Wales are to English and Welsh hon. Members and constituents.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order: Clauses 1 to 18; Clauses 25 to 29; Clause 77; Clauses 31 to 38; Schedule 2; Clauses 39 to 48; Schedule 3; Clauses 49 to 60; Schedule 4; Clauses 61 to 64; Schedule 5; Clauses 65 to 76; Clause 78; Clauses 89 to 97; Clauses 100 to 108; Clauses 19 to 24; Schedule 1; Clause 30; Clause 88; Clauses 79 to 86; Schedule 6; Clause 87; Clauses 98 and 99; new Clauses; Schedules 7 to 10; new Schedules.<P>

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Standing Advisory Council on Criminal Justice and the Penal System</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 2, line 2, after `it', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and on such aspects as it thinks appropriate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 82, in page 2, line 10, leave out `eighteen' and insert `twelve'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> First, I should declare an interest as a lawyer of many years' practise in the criminal field, as a recorder of the Crown court sitting at Crown courts in the south-east and as an acting metropolitan stipendiary magistrate sitting at various stipendiary courts in the London area.
<P>
On reading the clause, I immediately wondered whether the proposed advisory council is necessary or sensible, what costs will be involved and whether it will merely add the voice of yet another adviser in criminal justice. I set about trying to alter the clause to some extent.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 relates to the terms of reference of the advisory council. Clause 1(1) states that the advisory council has the purpose of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``advising the Secretary of State on the adequacy and effectiveness of the criminal law and procedure of the criminal courts''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. Such a council should be able to inititate advice on matters that it feels are important, in the same way as Select Committees can launch their own programmes and bring them to Ministers' attention. For that reason, my proposed amendment, which seeks to insert the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and on such aspects as it thinks appropriate'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would give the council authority to inititate action and lines of inquiry, and to concern itself with what it thinks might be important and not necessarily with what it is told to consider. The amendment would not limit the council; it would widen its scope.
<P>
My second amendment relates to numbers on the council, which it seeks to limit to 12 rather than 18. I put that forward for these reasons. When I considered whether the advisory council was necessary it occurred to me that the Home Office and Home Secretary must already be receiving advice on the criminal justice and penal systems from a whole variety of sources: judges, the police, the probation service, social services, magistrates, stipendiaries and Members of Parliament. Not only is the advisory council an unnecessary addition to those many groups, but it will probably cost a great deal of money.
<P>
The clause does not appear to say whether the appointments will be full or part time, what remuneration the appointees will receive or what staff or other facilities they will have. I would have asked and still perhaps can ask the Minister whether he would estimate the likely annual cost to the Exchequer of such an organisation and deal with those other questions. Eighteen is a lost of people to have on a committee. I do not know whether other hon. Members would agree, but whenever I have sat on committees involving 18 people nothing gets done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh: </B>(Gainsborough): Such as the Cabinet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Yes, such as the Cabinet. I have not sat in the Cabinet as yet and if my performance carries on like this I doubt if I will. But 18 seemed rather a large number. Select Committees such as the Home Affairs Select Committee have 11 members or thereabouts and that it plenty. The smaller the committee the more is likely to get done. I thought that 18 was too many on grounds of cost and administration and I therefore tabled the amendment. Much of what I have said may be redundant because I believe that the Government do not particularly favour the clause. Nor did I, but had it stood part of the Bill I would have wanted to alter it in the respects mentioned.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We are firm supporters of the general thrust of the clause, as was indicated in the other place. We were impressed by the support for the general principle that was offered, often from independent law Lords rather than whipped hereditary peers. We felt that the amendments added to the clause. With regard to amendment No. 81, we thought it entirely appropriate for the council to be able to look at issues independently and to report back. That fitted in with the ethos of the council, which was to provide a voice independent from the penal and criminal justice system, as opposed to the partisan voices that are normally heard in the House.
<P>
We are more concerned about amendment No. 82. The scope of the criminal justice and penal world is such that the council requires 18 rather than 12 members to function effectively and to allow full representation. We certainly support amendment No. 81, which adds to a clause that we wish to remain part of the Bill, but we do not support amendment No. 82 as it would reduce the effectiveness of the council, which we wish to see established.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The declaration of interest by the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) demonstrates his expertise, and I take his comments seriously. It is useful to have the benefit of experience from the courts, as long as we recognise the need for experience from elsewhere in the real world. He will, I am sure, forgive me if I do not respond to his questions of detail about the clause. He is right that we do not support the continuation of the clause. It was not a Government clause and we have not worked out costs or a strategy for its use.
<P>
Amendment No. 81 would widen the statutory purpose of the advisory council to too great an extent. It would include advising the Government on any aspect of the penal system that it thought appropriate. As currently drafted, the Bill limits the council to advising on the penal system when the Secretary of State refers matters to it. The Government are fundamentally opposed to the clause and will seek to remove it from the Bill. The extension would mean that the advisory council could effectively stray far and wide and could produce reports on issues that it thought important, but which were not high on the Government's list of priorities. That could be a wasteful use of resources. It must remain for the Government to set the agenda, having been elected to do so.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Moreover, operating in this way would make the council even more vulnerable to challenge, on the grounds that it would slow down the development and implementation of policy. It is that question that needs to be answered in relation to the proposed council.
<P>
As far as the number of members on the council is concerned, the hon. Member for Woking is right to suggest that the larger the number, the larger the costs that will be involved. At the same time, the intended purpose of the council is to provide advice on whole range of matters concerning the criminal justice and penal systems. Correspondingly, a wide range of expertise would be required amongst its members. Amendment No. 81 would widen the remit of the advisory council. Therefore, such a move would surely be counter-productive.
<P>
I have sympathy for the hon. Gentleman's point about the size of a body with 18 members, but it merely demonstrates the problem with the body: that it is designed to cover much too wide an area. We shall return to the point of whether there should be such a council on the clause stand part debate. 
<P>
The amendments that the hon. Gentleman proposes would not improve the body so as to allow us to support the continued inclusion of the clause. We should move on to the substantive issue of whether there should be such a council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Notwithstanding the Minister's kind comments about my operating in the unreal world of the courts, and having considered his arguments carefully, I am content to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It may be helpful if I say at this stage that we do not support the motion that the clause stand part of the Bill and will vote against it in order to delete the clause from the Bill.
<P>
The clause was inserted in the Bill at Third Reading in the House of Lords, when an amendment by Lord Ackner was accepted by a majority of nine votes on a Division. The Home Secretary has informed colleagues of his intention to seek removal of the clause from the Bill during the Committee stage.
<P>
The clause seeks to reconstitute the old Advisory Council on the Penal System, which operated in the 1960s and 1970s. The council provided valuable advice to the Government of the day, but the advice was not always accepted, nor was it always provided quickly--some reports took three to four years. The pace of life is faster and the demands of the public are much greater now.
<P>
We agree with the basic thrust of Lord Ackner's remarks that the Government should have well-informed advice to underpin their policies. However, we do not think that clause 1 provides a body that would achieve that end. Instead, well-targeted advice from people with specific expertise in particular areas is needed. That is already available from a wide range of sources, some of which did not exist in the 1960s and the 1970s. There has been a considerable change since then, which I shall outline.
<P>
The Criminal Justice Consultative Council contains leading representatives from across the criminal justice system. It is underpinned by local groups, which comprise senior practitioners within the area. That ensures that it has a well-informed understanding of the practicalities, as well as being able to take a broader and more strategic view when appropriate. It is the first body that is available to provide advice to Government.
<P>
The second is the trial issues group, also supported by sub-groups, which has a wealth of experience in practical and procedural issues. Thirdly, Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons and the probation service produce the thematic reports on penal issues of concern. The Law Commission also advises on the adequacy and effectiveness of the criminal law. We have input from the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission, both of which have a role to play in advising on efficiency and effectiveness in these matters--for example, the work on youth justice, which we shall consider later in the Bill.
<P>
The Audit Commission's report on youth justice was a seminal work, and has informed the provisions in the Bill to reform practice and legislation. In preparation for the reforms to the youth justice system, we have gone further and established a representative youth justice task force; there are formal and informal ways in which Government can seek and obtain advice.
<P>
Two other bodies will be in place when the Bill has completed its passage: the youth justice board, which will provide advice on the operation of the youth justice system and bring an important degree of coherence to the way in which young offenders are dealt with, and the sentencing advisory panel, which will have regard to the range of available disposals, their effectiveness and their appropriateness for different types of offence and offender when drawing up proposals for the Court of Appeal. It will have the benefit of advice from a wide range of organisations and will publish its advice.
<P>
Within Parliament, there is the Select Committee on Home Affairs; its terms of reference enable it to cover the whole area of criminal justice and penal policy. It consults widely and produces authoritative and well-researched reports on a range of issues. Taken together, a formidable array of bodies covers criminal justice and penal policy very effectively.
<P>
We have taken the debate in the House of Lords very seriously, and listened especially to the views of Lord Ackner, while considering whether there is still a case for advice from a new source with a wide-ranging remit. We have concluded that it would be difficult for the new body proposed in the clause, with wide terms of reference, in practice to contain representatives of all the sources of expertise that would be needed.
<P>
It would be wrong to engineer an arrangement that would have the effect of delaying the development and implementation of policies to which the elected Government are committed. We therefore concluded that such a body is not needed and, indeed, that it would be positively undesirable, without considering issues of cost to which the hon. Member for Woking referred in discussing amendments Nos. 81 and 82. Obviously, cost is a consideration, but the question is whether such a body would introduce delay and confusion rather than help the process of good government.
<P>
We are ready to consider ways of ensuring that we get the best advice from existing bodies. We are always open to suggestions for improvements. For example, the Criminal Justice Consultative Council's terms of reference do not give it a specific responsibility to advise the Government on issues within its remit. It has an obligation to consider them, but not a remit to advise.
<P>
The chairman of the council recently wrote to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary about the matter, and in response my right hon. Friend made it clear that he sees a good case for an amendment to the terms of reference to make the provision of advice explicit. That shows our willingness to respond constructively to points raised, including those that were raised when the clause was debated in the other place. However, we do not believe that a wide-ranging body of this sort would provide added value, and therefore we recommend its deletion. My recommendation to the Committee, therefore, is to vote against clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As the Minister said, the clause was added to the Bill in the other place against the wishes of the Government and we thought that the Government's attitude might be that expressed by the Minister. Nevertheless, the clause had a distinguished pedigree in the House of Lords, and a distinguished cast list of supporters, which included Lord Ackner, other senior members of the judiciary, former Home Secretaries and those with experience in the field. We therefore think that it is right at least to take the matter seriously when so many authoritative voices argue in favour of it.
<P>
We are not however, entirely convinced by the case made by those who want a standing advisory council to be established. The legitimate argument advanced by the Minister was to question why such a body was needed when there are already so many other bodies in the field. The Minister read out a long list of them: the Criminal Justice Consultative Council, the trial issues group, Her Majesty's inspectorate of prisons and others. We must be strict in asking whether another body is needed.
<P>
The same process of justifying the creation of yet another body must be applied to some of the Minister's proposals in the Bill, including the sentencing advisory panel. Why is such a panel needed? There are already so many other bodies, and matters such as producing guidelines for the courts in certain types of case are already in the hands of the Court of Appeal. We shall ask similar questions in later debates.
<P>
Among the questions that must be asked is the following: if such a body is needed, is the proposed form the right one to fill that need? My hon. Friend the Member for Woking asked such questions by means of his amendments. He put his finger on the matter when he referred to the number of people who would be on the standing advisory council. It was an interesting revelation that the reason why my hon. Friend thought that the body might not function well in having 18 members, which he sought to reduce to 12, was the reason given by the Liberal Democrats that it would function effectively. That was a strange giveaway by the Liberal Democrats. It is not my experience that the effectiveness of such a body would be increased by having so many members. My hon Friend's amendment to reduce the membership to 12 was sensible. That is one reason why we do not think that the body takes the right form, even if a need were established.
<P>
There are other questions to be asked, especially about the membership of such a body. That point is relevant to this clause and to later clauses. If such a body were to be set up, it is right that it should include the authoritative voices of people of eminence and relevant experience. However, it is also important that the voices of ordinary people, especially those who have been victims of crime, or who are apt to be so--for example, small businessmen and pensioners--should not be lost. Their voice needs to be heard too, alongside the voices of the great and the good, the people of eminence and distinction. We sometimes have a nagging worry that the voices of people of eminence and distinction, whose voices must be listened to, might swamp the voice of the man in the street, of the victim of crime, the sort of person whose shop might be broken into or of those whose peaceful and tranquil estate might be disturbed. We would therefore have a nagging worry about the body that is proposed, a worry which extends to other parts of the Bill too.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking was right to highlight the issue of cost. Such bodies must be justified by asking how much they will cost and to what benefit. That is another question which we shall ask later in our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
In the meantime, we know the Government's views on the matter, which we share. The case has not been made for the proposed body and we are not convinced that it would fulfil a need, if indeed there was such a need. There is no case to be made, and although we do not wish to delay the Committee further on consideration of the matter, we want our views to be recorded.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan: </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): Liberal Democrat Members support the retention of the clause. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere pointed out, it was widely supported in another place. It has also received support from those involved in the penal and criminal justice systems. The clause does not create a new body, but reconstitutes one that used to exist. I welcome the constructive comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the possible composition of the body. Representatives from victim support groups or local community safety forums, who are at the sharp end of the crime explosion, could be included among the 18 members.
<P>
The principle argument against the body is that the Government might choose not to take its good advice. I accept the Minister's comments that he receives advice from other areas, but it would not be harmful to have additional advice. As Lord Ackner has argued convincingly, this encompassing body would produce a different form of advice which would be useful to the Government.
<P>
It has also been argued that too much time would be taken to issue reports. However, that could be beneficial. Some of our poorest laws have been made too quickly. Some trends in criminal justice have been responses to a particular event, or set of events, that were too swift. We can reflect with hindsight that those matters would have been better dealt with if they had been given longer consideration. There have been some major changes in sentencing policy, for example, that would have benefited from a deeper and more serious consideration, especially regarding their financial implications.
<P>
There is always a risk that tabloid editorials will perform an advisory function for Governments. Liberal Democrat Members felt that that was certainly the case for the previous Government. The Sun, or a similar newspaper, would produce an editorial to which Ministers would respond on the ``Today'' programme. We want to avoid that situation. We would prefer to listen to Ministers' responses to a considered report from an advisory council.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members strongly support the proposal that there should be annual reports to both Houses of Parliament. Parliament is a political hot house, whose members divide along partisan lines over many issues. An impartial report from an outside body would stimulate debates that did not reply on proposals from one side of the House or the other. There is much flexibility between parties in the modern political scene, and there would be some interesting responses to such an advisory panel.
<P>
We want to retain the clause, but I am encouraged by the Minister's statement that the Government are considering alternative ways of dealing with some of the functions that it proposes. If the Government succeed in striking the clause from the Bill, we shall be interested in those alternative responses, such as the use of the criminal justice consultative council, which is already in existence. However, despite those provisos, we support the retention of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps I can give the hon. Member for Hallam further reassurance. He has acknowledged my statement that the Government are willing to listen to suggestions about the criminal justice consultative council:
<P>
There is considerable support for the idea that the Government should receive advice that includes careful consideration of the views of victims and of the communities that are damaged by crime, rather than advice from a specific body whose functions are not clear. That is why Lord Ackner's amendment received support. The Government accept the general thrust of that. However, the new body proposed in the clause will not be helpful. That is why we want to delete the clause. It is not because we think that objective advice from outside Parliament is unimportant. If the hon. Member for Hallam consults the list of advisory bodies that I referred to, he will see that there is a wide range of advice available to the Government.
<P>
It is not simply a question of what advice is available, but what the Government does with that advice. the hon. Gentleman should study the way in which we have responded to the Select Committee on Home Affairs, some of whose reports previously were left hanging around for a long time, and the way in which we have established the task force on youth justice, involving practitioners and representatives of victims, and responded quickly to the advice that we sought from that body. It should be crystal clear that we have a Government who are prepared to listen and to take on board advice.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I understand that former Home Secretaries in the other place were supportive of the clause. What advice from the Home Office is available now that was not available to them in their day, which made them think that such a body was necessary? Has something changed since their day, which would make them not realise that such advice is now available?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am not sure whether those who supported the clause fully appreciated the wide range of additional bodies that now exist, to which I referred in my introductory remarks on the clause. I hope that, on reflection, we shall be able to persuade them that the Government have the necessary range of advice available and are listening to that advice.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine referred to the views of previous Home Secretaries. It may be useful to reflect that, in January 1980, the then Home Secretary--now Lord Whitelaw--decided not to reappoint the Advisory Council on the Penal System, as it then was, as part of the drive to reduce the number of such bodies in all Departments. In response to the Home Affairs Select Committee's report in 1980-81, the Government of the day claimed that, where Ministers needed advice on which policy to adopt, the best solution was to set up a body specifically fit for that purpose. They rejected the idea of setting up a single, all-purpose advisory body.
<P>
Time has moved on and several opinions have changed. The previous Government established a number of bodies that gave advice that was not available at that stage. It is interesting that the then Home Secretary was advising on the establishment of specific groups. I gave the example of the advisory task force on youth justice. By bringing together the expertise from a wide range of individuals who can draw on the experience of whole professions and their representative bodies, it is possible in a short time to get good quality advice, which enables the Government to respond quickly to the need for change. The youth justice system is an excellent example. The history of this issue needs to be taken seriously.
<P>
The sentencing advisory panel is an interesting way to look at the manner in which sentencing operates. The purpose of the sentencing advisory panel is to assist the Court of Appeal. The panel will seek views from other bodies, with a particular interest or expertise on sentencing matters, and then formulate its own views and give them to the Court of Appeal. We shall debate this point later, but it is important to realise that, in deleting this clause, there is a new opportunity to bring a wide range of views into the process that leads to the Court of Appeal issuing sentencing guidelines.
<P>
The appointment to that advisory body will be a matter for the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the Home Secretary. People appointed to that body will include academic lawyers, researchers, those who sentence, sentence providers and one or two people who are independent of the criminal justice system. It is also expected that the panel will seek views from a wide range of interest groups: the police service, justices' clerks, groups with experience of working with offenders and victims organisations that relate particularly to the hon. Gentleman's good point about the need for such views to be included in the panel's consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is an important point. In view of the comments that the hon. Gentleman has just made about victims being consulted and the distinction he drew between the membership of the body and those whom the body consulted, would he agree that it is important for any such body, including the sentencing advisory panel, not just to consult victims or their representatives but to have them sitting on the body itself? I did not hear victims mentioned in the list of those who would be sitting on the sentencing advisory panel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I referred to one or two people who are completely independent of the criminal justice system, people other than lawyers and those involved as practitioners. The door is open to that consideration. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the representation of victims is iportant. I should like to pay tribute to the work of Victim Support in making a coherent and constructive contribution to debates about the criminal justice system and the law. Its advice over recent years, provided publicly to the previous Government and now to us and to anyone who will listen, has helped to make the criminal justice system more sensitive to the needs of victims.
<P>
There is a long way to go and such issues will be covered in reports that will be coming out shortly on the needs of vulnerable witnesses. The hon. Gentleman is pushing at an open door in asking for the needs of victims to be considered, both structurally and in terms of our debates in Committee and elsewhere. I hope that what I have said will demonstrate that we have listened to the debate in the House of Lords. We have listened to the points that led Lord Ackner to propose his amendment. We have accepted the arguments about effective and comprehensive advice to Government so that we get the best possible decision making. I hope that the Committee will also accept that retaining the clause in the Bill is neither helpful nor necessary and that we can therefore delete the clause and proceed accordingly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 do not oppose the principle of anti-social behaviour orders, which will be a useful tool in preventing some types of behaviour, but they define the circumstances in which such orders could be issued. We want to introduce two concepts. Amendment No. 38 would provide for a test of reasonableness to ascertain whether behaviour was anti-social. Amendment No. 39 would ensure that the behaviour was serious before an order was made.
<P>
We are worried that there may be attempts to secure anti-social behaviour orders for behaviour that might simply be naughty or a little extraordinary, rather than for serious anti-social behaviour. We want to ensure that it is not deemed anti-social to be a young person hanging out on a street corner; to cook the wrong sort of food in a flat; to be the wrong colour in the wrong part of town at the wrong time of day. We can envisage members of the public going to a police station and telling the police that they were disturbed by a specific event, and requesting an anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
The Minister has clarified outside the House and in informal discussions that anti-social behaviour must be serious for such an order to be made. We want to explore that in Committee, and ensure that we do not introduce, in response to public demand, a provision that could be applied inappropriately.
<P>
Amendment No. 38 would introduce the important concept of reasonableness into the measure. The phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it appears to the authority''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is too weak in the light of the possible consequences of an order.
<P>
Amendment No. 39 would include the word ``serious'' in the clause. Other criminal justice measures accept the concept of seriousness; it can be tested in law. That is especially important when dealing with concepts such as alarm or distress. Many people, including, probably, some constituents of members of the Committee, are alarmed by someone who wears the wrong clothes, and feel distressed when someone plays the wrong sort of music. That should not be in the scope of an anti-social behaviour order. Only behaviour that can be deemed genuinely disruptive should be covered by such an order.
<P>
We look forward to the Minister's response on providing for reasonableness and seriousness in the Bill, to satisfy us about the nature of the orders and the circumstances under which they would be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are considering the important subject of anti-social behaviour orders, which will require scrutiny. I do not wish to be unkind, but the subject requires more scrutiny than the hon. Member for Hallam has given it. We must scrutinise the Government's proposals and examine other methods of dealing with the matter. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 add little to the Bill.
<P>
However, I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the Minister's comments in other places that the provision was intended to tackle serious incidents of anti-social behaviour. We hope to hear more from the Minister about that.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments that we have tabled is to explore in more detail the legal basis of anti-social behaviour orders, and to consider some of the important subjects that are of interest to many people outside the House. We want to establish more precisely the definition of an act of anti-social behaviour. It is not sufficient for the Government to paint with a broad brush and talk about problems of anti-social behaviour, especially on specific estates. We all take those problems seriously. However, the legal definition needs to be more precise than that in the Bill.
<P>
One of the main purposes of the amendments is to ascertain whether the provision is workable, and whether it helps to deal with the problems in practice. The Minister will know that elsewhere the issue has been raised whether anti-social behaviour orders could breach the European convention on human rights. The Minister told me, in reply to a written question on the matter, that in his view such orders would not breach the convention. However, distinguished academics have produced reports expressing doubt about that. I shall refer to one in particular, by six extremely distinguished legal academics. They believe that there is at least a risk that the orders will breach the convention. The Committee should bear that risk in mind as it considers the detailed provisions.
<P>
One of the main complaints raised by the legal academics and others is that the anti-social behaviour order
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``takes sweepingly defined conduct within its ambit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 149 and 35 are intended to explore that aspect of the matter. Amendment No. 149 would remove the reference to behaving ``in an anti-social manner''. We wonder whether that phrase might be surplus to requirements, as it does not seem to add much to the Bill. We should prefer not to run the risk of incorporating in the Bill anything that looks like a slogan or a presentational device. If the Minister considers the phrase important, perhaps he will explain what the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acted . . . in an anti-social manner''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
add to the Bill in legal terms.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 is important, because it is intended to ascertain what behaviour is covered by the Bill. It asks how far the Bill would extend the boundaries of the law. The amendment would restrict the type of behaviour that could lead to the making of an order to behaviour that is covered by existing criminal or civil law.
<P>
I had the privilege of being present when the idea of the anti-social behaviour order had its first outing in the House of Commons. That was during the passage of the Housing Act 1996. I hope that I am not doing anyone an injustice through a lapse of memory but I do not think that any other member of this Committee served on the Committee for that Bill. The community safety order that was then proposed--it has had a change of name since then--was restricted to acts that breached existing civil and criminal law. The Labour party spokesman tabled the relevant amendment.
<P>
The Committee was told that it was intended that the proposed order could be granted if the defendant had committed at least five unlawful acts. The amendment listed the types of action, covered by existing criminal or civil law, that would trigger such an order. Now it seems that the Labour party has abandoned that approach. Instead of relating the provision to acts that would be criminal offences or breaches of civil law, there has been a shift to a far wider type of provision. On the face of it, any type of action leading to ``harassment, alarm or distress'' could give rise to an order. We need to know more and, more precisely, what those actions might be.
<P>
It is the imprecision of the clause that has caused concern. The report by distinguished academic lawyers that I quoted from earlier states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The conduct triggering an order can, under the present proposal, be wholly legal behaviour. A requirement could, however, be added, that at least some of the conduct involved must constitute a criminal offence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Have the Government moved from seeking to define anti-social behaviour? The Minister indicated assent a moment ago. Is such behaviour no longer defined as acts that are criminal offences or in breach of civil law? Could such acts include those that are presently wholly legal if they generate harassment, alarm or distress? Are we extending the definition from behaviour for which a civil injunction can be obtained to that which is currently wholly legal?
<P>
As the Bill stands, the elements of the offence consist entirely of the effect that behaviour or actions have on the alleged victim. The words ``harassment'', ``alarm'' or ``distress''--the feelings that must be engendered in the person who could be the victim of an offence--come from section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, which was introduced by the previous Government. In another amendment, we also ask about intimidation. The Minister looks puzzled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain something. He referred to harassment, alarm and distress and asked about intimidation. Intimidation is the act of intimidating someone, whereas harassment, alarm and distress are the reactions that are caused in individuals. I may be in danger of missing the hon. Gentleman's point. Perhaps he could clarify it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Certainly. Is intimidation covered by harassment, alarm and distress? That is a point of some importance and we should like an answer from the Minister of State in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am still not clear about the hon. Gentleman's grammatical point. If somebody is intimidated, that is likely to cause him harassment, alarm and distress, is it not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have perhaps not explained myself sufficiently clearly. The point is that the feeling of intimidation is important. The Bill is defined by reference to feelings of harassment, alarm and distress on the part of alleged victims. Is the feeling of intimidation covered by that definition?
<P>
That is a slightly separate point from the one that I now want to make. The Bill is defined entirely by reference to the effect of behaviour on the victim, but it does not say what that behaviour is. Under the Public Order Act 1986, only certain defined behaviour, which causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, leads to an offence. In section 5 of the 1986 Act, which is commonly used, such behaviour is defined as using
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour . . . within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know from that provision precisely what behaviour is covered in existing legislation. It is fair to say that section 5 has a fairly wide ambit. The definition in it is well understood and well worked, and I gather from a written parliamentary answer from the Minister of State that it is well understood by the courts. In 1996, there were some 15,000 successful prosecutions for the offence that is set out in section 5. The courts know what type of mischief and behaviour it is aimed at.
<P>
The anti-social behaviour in the Bill is not so well defined, and that is an important difference. We do not know what type of behaviour is covered by the anti-social behaviour order. To deal with that question and to rebut the charge of duplication and relabelling for presentational purposes, I invite the Minister to give the Committee an example of behaviour that would be covered by the anti-social behaviour order but which is not covered by sections 4(1)(a) or 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. We know that the effect on a victim--or on a potential victim, as suggested by the use of the word ``likely''--has to be harassment, alarm or distress, but will the Minister give us an example of behaviour causing that when he winds up the debate?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like the Minister to go a little further when he talks about the types of behaviour that might be covered. We believe that the Government have given us some inkling of the behaviour that they have in mind with regard to the anti-social behaviour order. The Home Secretary in particular has said on several occasions that the order is one of a number of measures that he is taking to tackle disorder and incivility. Is it intended that--[Interruption.]--not inclement weather but incivil behaviour causing harassment, alarm or distress should qualify for an order, in view of the Home Secretary's bracketing of disorder with incivility? Is he thinking of this order when he talks about incivility?
<P>
I remind the Minister of the Oxford dictionary's definition of incivility:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Uncivil or impolite behaviour; discourtesy, rudeness . . . Lack of good manners or good breeding''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is that the sort of incivility of which the Home Secretary was thinking and which would therefore be covered by the order? The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine is laughing at that, but if incivil behaviour caused harassment, alarm or distress, would not it qualify for the making of such an order? If not, will the Minister explain why not? According to the terms of the sweeping legal definition, anti-social behaviour is any behaviour that leads to such feelings.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman brings to mind my feeling of harassment, alarm and distress which frequently occur at the incivil behaviour of hon. Members in the Chamber during Prime Minister's Question Time. I wonder whether, for example, swearing on the bus, which is decidedly incivil, will be covered by the order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that the usual channels use far worse types of order than the anti-social behaviour order to deal with behaviour they do not like in the Chamber. It is for the Minister to respond to the hon. Gentleman's other point. I, too, want to know whether the order will cover that sort of behaviour.
<P>
It is important that when magistrates deal with applications for anti-social behaviour orders from local authorities or the police, they have some idea of what sort of behaviour the Government have in mind. We want to know not only about the behaviour that is covered by existing legislation, but what other types of behaviour could be covered.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam alluded to eccentricity, but the order goes further. If behaviour is not even incivil, rude or discourteous but merely eccentric or unusual, could it trigger an order? What about people of an eccentric disposition, who do things that upset their neighbours and cause them alarm and distress? Is such behaviour enough to qualify for an anti-social behaviour order? I might enjoy, for example, dressing up as a red Indian chief and doing a war dance--not a weather dance, which is not needed at present--in my back garden. I might send smoke signals to other people in the great Sioux nation, whom I hope would live nearby. Would such behaviour qualify for the making of an order? I shall spare the Minister from dressing up as a red Indian to give a more vivid example.
<P>
Amendment No. 3 is designed to explore the character and sensitivity of the person on whose behalf an order may be made. Does the character or sensibility of people who are apt to suffer harassment, alarm or distress as a result of the actions in question matter? The person complaining could be a sensitive soul. The behaviour being complained about might not cause harassment, alarm or distress to people of everyday firmness--perhaps such as the Minister and myself--but it might to a sensitive soul. If such a person were to complain to the council, wanting protection, should it apply for an order, and should the magistrates grant it? How does the Bill stop such applications and the granting of orders in response to them?
<P>
The Opposition want to hear about that issue as well. Does it matter what sort of person is affected by the behaviour in question. The Committee will later consider behaviour that is likely to cause everybody to have the feelings about which I have spoken. I am speaking about sensitive souls. Will such people be able to complain and to seek the making of an order, perhaps against their neighbour?
<P>
Amendment No. 36 deals with the question of who can apply for an Order. Persons living in the same household are excluded from applying for an order, but those in adjoining households are not. I shall come to that point later in respect of another amendment. On the face of it, that provision is understandable, and I shall not take issue with the Government.
<P>
I should, however, like to ask the Minister to explore the issue of houses with multiple occupation. Courts have sometimes held that people living together in such a house constitute a single household, when people in the street or in the real world--I do not mean to cause any offence to my hon. Friend the Member for Woking--have not felt that that is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> My hon. Friend raises a key issue. He will be aware that in the courts, the offence of burglary is based on entry into a dwelling with intent to steal therein. The courts have often held that entry into an individual dwelling within a house with multiple occupation--in this case a room--constitutes a trespass. The criminal law distinctly separates dwellings within the same block.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. The Committee will reflect on the fact that his experience which he outlined earlier, means that he is likely to encounter such problems every day. That experience adds more force to his argument. Will the Minister deal with that point?
<P>
All hon. Members know about the problems that are experienced in specific inner-city areas and elsewhere, and we want to help. We have to be convinced, however, that the proposals are workable. The Committee would not be doing its job if it did not ask such questions. The serious doubts that I have outlined have been raised in some quarters in a much more elegant and academic fashion than I could ever attempt. The have been raised by distinguished commentators and the Government owe us a response.
<P>
We would not want to run the risk of scrutinising legislation in Committee while the Government were introducing provisions on the Floor of the House to incorporate the European convention on human rights into our law, and finding that one of the first challenges under the convention, if it is the will of the House to incorporate it, came about as a result of this Bill. That would be a shame, but there is a real risk of that, according to this distinguished academic opinion, unless we have a better idea of what the Bill covers and clear answers to the questions I have put to the Minister. It is no good his saying that the behaviour in question is any behaviour which causes harassment, alarm or distress. We know that already: we want to know what type of behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I shall speak particularly to amendment No. 3 as I am concerned that it could water down the Bill. In my previous life as a personal injury practitioner, I came across a similar definition called ``reasonable fortitude'' when dealing with people who suffered psychiatric injuries. It causes great problems in civil law, particularly as the psychiatric evidence and thinking these days is that people can suffer adverse consequences whether they are people of exceptional fortitude or wilting violets. The problems they may experience bear no relation to whether they are persons of reasonable fortitude. Indeed, it may be of interest to Opposition Members to know that the Law Commission has been greatly troubled by this and has produced a large report on psychiatric injury.
<P>
When a group of pensioners has been affected, I can foresee arguments about whether we should apply a test of reasonable fortitude for pensioners as opposed to people of any age or, if children are particularly affected by the anti-social behaviour, about the reasonable fortitude that may be expected of a child. Equally, there may be people who are now no longer of a reasonable firmness, but who perhaps were before the anti-social behaviour commenced--the anti-social behaviour has turned them into nervous wrecks. I am worried about a definition that could dramatically whittle down the effectiveness and availability of these orders.
<P>
On Friday I am visiting Grahame park, one of the housing estates in my constituency, and some of the people I shall meet have suffered dramatically from the anti-social behaviour of a relatively small group of people. They would be extremely concerned if, having persuaded the police or the local authority to go for one of these orders, they had to undergo psychiatric assessment to determine whether they were persons of reasonable firmness before any progress could be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has slightly missed the point of the amendment. The test is not of the individual who is affected: there is no suggestion of psychiatric testing of the person in court. The test is a generic one of whether a person of reasonable firmness would be offended. There is no suggestion of testing each individual who has been harassed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I refer the question back. How do we define a person of reasonable fortitude in that context? That is exactly the problem that has troubled the civil law when trying to come up with a definition of reasonable fortitude. If a group of pensioners is affected, are we talking about the reasonable firmness of pensioners or of the proverbial man on the Clapham omnibus? That definition is difficult. I want to be able to tell the people I see on Friday that the amendment has not succeeded, because it could cause them considerable difficulty.
<P>
I would prefer to leave it to the good sense of the magistrates, particularly those in my area who have a lot of common sense when looking at these issues. If the police or the local authority get bullish in their approach, there is no guarantee that the magistrates would grant such an order. They have common sense and their feet on the ground. They know the sort of things we are talking about here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the amendments. If we study clause 2 and the definition of an anti-social behaviour order, it must be clear to all of us that it is something of a dog's dinner, with language taken from a variety of sources in an attempt to put together jigsaw pieces that do not fit.
<P>
The language comes from part III of the Housing Act 1996, which was intended to deal with so-called ``neighbours from hell'', and from the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The whole thing is most unsatisfactory. Clause 2(1)(a) states that an application for an order may be made if,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person has acted . . . in an anti-social manner, that is to say, in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Quite plainly, the Government are defining an anti-social manner as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fundamental weakness because anti-social behaviour is a subjective test, and all sorts of difficulties may arise.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere drew attention to several difficulties and gave particular examples. For example, smoking is often thought of as being anti-social behaviour. Let us say that there is a telephone box outside a block of flats and I persist in smoking therein. Anybody would say that that was anti-social behaviour. However, does it amount to conduct that would merit an order under clause 2(1)(a)? What terrifies me about the loose wording is that it is a charter to punish the eccentric, the oddball and the person who does not conform.
<P>
I commend the wording that I think was proposed by the Association of Magistrates--I shall be corrected in due course if I am wrong. It wanted the wording to read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that the person has acted in an anti-social manner, that is, in a manner in which was threatening, abusive or insulting towards two or more persons not of the same household, which was likely to cause those other persons harassment, alarm or distress thereby.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a much better description.
<P>
I said that the language from this section reminds us of part III of the Housing Act 1996 and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It also reminds us of the Public Order Act 1986. Those advising the Government in drafting the Bill have effectively dipped into those Acts and pulled out a mixture that will not work well together. Let us compare the language of clause 2(1)(a) with section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. Section 5 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person is guilty of an offence if he--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or
<P>
(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive, or insulting, within the hearing or sight of of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>At Committee stage, it is helpful to compare the sort of conduct that is envisaged to be a breach of section 5 of the Public Order Act with the sort of conduct that is sufficient for an anti-social order to be made. Let us remember that section 4 of the Public Order Act relates to a criminal offence. The Minister must answer the question. Is it possible that conduct that falls short of a criminal offence is sufficient to grant an order under clause 2? If that is possible, is it desirable? Many of us would suggest that it is not.
<P>
When matters arising under the Public Order Act are dealt with in court, the seriousness indicators and aggravating factors must be taken into account. These are such matters as racial motivation, group actions, victims specially targeted, a high degree of planning and night-time behaviour. Do the Government think that such behaviour is more serious than the behaviour defined in the clause? I am sure that the answer will be ``yes''. If that is the case, why is the maximum penalty, under section 4 of the Public Order Act, six months on summary conviction, or a fine, whereas under the Bill, which suggests that the behaviour must be less serious, the penalty is much higher, namely five years on indictment?
<P>
If the behaviour described in the Bill is necessarily thought to be more serious than that defined in section 4 of the Public Order Act, what is wrong with other public order offences? Section 4(2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is distributed or displayed, by a person inside a dwelling and the other person''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
who is harassed, alarmed or distressed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is also inside that, or another, dwelling.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain why that does not apply to an anti-social behaviour order? Why has that saving clause been omitted?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere referred to the definition of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not of the same household as himself''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That matter must be dealt with. Much anti-social behaviour, almost by definition, takes place in buildings that contain several different dwellings or households.
<P>
Section 4 also requires proof of an intention to cause harassment, alarm or distress. However, clause 2 does not require any such proof. Why not? How can that be right? Conduct merely has to be unreasonable. If the defendant--the person on the wrong end of the complaint--fails to show that his conduct was reasonable in the circumstances, why can he not say that he had no intention whatever of causing the alarm or harassment complained of? Surely he could not have an order made against him. However, if he said that he had no such intention, it would be to no avail under this clause, Will the Minister tell the Committee why section 4 of the Public Order Act is not satisfactory to cover the conduct to which the Bill alludes?
<P>
If section 4 is not unsatisfactory, perhaps the Minister will deal at some length with section 5. The language of section 5 is very similar to that of the Bill.
<P>
If states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person is guilty of an offence if he uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or displays any writing, sign or visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Identical words appear in the Bill. In what circumstances does the Minister envisage that people would not have recourse to section 5, but could make an application to the court for an anti-social behaviour order? In what circumstances would people decide that they were not covered by section 5 of the Public Order Act but that they had a cast-iron case under clause 2(1) of the Bill?
<P>
The Minister could give all sorts of examples and claim that they were covered by clause 2(1), but I could argue equally well that they would come under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. I see the Minister scribbling furiously. The Committee needs to know what conduct fits where. Behaviour that could be subject to an order under clause 2(1) would be an offence under section 5.
<P>
The Minister might also say which he considers more serious--an offence under section 5, or that which leads to an anti-social behaviour order. Which would carry more weight and gravitas? Which would create the stigma that lasted longest? The Minister may claim that an offence under section 5 would be more grave. In that case, why is such an offence summary only, with a maximum penalty of a fine, when an offence under clause 2(1) is not only summary but indictable, with a possible custodial sentence?
<P>
We must examine words such as ``harassment'', ``alarm'' and ``distress'' carefully. The Committee will be fascinated to hear a little about the criminal law on that point. The Minister will be able to tell us how the definitions apply, through precedent or other authority, to anti-social behaviour orders.
<P>
Harassment, alarm and distress are clearly alternatives. Doubtless, the Minister will confirm that. In the case of Lodge v. the Director of Public Prosecutions, it was held that whether a person was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress was a matter of fact to be determined by the court. The court indicated that it was sufficient for the other person--in that case a police officer--to feel alarm, harassment or distress for someone else, such as a child. The Under-Secretary is shaking his head and advising the Minister. No doubt he is telling him that I have cited the law reports inaccurately.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I intervene to help the Committee and enable advice to be given more generally. The case that my hon. Friend has cited is one with which I am familiar. To the best of my recollection he has done so correctly. I think that the consultations between the Under-Secretary and the Minister are finished.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): I was shaking my head not because I thought that the hon. Gentleman had wrongly cited the case but because in Lodge the intention, if I recall rightly, was that a police officer should be able to say that a child was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress by reason of the action in question.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> In that case, perhaps the Under-Secretary would care to respond to my next point. Can he or any of his colleagues confirm in absolute terms that if I, an adult, witnessed a child outside being struck by another child, who was aged nine--I choose my words carefully--the nine-year-old who had struck out could not be taken to court for an anti-social behaviour order to be made against him, because of my distress and alarm? I see that no one from the Government is rising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The age limit is 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Oh. The Minister thinks that, does he? Well, perhaps he can tell us something else. He will know the criminal law as well as I do, and it is clear that where a person's age is to be determined--no wonder the civil servants are writing notes so quickly--it is to be determined as his or her age on appearance at court. Has the Minister grasped the point? Unless he can give me an absolute undertaking--as he no doubt will--that it would be impossible to lay a complaint for an anti-social behaviour order against someone aged under 10, my point stands. A person's age is determined for the purpose of proceedings as the age upon conviction or finding in the court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. I should not want to claim that I know the criminal law as well as he does, but I understand how the provision would operate. The decision to apply for an order would have to be made by either the police or the local authority, in conjunction with the other. If the hon. Gentleman's point were even theoretically correct, that would provide the necessary protection. As to children under 10, the child safety order that we shall reach later in our consideration of the Bill would deal with behaviour that caused concern not by making it criminal but by identifying it as giving rise to certain action. Such action would be in the child's interest as much as that of anyone who might have been affected by the behaviour. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept, without my going too deeply into the detail, that the example he used is not relevant to the way in which an anti-social behaviour order would operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> With respect, the whole point of the Committee is to go deeply into things. If we were on Second Reading, it would be another matter. I wonder whether those who advise the Minister can deal with the point that I put to him, even if he and his hon. Friends cannot--I am looking round to see whether anyone will rescue him, but they do not. Can he confirm that if I as a parent witnessed a child--whom I shall, for the sake of argument, assume to be aged 10--
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran (Beverley and Holderness):</B> Yes, make it easier for the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Exactly. Under Lodge, if I saw that child striking another child, and as a result I felt alarmed for that other child, could I seek, via the local authority or police, an anti-social behaviour order? If I would be forbidden from doing so, I should be told so in Committee. Perhaps the Minister will also confirm that the general criminal principles do not apply, and that in no circumstances would it be possible for an authority to lay a complaint against a person who is under 10 on the date when the complaint is laid, rather than on the date of appearance in court? I should be grateful for the Minister's absolute assurance on those matters.
<P>
The debate has drawn attention to the Government's difficulties, and I must give the Ministers a chance to speak to each other. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere drew attention to many problems and I agree that the language is wishy-washy. I speak for many on the Opposition Benches who have strong civil liberties views: we need certainty. I, for one, remain worried about the language of the first part of the clause. Surely we do not want a charter to punish those who are abnormal, off-beat or eccentric. I cannot, for the life of me, see that the first part of the clause will avoid that prospect.
<P>
The lady who lives near me who wanders up and down the street waving her arms is a bit eccentric--some would say mad. She is harmless, but she has been known to frighten children. Those of us who are concerned about civil liberties do not want to live in a state where conduct that falls short of what is required by the criminal law could result in oppressive action being taken against those who do not intend their actions to cause offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I begin by declaring an interest: I am a practising barrister and a member of Goldsmith chambers in the Temple. In the 15 years that have been a Member of Parliament I have concentrated on my duties here, so I suppose that as far as the Minister is concerned, that means that I live in the real world and do no spend too much time in the courts.
<P>
I want to speak in general terms about the clause and the amendments, rather than getting stuck in legal technicalities, which may weary members of the Committee.
<P>
The debate is worrying; that is why I support the amendments. We start every speech on the issue by saying that the problem is very serious; that is especially true in respect of some estates in my constituency. However, year after year, Parliament introduces new remedies to try to deal with these problems, some of which are already on the statute book. There is a danger that we will fool ourselves into thinking that passing these remedies, which every year become more draconian, will deal with the problem. However, most of the problems arise from the fundamental social, moral and ethical structures of society, which Parliament, acting through leglislation, cannot address. If we pass these remedies, which every year become more generalised in scope, more draconian in nature and more divorced from our traditional legal protections, there is a real danger that we will suddenly trip into a repressive society. That may seem an extreme claim and I am sure it is a million miles from what the Minister, who is a charming, honourable and decent man, want to achieve; but as parliamentarians, charged as we are with the protection of civil liberties, we should be concerned.
<P>
As we have already heard, it is unclear precisely what the new, broadly based definition of anti-social behaviour will achieve. How will it result in more convictions than are possible under existing legislation? We already have the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. We have the many civil remedies which have been avalable in our court for centuries. We have the Public Order Act 1986, particularly section 5. We have the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. They are all closely defined. What will this new provision add to what we already have, particularly as section 5 of the 1986 Act refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let us look at the various types of people that the clause is designed to deal with. The vicious character who terrorises a neighbourhood can be dealt with under existing legislation and by injunctions. Do we really believe that Parliament should introduce new legislation to deal with people who are simply hanging around on street corners? The police already have powers to move people on. Is this the way to deal with the problem of teenagers hanging around on street corners, sitting on walls, kicking paving stones and leaving litter around? Should we not look at the facilities available to those young people and see why they are behaving in that way?
<P>
If people are playing music too loud or irritating neighbours, there are existing measures that can be used. In any event, do we want to trigger a mechanism that could result in a criminal conviction just to deal with people playing loud music? The Minister will naturally say of course not and that he is concerned not with that problem but with the young and vicious thugs who are terrorising the neighbourhood. If so, he must tell us why existing enactments are not sufficient to deal with the problem. The shortcomings lie not in the nature of our existing criminal law but in the resources available to the police to deal with the problem. There is no point in Parliament deluding itself that every year it can introduce more and more legislation, repressive in its nature, and yet not provide adequate resources for the police to deal with these problems.
<P>
The clause is not carefully targeted. It is far too sweepingly defined and goes against the grain of our existing criminal law. It gives local agencies unlimited discretion. In setting up bodies like the Crown Prosecution Service and in the way we have traditionally conducted our criminal law, we have always been careful to ensure that Executive agencies are not given powers of prosecution and pursuit over ordinary citizens, but that is precisely what we are doing here. A senior police officer or a local council officer, not the Crown Prosecution Service or trained lawyers, will be able to instigate proceedings which could result in criminal prosecutions.
<P>
It is claimed that the clause is designed simply to prevent people acting in an anti-social way--for example terrorising neighbours. That is why the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is fair. The hon. Member for Hendon mentioned the man on the Clapham omnibus. In Parliament, when we frame new laws we have always recognised the conecept of a reasonble person. In this instance someone could behave in an anti-social way and there might be a so-called victim, although it was actually a victimless crime. That is dangerous. Parliament has always said that if a crime is committed, there must be a victim.
<P>
The Minister has not yet explained where the victim is. The concept of anti-social behaviour is so widely drawn that a person could receive a criminal conviction for breaking one of these orders, without there being a victim. Someone could be convicted merely because he was deemed to be an irritant. Although I have alluded to what already exists in the statutes, the Bill is a potentially dangerous departure from the way in which Parliament has protected civil liberties over the centuries.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Before I respond to the points raised by hon. Members, I should like to clarify one matter. The purpose behind the provision is to prevent anti-social activity. If the hon. Member for Gainsborough thinks that there are no victims of such activity, I invite him to consider areas, probably in his own constituency, and certainly in those of many other hon. Members, where people are crying out for action to prevent anti-social behaviour. It is not prevented by current legislation. The Bill addresses that sort of mischief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Of course there are victims; we all know that. However, if we want to impose a penalty on an individual in a free society, we must convince the courts that there is a victim of his behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am sorry to intervene again, but it might save the hon. Gentleman from pursuing a fruitless line of argument. The application to the court results in an order. The breach of the order results in the penalty.
<P>
<B>Mr Leigh:</B> I know that. I have read the Bill. The Minister cannot protect himself by saying ``Don't worry, this is just an order which will be imposed by the local authority, and after that people will behave themselves very well and the problem will go away''. The problem will not go away. The local authority will impose the order, but what will happen if it is broken? The person will be brought before a criminal court and could be subject to a severe penalty.
<P>
The Minister cannot pretend that the Bill will not introduce a new criminal offence. The anti-social behaviour order is only the first step. We must accept that it could result in criminal prosecutions. If we are to go down that road, we must at least establish that there is a victim.
<P>
I do not claim that the Minister is going too far, but we know that neighbourhoods are tightly controlled in certain parts of the continent. In Germany, for example, people get into trouble if they do not cut their lawns. That might seem to be too trivial a matter for us to worry about. However, in the former East Germany there was a sinister development when neighbourhood blocks were given similar powers to those in the Bill, and local officials snooped on others. Clearly, the minister is not trying to introduce that kind of system in any way whatever, but the Opposition must point out what happens under similar provisions in other parts of Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was tempted to speak by my hon. Friend's reference to East Germany. Perhaps great minds think alike. The academic lawyers who produced a report on behalf of the Howard League state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All this is unpleasantly reminiscent of powers granted in former East Germany to housing block committees.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is all very well for members of the new Labour party to laugh, but they are introducing a Bill with the widest possible definition of anti-social behaviour. What is anti-social behaviour? Is the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) behaving anti-socially towards the Labour party? Although every opinion poll states that he is the most popular politician in London, the Labour party want to prevent him from standing--``Your anti-social behaviour might not be my anti-social behaviour.'' It is not a laughing matter; it is serious and we should deal with it carefully.
<P>
What is offending behaviour? We know from clause 2(1)(a) that it is behaviour that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``caused, or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At first sight, that appears to be a fair definition. The same words were contained in the Public Order Act 1986. That should give us cause for comfort. However, the 1986 Act stated that such behaviour should comprise
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also made clear that such behaviour had to be intentional, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking and I are getting old: we are the only members of the Committee who were Members of Parliament when the Public Order Act 1986 was passed. Perhaps we bear some guilt for introducing that measure. At least, in a democractic Government, in which we were fully involved in all decisions, we ensured that the behaviour that the measure covered was tightly defined. The 1986 Act went as far as is advisable in a free society. The restrictions in section 5 do not apply to ASBOs, or anti-social behaviour orders. That is why they are dangerous.
<P>
We await a definition of anti-social behaviour. The courts weigh the Minister's words carefully; he would do Parliament a service by defining the sort of behaviour that would result in an ASBO. Does it include playing a CD too loudly, or having noisy children? I have six children, and we make a considerable amount of noise. Would I be subject to such an order? Before we embark on the course prescribed by the Bill, we should have some idea of what would generate such an order. Will orders be imposed on irritating groups of teenagers, or will they be used only to control thugs who terrorise estates? If the latter, why is the Minister convinced that existing procedures are inadequate?
<P>
My hon. Friends have asked many pertinent and interesting questions. We look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): I shall be brief.
<P>
Like my hon. Friends, I am worried about the lack of precision in clause 2. The intention--to protect people from noisy neighbours and young people who cause trouble in a particular neighbourhood--is good. However, there is no point in measures with good intentions if their lack of precision make them unworkable. There is a danger of creating a busybody's charter unless the clause is more precise. We also run the risk of fanning the flames of public prejudice and hysteria. It is currently fashionable for the press to encourage public hysteria. That was demonstrated last week by the fear in a specific neighbourhood of the future conduct of Mr. Cooke--I mean the paedophile Mr. Cooke, not the Foreign Secretary, whose future conduct many of us fear.
<P>
People derive enjoyment from a television programme that is entitled ``Neighbours from Hell''. I did not know about the programme until our neighbours told us about it when we returned from our holiday to find that our burglar alarm had been ringing constantly for 36 hours. I realise, from reading the clause, that letting a burgular alarm cause a disturbance for 36 hours, however unintentionally, while we were out of the country, might, had the Bill been law, have put my husband and I in difficulties, because we could have been the subject of an anti-social behaviour order. Most of our neighbours would have agreed with that, at the time.
<P>
That is fairly trivial conduct--
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The hon. Lady must be careful in saying ``trivial''. If someone is at his wit's end because he cannot sleep, he will not consider a burglar alarm ringing for 36 hours trivial, especially if it is at the end of a busy week and he is worried about his wife.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It appears trivial when we are discussing the matter but it is not trivial when it is happening. It is, perhaps, excusable, if it happens once, but such persistent conduct, whether intentional or unintentional, must be dealt with.
<P>
Although I accept, as do my hon. Friends, that the intentions behind the clause are good, if we do not get the right balance between the freedom of one individual and that of another, we are making bad law because we are beginning to erode the individual freedom which we have so long taken for granted in this country.
<P>
My hon. Friend is concerned about intention as a test of whether an order could be brought. I appreciate that the usual test in criminal law as to liability is whether there is mens rea, which applies in Scottish criminal law; I do not know whether that applies in English criminal law too. If it does not, the conviction will not stick, and rightly so. Can the Minister answer two questions: first, will he state that the Government do not want the test of mens rea of intention to apply? Can he say whether these orders could be brought against someone who, unintentionally, causes difficulty and harm to other people in a neighbourhood? Secondly, if that is the case, can the Minister say whether there is a safeguard in that the order would have to be granted first and could be brought whether or not there was intention on the part of the accused person, but that when it came to enforcing criminal proceedings, the second part of the clause would apply under the normal criminal law in which intention matters--in this case, presumably, intention to break the order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Many issues have been raised in interesting contributions to the debate, some of which are misapprehensions of what is intended and how the anti-social order will operate. I shall try to clarify the Government's intentions.
<P>
The opening remarks of the hon. Gentleman for Hallam were constructed so as to enable me to clarify the intentions and effectiveness of the proposal. The hon. Member for Hertsmere similarly sought, rightly, to test the Bill's intentions.
<P>
We must make it clear that we are not talking about minor or trivial behaviour; it is not the loud stereo that belongs to someone of a different colour or culture that is meant to be caught by the anti-social behaviour order. It is worth pointing out that someone of a different colour, culture, sexual orientation or religion may be among the groups that most need these provisions and may well be the subject of the sort of behaviour that we are trying to prevent. I stress the word ``prevent'': there is a need to prevent anti-social behaviour, which has caused tremendous distress and even the ruination of the lives of many individuals and families.
<P>
The hon. Members for Woking and for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) justified my earlier welcome for the presence of hon. Members with legal expertise in the Committee, but they underlined my earlier reference to the real world. Both the courts of law and Parliament, to which the hon. Member for Gainsborough referred, have their place but only if they serve the real world, which is inhabited by people who suffer from the behaviour that these provisions are meant to address--people on housing estates, in city centres or in towns and villages across the country who have suffered the sort of anti-social behaviour that existing legislation has failed to prevent and control.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In that context, will the Minister now say what type of behaviour is not covered by existing legislation but will be covered by the order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will contain himself, I shall certainly address that, as I said I would. If I have not responded to the hon. Gentleman's questions by the end of my speech, he might be justified in repeating them, but it was not necessary at this stage.
<P>
Clause 2(1) states that an application for an order may be made if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person has acted, since the commencement date, in an anti-social manner, that is to say, in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as himself; and''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress the word ``and''--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such an order is necessary to protect persons in the lcoal government area in which the harassment, alarm or distress was caused or was likely to be caused from further anti-social acts by him''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill goes on to refer to the ``relevant authority'', which is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the council for the local government area or any chief officer of police any part of whose police area lies within that area.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All those elements have to be taken together to understand the Government's intention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) rightly referred to the danger of legislation being driven by hysteria. She mentioned events in the west country, which was extremely relevant to the way Parliament behaves. I also pay tribute to the measured response of the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown). He sought, as do we, to respond rationally to people's fears. The hon. Lady argued for that, too. We respond rationally, however, by ensuring that the law is right and that matters are dealt with so as to protect the public from harm, as distinct from being pushed by circumstances into responding inappropriately.
<P>
The anti-social behaviour order has not been rushed into legislation. We have thought about it long and hard and have teased out a way of dealing with anti-social behaviour which has been widely welcomed throughout the country. The order addresses real situations which have caused misery for many people--I ask hon. Members to keep that in the forefront of their minds. People are having their lives ruined by behaviour that is not prevented or dealt with by current legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough teamed up with the Howard League to question some elements of our advice. I am sure that that organisation will be greatly embarrassed by such an association--I do not believe that it wants to see such behaviour go unaddressed. The hon. Gentleman asked how the measure would increase convictions. The whole point is that we want to prevent the type of behaviour that is covered by clause 2. Convictions will have to follow only if people breach the order and act in a way that has to meet the criminal standard of proof before the courts. It is important to understand the nature of the order.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the issue depended on the resources that were available to the police and that it could be dealt with as matters stand at the moment. I must tell him that he is wrong. As a Member of Parliament and, previously, as a councillor, I have experience--as many of my colleagues have--of circumstances that clearly cause people in our streets and in local communities immense distress and pain. The police and the local authority could spend hours and hours trying to tease out a way of dealing with such problems. That is a waste of police time because it takes officers away from policing duties. The order will help local authority officials and the police to deal effectively with such problems and to use their time more effectively.
<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General is famous for suggesting to Parliament that it is wise to recognise an elephant on the doorstep. That is why we are not trying in the order to define the elephant on the doorstep too narrowly. For those who experience serious anti-social behaviour and harassment, such problems are very much an elephant on the doorstep, and they know what they want to be protected from. An individual or a family whose life is being devastated by an individual or group will certainly understand the difference between a single serious event, with which the criminal justice system is quite good at dealing, and behaviour that causes distress, harassment or alarm--
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Just one moment. I will give way, but I would like to do so at the end of sentences rather than half way through them. It would help if Opposition Members listened to a sentence rather than intervening before I get to the end of it.
<P>
I am trying to make it clear to Opposition Members what we want to deal with a type of behaviour that causes devastation to individuals, families and groups in local communities. Current legislation does not deal with such behaviour, which is why we need the new order. [Interruption.] I will explain if Opposition Members will let me get on to the order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is becoming clearer. The Minister is not saying that the new clause covers a new type of behaviour that cannot already be dealt with under existing legislation. He is complaining about the fact that considerable police time and resources are taken up bringing a conviction that has to be proved in the usual way. Parliament is surely entitled to ask that the police prove criminal conduct in the usual way. THe Minister is--and will, I suspect, remain--quite incapable of suggesting which new types of anti-social behaviour set out in clause 2 the police cannot already deal with under existing legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not grasped the basic point about the order. It is intended to prevent the repetition of behaviour that has the effect described in clause 2. We want a workable clause, which we do not want to limit to an academic definition of seriousness. We want a threshold on the nature of the activity that clause 2 addresses. We are following precisely the approach that the previous Government adopted in recent years in legislation on serious crime. We are making clear our intention regarding the use of the order rather than adding words to the clause. The Government envisage a threshold that will be tested by the police and by local authorities. They must agree that the order is necessary. It will also be tested by the courts, which will have to apply the test of reasonableness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I take it that the Minister has not yet come to the point about the type of conduct covered, so I shall reserve my position regarding that.
<P>
The threshold is important. Will the Minister say a little more about how it works? Is a repeated act of the type in question needed to exceed the threshold?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Not necessarily. Matters such as repetition would be considered by the local authorities and by the police. They would not be prevented from taking action because the behaviour seemed to be a one-off act. It is likely that they would ask whether the act was single and isolated, and whether it made an order necessary. A lot of common sense must be applied. The hon. Gentleman will agree that the police and local authority involved will require a minimum of common sense to ask that question before applying for an order. The question will also be part of the test of reasonableness that will be required by the court in deciding how to respond.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to the European convention on human rights. That is a serious point, which was mentioned by several hon. Members. The convention's provisions will soon be enshrined in law. Breaches will have to be considered by the court when dealing with applications, rather than by the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>
Reference has been made to distinguished academic commentators. The commentators have misunderstood the nature of the order, and they made their comments before amendments were made in another place to deal with some of the issues about which they expressed concern. The Government have examined the matter, and we are confident that the European convention on human rights has not been breached. Subsection 5 of Clause 2 was the critical addition made in another place. It refers to reasonable behaviour ``in the circumstances''. I should mention in passing that the circumstances regarding legal aid have also been remedied.
<P>
I am keen to ensure that the Committee has understood the nature of the orders, and that the various points that we made are dealt with, so I shall not rush to conclude my remarks.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to a list of five actions that were the test when dealing with these matters in 1996, when community safety order--that is the previous title of the anti-social behaviour order--was being explored by the Labour party, then in opposition. Labour Members concluded that a limit of the sort specified and a list of specific actions were unnecessary. We decided that the tests in clause 2 and the test of reasonableness by the court were the best way of ensuring an appropriate threshold, and of ensuring that the order is applied only to the behaviour that it is intended to address.
<P>
The concepts of harassment, alarm and distress--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Or distress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Those three concepts--harassment, alarm and distress--are contained in section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere pointed out. They are familiar to the courts. He quite rightly says that one or another is necessary to trigger the order, although in many cases more than one will be required to satisfy the court that an order is necessary.
<P>
A number of hon. Members questioned the inclusion of behaviour not illegal of itself. I think that I am right in saying that behaviour that is not illegal of itself might be a part of a pattern of behavour, put before a court as evidence of the necessity of an order.
<P>
