Chakrabarti:</strong>
                           </em> We at Liberty have profound concerns
about part 1. I understand that people want the police, who do
incredibly important work, to be accountable, but accountability to
what or to whom and what is the best mechanism for delivering that? Our
firm view is that, with all the problems that we might read about in
that or this operation at particular times, the tradition of policing
in this country is fundamentally sound. The traditions of Robert Peel
and the first commissioners, Rowan and Mayne, were very sound in their
thinking. The police need to be independent. They need to be
non-partisan. To some extent, they need to be above
politics.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not think that having a local politician direct the police is any
more comforting than having a Home Secretary with too much operational
control over the police. I do not take much comfort from the supposed
checks and balances in the Bill. It is very dangerous to put so much
political pressure on people who are independent. They are independent
in the way that judges should be independent. Police are part of the
rule of law. They are not part of the political Executive, and I am not
sure that the Bill understands that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000014">&#160;</a>

are other things in the Bill that I am happy to answer questions about.
I hope that you have had the opportunity to read our analysis, but my
biggest long-term, fundamental concern with the Bill is the pressure
that it puts on the traditions of non-partisanship, independence and
accountability to the rule of law that chief constables have had for
hundreds of years in this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000016">&#160;</a>

who we thought were doing the opposite. They were trying to interfere
in politics, just as there is a danger if politicians try to interfere
in individual operations. Those were anomalies and wrong, but the
system that is being proposed here will lead to a lot more of that in
practice, particularly with the charismatic, mandated, local, elected
police commissioner who will find commenting on high-profile
operations, numbers and visibility irresistible. Some of those concerns
have quite rightly been expressed by senior police officers, including
the current Metropolitan Police

who? Is it not the case that police and crime commissioners will have
broadly the same powers as police authorities? And what about the case
of London? Is it Liberty’s position that the mayoral oversight
of the police in London should be reversed? Should we hand that
oversight to some independent body of non-elected wise men, perhaps? It
would be terribly inconvenient, of course, that they might represent

been elected and you make all sorts of incredibly important decisions,

the rule of law. It needs independent judges, for example. Are you
suggesting that the judges should be elected and not be independent
wise men and women? Do we think that the public would be more
comfortable in the context, for example, of the rows over parliamentary

sorts of things have been discussed this week about undercover

to know that, whether you are a politician or a policeman, if you have
breached the law, you will be held accountable. The police are in the
very special position of enforcing the law; but they must also be
subject to it. The ultimate accountability is to the law, the judiciary

officer, but I have also worked in two county forces—Kent and
Surrey. The current model operates effectively, if you are using London
as the example of one force. Effectively, because of the size of the
Metropolitan Police Service, we are the equivalent of a region. On
operational independence, we absolutely support the Government’s
desire to strengthen local accountability and local democratic
accountability, but our nervousness relates to how that will amalgamate
to deal with the national functions—counter-terrorism,
protective services and major crime investigation. While the drafting
of the legislation talks about having regard to a strategic policing
requirement, you can absolutely understand the pressure that a locally
elected politician may feel to the very visible, accessible parts of
policing that we all think are very important. There is, however,
another side of policing, which is not always visible or easily
explained to the communities. It is when you aggregate it to a

points. Obviously it is your view that the proposal is a very
fundamental change to how we do policing. We have also had it suggested
to us that the Government should pilot this, before they roll it out
across the whole country. What would your thoughts be on that? Should
they proceed ahead regardless? My other question is on regional
variation. For example, my force is Northumbria, which is a huge force
area going from the Scottish border down to Durham. They would have one
police commissioner, as would Durham, which is a much smaller force. At
the moment, we have a police authority which recognises the breadth of
geography. Instead, you would have one person covering my area, who may
have been elected in Berwick. I am not sure how that would improve
accountability, when it comes to local people and their often very
local concerns about the nature of
policing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000055">&#160;</a>

If I compare London with Surrey, in London we have 32 unitary
authorities, answerable through the London Assembly to the Mayor. In
Surrey, there is one county council and 11 borough and district
councils. Under the current structure, which we would be applying to
the force structure—the 43 force structure in England and
Wales—you would end up with these democratically accountable
people responsible for very different size subsections of the
community. I think that presents us with an

would choose what those pilots are. One of the concerns of the chief
police officers at the moment is how it aggregates to the whole. If you
were to choose all large forces or all small forces, you might not

said in consultation documents and by Ministers is that
communities do not have confidence in policing. That is something that
we would challenge for the reasons that you say—crime has come
down, we have taken more knives off the streets and confidence levels
in policing are rising. In terms of our delivery against the current
model, we would say that our performance has improved. Whether a change
in governance would improve that any further, it would not be for me to
comment. It is not for us to define how we are governed. We are
currently operating under a police authority structure in London. We
have not moved to the new model yet, so we have the checks and balances
for that model. It remains to be seen whether that will change when the
full proposals in the Bill are

public order situation last year, I spoke at a big policing conference
at, I think, Wembley stadium. It was all about how to deal with
challenging public order situations that are difficult for the police.
There were police officers from all over the world. Just before I
spoke, I heard Mr Malthouse, the deputy Mayor, speak about his vision
of coping with those types of situations. He will no doubt correct me
if I am wrong, but my understanding of his contribution was that he
thought that elected representatives needed to be in the control room,
closer to the actual operation as it developed. In a sense, as with Ms
Casey’s remarks, I was pretty chilled by that. I think it is
even more important in difficult political and divisive times, times of
strife and public order situations that elected politicians and
partisan people are removed from that heated situation. Once again, I
have heard a vision of the future, and it is not one that is completely
compatible with my idea of operational
independence.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000063">&#160;</a>

point, on the repeal of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005
provisions and the changes that the Bill outlines, the Home Secretary
said that that would restore the right to peaceful protest around
Parliament. There is quite a degree of change there. How do you both
feel generally about the changes that the Bill proposes? We will come
on to some of the specifics later, but generally, do you feel that the
change in the Bill strikes a better balance between protests, civil
liberties and the powers that you, assistant commissioner, are given to
do your job? I would like to hear some general thoughts on the changes
proposed in the Bill from both of you.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000066">&#160;</a>

                           </em> This debate goes back to 2007, and the
parliamentary Committee that followed, which found that the powers that
currently exist do not fully enable us to work within the law. However,
in relation to the policing of Parliament square, it is important that
Parliament makes it clear to those who wish to exercise their
democratic right to protest what is and what is not acceptable. I am
not sure that the Bill in its current form gives that level of clarity.
For example, it is not clear to protesters, the general public,
parliamentarians and indeed the police what level of access is required
to Parliament at different times. It is therefore quite difficult for
us to police
events.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
fear about the proposals in the Bill is that they deal with a specific
issue—one that we saw in the square as we walked past it
today—and the question is whether they are well placed for the
potential policing of future protests. We would support the repeal of
the measures, but we would ask for more work to be done on whether
public order legislation can be redefined to include some of those
broader aspects that would pay consideration to human rights
legislation. At the moment, what is proposed in the Bill will leave it
up to individual officers to have to exercise the assessment about
whether it is proportionate and lawful. Certainly, in the cases that we
have had to date, we have been relatively unsuccessful in individual
cases in enforcing legislation because of the Human Rights Act 1998. We
think there needs to be more thought, and it needs to be enclosed in
primary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000068">&#160;</a>

the Bill, because I do not think they achieve the commitment of both
governing parties to restore the right to peaceful protest in
Parliament square. To be fair, the restrictions are now
narrower—it is a narrower geographical area, and that is
something. However, the rationale behind giving officers the power to
direct that you cannot have a sleeping bag makes no sense to me. One
assumes that you will be able to have a sleeping bag if you are wearing
a “Kate and Wills” T-shirt but not if you are
wearing a “Stop the War” T-shirt. My understanding of the
politics of this is that Parliament square has got to be tidy; it has
got to be pristine, because people from all over the world are going to
come to this wonderful event in the spring. That wonderful event is
going to happen in the oldest unbroken democracy on earth. Let people
come and see what democracy looks like. It is about dissent. Sometimes
it is irritating; sometimes it is a bit noisy; sometimes a bit messy.

we would, as a police service, have allowed the encampment to continue

Office and have tried to use every power within our current remit, and

been unsuccessful at different stages in the process, both ourselves
and the Crown Prosecution Service and, indeed, through civil courts.
There are currently cases outstanding, into which it would not be
appropriate to go into in any great detail. The challenge for us is
that the Human Rights Act does allow for protest. Of course, this piece
of Parliament square is the most protested piece of land in the

for Parliament to have a debate about what level of protest is

would like to be kept free at any time, and for that to be enshrined in

implementing it in that

democracy is at war, there will be for the duration of that war some
people who protest. There will be peace protesters. That happens in all
healthy democracies. If it is about structures, I am assuming that
elsewhere in the country laws on planning permission are implemented. I
come back to the question of the rationale for the restriction.
Proposition number one: there is a right to peaceful protest. It is not
absolute; it can be limited, but it has to be limited for good reason.

proportionate reason for limiting peaceful

simply saying that there is a power to direct that people’s

however, whether or not we are successful in that prosecution, that
case will close and the individual will have a right to return to the
square. Although I note that the Bill includes a draft on a condition
being imposed in the court prohibiting them from coming back to an area
for a period of time, again that will have to be a proportionality
test. Even if that case is successful, what is to prohibit that person

three different groups, through primary legislation that would have to
take into account the human rights legislation would be a better way
forward than the subsets as we see them here. They are at risk of
taking us back to where we are with SOCPA, which is that individuals
may be taken out for short periods of time but will have the capacity
to return. You see an awful lot of resource having to be played into
constantly removing people from the square who then have every right to
return.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000089">&#160;</a>

would also say that we were really horrified at the SOCPA provisions.
We found it absolutely chilling and incredibly unsavoury that people in
Britain should have to apply for permission to do incredibly trivial,
minor, peaceful acts not only in Parliament square but in a much
greater vicinity. This was most famous with Maya Evans, who was
arrested because she read out the names of dead soldiers and dead
Iraqis and she had not asked for permission. It put the police in a
terrible, invidious position to have to enforce something that was so
disproportionate. What we have now is something that is more
geographically limited, but as we have heard from the assistant
commissioner, it still offends that basic proposition, as it is
singling out an area that ought to be precious for demonstration, and
not excluded from demonstration. Instead of concentrating on the harm
that has been done, general public order legislation tends to approach
restrictions in terms of why the restriction is justified, which may be
because people cannot get on with things, because the traffic cannot
move, because there is an obstruction, or because there is a public
order danger, and so on. Here, however, there is no justification of
that kind. It is just very specific: prohibited activities include
loudhailers, tents and sleeping bags. Why? Because we do not want you
and your demonstration in the seat of our
democracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000092">&#160;</a>

behind it? The issue that some people have raised, and I will raise it
in the generic sense, is that having a permanent encampment may
actually frustrate protests. Parliament square is the centre of the
nation and the centre of protest, in that way, and if you allowed
permanent encampment and therefore, permanent protest by one group on
the square, that would frustrate and prevent others from protesting. I
am interested in whether you would accept that there may need to be a
way of regulating—hence the reason for looking at permanent
encampment, rather than protest—and seeking to address the
potential problem, instead of saying, in some ways, “We
don’t want protest here.” We should say, “We
accept that there should be protest, but when it transgresses into
permanent encampment it frustrates other protests.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000093">&#160;</a>

better to concentrate on the harm that you are trying to address. In
your case, I think you are suggesting that the harm you are trying to

Perhaps, in more generally framed public order legislation, you would
say that one can impose limitations that are necessary and
proportionate to first, public order; secondly, national security;
thirdly, preventing obstruction; and, fourthly, facilitating the
protest rights of others. To me, that is a much more human
rights-compliant, sensible approach to public order legislation than
only saying prohibited activities include loudhailers, tents, and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000094">&#160;</a>

events is that the behaviour of protesters changes in accordance with
the legislation. Something that we currently see is people acting as
lone protesters, or as lone voices. If we are going to look at
amendments to the Bill, the Committee might want to consider whether
there is any opportunity for the measure to apply to single protesters
as much as it does to groups. Another thing that we would lose with the
repeal of SOCPA would provisions that apply to security as well as
safety, which for Parliament are different from elsewhere in the
country. So, that might be something else the Committee would want to

proposed that directions can be given on a range of things, which we
have already mentioned. They can be given orally, either by police
officers, or by a range of other people—they may be council

Presumably, they would not necessarily be uniformed or particularly
trained—there is nothing in the measure to say that they would
be. These oral directions then last for 90 days, with no
record of that, unless they are changed. If they are breached, there is
a power for confiscation with

of training, within a legislative framework, and with a significantly
negotiated police regulatory structure and a misconduct procedure. The
provision on the use of force would make us nervous. At the moment,

bailiffs, and we stand by to prevent a breach of the peace in those

on-the-spot injunction—no balancing exercise, or any of the

comes with court injunction proceedings. I am also very nervous about
non-police personnel exercising those powers. Technically, we all have
the power of citizen’s arrest, but with the exception of Mr

most of us do not run around arresting one another, and most of us

police force even in challenging public order situations.
The police come from the citizenry and the community, and I
understand and respect all of that. None the less, it is incredibly
important, as you suggest, that we know who the person is, that they
have proper authority and that they have been properly trained. That is
why the commissioner was so clear after G20 that it was wrong for
officers to cover their identity numbers. That is about accountability
to the law. When somebody else is wearing something
else—possibly not in any uniform and looking like they might be
a traffic warden or whatever—it does not feel like consent-based
policing. It does not feel like that person has proper authority, and
that will lead to all kinds of resentments. Remember, this is a
politicised situation because it is about protest. The risks of
resentment and trouble as a result of the attempted use of the powers
are even greater than they would be in a normal arrest

                           </span> I want to echo the point
that you have just made. Having policed public order situations in a
previous occupation, I know that it is difficult enough as a police
officer to get a lawful order given by a uniform to be accepted and
acted upon, especially in stressful situations. You tend to find that
different types of people will accept it, and others will say,
“Who do you think you are?” and,
“Don’t you know who I am?” We are potentially
exacerbating that situation by asking those same people to accept that
same type of, albeit lawful, order from a non-uniformed person, and we
could make the situation
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000112">&#160;</a>

have also said that your powers are insufficient to deal with the

applied in this case? The Vagrancy Act applies to several issues,
including the erecting of

                           </em> Starting with the first point, at both a
strategic and a local level, in the judgments that constables make on a
daily basis, we have to get that balance right. As I said earlier,
there is a whole time line of activity over the past five years showing
where we have tried to get that balance right and where we have taken
action against protesters, and we have, in our view, acted
appropriately and got the balance right. Some of those cases are still
outstanding, having been appealed through both civil and criminal
courts. I am confident that the Metropolitan Police Service absolutely
respects the rights of all its citizens, including both the right to
protest and the right to live safely in London and to retain confidence
in doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000116">&#160;</a>

is a tricky balance, however, which is why I think that it is important
that parliamentarians put their minds to exactly what the appropriate
behaviour is in Parliament square and engage that in legislation,
rather than asking individual officers to make those judgments on a
day-to-day basis. Those judgments are difficult, and trying to defend
decisions that we have made on the back of current legislation
has certainly cost the Metropolitan Police Service a lot of money in
court cases. The Vagrancy Act is another example. I cannot say
definitively that we have tried that, but I know that we have tried
obstruction, we have tried injunctions and we have tried different
versions of the
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000117">&#160;</a>

there is a real harm, I would argue that there is plenty of law on the
statute book for dealing with it. When there is criminal damage, there
is the offence of criminal damage. When there is obstruction, there are
powers to deal with obstruction. When people engage in threatening and
abusive behaviour there are all sorts of offences related to that. This
is such a thorny question, because the harm is not really identified.
It is not proportionate, is it, in a free society to say that a couple
of tents of peace protesters while a country is at war are a blight on
our country? I think quite the

about your views on the Bill and where we should go. I am not trying to
put words in your mouth and so correct me if I am wrong, but you both
seem to be saying that in many respects you can see merit in the repeal
of the existing legislation but that in repealing it we need to be
careful that we get the balance right. There is a lack of clarity in
the Bill at present. There is real concern about the powers,
particularly those of the officer, the discretion given to an officer
and the extension of power to civilian employees. There is also a
concern about what Parliament actually wants to happen in and around
Parliament. Because that is not clear, we are not totally sure what it
is we are legislating to solve.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In a sense,
as the Bill goes through, the Government, with the Opposition holding
them to account, need to take a step back and try to understand what we
are trying to achieve over and above the statement that we have not
quite got the balance right between protest and civil liberties. We
would all agree that some of the things that have happened under SOCPA
have not been good, but in trying to do something about that we must
not create a whole set of new problems. The Public Order Act 1986 gives
a basis for taking this forward but that on its own will not be
sufficient to give you clarity as a serving police officer or to
address Liberty’s concerns about the balance of that process. As
a simple supplementary question to the assistant commissioner, if this
were passed, how would you get rid of what is there now, and on a
practical policing level, what would you have to do to ensure that it
did not return? I know that might sound a really simplistic
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000124">&#160;</a>

imposed, of course we will do our duty. We will enforce the
legislation. We would have to do our own test under the Human Rights
Act 1988. If, having done that test on the balance that you described,
we decided to take action, we might well ask officers to use force and
potentially extreme force in the removal of those people and those
tents. If, in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, we were
successful in securing a conviction, there is nothing to stop those
same individuals or indeed a subset of those individuals returning two
days, three days, a week or a month later, and being in exactly
the same position. That is what makes me nervous. You end up in this
circular position where you are consistently removing different people
and putting them before the courts. The question is whether that is
sustainable both in resource terms and public confidence terms because
of how it would present both to Parliament and to
policing.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000125">&#160;</a>

clearer. On the one hand, I am saying that of course people want to go
and protest in Parliament square because of its significance and,
therefore, we should be particularly slow to interfere with protesting
in Parliament square. People want to influence all of you, and that is
as it should be. On the other hand, I am also saying that generally
speaking one law of the land that has general
applicability—whether it is in Parliament square or another
square—is probably a good idea. We need one public order
framework that says, “What are the reasonable restrictions on
peaceful protest and what are the proper justifications?” It can
be obstruction or a risk to public safety. We should start with the
justifications for interference rather than just say that we have not
thought about why we want to get rid of these people, and that we are
just being specific to Parliament square. You would basically be
saying, “You will be prohibited here.” It is much better
to have a law of general applicability with all sorts of reasonable
restrictions that have been expressed. Get to the crux of the harm and
then use that as a justification for restrictions in public order
legislation rather than have special cases and special orders for this,
that and the other geographical locations.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000134">&#160;</a>

drafted is that that noise becomes a police responsibility. Shami
mentioned earlier the issue of creep over time in relation to what is
and what is not police responsibility. Noise issues are normally dealt
with by the local authority, so the policing view would be that that
would only be an element we would seek to use in extremis, probably
when we had various protest groups looking to be in the same place at
the same time. But, traditionally, noise issues are not dealt with by
police
officers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000141">&#160;</a>

idea of a law of general application, you should have a law on what
safe and appropriate levels of noise are in different areas. In
residential areas, one level might be appropriate; in busy central
London, it might be another level. If people are constantly breaching
whatever the law of general application is, there might be some
circumstances where it is better for the police to enforce than local
bureaucrats. Why is there something special for Parliament square? Why
should it be prohibited to use noise equipment in Parliament square?
Why do you not just deal with something that so clearly breaches the
appropriate decibel level and if that is proportionate, seize the
equipment after the fact. Is it not chilling that people should have to
apply effectively for special permission to demonstrate in Parliament
square? That was the invidious nature of the SOCPA provisions and that
is still
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000142">&#160;</a>

Chakrabarti:</strong>
                           </em> First, it is right that in a mature and
modern democracy most criminal prosecutions are brought by the
authorities. That is incredibly important because the vulnerable need
the powerful to stand up for them and bring prosecutions. We should not
just be left to prosecute criminality by ourselves. But, none the less,
over time, it has been an important safeguard that when the authorities
have other preoccupations—particularly domestic rather than
international preoccupations—there is the ability to bring a
private prosecution. There are already safeguards in place to stop that
being abusive, vexatious and so on, such as the ability of the Director
of Public Prosecutions to take over a prosecution that is frivolous and
vexatious, and end it. That is appropriate as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern about this provision in the Bill is that it largely addresses a
fear rather than a reality. I am not aware of warrants that have been
issued against foreign dignitaries that are causing huge problems to
Britain’s foreign relations. The courts have not been silly
about this. There is no evidence, once more, that there is a real
problem. I know that there is a perceived problem in that perhaps some
people in Governments around the world think that they are going to be
in jeopardy of some kind of political stunt or some kind of arrest when
they arrive in Britain.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Proposition
No. 1: there is diplomatic immunity for all sorts of people currently
serving in Government and as diplomats. Secondly, even when there is
not diplomatic immunity, the courts are not pursuing warrants
frivolously. If there is any concern or perceived concern that has to
be addressed, would it not be better to put the DPP on notice that
there is an application for a warrant, so that he can make the
alternative case, rather than effectively to give him a veto over
arrest, which sometimes would have to happen very quickly if a
potential or alleged war criminal were passing through? That would be a
better balance for dealing with concerns, but I do not think that
concerns are really borne out by much
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000147">&#160;</a>

in initiating serious prosecutions? These qualifying offences include
hijacking, piracy, the taking of hostages and the like, aviation and
maritime security. My first question is should the state not primarily
initiate such serious prosecutions? Secondly, I am interested to hear
you talk about and almost dismiss the fact that this is fear rather
than reality, because in many arguments do you not make the
counterpoint that you are just as concerned about the fear that members
of the public might have, for example, of the state’s overacting

arrest. There is considerable harm in the fear of arrest, even if it is
only for a few weeks. If I were to say to you, “There is a

good thing for innocent people to be worried about. Whether they are
young ethnic minority men in Hackney or visiting foreign dignitaries, I
would not want anybody to be subject to inappropriate arrest. You are

needs to be put on the table, though. Sometimes you have to reassure
people and not always with legislation. On the issue of whether the
state should be bringing serious prosecutions, of course it should. You
are right that many of these crimes ought to be prosecuted by states,
if not by international organisations, but the world is a big place as
well as a small one. All sorts of potential crimes against humanity may
have been perpetrated across the world, but they will not necessarily
be a prime preoccupation of the assistant commissioner here, or others,
at a particular time. Sometimes it might be a human rights
organisation, or a group of private individuals, that is aware of the
particular concern, at least in a moment speedy enough to apply to the
court for a warrant. Realistically, down the track the state will
engage and make a decision about whether to take over that
prosecution—to discontinue it or to pursue it. If you will
forgive me for saying it, you are not right to say that the courts are
not

If the DPP knows that an application has been made for a warrant, the
DPP can put any countervailing argument, such as there being an

the earliest stage for an arrest warrant to be issued—prima
facie evidence, somebody alleging something. Effectively, that is
enough, and has been enough, for an arrest warrant to be issued, which
in many cases has caused diplomatic incidents. I am concerned about the
respect for this country overseas and the respect for our rule of law,
about which you have already spoken. Does it not bring our legal system
into disrepute that the current system can be used for posturing and
grandstanding by politically motivated organisations that are trying to
score a cheap point? It is all very well that the courts can get more
involved after the committal stage—cases can then be thrown out,

fear of a frivolous arrest that is an end in itself, rather than a
serious intention to bring a prosecution based on evidence. But I am
not aware of all of the cases of abuse that you are describing. None
the less, if you think that they may come and that the threshold is too
low, let us look to the threshold of

involve the DPP, rather than to give him a veto over the warrant, is to
put him on notice, so that he can put the countervailing argument to
the magistrate. He can either give a knockout argument that the person
is a serving diplomat and has immunity, so that there must not be a
mistake or a warrant issued in anger, or he can say, “This is
vexatious—I’ve spoken to the Foreign Office and consulted
colleagues around the world, and there is just no credible prospect of
a prosecution.” That would be a better balance, because it
preserves private prosecution—it does not give the DPP the
absolute right to block a magistrate’s decision—but it
would deal with the reasonable concerns that you are talking

arrest warrant, and therefore they do not have the confidence that I
have. You cite statistics suggesting that they should have more
confidence in magistrates, but Mr Ellis has put the countervailing view
that it does not take much, in that a magistrate may be misled by the
person applying for a warrant and so on. That is a potential argument
for saying that the DPP ought to be put on notice, so that the other
side of the argument can be put. That is a fairer approach than to give
him a complete
veto.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000159">&#160;</a>

tell you that arrests sometimes have to be done quickly, whether they
are of a potential war criminal or of a common-or-garden criminal in
this country. That is why notice would be better than veto, because
veto means that nobody can do anything—the magistrate cannot
proceed until the DPP has done so and, frankly,

that giving notice is less likely to hold up proceedings, because if
the DPP chooses not to intervene or takes too long, the magistrate can
form his own view. But that would give the authorities the opportunity
to pipe up if they feel that they need to, because there is a real Mr

                           </em> On a point of clarification about
demonstrations, we clearly had a tricky time before Christmas, and we
have certainly been notified of future demonstrations. Clarity about
what behaviour is and is not acceptable in and around Parliament is a
real necessity for us in terms of planning going forward. We are very
happy to operate within whatever framework you would suggest. Just to
make more strongly a point that I am not sure I made strongly enough
earlier, in the current confusion of legislation we have descriptions
of marches, protests, single assemblies and assemblies. Each of those
different descriptors has what is and what is not allowed, so
individual protest groups can manipulate—perhaps that is
harsh—or use those words to place our negotiation with them
about how we facilitate their peaceful protest. We are absolutely
committed to facilitate that peaceful protest, but we cannot do that if
there is not clarity from either side about what the expectations
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000163">&#160;</a>

that last point, at the moment there is no notification period for an
assembly, so a group or an individual can choose to assemble outside
Parliament and there is not even a notification requirement. At the
very least, we would like that to be included, not because there would
be any need to put conditions—there is no bid from us for
that—but, if different groups are going to protest over the next
12 to 18 months, it would help our policing environment to be able to
facilitate that peacefulness if we know who is there, so that we can
stop different groups clashing with one
another.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The position
at the moment is that any private individual can go before a magistrate
with information and ask for an arrest warrant. Broadly speaking, what
they have to show at that stage is that they are alleging an offence
known to law and that what they allege shows a prima facie case, in
that the elements are laid out—the magistrate will not see the
evidence, but, on a prima facie basis, the elements will be laid out.
The court has jurisdiction, which obviously affects the immunity
position, that any applicable time limits have been complied
with—there is a retrospective element to some of these
offences—and that, where necessary, it has the authority to
proceed. If it can show all that, the magistrate can then issue an
arrest
warrant.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Normally,
the arrest warrant is to be executed by a police officer, and it is an
arrest warrant not to take the person to a police station, but to bring
them to court as soon as possible. Once the warrant is executed, that
will very often be the same afternoon or the next morning, Sundays and
bank holidays excepted. At that stage, the court proceedings begin. The
court can remand the individual or bail them and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
all cases within the clause in question—apart from piracy, which
is an odd exception, but most of the cases have universal
jurisdiction—the Attorney-General’s consent is needed.
Very soon after that exercise, consideration will have to be given by
the Attorney-General as to whether or not he consents to the
proceedings. The timing of the consent is important because consent has
to be given as soon as reasonably practicable, and always before the
plea. There is some recent case law on that. If consent is not given
before the plea is entered, the case becomes a nullity. That is
important in terms of the approach that we have taken. It is clear from
that that there is a threshold for the magistrate to issue the warrant
at the moment. Things will then move very fast because, once in custody
the individual has to be put before the court swiftly, as you would
expect. Before he or she enters a plea, the Attorney-General has to
consider
consent.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
of the cases are indictable cases, so there will be a period between
arrest and entering the plea, but it can vary. The Attorney-General
will act as swiftly as reasonably practicable. When he comes to
consider the case, the principles that he will apply are essentially
the principles taken from “The Code for Crown
Prosecutors”. Is there sufficient evidence to provide a
realistic prospect of conviction, and is it in the public interest?
That is the test that we apply to all the cases of public prosecutors.
If that test is not made out, he will not give his consent and the case
falls.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
temporal terms, there is a short window between the warrant and
A-G’s consent. There is another important feature: because the
warrant is issued at the behest of a private prosecutor at the moment,
there is no power to interview or search the individual or their
premises. They are all police powers, only exercisable by police
officers. Therefore, the opportunity for anyone to bridge the
evidential gap between prima facie or what is needed for the warrant
and the test that the Attorney will apply is pretty limited. In an
ordinary case, we might expect that the interview would throw something
up. You might expect that the search would throw something up, either
of the person or of the money. None of that will happen, so within a
reasonably short period the Attorney will apply the consent
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Forgive that
preamble, but it informs how we approach the matter. We have approached
it on the basis that the offences are obviously serious international
offences, and England and Wales should not be a safe haven. That is a
general understanding. When there is sufficient evidence, and it is in
the public interest, there should be a prosecution and the Crown
Prosecution Service would prosecute. We have also approached it on the
basis that we should be transparent and accountable, so we intend to
publish guidelines on our approach to the exercise. Everyone will then
know in advance how we shall deal with the decision whether or not to
give consent. I accept that any decision about that consent would be
susceptible to judicial review so, if we get it wrong, someone can go
to court to challenge us. I would not quarrel with that proposition. I
certainly would not advance the argument that it is a non-reviewable
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I should add
that we have a stand-in, ad hoc committee when individuals or groups
with a particular interest in such areas consult us. We meet about
every six months. We had a meeting last week. Among others, we have
talked to Amnesty about such matters. I shall describe our overall view
and what we intend to put in the guidance. It is not detailed, and the
guidance will not come out until the legislation is in place. Our much
preferred route is that, if anyone wants to pursue a crime of universal
jurisdiction as set out in the clause, they should engage us very early
in the process. They should come to us with whatever evidence they
have, and we will undertake to look at it and to advise. What often
happens in such cases is that there is some evidence, but it may or may
not be in admissible form. For evidence from abroad to be admissible in
our courts is fraught with all sorts of difficulties, so early
engagement is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
there is a case that we think ought properly to be investigated, our
preference is that it should be referred by us to the police and that
they should then investigate. That allows them to collate the evidence
and to exercise all the powers that the private individual cannot
exercise. So there is a huge advantage in the case going to the police
and we would encourage that. So we say, “Come to us early. We
will put people in place. This is an important issue.” We would
try to direct people down that route. There will be cases in which
people do not want to go down that route, or—this is the most
acute problem—in which time is of the essence, and it is simply
not possible to do that. There may be a need to go for a warrant for
arrest. In those circumstances, we would propose applying the code
test, so we would broadly apply the principles of, “Is there
sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of
conviction?” and, “Is it in the public interest?”
If those tests are satisfied, I give consent to the
warrant.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
we are now in the “time is tight” category, or the
individual may not be prepared to pass this over to the police to
investigate. You then get the “time is very, very tight”
category, in which even more difficult decisions have to be made. The
approach that we propose to take there—if we are talking about a
matter of hours—is to apply what in our code we call a threshold
test. It is not asking ourselves the question, “Is there already
sufficient evidence?”, which is what we would ask in most cases,
but “Is this a case in which there is enough to satisfy us that
within a reasonable period of time there will be sufficient evidence to
provide a realistic prospect of conviction?”<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Quite rightly,
a number of groups and individuals have said to us, “We may have
practically everything. We just need to change the nature of the
evidence and it won’t take long. You surely wouldn’t
refuse us consent on that basis?” So we have an exception that
allows us to apply the threshold test—is there enough for
reasonable suspicion and do we anticipate that, within a reasonable
period, the evidential gap, as it were, could be plugged? There would
then be sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.
That prompts the question, what is a reasonable period? It seems to us
that it is probably best measured in the period between the application
for arrest and the likely time that the Attorney-General will consider
consent, because that is the existing window. That is the only period
that can sensibly be used for that
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is a long
answer, but it comes to this. We will usually apply the code
test—evidential sufficiency and public interest. In very acute
cases we would apply the threshold test to give a bit of room, but we
would have to be persuaded that any gap in the evidence could actually
be made up in quite a tight window time-wise. If we are satisfied with
that, we will then give consent. As I have said, I would accept the
proposition that the decision one way or the other should be
susceptible to judicial review, so that if we get it wrong, we can be
challenged in the High
Court.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000180">&#160;</a>

our most recent example we were asked, with 24 hours to go, to look at
a file, and we did. We continued to look at it after the various
applications began to be made. It is quite a big ask, however, because
these are serious offences with serious consequences. Often the
evidence that has been gathered will be in lever-arch files rather than
envelopes, and technical rules of admissibility must be

answer to that, because it depends on the case. The volume of material
will be the key factor. The moment I commit to a time, I begin to tie
my hands. We have people who can work around the clock and we have
enough trained people so that someone is always available. When we were
called upon to do that in 2009, we worked solidly from the moment we
were handed the material, so there is no lack of will. But to say that
it will take two days, or three days, is to invite a problem, because
the next case will probably be 10 lever-arch files. In other words, it
just depends. We would act as quickly as we could, but we must act
carefully, because we have a legal test to

involves cases where the act was outside the jurisdiction, and

lawyer I may be misunderstanding some stuff. I would normally expect
that the level of evidence you would need for an arrest would be less
than to go ahead with a prosecution. To my layman’s eye you
appear to be applying the same test to allowing the arrest warrant as
you would be looking at to go ahead with a prosecution. The Bill says
that the warrant only needs to be issued with your consent. It is not
forcing you to go to any particular degree of proof before you give
that consent. Is there not some risk that you are putting too much
emphasis on what you are trying to do—more than you actually
need
to?<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000213">&#160;</a>

taking on board any points that people make to us throughout this
process. This is our proposed approach. These cases are slightly
different. It is true to say that where the police are involved in an
ordinary case the test for arrest is reasonable suspicion, as everybody
knows, and that the test for a prosecution is whether there is a
realistic prospect of conviction. They are slightly different tests,
but that is largely premised on the understanding that in the gap
between arrest and charge, there is a lot the police could do by way of
evidence gathering, because they have powers of interview, search,
seizure, production and so on. Cases either make it, as it were, to the
charging threshold or they do not. But in that gap between arrest and
charge, quite a lot can happen. In many cases, the police can be
satisfied that, while they are not necessarily at the charging
threshold when they arrest, they think they will be by the time it
comes to charge.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">These cases
are slightly different, because the time frame is much tighter. Once
you have someone in custody and you have to bring them before the
court, then the clock is ticking straight away. Secondly, and
realistically, I am not saying the evidential gap can never be made up,
because maybe you just need different signatures on a witness statement
from abroad or something, but broadly speaking the chances of making up
the evidential gap where there is a private prosecution are much, much

you talked about judging the public interest. When judging the public

prefer you to

out in our code, so they are there for people to see. I think it is
inevitable in most of these cases that we would consult the
Attorney-General, and it would be open to the Attorney-General to
consult Ministers. But the code is clear, and I am clear, that the
decision is the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions, taken
independently. Therefore, it is right to take into account any views
that are put forward. It would be quite wrong simply to follow the
views because they were put forward. It has got be an independent
decision and that is, as I understand it, part of the reasoning behind
having the DPP giving consent at this stage—so that independent
consideration can be given. I am clear that in any sensitive case,
whether it is one of these cases or any other, there is a protocol
between me and the Attorney-General that envisages consultation which
is done day in, day out.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000221">&#160;</a>

difficulties in a case that could be brought, we can assist in what is

signed off that this is an appropriate threshold for prosecution.

your involvement, by which I suppose she meant the ability of the
Attorney-General to influence that decision. The concern, as we all
know, is about a wider political consideration that may be made by the
Government as to whether it is appropriate that a VIP should be
arraigned—let’s use that word—in that manner. How

There is a provision in the protocol where, having consulted the
Attorney-General, I could seek those views myself, but I think,
sensibly, given that the Attorney-General would be consenting, or not,
in due course, he would conduct that exercise. He would then convey a
view to me, and I would obviously take that very seriously, that
exercise having been conducted. It would be relevant to the public
interest consideration. I would then have to form an independent view,
giving such weight to that consideration as I thought right in the
circumstances of the offence. It would be a serious consideration for
me to properly take into account. I do not quarrel with

this works is agreed between the DPP and the Attorney-General, and that
is a public document. It sets out that that is a proper exercise for
the Attorney-General to engage in, and also how the Attorney-General
should engage in it. It makes it clear, for the
Attorney-General just as for the DPP, that if he is the
decision maker, he must act independently of
Government, and that the decision is his. Therefore, the exercise that
he conducts is to ask other Ministers whether they have views, and if
so, what their views are. Then he comes to an independent decision.

counter that, when you come to your balanced
judgment?<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000247">&#160;</a>

have to look at the seriousness of the offence against any points that
are made by the Attorney-General or anybody else in the exercise. One
has to take everything into account and come to a proper view. Assuming
there is enough admissible evidence to provide a realistic prospect of
conviction that someone has committed a crime of universal
jurisdiction, you are already powerfully in favour of a prosecution at
that stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11012065000250">&#160;</a>

universal jurisdiction because they are really serious—it is a
balancing exercise but there is already a very powerful weight in
favour of prosecuting. Of course any other points have to be properly
considered and that exercise has to be conducted and then a decision
has to be reached. It is not easy. One cannot say in advance, “I
would weight this at three, five or seven.” You have to go
through the exercise. I do not shrink from the fact that in most cases
