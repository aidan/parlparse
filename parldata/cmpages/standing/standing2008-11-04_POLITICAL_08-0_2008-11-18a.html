Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): I beg to move
amendment No. 17, in
page 10, line 20, leave out from
&#145;shall&#146; to end of line 26 and insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;amend the electoral register by means only
of an additional entry at the end of the appropriate section of the
register, until the appropriate publication date of an
election.&#146;.</div><a name="08111887000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a fairly uncontentious part of the Bill. The clause is perfectly
reasonable and we do not argue with it but, as I have said several
times during our proceedings, the problem is that of clarity. An
anomaly in the clause could cause considerable problems and even
disfranchise people if an election were held during the latter half of
the year during the canvass period. The amendment is therefore intended
to clear up the anomaly. It is technical, and I say at the outset that
it is of a probing nature and if the Minister can convince the
Committee that the anomaly can be dealt with in another way, possibly
by a Government amendment, which would deal with matters more
efficiently, I would be delighted to withdraw
it.</div><a name="08111887000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we welcome the intention to make it easier for people to register to
vote, the anomaly arises whereby the voting ability is adversely
affected between July and December in respect of people who are new to
an area and therefore new to an electoral register because of rolling
registration. As I am sure all members of the Committee know, the
annual canvass of electors is conducted during the autumn and is
compiled on the basis of residents at an address on 15 October in a
particular year. The new register must be published by 1
December.</div><a name="08111887000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, during the autumn of 2007, there was considerable speculation
that there might be a general election. It is not for me to commiserate
with Ministers that there was no such election.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Some Labour Members seem happy
about that, while others seem sad. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
The hon. Member for Wirral, West says from a sedentary position that I
have not seen the polls. I am sure that such matters are outwith the
scope of the amendment. However, I have seen the polls and I am quite
happy with them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div><a name="08111887000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
early autumn of last year, when making concrete plans for a possible
general election, the electoral administrators were faced with the real
possibility of an election taking place during the annual canvass
period. There was much concern among them about whether a general
election held before 1 December 2007 would use the register drawn up in
October 2006 with the rolling register additions made during the year,
or whether the 2007 canvass information could be used. I hope that I am
being clear, but if I am not, it is because the whole situation is not
clear, which is the very point that I am making.</div>
<a name="08111887000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Electoral
Commission subsequently, and quite rightly, issued guidance to
electoral administrators, which stated that the 11-day rule for
registering to vote before an election did not apply to the annual
canvass. In other words, electors may have completed canvass forms, but
they would not be added to the register until the new one was published
in full by 1 December 2007. This meant that any elector not on the old
register would have had to register by rolling registration by 17
October 2007 in order to vote at a general election held on
1 November 2007, or he or she would have been disfranchised.
I am not concerned about 2007&#151;that has been and gone, with no
election&#151;but this could happen in any future year when there
might be a general election during the latter half of the
year.</div>
<a name="08111887000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Electoral
registration offices were advised by the Electoral Commission last year
to use the information about new voters on return canvass forms to
contact those new voters and ask them to fill in a rolling registration
form. As long as this was done by 17 October 2007, they would appear on
the register and would have been able to vote at an election on 1
November 2007. I am sure that the Committee will well understand that
this is causing a lot of confusion. An electoral system which is not
definite and which has any area of doubt in it is not a fair electoral
system. In a close election that could cast doubt upon the very
legitimacy of a Government. We do not want that in the United Kingdom;
we need a system that is absolutely watertight, so that people know
that when they have an entitlement to vote, they know how to vote, when
to vote and that if they are on the electoral register then they are on
the electoral register.</div>
<a name="08111887000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current system, people may or may not be on the electoral register,
which also produces an enormous burden upon the administrators who look
after the practical workings of a general election. I say general
election, because most other elections are on a specific date, when we
all know well in advance that there will be an election on 4 June or 3
May. That is not a problem because the former register would have been
in force from the previous 1 December and all electoral registration
officers and anyone else concerned with elections would know for months
that they were heading towards an election. However, with a general
election, we sometimes only know for three weeks. To have this scramble
to ensure that the right people are registered in the right place
during the three weeks of a general election campaign puts the entire
process into doubt. It is that doubt in the process that Opposition
Members are constantly trying to avoid.</div>
<a name="08111887000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
making any party political points in my remarks about clause
12&#151;this is nothing to do with party politics. When other parties
look at the problems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>that might occur, they will find the same as I have
in looking at this. The statistics show that, had there been an
election last November, something like 1 million people could have been
disfranchised. That is a very worrying situation. Electoral registers
are updated by the process of rolling registration, which allows
electors to go on or off the register as they actively ask the council
to change their details. That is quite right&#151;we have always
supported rolling registration because it produces a more up-to-date
and, therefore, accurate register. The problem that occurs,
specifically for an election in the autumn of any year, is that while
residents may be under the impression that their new details are on the
register, they will not be if there is an election in November. If they
take the additional step of filling out a rolling register update, they
will not be able to vote in their previous constituency either, so
people will fall between two stools if they try to do the right
thing.</div>
<a name="08111887000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The people
who will be most adversely affected are those who have recently moved
home and students, who frequently move. Almost every year, students
move from one address to another. Imagine the upheaval for someone who
is in charge of a student house and who therefore has to fill in the
details of some 20 or 25 students who move in or out every
October. If there was a general election in a November, we might find
that the wrong people were registered and that the right people did not
get a vote at all. That matters because a few hundred votes here or
there in a university town could decide the outcome of an election, and
therefore it is a matter of great concern. I can see a particular hon.
Gentleman who represents a university town grumbling in the wings, and
quite rightly so. If the hon. Member for Cambridge comes up with a
better solution than my amendment for getting round the problem, I will
gladly support
him.</div><a name="08111887000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000329"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Cambridge is very
much in the Committee; he is not in the
wings.</div><a name="08111887000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000330"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir Nicholas. I almost said that
the hon. Gentleman was to my left. I meant that geographically. I tried
to avoid using the phrase &#147;on my left&#148;, just in case
metaphorically and politically he is not, because I am not sure about
that.</div>
<a name="08111887000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000331"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I
am.</div><a name="08111887000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000332"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is confirming that
he is on my left, which is quite likely. He is both geographically and
politically on my left and not in the wings at all. I do apologise to
him.</div>
<a name="08111887000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
my concern, which was expressed publicly and vociferously by John
Turner, the chief executive of the Association of Electoral
Administrators, who warned of the worst logistical challenge in living
memory for electoral administrators. In an interview on the
BBC&#146;s &#147;Politics Show&#148; on 30 September 2007 he
said:</div><a name="08111887000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;nobody
sitting in my place could guarantee that it will be less than
trouble-free, and the real problem is that we could run into uncharted
water in terms of these problems that we&#146;ve just been talking
about.&#148;</div>
<a name="08111887000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">What he had been
talking about was the effect of the rolling register. We have also been
warned by others who are involved in the running of elections that
clause 12 could inadvertently cause an enormous
problem.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div><a name="08111887000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last thing
that we want in Britain is the hanging chad situation that they had
some years ago in the United States. Surely, we want respect for our
electoral system, and we do not want challenges to be made to the
outcome of elections. We also need certainty. It is perfectly possible
that the hon. Gentleman, for example, might win or lose his election in
a university town by some 100 or 200
votes.</div><a name="08111887000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000333"></a>David
Howarth:</b>
Unlikely.</div><a name="08111887000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000334"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> It may be unlikely, and I will not upset the hon.
Gentleman with possible predictions&#151;in any case, I am not in any
position to make such predictions&#151;but it is technically
possible. It is also technically possible that the hon. Gentleman might
hold the balance of power in this place. There might be equal numbers
on either side of the House apart from the hon. Gentleman. What if
there was a challenge to the outcome of his election? I use the hon.
Gentleman only as an example, because, sitting as he is to my left, he
is a winning example. However, there are many such seats throughout the
country, which could mean, if the outcome of an election was uncertain,
the outcome of the entire general election could be uncertain.
We have been warned about that in advance, so we must take that into
consideration
now.</div><a name="08111887000297"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
pm</div><a name="08111887000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is in the renumbering of the register. What happens is that
electoral registration officers renumber the register, therefore
creating uncertainty. Of course they renumber the register when they
produce a new register; that is perfectly reasonable, logical,
essential and part of a process. However, what if they do that in the
last 11 days before polling day? Political parties carrying out
canvassing will not be able to match up the numbers on the previous
register with the numbers on the register on polling day, but that is a
side issue which may concern us as prospective candidates in elections
and is not my main concern. My main point is that there is a danger
that polling cards, for example, which have been issued prior to the 11
days before the election, will have a different number on them for some
electors&#151;those whose numbers have changed because someone has
been inserted into the register. Therefore, when polling cards have
already been sent out with one number on them, if there is a new
register in front of the electoral registration officer or polling
clerk on the day of the election, the number might be different. If the
Minister tells me that that is not the case, I shall be delighted, but
it looks to me as if it
is.</div><a name="08111887000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
thing that I am concerned about is the importance of checking where
donations are coming from, which we have talked about for many hours
during the passage of the Bill. One of the ways of checking whether a
candidate can accept a donation from any particular person is by
checking whether that person is registered on the electoral roll. A
candidate has to be pretty sure when someone wants to give &#163;500.
We all have to stop and think whether we can accept the money, and one
of the ways of checking is, of course, whether that person is on the
electoral register. If the person is, prima facie, a candidate may say,
&#147;Right, that&#146;s great, this person is in a legitimate
position to give us this money. That is fine, we have checked
it.&#148; If there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>is any doubt about the electoral roll itself, that
puts all of that checking into doubt as well. Once again, all I seek is
clarity. The Bill already imposes&#151;quite
rightly&#151;considerable duties on candidates, agents and volunteers
to check donations, to ensure that everything is absolutely correct
with accepting donations. If we start messing about with the electoral
register in the last 11 days before an election, it puts all of that
into doubt, which is a matter for great
concern.</div><a name="08111887000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 17 requires the electoral registration officers to amend the
register to take account of new voters. We want to make sure that
everyone who has a right to vote is given that right in practice, so of
course electoral registration officers should go ahead and amend the
register to take account of new voters, but those new names should be
put at the end of the
register.</div><a name="08111887000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000335"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Has  my hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000336"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Yes. I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful
intervention. We have received evidence from electoral registration
officers that they are worried about the matter and the chief executive
of the Association of Electoral Administrators has warned of the worst
logistical challenge in living memory if matters were all to go wrong.
We do not want the process to go wrong. The point of amendment No. 17
is to identify a possible loophole in the Bill and to help the
Government to overcome the problems. The practical result of the
amendment would be that the electoral registration officer would put
the new names at the end of the register, thereby avoiding the need to
renumber it until the next month, and following a general
election.</div><a name="08111887000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have proposed how the problem could be obviated. There could be a much
cleverer or more practical way of getting round it. If the Minister and
those immersed in the Ministry of Justice who know exactly how the
system works can come up with a better solution than the amendment, I
shall be delighted because it is merely my quick attempt to highlight
the problem and suggest a way in which it might be put
right.</div><a name="0811199000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000337"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Good morning to you, Sir Nicholas, and to members
of the Committee. I wish to put on the record my thanks to the
Government for clause 12. It attempts to resolve a problem which, as
the hon. Member for Epping Forest said, affects a number of places,
especially university towns, by changes in the electoral register in
the canvass period in two respects: first-year students might not be on
a register, and second and third-year students will have changed
address, as a result of which there will be terrible confusion about
where their polling card should go.</div>
<a name="08111887000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is not
a problem in the clause but, if there is, I am sure that the Minister
will deal with it. However, there is a problem with the amendment,
which is that it would remove the words</div>
<a name="08111887000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall take
effect as from the beginning of that
day&#148;</div><a name="08111887000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">from
proposed subsection (6). Without those words, there would be a
fundamental problem in the
Bill.</div><a name="08111887000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000338"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Sir Nicholas. The
hon. Member for Epping Forest rightly drew attention to misuse of the
rolling canvass. I congratulate her on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>investing the clause with the significance of the highest order that few
of us might have guessed before she started her remarks. She has raised
real issues, but it is precisely those matters that the clause is
designed to address. The hon. Member for Huntingdon asked whether the
electoral administrators had been consulted. Yes, they have, and so has
the Electoral Commission. All agree with our approach, which is that
the provision will reduce its administrative burden in the event of an
election being called during the canvass
period.</div><a name="08111887000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
the hon. Lady keeps referring to John Turner and his nightmare. That
was hypothetical and would happen only if administrators had to issue
rolling register forms. They will not do that, so she will be relieved
to hear that nightmares are off the agenda. She asked whether the
elector&#146;s number will change when the register is republished in
December. Yes, it will at that point, but it will not change when the
notice amending the register is published. She made a specific point
towards the end of her remarks, which I will address in some detail
because it is important. It relates to the concern that clause 12 could
result in a mass of new people being added to the electoral register
shortly before an election and therefore it would be difficult to
scrutinise their applications. That is a valid concern. However, in
resisting the amendment, I hope to be able to demonstrate to her, and
the Committee, that appropriate procedures are already in place to
allow applications for registrations to be scrutinised by the public. I
hope that in doing so, I shall bring the clarity that the hon. Lady
seeks.</div><a name="08111887000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that, in addition to the checks being made by registration
officers, members of the public and parties can check a person&#146;s
eligibility to register&#151;to help prevent fraud, among other
things. At present, the provisions set out in the Representation of the
People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 provide a means for an
elector&#146;s eligibility to register to be scrutinised. Regulation
27 provides that an elector registered in the area of the local
authority may make an objection to a person&#146;s registration,
whether before or after that person has been added to the register.
Regulation 28 provides that an application for registration, including
one made on a canvass form and any objection to a person&#146;s
registration, shall be made available for inspection at the
registration officer&#146;s premises, until the application has been
determined. Regulation 29 sets out the procedure that must be followed
by a registration officer when he or she determines applications for
registration, or objections to a person&#146;s registration without a
hearing. Under this regulation, each registration officer is required
to keep a list of all the applications for registration that still have
to be determined. While there is no obligation to do so, in practice,
each registration officer compiles this list by reference to the street
name and the ward of the registrant and allows members of the public,
or political parties, to inspect it, together with the registration
applications.</div>
<a name="08111887000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once an
application for registration has been determined, clause 12 requires
the registration officer to add new electors to the appropriate section
of the register by the publication of a notice, which then becomes part
of the register. It contains the name, ward, street and house number of
each new elector, or person, removed from the register. That notice is
published five days before the poll; it is available to political
parties to inspect, or they can request that they be supplied with a
copy. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>therefore already possible for members of the public and political
parties to scrutinise applications for registration made before the
poll.</div>
<a name="08111887000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000339"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is it not currently the case that political
parties are given a copy of the new list? Is the Minister now saying
that they will have to request a
copy?</div><a name="08111887000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000340"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> It is absolutely the case that they will have to
request a copy if they so wish, but it is readily available. I am not
sure that that is an additional burden on the volunteers with whom we
have been so rightly concerned throughout these
proceedings.</div>
<a name="08111887000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000341"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Would that be at nil cost to the
candidates?</div><a name="08111887000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000342"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> No, it will not be at nil cost but it would be at a
marginal cost. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I stand corrected, it will be at
nil cost to the candidates. In other words, the costs would be borne by
the electoral registration officer.</div>
<a name="08111887000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible for these applications already to be scrutinised. It is also
possible to see which new entries have been added to the register for
the election by looking at the published 13BB notice. As mentioned,
this amendment would also delete proposed new section 13BB(7)
to the 1983 Act, which serves a useful purpose. It is quite feasible
that an election may be called late in the canvass period, where
registration officers have completed their annual canvass and wish to
bring forward the publication of the register from 1 December to
coincide with the poll. Deleting this subsection would leave the effect
of the provision unclear and may mean that registration officers will
not be able to deal with canvass forms in the usual manner, which is
the quickest way of compiling the register.</div>
<a name="08111887000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
get the right balance between enabling as many people as possible to
register to vote and being able to check that those who register are
eligible. We believe that the current arrangement for making a list of
applications and objections available for inspection and publishing a
list of changes to the register achieves this end. I hope that in the
light of that explanation the hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.</div>
<a name="08111887000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000343"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank the Minister for his explanation. My reason
for tabling the amendment has always been clarity. I am pleased by his
explanation to the Committee this morning. We certainly welcome clause
12 in general, but I was concerned about the renumbering issue in
particular. I would like him to confirm that I have got the following
right: the register will not be renumbered during the month before an
election if it falls within the canvass period. Given his undertaking
that that is the intent of the clause, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment.</div>
<a name="08111887000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="08111887000298"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<a name="08111887000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000344"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> There is another area of considerable concern, to
do with the way in which electoral registration takes place. It comes
within the scope of clause 12 and concerns service
voters&#151;serving members of Her Majesty&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>forces, many of whom are now on active service in dangerous places.
Before 2000, members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces could register once
in order to exercise their vote and their registration was valid for
the whole time that they served in Her Majesty&#146;s forces. Those
service voters, and the members of their families who travelled with
them, would move around the country and around the world because of the
duties they undertook. When I say service voters, I am not speaking of
serving people only, but of their families as well. Before 2000, being
registered to vote was not an additional concern for someone in Her
Majesty&#146;s forces.</div>
<a name="08111887000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2000, the
Government disfranchised thousands and thousands of people serving in
the forces by making it compulsory for them to register every year.
Unsurprisingly, as people were taken up with their duties on behalf of
Her Majesty&#146;s forces, sometimes they forgot to re-register. If
someone is in a combat zone, I do not suppose that it is at the top of
their list of concerns to think, &#147;Oh goodness, it&#146;s 15
October, I&#146;d better register again to vote.&#148; As we all
know, there are other pressures on serving officers and their
families.</div>
<a name="08111887000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Electoral Administration Act 2006, after we complained bitterly about
the situation, the Government finally conceded that registration should
be necessary by members of Her Majesty&#146;s forces every three
years only. The way in which clause 12 deals with how the canvass is
done and registration is carried out will keep the provision that
people have to register every three years. When hundreds of our
servicemen and women are risking, and giving, their lives for the
freedoms that we enjoy in this country by fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan
and other parts of the world, putting on them the burden of having to
register every three years is wrong. Those people are literally
risking, and giving, their lives for the very democracy that we are
talking about, but they are often not able to take part in the
democratic process, because they are disfranchised by the bureaucracy
of having to register again and again. That is wrong, and the
Government have an opportunity to put it
right.</div><a name="08111887000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000345"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): This is an issue that I
am extremely concerned about, and have been for several years. Clearly,
the only issue that we should and can address today is the relationship
between clause 12 and the methods that the Government have already put
in place to try to ameliorate the problem. However, they have not fully
ameliorated it, so I am not convinced. I want to know from the
Minister&#151;we shall find out&#151;how much thought has gone into
the relationship between clause 12 and the largely consultative, ad hoc
measures for addressing the effective disfranchisement of a large
proportion of our service
voters.</div><a name="08111887000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to explain and rehearse how we got into this mess,
otherwise we shall not be clear on how or whether clause 12 can get us
out of it. The problem all arose because, inadvertently, as a
consequence of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000, thousands of service voters&#151;probably a third to half of
them&#151;and their families were removed from the register. They
thought that they had been registered for the whole period of their
service, which is what they were told when they joined, but they then
discovered&#151;a few of them, much later&#151;that PPERA had
disfranchised them. Their enfranchisement no longer applied, without
there being any notification or information about how to get back on
the register.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div><a name="08111887000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of fact, I was the one who uncovered the situation. At the
time, I had two bases in my constituency, and I asked my returning
officer in Chichester, casually, about the registration figures. He
said, &#147;Well, on Thorney island there has been a drop in
registration.&#148; I said, &#147;Oh. By how much?&#148; He said,
&#147;Forty-seven per cent.&#148; About half those on the island,
who are almost all service voters and their families, had been taken
off the register. I raised that with the Government and the Electoral
Commission, but I am afraid that I got dilatory
responses.</div><a name="08111887000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000346"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to make
his point, but it goes rather wider than clause 12, which
deals with registration during the canvass period. However, I
understand the importance of his point, so I shall use my
discretion.</div><a name="08111887000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000347"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Thank you very much, Sir Nicholas. It will be of
particular concern to a large proportion of our service voters if they
can have some assurance that this change will not inadvertently lead to
another ill effect, as yet not thought out&#151;I have not thought it
out&#151;just as no one thought out the effect of
PPERA.</div><a name="08111887000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could not persuade the Government to do anything about service voters
before the 2005 election. The Ministry of Defence has to shoulder some
responsibility for this, because the Department was aware of the
situation but did nothing about it. In the Department&#146;s defence,
it was fighting a war, so one might argue that it had more important
things on its mind&#151;that is what the Ministry of Defence would
argue.</div><a name="08111887000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking
to heart your strictures about ensuring that my remarks are pertinent,
Sir Nicholas, this is my last general point. It is particularly ironic
that, as a country, we expected members of our military to put their
lives at risk to extend democracy in countries such as Iraq while we
were neglecting to ensure that they could vote in a general election.
Furthermore, in that general election, the biggest single issue was the
war in Iraq. That was absolutely
extraordinary.</div><a name="08111887000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
questions to the Minister come in several parts. First, since he took
office, has he examined the schemes that have been put in place to
ameliorate the problem? I shall give time for the officials to prepare
an answer. I understand the position, and I apologise to him for not
telling him in advance what matters I intended to raise with him, as I
can see from how he is scribbling that he regards them as important. Is
he up to speed with knowing what has been done since I raised the
matter previously? A number of us made a lot of noise about it in the
House. Is he confident that the existing service register is
functioning properly? What estimate does he have of registration as a
proportion of the total service
vote?</div><a name="08111887000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
what the clause does to the rolling registration period, my second
question concerns the effect that it will have on the level of service
registration. Has it been taken into account? Have there been any
discussions with the Ministry of Defence about it? Are we confident
that it will have no ill
effects?</div><a name="08111887000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
road to hell is paved with good intentions, or whatever the phrase is.
Everyone thought that PPERA would be all right, but it had the dramatic
consequence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>of perhaps taking 100,000 service voters off the register. The effect of
the clause will not be remotely as bad as that, but I am worried that
the suspension of rolling registration embodied in it might
inadvertently generate some ill effects for service
voters.</div><a name="08111887000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the Minister ready to answer the questions? It seems as though he is
getting near that point, so I shall gladly allow him to
respond.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000348"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will come to the points about service voters in a
moment because, although they are slightly beyond the scope of the
clause, I recognise their importance. The hon. Members for Epping
Forest and for Chichester have described graphically the importance of
such matters to those to whom we all owe a huge debt of gratitude. I
shall do my best to answer the specific questions asked by the hon.
Gentleman. Before I do so, however, we must be clear about the overall
purpose of the clause. It is designed to address a set of issues, which
over the past year have become particularly clear to each member of the
Committee.</div><a name="08111887000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
annual canvass of electors takes place each year from early summer to
late autumn, and the purpose of the clause concerns the circumstances
if an election were called during the annual canvass period. That is
not common in recent history, but, as the hon. Lady tried to persuade
us, we can never be certain of anything in this life. We need to be
prepared for all eventualities. If an election were called during that
period, a new application for registration recorded on the canvass form
would result in eligible voters being added to the register for the
poll. At the same time, administrators would be required to remove
non-eligible electors from the
register.</div><a name="08111887000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the law stands, if an election is held during the annual canvass, the
register can be amended in response to applications for registration
made on an individual rolling registration form up to 11 days before
the election. However, administrators may register only electors who
complete and submit a canvass form on the publication of the revised
register at the conclusion of the canvass, which may be after an
election. An application for registration cannot be accepted even where
there is clear evidence that a new elector or electors have moved into
the household from which the form has been returned. The Government
want to do everything we can to ensure that eligible voters are on the
electoral register and have their say at the ballot box. The clause
helps to achieve that
aim.</div><a name="08111887000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08111887000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the potential disfranchisement of service voters, our proposed measures
should&#151;I say, &#147;should&#148;&#151;help service and
other voters who would otherwise be caught by the existing situation.
My general response to the concerns raised is that we hope and expect
the Bill to be of benefit. No one can rule out unforeseen
consequences&#151;the hon. Member for Chichester spelled out the
risk&#151;because they are, by their very nature, unforeseen, but we
are sensitive to the
issues.</div><a name="08111887000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s first question was about whether I have got
fully up to speed on the issue since taking office. I took on
responsibility for this area about three weeks ago. Am I as up to speed
as I would have been had I been in post for a year? Probably not, but I
am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>reasonably up to speed and I hope that I can give
him some reassurance. If, however, there are issues that we cannot
address in
Committee&#151;</div><a name="08111887000080"></a>

<a name="08111887000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000350"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I recognise the importance of the issues, so I am
happy to address concerns on the margins of the Committee and then
write to all members of the Committee. I shall address some of the
other concerns in a moment, but I am happy to give
way.</div><a name="08111887000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000351"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> If the Minister is going to come to those issues, I
am sorry to have
interrupted.</div><a name="08111887000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000352"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> If I do not fully answer all the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s questions now, I will be happy to give way
again.</div><a name="08111887000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say straight away that there is a problem in identifying the degree of
disfranchisement among service voters. That is partly because some of
them are registered at their home address, which is sometimes difficult
for electoral registration officers to determine. That is  not
for a second to query that there is an issue. I have  no reason
whatever to dispute the evidence given by  the hon. Member for
Chichester on the level of disfranchisement in his constituency, but I
merely point out the fact that it is sometimes difficult to
determine.</div><a name="08111887000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000353"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I hope the Minister will not mind if I interrupt a
few times to make suggestions. I put to him the thought that I have
been begging to have him place on the issue for some time&#151;a
commitment to undertake a regular survey of a proportion of service
voters to establish the level of registration in relation to the rest
of the population. That should also include the families. If it were
done, we would have a yardstick&#151;a
measure.</div><a name="08111887000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if the survey did not provide entirely accurate information, even the
level of change would give us a high degree of information about
whether the Government&#146;s measures were working and how deep the
problem that we have identified since the introduction of PPERA
remained.</div><a name="08111887000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000354"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before the Minister replies, I must remind the
hon. Member for Chichester that I used my discretion earlier. I shall
continue to chair proceedings with a light hand, because I know how
strongly he feels, but once again, this point, in the general sense in
which he is raising it, goes much wider than the clause we are
debating.</div><a name="08111887000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000355"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I accept your strictures, Sir Nicholas, but I hope
that you will also extend a similarly light touch for a few sentences
during which I shall address the general concern
here.</div><a name="08111887000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman makes a sensible suggestion and I am happy to carry it
forward. He may be aware&#151;I hope he is&#151;that Ministry of
Justice officials regularly hold round-table discussions with the
Ministry of Defence, the Electoral Commission and others about how best
to tackle the issue. There are regular drives to try to increase
registration among service personnel, encouraging them to
register.</div><a name="08111887000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the hon. Member for Epping Forest made the important
point that service personnel are often engaged in arduous, difficult
and dangerous circumstances serving our country. In such circumstances,
it is perhaps an unnecessary burden on them to have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>remember to register and to feel obliged to do so when they have other
things on their mind&#151;that was her expression, I think. I
understand that, but it is open to service personnel to appoint a proxy
to vote on their behalf. That may or may not be considered satisfactory
in individual circumstances, but it is available to them. It can
continue indefinitely, although there are certain
restrictions.</div><a name="08111887000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have said enough in those few words to reassure hon.
Members that we take the issue extremely seriously, as do the Ministry
of Defence and the Electoral Commission. That is not to say that there
is no room for improvement. I am happy, in my ministerial capacity,
outwith the Committee&#146;s
remit&#151;</div><a name="08111887000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000356"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="08111887000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000357"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will in a moment, but I want to give this
assurance before I return to the substance of the clause. I am happy to
carry on a dialogue with all hon. Members who are concerned about this
issue and who have service personnel in their constituencies to ensure
that we get it right. It is an important matter and we want to address
it
clearly.</div><a name="08111887000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000358"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I met the Minister before he took office, so I know
that he will take the issue seriously and look at it carefully. He has
had only a few weeks to start thinking about it, and perhaps asking him
to be up to speed was not quite the phrase that I should have used on
the spur of the moment. The key issue with respect to the clause is
whether there has been any consultation. Has there been any
consultation with the Ministry of Defence? Has there been any
consultation to try to establish what effect this will have, if any?
That is a relevant question for him to look at, and if he said a few
words about that I would be grateful.</div>
<a name="08111887000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000359"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> As I said in my opening remarks, we expect that the
clause will help service personnel and others who will experience
problems before it is brought into effect. We expect that to happen.
The hon. Gentleman has made valuable suggestions for how we can improve
levels of registration and ensure that, subject to the concerns
expressed by the hon. Lady, service personnel are not disfranchised. We
will do everything we can. We think that the clause will provide a
significant improvement in circumstances should an election be held
during the annual canvass period and I hope that the Committee will
judge that it should be part of the Bill.</div>

Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): I welcome you to the
Chair, Sir Nicholas. I support clause 13. It will make for a more
streamlined administration if the European elections are run by local
authority returning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>officers. If those elections were run under
parliamentary boundaries, the returning officers would be operating
outwith the area or the council in which they are senior officer. The
proposals make sense and it will make for a streamlined administration
if the elections are run based on local authority boundaries. However,
I want to raise a concern in relation to Scotland and Wales. I
understand that this year, the clause will impact in Scotland and Wales
only. As a result of the order that has already been passed to change
the council elections in England to the same day as the European
election, council returning officers will run the European elections in
England. In Scotland and Wales, however, the present rules state that
the returning officers for parliamentary constituencies run the
elections.</div>
<a name="08111887000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Electoral
Commission has expressed concern that, as the Bill may not receive
Royal Assent until March, the change will happen within only two or
three months of polling day. The commission has always expressed the
view that changes in legislation that affect elections should be put in
place at least six months before the election date. Returning officers
in Scotland and Wales have also expressed concern that if the change
was to come into effect in March there might not be enough time,
because preparations for the European elections will already have
started.</div>
<a name="08111887000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask
the Minister what his intentions are for bringing the clause into
effect. Will he take the advice of the Electoral Commission and
electoral administrators in Scotland and Wales, and not bring the

year&#146;s European

Chairman:</b> Admirably
succinct.</div><a name="08111887000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000362"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute has just
expressed most of the concerns that I would have expressed, having also
discussed the matter with the Electoral Commission. When the Electoral
Commission comes forward with concerns, we must take it
seriously&#151;it is not doing so for any reason other than to try to
make the system work better. Although I understand what clause 13 says
and what it brings about, I cannot quite understand why the Government
are bothering to make this change to a system that appeared to work
perfectly well before. Is this because the Government have been told by
the European Commission that this is the right thing to do in respect
of European elections? <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.] </i>The Minister
indicates that that is not the case. I accept that and will put that to
one side. I am delighted, because in the United Kingdom we are
perfectly capable of running our own elections the way we always have
done, without any interference from those who sometimes think that they
know better. However, it still puzzles me why this is
necessary.</div>
<a name="08111887000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000363"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> I can give the hon. Lady an example of an occurrence
in my own constituency during the last local and Scottish elections.
The postal votes are sent out by the returning officer, but because the
Scottish parliamentary constituency and our local council constituency
areas did not match up, it meant that returning officers were returning
postal votes to a different local authority area from that in which
they operated, which caused some confusion. This new clause will
streamline that process.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div><a name="08111887000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000364"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation. I
remember vividly the debate that we had in the Chamber about
coterminosity. Members of the Committee who have never paid any
attention to the workings of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish
electoral issues will wonder what on earth I am talking about.
Opposition Members warned that creating boundaries that are not
coterminous would cause confusion at election times. At that point, we
were talking about the non-coterminosity&#151;it is getting worse.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.] </i>The lack of terminosity, if the hon.
Gentleman accepts that term, between Westminster constituencies and
Scottish parliamentary constituencies is bound to lead to some
confusion.</div>
<a name="08111887000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the hon. Gentleman&#151;he is absolutely right&#151;the lack of
terminosity between the European boundaries and the local authority
boundaries, which is, to some extent, inevitable, is causing a problem.
I accept that and I accept that the problem should be put right.
However, the Electoral Commission has concerns, as the hon. Gentleman
has also expressed, about the possibility of this part of the Bill
coming into effect a very short time before the forthcoming European
elections. I share that concern and I therefore wish to express it on
behalf of Opposition Members. I am sure that the Minister will have an
answer to that, so I shall allow him to give us that
answer.</div>
<a name="08111887000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

Wishart</b> (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP): I welcome you
back to the Chair, Sir Nicholas. I was not going to make any remarks on
this particular clause until I heard the curious remarks made by the
hon. Member for Epping Forest. I share the concern of the hon. Member
for Argyll and Bute about the commencement of this clause. We need to
hear from the Minister that there is no intention whatever of
commencing this clause prior to the European elections in 2009, as we
would be in a very curious situation whereby it would have different
applications in Scotland, Wales and England. As the hon. Gentleman
said, there are no local authority elections in Scotland in June, so
there is no order on the Table that would combine local authority and
European elections in Scotland or Wales. In Scotland, under existing
guidelines, matters would still be determined in accordance with
Westminster constituencies. I am not too worried about that because it
is always good to have a snapshot of how well we are doing in our
constituencies when it comes to European elections, but I am concerned
about coterminosity in such
matters.</div><a name="08111887000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth while pointing out that Scotland is one region, according to
European elections, and that it is not broken down into Scottish
Parliament or Westminster constituencies. It would therefore be of
benefit for matters to be determined on a local authority basis so that
they would be clearly understood. I hope that the Minister agrees with
the Electoral Commission that no new measures should be put in place
six months before an election, and that we can have a guarantee that
there is no intention of the clause commencing before the European
elections next
year.</div><a name="08111887000109"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000366"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> May I first clarify matters? When the hon. Member
for Perth and North Perthshire referred to Scotland as a region, is
that how he sees the position?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div><a name="08111887000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000367"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> It is an electoral region for European elections.
That is not my definition, but the definition that has been
given.</div><a name="08111887000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000368"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am delighted to have given the hon. Gentleman the
opportunity for
clarification.</div><a name="08111887000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make some general remarks before I deal with the specific
concerns that have been raised. The purpose of the clause is to
substitute a new definition of &#147;local returning officer&#148;
under the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002, so that the local
returning officers for European parliamentary elections held in
England, Wales and Scotland are returning officers for local authority
elections in those parts of the United Kingdom rather than the
returning officers for the United Kingdom parliamentary
elections.</div><a name="08111887000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
change, together with a subsequent change in secondary legislation made
under the 2002 Act, will enable future European parliamentary elections
to be administered on a permanent basis by local authority returning
officers along the lines of local authority areas, which will assist in
the effective administration of European parliamentary elections. I can
confirm to the hon. Member for Epping Forest, who I am sure will be
fascinated by such matters, that such a change was not suggested by the
European Commission, but by election administrators. They welcome the
change because it will ease the complexities in running European
elections and will provide certainty in their planning. The hon. Member
for Argyll and Bute gave a good illustration of
that.</div><a name="08111887000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to concerns raised by various people, including members of the
Electoral Commission, we cannot be certain at this stage exactly when
the Bill will receive Royal Assent. We certainly cannot be certain that
it will receive it in time for the provision on boundaries to be
implemented for the European elections on 4 June 2009. We have
therefore been exploring other options. After consultation, we decided
to exercise powers under the Representation of the People Act 1983 and
to make an order that will move the date of local government elections
in England in May 2009 to the date of the European elections in June
2009. That order has now been made, after debates in both
Houses.</div><a name="08111887000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
that order, we have made the necessary modifications to the European
Parliamentary Elections Act 2002, and the regulations made under that
Act, to enable the European elections in England 2009 to be
administered on local government boundaries. There are no scheduled
local government elections in May 2009 in Scotland and Wales, nor are
there any powers to refine the definition of &#147;local returning
officer&#148; under secondary legislation so that European elections
in Scotland and Wales are run at a local level by local authority
returning officers. We are exploring with colleagues in Scotland and
Wales whether it may be possible to deal with the issue within the
existing legislative framework, but I assure the Committee that we
shall not commence the clause in 2009 for the European elections.
However, the change will provide certainty on the issue for the future
European parliamentary elections, and I hope that the Committee will
support
it.</div><a name="08111887000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000372"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall be brisk. The purpose of the new clause and
the amendment is to transfer responsibility for storage and provision
of access to UK parliamentary election records and documents in
Scotland, including the marked register, from sheriff clerks to the
parliamentary returning officer. The overall aim of the provision is to
improve access to the documents, particularly for parliamentary
colleagues.</div><a name="08111887000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
a Westminster election has been contested in Scotland, election
material, including the marked register, is sent by the constituency
returning officers to a local sheriff clerk for safe keeping. The
sheriff clerk is obliged to make some of the material available for
public inspection and to destroy all the material after a year, unless
otherwise ordered. However, there have been difficulties with the
current arrangements, including around access and the fees to be
charged, and sheriff clerks&#146; offices do not feel that they are
set up to carry out those functions
effectively.</div><a name="08111887000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
change will bring Scotland more into line with the position in England
and Wales, where local authorities, through electoral registration
officers or acting returning officers, are responsible for those
functions by virtue of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>the Electoral Administration Act 2006, as well as for existing
arrangements in Scotland for local government and European election
records.</div><a name="08111887000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new provision has the full support of stakeholders in Scotland,
including electoral administrators, political parties and the Electoral
Commission.</div><a name="08111887000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000373"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The new clause seems perfectly reasonable, but I
always have to question Ministers when they say, &#147;Such and such
a measure brings Scotland more closely into line with the rest of the
United Kingdom.&#148; As a principle, I do not see why Scotland has
to be brought into line with the rest of the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="08111887000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000374"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I was not suggesting anything other than that the
people in Scotland have asked us to do this and we are responding to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000375"></a>Mrs.

entirely
accept.</div><a name="08111887000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000376"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000377"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b><b class="B"> </b>If my hon. Friend mentions 1707 in the same
vein, I understand why. I was merely suggesting that sometimes it would
be good if the rest of the United Kingdom came into line with Scotland,
which has an excellent legal system and many other excellent
institutions.</div><a name="08111887000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000378"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> I cannot resist asking the hon. Lady whether she
believes that that should also be the case for local government
electoral
systems.</div><a name="08111887000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000379"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I understand why the hon. Gentleman asks the
question, but in that it would not be best for the rest of the United
Kingdom to come into line with Scotland. I was thinking more along the
lines of the excellent Scottish legal system, which is based on
extremely good principles that have lasted many
centuries&#151;</div><a name="08111887000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000380"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am not allowing this debate. Please let
us concentrate on the Government new
clause.</div><a name="08111887000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000381"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000382"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000384"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> We support the Government new clause, with the
caveat that, as a principle, it is not always right to bring Scotland
into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, just for the sake of it.
I declare an interest and admit a bias, as I am a Scots lawyer. That is
the problem. Having made my small protest on principle, I accept that
this is something that the electoral administrators and others in
Scotland have asked for. It makes perfect sense and we support the new
clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div><a name="08111887000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000385"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> I, too, support the new clause. To make a more
streamlined administration, it makes sense that, if a returning officer
is in charge of all aspects of an election, he or she should also be in
charge of what happens to the documents after polling
day.</div><a name="08111887000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister referred to problems of access with the sheriff courts and
with fees. I can confirm those, having experienced similar problems.
The new clause, combined with an order passed recently on the fee
structure, will improve the administration. I have one question for
him: is it the Government&#146;s intention to introduce legislation
so that documents are dealt with in the same way after Scottish
Parliament elections?</div>
<a name="08111887000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000386"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> I very much agree with the new clause.
Historically, the sheriff clerk has looked after the documents because
he was given the task of ensuring that the electoral register was
compiled. There is a good case for saying that that task should be
returned to returning officers and local authority chief executives.
That is what we want in Scotland and it is something I particularly
support.</div>
<a name="08111887000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
for the Minister is along the same lines as the question asked by the
hon. Member for Argyll and Bute: what happens to the Scottish
Parliament? As far as I understand it, an amendment would have to be
made to the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 2007, so that
the practice could be introduced for the Scottish Parliament as well.
That prompts the question, why is Westminster making these tinkering
amendments to Scottish elections? We have had the Gould report in the
last few months, which addressed the biggest post-war electoral
disaster&#151;</div><a name="08111887000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000387"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> The SNP
won.</div><a name="08111887000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000388"></a>Pete
Wishart:</b> About 147,000 voters were disfranchised. I am
disappointed at the hon. Gentleman&#146;s flippant
remark.</div><a name="08111887000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost
150,000 people were disfranchised during the Scottish Parliament
elections. That suggests to me more than anything that the powers and
responsibilities for arranging Scottish elections should be returned to
the Scottish Parliament, instead of having these little orders coming
through Westminster to ensure that we are up to speed on new electoral
law. I want the Minister to confirm that there will be an opportunity
for local authority chief executives in Scotland to be responsible for
the Scottish Parliament elections, as well as for the Westminster
elections.</div>
<a name="08111887000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000389"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I have one brief point to make. The Minister will
correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it, we are talking about
the storage of election material&#151;if there is a row, we will have
something to refer to afterwards.</div>
<a name="08111887000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000390"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> And
access.</div><a name="08111887000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000391"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> And access,
indeed.</div><a name="08111887000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are changing the norm only with respect to Scotland. I do not want to
detain the Committee, but I have thought for a long time about the
access provisions in England and Scotland&#151;we have been
discussing bringing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column285" />Column number: 285</div>Scotland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom&#151;and
wondered whether the arrangements that we have for the rest of the
United Kingdom are the right ones. I raise that in the context of what
my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest referred to
earlier&#151;the so-called hanging chads
issue.</div><a name="08111887000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister consider taking a look at the so-called sunshine
provisions that operate in a number of states in the United States?
Those provisions enable a much higher level of access to information
than is available under most UK law, and they can provide a high level
of reassurance about the integrity of an election result. I do not know
whether that was considered in the Gould report, because I confess that
I have not read anything other than summaries of it, but I suspect that
it may have been alluded to as part of that
advice.</div><a name="08111887000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000392"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> In relation to the points made by the hon. Members
for Argyll and Bute and for Perth and North Perthshire, the intention
is to make similar provision for Scottish Parliament election records
and access through Scottish secondary legislation. I understand that
that is likely to be the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order
2010. The intention is also to apply revised access provisions as
provided for under sections 42 to 44 of the Electoral Administration
Act
2006.</div><a name="08111887000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will resist the temptation to pursue the other points raised by the
hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire. With great reluctance, I
restrain myself on that, but I am sure that we shall return to the
subject.</div><a name="08111887000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point made by the hon. Member for Chichester, I am ideologically
disposed towards sunshine and am happy to consider the matter. If I
may, I shall investigate further and write to him, as I think that it
is slightly outside the Committee&#146;s remit, but I am interested
in what he has to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000395"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The new clause facilitates reform of the system for
filling vacant European parliamentary seats in Northern Ireland. It is
important because Northern Ireland does not operate a party list
system. Under section 5 of the European Parliamentary Elections Act
2002, vacant seats can be filled only by having a
by-election.</div><a name="08111887000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">European
elections in Northern Ireland are held under the single transferable
vote form of proportional representation. Concerns have been raised
with us that a by-election under that system has the potential to
provide for the disproportionate representation of certain parties.
That is a particular issue in the context of Northern Ireland, where
proportionate representation is of real
importance.</div><a name="08111887000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Northern Ireland political parties and other interested groups
expressed concerns about the current system and requested that the
Government explore options for reform. That is why we have introduced
the new clause. We have consulted all the relevant parties. They are
all content with the proposals. We have consulted the chief electoral
officer for Northern Ireland, who is also content. We therefore believe
that people are generally content with the
proposals.</div><a name="08111887000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier
this year, the Government proposed that the nominating officer of the
political party in whose name the Member of the European Parliament
stood when elected should be able to nominate a replacement to fill a
vacant European parliamentary seat. Generally, electors vote for
representatives of political parties because they support the
party&#146;s position on certain matters, in line with the
party&#146;s manifesto. However much we as individuals would all like
to believe that that was otherwise, we generally accept that it is the
position. Therefore, should a vacancy arise, it makes sense for that
party to decide who should fill the seat.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div><a name="08111887000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000396"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): The Minister seems to
think that the choice of electors would be the same two years on. It
may be different. What is he doing about
that?</div><a name="08111887000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000397"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I will come to precisely that point. There is no
perfect system in such a circumstance, and I stress that it is
relatively unlikely that a vacancy will arise. It is possible, but most
of the time Members of the European Parliament see through their full
term. As we may see in further debate on the issue, the alternatives
also create problems in the way that the hon. Gentleman
suggests.</div><a name="08111887000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
makes sense for the party to decide who should fill the seat. Under
that system, Members of the European Parliament who did not belong to a
political party when elected could submit a list of substitutes when
returned, which could be used to fill the seat and could be modified as
necessary.</div><a name="08111887000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals were the subject of a full public consultation, and they
received strong support among the Northern Ireland parties and other
interested groups, so new clause 18 amends section 5 of the 2002 Act to
add proposed new subsection (4), enabling regulations to be made that
provide for the nominating officer of the relevant political party to
nominate a replacement Member of the European Parliament in the event
that a European Parliament seat held by that party becomes
vacant.</div><a name="08111887000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should point out to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight the fact that in
a democratic system voters elect Members of Parliament or Members of
the European Parliament for the full term. What he suggests would in
some sense compromise that principle. I recognise that the issue is
difficult, and can be debated either way, but I ask him to reflect on
that fundamental democratic principle. We do not shift our position on
who should remain in Parliament on the basis of opinion polls. That may
or may not be a good thing, but it is the system that
operates.</div>
<a name="08111887000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000398"></a>Mr.

way?</div><a name="08111887000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000399"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am happy to, although I suspect that we shall
diverge a little from the clause and Northern
Ireland.</div><a name="08111887000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000400"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Not for
long.</div><a name="08111887000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000401"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Without going off the trail of Northern Ireland,
if a Westminster Member died there would be a by-election. Is that
going to
change?</div><a name="08111887000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000402"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> No. As I have explained to the hon. Gentleman, we
are dealing with a different system of elections in Northern Ireland.
We have first past the post for parliamentary elections to Westminster,
but we also have a different system in this context, and views will
differ on its merits. In the specific context of Northern Ireland, that
system and the methods in place to replace Members of the European
Parliament, should they die or otherwise become unavailable to continue
their term of office, could lead to specific problems. That is what the
new clause is intended to deal
with.</div><a name="08111887000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have consulted widely on the new clause in Northern Ireland and have
made provision in it for regulations to be made to permit Members of
the European Parliament who did not belong to a political party when
they were returned to submit a list from which a replacement MEP could,
if required, be selected. Hon. Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>will know that replacements for seats vacated by MEPs from a registered
party in Great Britain are filled from the party&#146;s list and no
by-election is held. The proposed change will align Northern Ireland
closer with that
principle.</div><a name="08111887000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 128 simply provides for new clause 18 to come into
effect on Royal Assent. Regulations will then be required to give full
effect to the
changes.</div><a name="08111887000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000403"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to proposed
new subsection (4)(b), which the new clause will insert in section 5 of
the 2002 Act, which deals with the death of someone elected as an
independent.</div><a name="08111887000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned the possibility of a list being used in that case,
but there is nothing in the new clause to determine who on the list
would be nominated. If the independent MEP died having only submitted a
list, who would decide which person on the list would be nominated in
his
place?</div><a name="08111887000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000404"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those
remarks; he raises an important point. The process is difficult with
independents, as he says. We intend to cover the point in more detail
in regulations, and I hope that the Committee will bear with us on
that.</div><a name="08111887000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is complicated and we must bear in mind the very specific
circumstances of Northern Ireland. However, we intend that independent
MEPs in that context will be able to submit a list of substitutes when
they are returned. That list may be changed by the independent Member
by notifying the chief electoral officer during the
term.</div><a name="08111887000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will support the new clause and amendment No.
128, so that in the event of a vacancy arising during a term, the views
of the people of Northern Ireland will continue to be represented
proportionately in the European
Parliament.</div><a name="08111887000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000405"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> I support amendments (a) and (b). I want to say at
the outset that I believe that the single transferable vote system is
the best and fairest system of election. I am delighted that it is used
in Northern Ireland European elections and wish that exactly the same
system were used in the rest of the United Kingdom. However, I accept
that nothing is perfect, and that there is one imperfection with the
single transferable vote, which is how vacancies are handled.</div>
<a name="08111887000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
obvious options: one is a by-election, which is how the law stands in
Northern Ireland, and the other is nomination, as Government new clause
18 provides. The problem with a by-election is that even if everybody
voted for exactly the same party that they voted for in the previous
general election, somebody from a different party could be elected if
the vacancy had occurred because of the death or resignation of someone
representing a party that had not got the most votes in that
constituency. That is the problem that can arise with by-elections
under
STV.</div><a name="08111887000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
system of nomination also has defects: there is no public scrutiny of
the person who becomes the MEP, and it also lays the way open for
political parties to nominate a well known public figure at the
election. If that well known public figure got elected, they could
resign a few days later and be replaced by someone totally unknown to
the electorate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div><a name="08111887000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
most circumstances, a by-election is the best way to fill a vacancy
under STV, which is what the Scottish Parliament decided when it
introduced the STV for local government in Scotland. That system has
worked well. As I said earlier, even if people voted the same way as in
the previous election, that could result in someone from a different
party getting elected. We are all aware that, even under first past the
post, by-elections are different beasts from general elections. A
significant number of by-elections&#151;local government
and parliamentary by-elections&#151;result in someone from a
different party being
elected.</div><a name="08111887000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally,
I prefer the STV system to fill vacancies in a by-election. However,
Northern Ireland is different, as the Minister said. We need to ensure
that we balance the interests of the whole community in Northern
Ireland. All our European elections in Northern Ireland have resulted
in two Unionists and one nationalist being elected. A problem could
arise if the nationalist MEP died or resigned. The by-election would
almost certainly result in a Unionist being elected, so we would have
three Unionists and no nationalists in the European
Parliament.</div><a name="08111887000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the peculiar circumstances of Northern Ireland, I agree with the
Government on using nomination to fill the vacancy. We tabled
amendments (a) and (b) because the Government&#146;s new clause will
allow political parties to nominate somebody who will go through no
public scrutiny. We all know that parties put forward prospective
candidates. There are circumstances in which the media questions that
candidate, or something arises in that candidate&#146;s background
that causes the candidate to withdraw. Even in list
systems&#151;parties put forward lists for the European
Parliament&#151;the media can question someone lower down the list
even though that person has no chance of getting elected. If anything
damaging is said by that person, it might damage the political
party&#146;s chances of winning votes in the
election.</div><a name="08111887000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the people who are nominated to fill vacancies are
known to the electorate before they cast their votes in the European
election. That is why we have tabled amendments (a) and (b). Amendment
(a) refers to the circumstances in which somebody representing a
political party has been elected. Along with that person, there would
have to be three possible substitutes nominated. Their names would be
published so that the electorate knew that if they were voting for that
person, there would be a possibility that one of the three nominated
substitutes could become the MEP if that person died or resigned.
Therefore, when a vacancy arose, the political party would choose one
name from the list of
three.</div><a name="08111887000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would not allow for that political party to add other people
to the list. The important thing is that anybody who becomes an MEP
should be known to the electorate at the time of the original election.
That would be the effect of our
amendment.</div><a name="08111887000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not said that the list should be ordered because there could be
problems if the person at the top of the list defected to another party
or became seriously ill. We have said only that the three possible
substitutes should be known at the time of the
election.</div><a name="08111887000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08111887000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(b) relates to independence, which I raised with the Minister earlier.
In this case, the list must be ordered. If the independent candidate
dies, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>there is no way&#151;unless they wrote something in their
will&#151;that they can come back from the grave and decide which of
the three substitutes should become the elected representative. The
Minister said that that matter would be tackled by secondary
legislation, but the best way to tackle it would be to accept amendment
(b). At the time of his election, the independent candidate would
submit an ordered list of three people. If a vacancy arose, it would be
filled by the highest ranking surviving person on that list.</div>
<a name="08111887000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government new clause sets the right principles of nomination, but I
urge the Government to accept amendments (a) and (b). Potential MEPs
must put themselves forward at election time and undergo public
scrutiny. They should not merely be nominated by their party and appear
from nowhere after the vacancy has arisen.</div>
<a name="08111887000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000406"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> It is strange to debate the reintroduction of a
sort of hereditary principle as part of the Bill, but that is really
what new clause 18 brings about. It would save a lot of time and
difficulty if, when standing for election, each of us could say,
&#147;If I do not make it to the end of this Parliament, I would like
so and so to take my place.&#148; Many political parties have worked
like that in the past, but I am delighted that none of us work like
that now. Of course, I see why the Government want to introduce the
provision in respect of Northern Ireland, and I support what they are
trying to do. That is perfectly reasonable.</div>
<a name="08111887000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support
amendments (a) and (b) as proposed by the hon. Member for Argyll and
Bute. They produce greater clarity&#151;again, I return to that
point&#151;about how the system would work. In recent weeks until
4 November, newspapers around the world were full of the
succession question: if John McCain were elected as President of the
United States, would Sarah Palin take on that role in the event of a
catastrophic event that removed John McCain? It seems
that&#151;against the better judgment of some of us&#151;the people
of the United States decided, for some unfathomable reason, that that
succession was not to be risked. Actually, that is not correct. The
reason was not unfathomable; it took up thousands of columns in
newspapers throughout the world.</div>
<a name="08111887000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the hon.
Gentleman was speaking, it struck me that this is the same principle.
If we elect a person, we should know who would take over that position
should they not complete a term in office. Normally, our democratic
system depends on by-elections. If it were not for them, we would
surely get bored between elections&#151;they are an essential part of
our system.</div>
<a name="08111887000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support
what the hon. Gentleman has said and I hope that the Government will
consider the amendments favourably as they would clarify what would
happen under new clause 18. I am also concerned about what is meant by
the phrase &#147;specified circumstances.&#148; New clause 18
refers to certain issues occurring in &#147;specified
circumstances&#148;, but what are they? The lack of transparency of
new clause 18 was the issue that concerned me most. However, when
someone votes, they should know what substitutes the elected
representative has put in place, as they would perhaps subsequently
become the elected representative for that particular place. The voter
ought to know that. It is not fair to ask a voter to go into the
polling booth and elect Mr. A without knowing that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>carries Mrs. B with him. It is wrong for
that information not to be given to a voter. It would be perfectly
possible to put that information before a voter in the two specific
circumstances referred to in amendments (a) and (b), while keeping the
Government&#146;s overall intention of maintaining the balance within
the specific unusual circumstances of the Northern Ireland elections.
We all understand and support that
intention.</div><a name="08111887000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other slightly worrying thing is that the basis of new clause 18 is the
assumption that people vote on party lines alone and not on other
factors related to a candidate. I accept that the Minister put that
forward as a reasonable argument and that people do largely vote on
party lines. However, sometimes the particular candidate matters as
well. I am always suspicious of giving political parties more power and
taking that power away from the individual&#151;for example, the list
system for European elections gives far more power to a political party
and takes power away from the individual. If power is taken away from
the individual, it is taken away from the voter because if the voter
does not know who is accountable, they cannot get rid of that person.
The voter therefore has less power and the political party has more
power.</div><a name="08111887000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
again, we come back to the basis of our democracy, which is what the
Bill is about. The way in which our democracy works is the basis of our
democracy. The more power that is given to political parties and the
less power that is given to the individual and the voter, the weaker
the democratic system is because it is much more difficult for the
people to speak. It is much more difficult for the people to be heard
if the panoply of party political power gets in the way. Having said
that, I reiterate that we understand why there are special
circumstances in Northern Ireland. If the clause were to apply to the
rest of the United Kingdom, it would be totally and utterly
unacceptable. However, for the special circumstances in Northern
Ireland, it is acceptable. The measure is much improved by amendments
(a) and (b) and I hope that the Government will take those
seriously.</div>

Chairman:</b> May I assist the Committee&#151;particularly
the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute? I say this, of course, before the
Minister has replied to the debate, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes to
press one or both of his amendments to a Division, he will need to make
it clear during the debate. As I say, the Minister is yet to reply, but
I have to advise him that if he does not make it clear, the Chair will
proceed to put the question on adding the clause to the Bill straight
away. I hope that will help the hon. Gentleman to make up his mind. Of
course, we now depend on the Minister&#146;s
reply.</div><a name="08111887000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000408"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I shall be happy to give way to the hon. Member for
Argyll and Bute at any point during my relatively brief remarks. I am
grateful to the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Epping Forest
for their understanding of the special circumstances in Northern
Ireland. We all accept that. Unfortunately, like the people of the
United States of America, I shall reject the advice of the hon.
Lady.</div><a name="08111887000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments will more carefully align the method of filling seats with
the current method of filling vacancies in the Northern Ireland
Assembly where a list of up to six possible substitutes can be
submitted prior to the election. However, hon. Members may be aware
that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>Government recently laid an order to change the
method for filling vacancies in the Assembly to one similar to that
proposed in new clause 18. When consulting on possible changes to the
method of filling vacant European parliamentary seats, the Northern
Ireland Office also consulted on changes to the method of filling
vacant Assembly seats. The consultation paper noted that the current
substitutes method used to fill seats in the Assembly can be
problematic in situations where those designated as substitutes are
unwilling or unable to fill the seat when the vacancy arises,
particularly if they have assumed other responsibilities during the
Assembly term or if other factors have emerged since they were first
listed as a substitute. Indeed, the person may have defected from the
party to which they belonged when they were listed as a
substitute.</div><a name="08111887000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
vast majority of respondents to the consultations, including the four
largest political parties in Northern Ireland, agreed that reform was
needed. With that in mind, I hope that the Committee will agree that it
is not appropriate now that the system has been changed to reintroduce
a system for
filling&#151;</div><a name="08111887000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000409"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am interested in what the Minister is saying.
Can he give any instances in which the problem to which he refers
actually happened, and what the resolution
was?</div>
<a name="08111887000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000410"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> It is not so much whether it has actually happened.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is a possibility
that it could happen and, as we have heard many times in this
Committee, we must legislate for reasonable possibilities as well. With
that in mind&#151;given that we have conducted the consultation and
that the four largest political parties in Northern Ireland agree that
the changes should be made to the Northern Ireland Assembly&#151;the
changes in new clause 18 would align the method for filling vacancies
in the Northern Ireland Assembly with that for filling vacancies in the
European Parliament. It seems almost perverse to accept amendments that
would return to a system that the four largest political parties in
Northern Ireland want to change.</div>
<a name="08111887000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000411"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Just to put it on the record, it does not have
the consent of the fifth largest party, the Alliance party. There is
another way out of the problem. France, I believe, has a
suppl(c)ant system for elections to the National Assembly. A party
can put forward a suppl(c)ant, and if the suppl(c)ant does
not want to do the job, a by-election must be held. That risk is up to
the
party.</div><a name="08111887000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000412"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> We have discussed by-elections, and I was careful
to say &#147;the four largest political parties in Northern

would be perverse not to seek to align the two systems, and I very much
hope&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The hon. Gentleman
will be interested to hear that I have just been informed that,
although the consultation was widespread, the Alliance party did not

the consensus. However, I am not sure that it would be anything other
than perverse to resist the amendments, and I hope that the Committee

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000413"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000415"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am moving this clause now because it is necessary
for the successful implementation of the co-ordinated online record of
electors scheme, and if we do not pass it, there may be delays in the
implementation of the scheme. Subsection (2) expands the circumstances
in which the CORE keeper must inform an electoral registration officer
that improprieties involving electoral records or potential absent
voter fraud may have arisen.</div>
<a name="08111887000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for postal
votes, the CORE keeper will now be required to notify electoral
registration officers when more than a specified number of postal votes
are requested for a single address, as well as for a redirection
address. That is in response to feedback from electoral registration
officers that the number of postal vote redirections is minimal and
that there would be greater value in looking at all instances when
large numbers of postal votes have been requested to close the
opportunity for postal vote fraud to occur.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div><a name="08111887000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="08111887000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause also provides that the CORE keeper will be required to
notify electoral registration officers when the same person is
appointed or votes as proxy for more than two electors. Being appointed
as proxy for more than two electors is not in itself an offence, but
voting as proxy for more than two electors who are not close relatives
is. The new clause will provide an opportunity for electoral
registration officers to remind those appointed as proxies of the legal
position.</div><a name="08111887000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) of the new clause extends the Secretary of State&#146;s
order-making powers in respect of a CORE scheme order so that he or she
can require an electoral registration officer to take steps, if any,
that seem to the electoral registration officer to be an appropriate
response to a notification from the CORE keeper. It will be the
responsibility of the electoral registration officer to decide what
steps should be taken or whether steps should be taken at all. That is
consistent with the nature of the statutory appointment of electoral
registration officers, in that they are ultimately responsible for
their own electoral registers. When deciding how to respond to a
notification from the CORE keeper, electoral registration officers will
be free to make best use of their professional judgment, local
knowledge and
experience.</div><a name="08111887000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) also requires electoral registration officers to report to the CORE
keeper about either the steps taken in response to information provided
by the CORE keeper or the reasons for not taking steps. That will
enable the CORE keeper to maintain an overview of how the CORE scheme
is running and ensure consistency throughout the scheme. Subsection (4)
of the new clause allows the CORE keeper to provide relevant
information to an electoral registration officer when the CORE keeper
has a suspicion that an offence has been committed or may have been
committed under the Representation of the People Act 1983 or that there
has been some other
impropriety.</div><a name="08111887000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) of the new clause allows a CORE scheme to provide for the electoral
registration officers to share information with each other for the
purposes of responding to information supplied by the CORE keeper under
the provisions. That will allow electoral registration officers to work
together across electoral boundaries for the purpose of taking steps in
response to notifications from the CORE keeper. The new clause is
essential to the detection of fraud and in making sure that the
prevention functions of the CORE scheme work effectively. It will
ensure that the CORE scheme can be delivered without unnecessary
delay.</div><a name="08111887000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000416"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am pleased that the Minister has tabled the new
clause because we support all efforts that are made by the Government
to stop electoral fraud. As I have said several times, we want the
workings of our democratic system to be absolutely watertight and we
are in favour of every reasonable measure taken to ensure that that is
brought about. When the CORE scheme was introduced, we supported it for
that
reason.</div><a name="08111887000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I am worried that, in the few years since the scheme was introduced, it
has not achieved anything. Little has been done, but it has cost a lot
of money. If that money were invested in improving our record on
electoral fraud, I would be all in favour of it, but we have seen a lot
of money spent and little result. The Minister might explain that there
is a long time lag in the spending of money and the setting up of some
parts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>of the CORE scheme. If he does, I will have to accept that. However,
when we first discussed the matter during consideration of the
Electoral Administration Act 2006 some three years ago, we all hoped
that something along the lines of CORE would happen. We hoped that by
the time we were looking at another general election and the important
European elections that we are about to face, the CORE scheme might be
achieving something.</div>
<a name="08111887000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in a
written answer to a question that I put to the Minister a couple of
weeks ago, we discover that to date, the staff costs of CORE are
&#163;2.78 million and that &#163;1.73 million has been
spent</div><a name="08111887000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
enable local authorities&#146; electoral management systems to output
data in an agreed Election Mark Up Language (EML)
format.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 October 2008; Vol.
481, c.
559W.]</div><a name="08111887000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that those sums, and the other several thousands of pounds that
have been spent in the intervening period, are necessary. One does not
get the results if one does not invest in the technology&#151;I am in
favour of that. However, I have a couple of questions to ask the
Minister in this respect.</div>
<a name="08111887000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000417"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> To clarify the point, is the hon. Lady suggesting
that we should not spend this money on getting an agreed system for
outputting
data?</div><a name="08111887000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000418"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> No, not at all. I am saying that if we can see that
this expenditure is investment in a good system to combat fraud, we are
certainly in favour of it. I am not suggesting that it is an enormous
amount of money; it is a few million pounds, and when covering
the whole country, I accept that that is what these things cost. Every
penny of taxpayers&#146; money spent in this way will be well spent
if it brings about the result that we hope for.</div>
<a name="08111887000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, two
aspects in particular concern me. I am sure that the Minister is aware
of these points and will be able to address them. The first is that,
generally, the Government&#146;s record on investing in technology
has not been good. In the Ministry of Justice alone, several projects
have gone way over budget and have not achieved what they ought to have
achieved. I am not suggesting that that has yet happened with the CORE
scheme. I also appreciate that the Minister has not had responsibility
for this area of policy development for very long, so I do not hold him
personally responsible, or suggest that he has not carried out his
duties properly. However, we have had many examples of massive
expenditure on Government technology, on computer systems that do not
work, on new technology which promises the earth and where Ministers
announce in the House, &#147;We will be able to achieve x, y and z
because we have spent &#163;10 million on a, b and c,&#148;
and it does not happen. People rely on technology and it does not work.
Not only do the Government not achieve what they set out to achieve,
but they are often in a worse position than they were before they spent
all the money on the technology.</div>
<a name="08111887000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that will not happen with CORE. I am not suggesting that the evidence
we have so far indicates that the whole CORE project is likely to fail
and I seriously hope that it does not. We want this project to work; we
want the fight against electoral fraud to be won and we will do all we
can to support the Government in that respect. I merely draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>the fact that some of his colleagues have been very unsuccessful in
bringing about good end results in the technology projects that they
have started. I hope that he will be able to assure us that vast
amounts of money will not be spent on CORE to no avail. I appreciate
that he may have good explanations of why it has not achieved anything
yet, but I would like to give him the opportunity to say what it will
achieve in future, hopefully without the spending of further enormous
amounts of taxpayers&#146;
money.</div><a name="08111887000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is the security of data, another matter on which the
Government have a bad track record. Again, it is not this Minister and
this project that have been in trouble&#151;far from it. Let us hope
that they never will be. However, even he must admit that his
colleagues in many Departments have been responsible for massive losses
of data that should have been kept secure and safeguarded on behalf of
the members of the public to whom it related. My one
concern&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="08111887000226"></a>

<a name="08111887000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000420"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas.</div>
<a name="08111887000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My one
concern when I first looked at the proposals for a co-ordinated online
record of electors was that it was yet another instance of the
Government bringing enormous amounts of information to a central point.
There is always a danger in that, because, as we have seen with child
benefit, many Ministry of Defence information sources, even provisional
driving licences and many more examples that I shall not take the
Committee&#146;s time to explore, the more the Government bring vast
amounts of information together in a central place, the more risk there
is of that information going astray. We do not want that to happen in
the case of CORE.</div>
<a name="08111887000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek
assurances that the Minister has learned from the mistakes of his
colleagues and that the data security aspect of the provision will be
taken into consideration. It is unimaginable what a catastrophic effect
there would be if the information concerned were brought to a central
point and then lost. I assume that the technology will be good enough
that the information would not be lost for ever, which would be quite
ridiculous. If the information got into the wrong hands, even if it
were not used for nefarious purposes, it could certainly be used to
send so much junk mail that although it might be good for the economic
prospects of the Post Office, it certainly would not be good in terms
of the amount of paper engendered and the number of trees cut
down.</div>
<a name="08111887000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is just
one way that I can think of in which such information could be used. I
hope that it would not be, and I sincerely hope that the real purpose
of the CORE project will be advanced securely and with good use of
taxpayers&#146; money and careful regard for the information about
individual citizens of this country that will be held in a central
point. I seek those assurances merely because we would like to be able
to support the Government&#146;s new
clause.</div><a name="08111887000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000421"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> First, I congratulate the hon. Lady for managing to
make so many generic points out of what is rather a modest little
amendment to the CORE 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>provisions, enabling us to tackle fraud even more
effectively than we are already tackling it, which I hope is an
objective that all of us on the Committee share. None the less, she has
raised some interesting points and I will briefly address
them.</div><a name="08111887000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
start by gently pointing out to the hon. Lady that there may just be a
contradiction between the various points that she has raised. On the
one hand, she appears to be criticising us for what she described as
delaying bringing CORE on stream. On the other hand, she said that she
hoped that we would be extremely careful to ensure that money was well
spent and that we took great care in ensuring that the data were stored
securely. I would like to suggest to her tactfully that the reason that
we are proceeding so cautiously and deliberately on this matter is
precisely to ensure that we are spending the money to good effect and
that the data is stored securely.</div>
<a name="08111887000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
happy to take the Committee&#146;s time in explaining everything that
we are doing, but very briefly I would like to point out to the hon.
Lady that we are moving forward carefully. We are consulting 468
different electoral registration officers to ensure that they are in a
position to store and move the data securely. We are spending the money
carefully and I am very glad that she agrees that the money that we
have spent so far has been well spent. We will continue to ensure that
we get value for money.</div>
<a name="08111887000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s description of a list of Government failures was, if I
may say so, misleading There is no question but that mistakes have been
made in Government. Mistakes are also made in the private sector. Those
mistakes involve the failure to achieve value for money, projects not
coming to fruition in the way that they were originally conceived, and
of course matters of data protection. It is a matter of record that the
Government have made mistakes, but, as I say, mistakes also happen in
the private sector, so I should be grateful if she would reflect on the
fact that there is no evidence that the public sector is worse than the
private sector in this regard, either in terms of great schemes that
did not come to fruition in the way that they were originally
conceived, after lots of money had been spent, or in the matter of data
protection.</div>
<a name="08111887000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most
recent data losses in the public sector have taken place among private
sector contractors working for Government. The real problem with this
area is that the technology is moving so much faster than the
managerial processes that are in place. I can absolutely assure the
Committee that the Government are seized of this issue. In the last
year, we have taken radical action to improve our processes. No one can
ever guarantee that all data will always be secure, but we are doing
our very best and we are certainly moving forward in
relation to
CORE.</div><a name="08111887000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sense that you are getting slightly impatient about our straying beyond
the remit of the clause, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="08111887000237"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000423"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am happy to assure the Minister that I fully
appreciate that, of course, mistakes occur in the private sector too,
but he knows perfectly well that two wrongs do not make a right. Just
because the private sector makes mistakes, and sometimes it makes
mistakes on behalf of the Government, does not excuse the Government
from the responsibility that they have to the
taxpayer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000428"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> New clause 1 was originally in my name, but I then
detected that I had made a drafting error, so I tabled amendments (a),
(b) and (c) to the new clause. As a procedural matter, therefore, my
name no longer appears at the top of new clause 1 and it is
in the name of my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon, who has asked me, on his behalf, to continue to speak to
it. For the sake of getting the amendments to the new clause out of the
way, I shall begin with amendments (a), (b) and (c) in my
name.</div><a name="08111887000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000429"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> This is about the most important clause that we
will consider in the whole of the Bill. It goes to the heart of it. I
have seen many of these clauses in past Committees, but we have not yet
developed the last word on this. The Government say that they are keen,
in principle, on this type of improvement. I take it that we would be
amenable to constructive suggestions from the Government to improve the
new clause. Is that correct? If they come forward with suggestions,
rather than just knocking it out, the Opposition will be
constructive.</div><a name="08111887000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000430"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> My hon. Friend asks me a leading question, and of
course I agree with
him.</div><a name="08111887000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000431"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am not a lawyer, so I am just asking a
question.</div><a name="08111887000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000432"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I, clearly, and not for the first time, have been
proved not to be a brilliant parliamentary draftsman, but I did not set
out to be. My hon. Friend is right. This is an extremely important
group of new clauses on a vital issue. If the Government produce a
constructive way forward, we would be happy to
co-operate.</div><a name="08111887000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will deal first with the amendments, so that the Committee does not
have to puzzle over their meaning. New clause 1, as drafted, is taken
from the Northern Ireland legislation, so I made the mistake of leaving
in proposed new subsection (4A)(c) (ii), which
states:</div><a name="08111887000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
statement of whether or not he has been resident in the United Kingdom
for the whole of the three-month period ending on 15th October
in the year in question,
and&#148;.</div><a name="08111887000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
should not be there, because it is a specific requirement relating to
Northern Ireland and it is not necessary in the rest of the United
Kingdom. I did not intend to introduce the three-month residency
restriction across the rest of the United Kingdom&#151;that would be
wrong. Amendment (a) removes that
sub-paragraph.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div><a name="08111887000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has not
been our intention at any point in the Bill to make it more difficult
for people to register, or for people who legitimately ought to be
voting to vote. We want to ensure that the franchise is extended to
everyone to whom it ought to be extended, with no unnecessary
restrictions. The areas to which amendments (a), (b) and (c) refer
would have introduced a residency restriction, so I have amended my own
new clause. Or, in technical terms, to ensure that the procedure is
correct, I have amended the new clause standing in the name of my hon.
Friend the Member for Huntingdon. I hope that the Committee will accept
that explanation so that we do not have to waste time debating
amendments (a), (b) and
(c).</div><a name="08111887000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000433"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): As one who tried to
persuade my noble Friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton to include a scheme
for individual registration in the 2006 Act, I certainly will not argue
against the principle of the amendments, but when the hon. Lady refers
to the Northern Ireland model, does she accept that there was a big
drop in the number of people registered to vote when the single
registration scheme came into effect there? Does she think that, when
we design a scheme for the rest of the United Kingdom, we ought to do
something in the law to protect against that happening
again?</div><a name="08111887000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000434"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes at the outset the very
point that we have to discuss. That is why the new clause is such an
important omission from the Bill. I cannot say that it is an important
part of the Bill because it is not in the Bill, but it should
be.</div>
<a name="08111887000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will deal
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point later, but discuss it briefly
now. One reason why the legislation was introduced in Northern Ireland
while it was still in the early stages of being considered for the
remainder of the UK was because it was seen as a necessary way to solve
a specific problem in Northern Ireland. It was recognised by the
Government and, I believe, all political parties, that the Northern
Ireland register was not accurate. It was not intact. It had on it the
names of many people who should not have been on it. Indeed, it had on
it many names that were not the names of people. It was very much in
need of being cleaned up, to put it
simply.</div><a name="08111887000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inevitably,
if one of the reasons for introducing legislation is to remove names
that are not names of people but the names of people long deceased or
not yet born or of people who left the country long ago and have no
right to vote or that are merely anagrams of other
names&#151;something that was discovered when the matter was
examined&#151;given that the intent of the legislation as it applied
initially in Northern Ireland was to remove superfluous names from the
register, by the very nature of the legislation, the outcome was that
the number of names on the register was significantly
reduced.</div><a name="08111887000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000435"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> May I clarify this point? Is the hon. Lady
asserting that the entire fall in the numbers registered was due to the
phenomenon that she
described?</div><a name="08111887000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000436"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> No, not the entire fall. I could not possibly
assert that, and I certainly could not prove it. It was not entirely
for that reason, but we have evidence to show that it was largely for
that reason. The Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>cannot argue that, three years ago, his colleagues
did not introduce legislation to clean up the Northern Ireland
register. I hope that the Government would have been extremely
disappointed if there had been no difference in the number of names on
it. However, there are significant differences between the way that the
register is made and kept in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the
UK. I am not asserting that the fall was entirely due to that, and I am
happy to address that point
later.</div><a name="08111887000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="08111887000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000437"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): While the main purpose of the
legislation was to remove people from the register who should not have
been on it, does the hon. Lady accept that there already was a serious
problem of under-registration in Northern Ireland, with 29 per cent. of
18 to 24-year-olds and 17 per cent. of people in socio-economic
categories D and E not on the register, and that the legislation
probably made the problem worse by increasing under-registration among
those
groups?</div><a name="08111887000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000438"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s statistics,
but he must not forget that there is a statutory duty to register. I am
sure that the Minster will correct me if I am wrong, but the present
legal framework provides that electoral registration officers in
Northern Ireland can impose a fine of up to &#163;1,000 on someone
for not registering. Of course, that is not enforced. I am not
suggesting that it should be enforced, but the framework is in place to
allow that and perhaps it would be a good idea for the Government,
through their officials in the electoral registration offices, through
the Electoral Commission, or through whichever way they choose, to
remind people that they have a duty to register to vote. There is an
idea that, &#147;Oh dear, a significant part of the population aged
between 18 and 25 don&#146;t bother to register to vote&#148;.
Surprise, surprise. A significant part of the population aged 18 to 25
do not bother about very much, because they are at that stage in life
where they do not have to, and this is just one of those things.
However, it should be remembered that the framework is there to impose
the law if the Government choose to do
so.</div>
<a name="08111887000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000439"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend, with the help of the hon. Member
for Battersea, has uncovered one of the most disgraceful aspects of our
electoral registration system and democracy in this country: hundreds
of thousands of people fail to register, thereby breaking the existing
law. We are looking to move the law on, but it is important to make the
point that the existing law is being
broken.</div>
<a name="08111887000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000440"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> My hon. Friend is correct. I do not think that I
have ever seen a Government information programme&#151;leaflets or
posters&#151;about this. We see so much Government information: there
are glossy brochures on just about everything, coming from every
Department. One can hardly turn round without seeing some kind of
Government information about something, whether it is teaching our
children to read, how to cross the road, or not having water that is
too hot running into our baths&#151;that is done particularly in
Scotland, but it is still Government money that pays for it. All that
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>done, and yet I do not think I have seen any promotion by the Government
saying that it is an offence not to register to
vote.</div>
<a name="08111887000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000441"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am sorry to stray, but I hope that the hon. Lady
is not suggesting that the literature on babies being scalded is not
worth spending money
on.</div><a name="08111887000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000442"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> No, of course I am not. It is right to educate
people about such important matters, and so it is right to teach people
that they have a duty to register to vote. We all often go out on the
campaign trail and I assume that every member of the Committee
sometimes knocks on people&#146;s doors and asks, &#147;Will you
vote?&#148;. Usually we ask &#147;Will you vote for me?&#148;,
rather than &#147;Will you vote?&#148; generally, but often the
conversation comes round to whether a person votes generally. We find
people who say &#147;I don&#146;t vote&#148;, like &#147;I
don&#146;t smoke&#148; or &#147;I don&#146;t eat pasta&#148;
or &#147;I don&#146;t ride a bicycle&#148;, as if there is no
duty to register to vote. It is as if they are asserting that they are
in some way morally superior because they do not get involved in the
political process, but they will be the first to complain if something
goes wrong and their representative has not done anything about it.
That is a massive generalisation that I do not propose to back up, but
we all meet people who say that they do not vote. It should be up to
the Government to tell them that they have a duty to register to vote.
If they then choose not to vote, of course every individual has the
freedom to choose whether to exercise their
vote.</div><a name="08111887000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000443"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I have listened
carefully to the hon. Lady&#146;s argument about what happened in
Northern Ireland and the what purpose of individual registration was.
Does she accept that, after 2005, when a provision was introduced to
enable a person to have one year&#146;s grace on the carry-forward
mechanism if they had not re-registered the previous year, virtually
the whole reduction in the register that had been experienced
previously was reinstated by the increase in votes that took place as a
result of that carry-over mechanism? These were real voters, not fake
voters, who had been removed from the register. By and large, they were
members of the settled population in Northern Ireland, not the younger
people whom she referred to, who perhaps had not fulfilled their
responsibility to register to vote. Is she saying that all portions of
the population should register annually in order to undertake the duty
to register, or is she saying that, as is the case throughout the rest
of the United Kingdom, there may be some leeway for ensuring that
settled communities that do not necessarily have to re-register every
year continue to be placed on the electoral
register?</div><a name="08111887000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000444"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is
suggesting that we should have different rules in different parts of
the country. I accept what he says. It is essential, and it is the
purpose of the Bill, to try to make it easier for people to register to
vote. He will have heard what I said about service voters earlier this
morning. It is essential that everybody who has the right to vote can
fulfil the duty to register to vote, and then to vote if they choose to
do so.</div>
<a name="08111887000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I would
say about the Northern Ireland situation is that one of the reasons the
Government have given over the last several years for not introducing
individual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>voter registration in the rest of the United Kingdom is that they wish
to carry out pilots. My argument is that there is no need to carry out
pilot schemes, because we have a pilot scheme in a whole country,
Northern Ireland, and we can learn from what has happened there. The
hon. Gentleman put the point very well.</div>
<a name="08111887000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other Labour
Members have also made good points about the lessons to be learned from
Northern Ireland. I am not suggesting for a moment that everything that
happened in Northern Ireland is perfect, but I am suggesting that the
individual voter registration scheme has been successful there, and
that in learning the lessons of what could be improved, the Government
should be able to bring all those lessons together and in a short space
of time introduce a similar scheme in the rest of the United
Kingdom.</div>
<a name="08111887000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111887000445"></a><b class="B">Nick
Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab):
The hon. Lady has just told the Committee that the Northern Ireland
scheme is successful. It depends what criteria one uses to describe
successful. Nearly 120,000 people were removed from the electoral roll
as a result of the changes, and it was only when the rollover system
was introduced that a further 70,000 came back on. That means that
there are still at least 40,000 to 50,000 people who are not registered
in Northern Ireland. I do not think that that is a success. While
individual registration is important, we need a range of other packages
to ensure that we encourage people, as she rightly says, to register to
vote, so that they can vote.</div>
<a name="08111887000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000446"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments are amazing.
The point of introducing the legislation in Northern Ireland was to
take out of the register the names of people who were not people and of
people who did not have the right to vote. That system was not
democracy, the Government rightly took steps to put it right and we
supported them. UK citizens who are responsible enough to exercise
their right to vote and make a decisive contribution to deciding who
shall govern our country ought to have responsibility for registering
themselves to vote. We ought not to make that difficult but, my
goodness, it is not very difficult to fill in a
form.</div>

Ainger:</b> I shall do an encore, Sir Nicholas. My point was
about unintended consequences. The individual identifier removed the
names that should never have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>been on the register, as the hon. Lady rightly says, but the unintended
consequence was that 120,000 people who should have been on the
register no longer were. It was only when further legislation
introduced the rollover system, and 70,000 names were added, that we
started to return to the previous level of registration. Even now, an
awful lot of people in Northern Ireland&#151;tens of
thousands&#151;who should be on the register are
not.</div><a name="08111887000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000450"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I did not miss the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point; I
fully understood it. I accept that the drop of 120,000 went too far,
and that it was right to introduce further legislation on the rolling
register. That brought the number back up by 50,000, meaning that
70,000 had been taken off the
register.</div><a name="08111887000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000451"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> It is the other way
around&#151;70,000 went
on.</div><a name="08111887000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111887000452"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Yes, so the number that came off the register was
not 120,000, but 70,000, because 50,000 went back on. This is exactly
my point about pilots and about learning from Northern Ireland. There
were unintended consequences, as there often are with this type of
legislation, but the Government then put the situation right. That is
what is important. Can the hon. Gentleman explain where those 70,000
people are and why they do not register?</div>

reluctance among people of certain age groups either to engage in the
political process or to believe that they should fill in the form. We

at the moment. That is the
