                           </span> Thank you, Mr Brady. It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship. I am grateful to hon. Members from
all parties for taking an interest in the Bill and for attending the
Committee this morning. The Bill covers England and Wales, and I am
pleased that representatives are present from both England and Wales.
Given that the Football Licensing Authority was set up in the aftermath
of the Hillsborough disaster, I am also very pleased that hon. Members
from Liverpool are here today. That is only right and
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000009">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
the FLA is able to give advice only with regard to safety at football
grounds, so the Bill’s purpose is to allow all the experience
and expertise acquired by the FLA and its staff over all its years of
operation to be available to other sports. Under the Bill, football
safety will remain the authority’s core priority and main
preoccupation. The FLA’s licensing functions and its local
authority oversight duties will continue to relate only to football
grounds. Football will continue to be the authority’s raison
d’être. However, with London hosting the Olympic and
Paralympic games in 2012 and with other sports potentially able to
benefit from the FLA’s experience and staff, the Bill’s
purpose is to allow the FLA to be renamed the Sports Grounds Safety
Authority and to provide safety advice on request to other bodies and
other sports, including national or international
organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No
amendments have been tabled, and I hope that we shall be able to
conclude matters this morning without the need for a subsequent sitting
of the Committee. For the sake of ease, I shall try to refer to the
Football Licensing Authority as the FLA and to what I hope will become
the Sports Grounds Safety Authority as “the authority”.
As Mr Brady said, we are encouraging a broad debate at the start of the
sitting. If we go on to the substantive clauses—clauses 2, 3, 4
and 5—and hon. Members wish to speak, I shall be happy to make a
few introductory comments on those clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000011">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 1
allows for the authority’s name to be changed from the Football
Licensing Authority to the Sports Grounds Safety Authority in line with
its widened advisory remit, and confirms that the expenses of the
authority will continue to be paid from the public
purse.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000012">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Let me start by
congratulating the hon. Member for Woking (Jonathan Lord) on his
success in the draw and on the work that he has done on the Bill so
far. I also thank the Minister and his officials for their help and
advice and for the briefing that they have
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
has been said, the Football Licensing Authority was established in the
wake of tragedies at football grounds, such as at Hillsborough in 1989.
Following Lord Justice Taylor’s final report on that disaster,
the authority was charged with responsibility for monitoring local
authorities’ oversight of spectator safety at international,
premiership and football league grounds. The importance that hon.
Members for Merseyside constituencies attach to that issue explains why
a number of them are serving on this Committee and will raise issues on
behalf of the residents of the city that they
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Margaret
Aspinall of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, for example, said
that the
Government<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“must
make sure there is no cost-cutting on
safety.”<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Labour
Members agree with that. We believe that any dilution of focus on
safety at football grounds would be a real cause for concern. That
said, we recognise the benefits of enabling other sports to benefit
from the expertise that the FLA has built up. That is obviously why the
Government are keen to see the Bill approved today. However, there are
a number of areas where we would like further clarification and some
reassurance. I have a number of questions which I hope either the hon.
Member for Woking or the Minister can answer. There are inevitable
risks involved in changing an organisation’s structure and remit
and we will want assurances that proper measures are in place to ensure
that public safety is not compromised during the transition or
following the establishment of the new organisation, that appropriate
levels of funding are provided and that the new organisation has the
expertise to fulfil its responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So how can we
be confident that the new organisation will be able to fulfil a wider
remit when its budget is being reduced? Is it the Government’s
intention that it will be responsible for all grounds or venues at
which all sports are played or just some sports? Will it have
responsibility only for professional games or matches, or for amateur
competition too? Will its remit cover grounds or events that people pay
to attend or all sporting events? What discussions have the Government
had with people who were at Hillsborough or the families who were
bereaved? Has the Minister considered whether there might be useful or
relevant information relating to crowd or ground safety that might
emerge from the release of all the documents relating to the
Hillsborough disaster which is due to take place over the next
two years?<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Have the
Government consulted the Premier League, the Football League and the
Football Association about how well the FLA has operated so far? Have
ministers met representatives of fans’ organisations such as the
Football Supporters Federation, for example? What discussions have
taken place with governing bodies and supporters’ organisations
in other sports and what advice have the police provided about this
proposal?<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, we
are also concerned about the implications of the Public Bodies Bill for
the FLA or the new authority. Members on both sides of the Committee
will agree that the FLA has done a good job and will want to know why
the Government propose to replace it with the new authority at this
point and then abolish it. The Government announced the abolition of
the FLA in the comprehensive spending review and said its
responsibilities are being transferred to another body. The Secretary
of State with responsibility for the Cabinet Office has been reported
as saying that responsibility for safety at grounds would now shift to

that? What is the timetable for the new authority’s abolition,
who will take responsibility for its work and what measures will be put
in place to ensure that safety is not

start as others have done by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr Brady. I
also put on the record my thanks to the hon. Member for Woking for
introducing this Bill and to the shadow Minister both for his
contribution and the trouble he took to get behind the Bill over the
last couple of days. Perhaps I might say by way of introduction that
this baby has been a long time in gestation. The first attempt to do
this was in the 2001 Culture and Recreation Bill introduced by the
previous Government. It then reappeared briefly in a Home Office Bill
before running out of time during the last Parliament. Lord Faulkner
tried to introduce it as a private Member’s Bill in the other
place with the support of Baroness Taylor. Over the last 10 years the
measure has enjoyed broad cross-party consensus. I shall make a number
of comments on that before I attempt to answer the questions raised by
the shadow Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill has
a certain urgency at the moment because of the London 2012 Olympics.
The London Organising Committee is keen to make use of the expertise
that lies inside the FLA but the current remit of the FLA does not
allow that. A body of expertise has been built up in British sport and
we are not able to use it for the most important event that British
sport is now facing. That is clearly nonsense. That said, I reiterate
absolutely what my hon. Friend the Member for Woking has said. It is
firmly our intention that football safety and security will remain the
core function of this body. To give everybody confidence that I am not
just saying that and that it is genuinely the case, the wider powers
contained in this Bill could be used only with the express permission
of the Secretary of State. He or she would have to be absolutely sure
that it was in the wider interest before these powers could be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
powers in the Bill mirror the current powers of the FLA, which shows
that we trust the FLA and that the experience of the period that the
FLA has been in existence has given Governments of both colours
enormous confidence in the way that it performs its task. The shadow
Minister is correct that the FLA’s funding was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 6<a class="bkMark" name="Column6">&#160;</a>
                           </div>cut in the comprehensive spending review, but it was put in the reserved
pot—receiving a tiny cut of 4% and being spared the much larger
cuts imposed elsewhere—because it was recognised as having such
an important function. Indeed, we took out any of the original
provisions in the Culture and Recreation Bill 2001 that we thought
would be controversial to ensure that this Bill had a broad measure of
approval.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will try to run through the questions, but I am not sure that my
handwriting was quick enough to catch them all. There have been
discussions with the Hillsborough families. Their chief representative
saw the Secretary of State within the past couple of days, and the
families have indicated their approval of the Bill. I would not want to
paraphrase or misquote them, but I understand that their key point is
that safety in football grounds, and sports grounds generally, is
paramount and that anything that increases that across a wider range of
sports grounds has to be a good thing. I was not involved in earlier
discussions, but I guess that that was why they indicated their
approval during the last Parliament and the preceding one, and they
continue to give their approval. If either of the two Labour Merseyside
Members is in regular contact with that group, please could they pass
on my assurances to the Hillsborough families and my thanks for their
continued
support?<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
have been consultations with the FA, the Premier League and the
Football League, who are all in favour of the Bill. I am due to see
Supporters Direct within the next couple of weeks on broader issues of
football governance. I cannot give an absolute assurance that it has
been asked about the Bill, but certainly it has made no
representations. The Bill has been floating around for nigh on 10
years, and as far as I am aware it has not raised any objections during
that period. I regularly meet the chief executives of the big five
sports, and other sports are extremely keen on the Bill. The London
Organising Committee of the Olympic Games wants the Bill to be enacted.
The shadow Minister asked about the police, who are also very
supportive of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000025">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the future of the FLA, I am absolutely determined that it will continue
to carry out its core functions, and the extra functions that it will
be given in the Bill, in the same way as it has always done. However,
it is illogical to have six people in a little satellite office next to
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. They almost feel slightly
groundless, and putting them into a larger, more powerful organisation,
which would allow them to save money on back office functions and which
broadly reflects their safety remit, is sensible, because they are
sitting in a pod on their own at the moment. It is telling that, in the
five years that I shadowed this brief in opposition, I never ran across
the FLA, which did not cross my radar until I became the Minister.
Finding it a proper, sensible home, which reflects the importance of
its task, would be sensible. I assure the Committee that that will not
be done in any way that conflicts with its core role. I think that I
have run through the
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000026">&#160;</a>

                           </div>the origins of the FLA. My aim, therefore, is to try to devolution-proof
the Bill by recognising the devolution settlement and the different
political background in Wales. I am grateful to the hon. Member for his
discussions with me on the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
ground safety may not be specifically devolved, sport in general is a
matter for the Minister for Heritage in the National Assembly for
Wales, who has responsibility for many of the issues that are dealt
with in Westminster by the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics,
Media and Sport. The Bill relates to England and Wales in territorial
extent, as we have heard. From my reading of the FLA website, there are
only two grounds in Wales currently included in its scope—the
Cardiff City stadium in Cardiff and the fantastic Liberty stadium in
Swansea, a ground where I have spent many happy Saturday afternoons,
especially recently, and which is home to the mighty Swansea City
football
club.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the Bill’s explanatory notes state that international football
grounds in England and Wales are also included. This widens the scope
in Wales, where Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli—which is, of course,
a rugby ground—has hosted football internationals for Wales, as
have the Millennium stadium in Cardiff and the Racecourse ground in
Wrexham. All those grounds have been used by the Welsh football team in
the past five
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000029">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
widening of the remit to include other sports means that other venues
could also come into play. I want to know what discussions the UK
Government and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport have had
with Welsh organisations, such as the Football Association of Wales,
Welsh Rugby Union and Sport Wales regarding the changes that they are
promoting through the Bill. The same question applies for discussions
with the Welsh Government, who, as I have already made clear, are
generally responsible for sport in Wales. I suggest that the
administrative powers held by the Secretary of State in England in the
current version of the Bill should largely be in the hands of Welsh
Ministers when matters relate to Wales. That would mean changing clause
2 so that the authority may provide advice to a Welsh Minister in
addition to the Ministers of the Crown, and clause 5 so that a fee
charged by the authority for advice would require the
consent of the Welsh Ministers for an organisation in Wales. Clause 4,
which deals with bodies outside England and Wales, would be
untouched.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also suggest that the National Assembly for Wales as a body is included
in clause 3—a future-proofing measure that would allow, for
example, the National Assembly as a body to ask for advice regarding
ground safety on, say, a Welsh Commonwealth Games bid. Because of the
different political background and organisations in Wales, it makes
sense to us to have a member of the authority who has specific
knowledge and expertise about our country. We suggest that there is a
Welsh member of the authority with this role, perhaps in addition to
other roles undertaken for the authority and not as a sole task. Our
preferred solution would be that the Welsh Minister makes the
appointment and takes on the role held by the Secretary of State for
the appointments in schedule 1. I am informed that this 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would involve an addition to paragraph 2 of the schedule. Acceptance of
our suggestions would lead to awkward phrasing throughout the Bill,
which could be solved by referring to the Secretary of State and Welsh
Ministers as the “relevant authority” throughout, with
clarification in clause 5(5).<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We presume
that responsibility for sports grounds safety in general is not
devolved, given the workings of the three Acts referred to in the Bill,
although local authorities are generally held to be responsible for
sports grounds safety in their own areas. Local authorities, of course,
are devolved. A clarification of that position on the face of the Bill
might be welcomed, after discussion and consultation with the relevant
Welsh Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In short, I
would like to know what consideration has been given to these issues as
a whole. I hope that the Bill’s promoter and the relevant
Minister will take my concerns into account as the Bill progresses. As
I have already made clear, I have no intention of blocking or
preventing the Bill, but given that it extends to Wales, the issues
relating to devolution cannot be swept under the carpet and
ignored.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000033">&#160;</a>

Minister for the Cabinet Office about what was to happen to all the
non-departmental public bodies. The FLA was listed, at that time, as a
body that would be abolished, and I wondered what on earth would
happen. It seems that we have since moved on a great deal, for which I
am most grateful, but I would appreciate some clarification about
precisely where the new body will sit and how that fits with local
authorities being responsible for advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000037">&#160;</a>

phrase, which since has become unfortunate, but it is worth ensuring

about the arrangements for their safety, and that we all know how we

sports wish to come to the Sports Ground Safety Authority, in its new

FLA gives to football grounds, and on football-related matters, will
continue to be free to the recipient. The only charges will be to other
sports, where a contribution, in effect, to cover costs will be
charged. The only charges will be on the request of the recipient of
that advice. That element of charging at cost will include a certain
amount of overhead and running costs, so if anything, there will be a
small reimbursement to the authority, which will enable it to give even
more advice to football authorities and other football-related

I used to sit on the ground safety advisory group in Liverpool. The FLA
always attended and regularly gave advice, which was received by all

full cost recovery for that advice, people would simply stop asking for
the advice, knowing that there is a charge. I am happy with the

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had extensive discussions with the Welsh Assembly Government at
official level. The reason we are not keen at this stage to pick up the
suggestion of the hon. Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr is
precisely that the Bill is a safety measure, not a sports measure. If
it was a sports measure it would be a devolved matter; because it is a
safety measure, at the moment, it is not. I do not have any ideological
objection to devolving safety measures, but that is a much wider
argument. It is important when looking at the safety of people in
sports grounds that, if we are to devolve it, we devolve it as a
package rather than piecemeal, because when little bits of
responsibility start to go, but not others, that is precisely when the
boundaries get clouded, risking a disaster that nobody
wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
best offer I can make to the hon. Gentleman is that we have reinstated
the sports cabinets that discuss such issues—by happy
coincidence, the next meeting is in three weeks’ time in
Cardiff—so if he would like to have the matter raised, my advice
would be to make representations there. The Welsh Minister will be in
the chair, so it would be an extremely good opportunity to discuss this
at an early stage, if that is what he
wants.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Woking gave a perfect answer about the
charging regime. There will be absolutely no fee for anything related
to the FLA’s current roles and responsibilities. I hope I have
reassured the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton, who presumably is
happier about his football club than he was when we last had a football
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the new home, if I am honest—I must be careful how I put
this—I am keen to get the Bill through and to extend the remit
of the organisation as an indication of the confidence that we have in
it. There is a logical fit between the two organisations under
consideration, because the Health and Safety Executive is primarily a
safety-based organisation. If that does not happen, as the hon. Member
for Wirral South is aware, we are merging Sport England and UK Sport
into a single body, and that could provide a sensible option. We are
looking closely at the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic park as a home for
the new body, to get its constituent parts out of central London where
they are paying high rents and all have different IT contracts,
back-room contracts and so on. The FLA could benefit from being in a
larger body in which it could share some of the expenses that come with
separate back-office functions, but I give the hon. Lady an assurance
that nothing will be done that puts at risk the FLA’s key roles
and
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11011949000051">&#160;</a>
