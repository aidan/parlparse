<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley):</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. This afternoon, Parliament will have many visitors. A large number of disabled people will be coming to lobby hon. Members and some may wish to listen to our proceedings. Would it be in order to ask the Serjeant at Arms if the Committee could move to a larger Room this afternoon so that more people can be accommodated in the public gallery?
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. On behalf of the Opposition, I endorse that request, which is an admirable suggestion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall do what I can when  the Committee adjourns for lunch. I shall ask the Serjeant at Arms if the Committee can move to a larger Room and, in anticipation that that will be possible, I suggest that hon. Members take their papers with them when we adjourn.
<P>
It is rather warm in the Room this morning, so hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets. Also, there is an odd odour of cyclamen in the Room. I do not know why and I cannot imagine that anyone has been fixing lamp slides. I apologise for that, but there is nothing I can do about it.
<H4><center>Clause 45</center></H4>
<H4><center>New allowances for bereaved spouses</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 41, leave out lines 44 to 48.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 103, in page 41, line 45, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "six years".
<P>
No. 95, in page 41, line 45, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "five years".
<P>
No. 96, in page 41, line 45, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "three years".
<P>
No. 97, in page 41, line 45, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "one year".
<P>
No. 219, in page 41, line 45, after "26 weeks", insert ", or 52 weeks should the surviving spouse have been caring for the spouse full-time immediately before the death,".
<P>
No. 107, in page 41, line 45, leave out "26 weeks" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"1 year plus 26 weeks for every whole year the surviving spouse has lived over the age of 45".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 106, in page 42, leave out lines 6 to 8.
<P>
No. 108, in page 42, line 6, leave out "26 weeks".
<P>
No. 104, in page 42, line 6, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "six years".
<P>
No. 98, in page 42, line 6, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "five years".
<P>
No. 99, in page 42, line 6, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "three years".
<P>
No. 100, in page 42, line 6, leave out "26 weeks" and insert "one year".
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> One of the advantages of the cold from which I am suffering is that I am blissfully unaware of any smell in the Committee Room.
<P>
The amendments cover the substantial change that is being made by the Government, namely, the abolition of the widows pension. That has given rise to most of the lobbying that members of the Committee have received. You will recall, Mr. McWilliam, that during our previous sitting the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley) clarified the position of existing widows. We are still receiving many letters about the matter and confusion exists. It is worth repeating that existing widows will be unaffected by the provisions if they reach 45 when their youngest child ceases full-time education. It is worth emphasising that because there is still confusion about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Existing widows are not affected, by the changes at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am slightly taken aback by that. The Under-Secretary stated at our previous sitting:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Existing widows in receipt of widowed mother"s allowance will be able to receive widow"s pension if they are aged 45 or over when their youngest child ceases to be dependent. That is the current system and that protection will be continued. New widows and widowers in receipt of widowed parents allowance will not be able to receive bereavement allowance." (Official Report, Standing Committee D, 25 March 1999; c. 533.)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, a widow aged 44 would not receive the pension that is slightly different from what the Minister of State is saying. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security can clarify that? I think that it illustrates the confusion that exists. Is what the hon. Gentleman says in col. 533 correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Indeed it is. I want to make it clear, as my hon. Friend did last week, that existing widows are not affected by these changes. The hon. Gentleman has qualified that in a way that has obscured the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I prefer what the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security said in col. 533 to what the Minister is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Does not the intervention of the Minister of State throw these matters into a harsh light? Why should new widows be treated differently from existing widows? What has suddenly changed about widowhood that means that they have to be treated differently?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend has asked a salient question. The answer is that the Government wish to save £500 million a year and their chosen target for that saving is widows, because they are soft targets. Those who will be affected by the measure do not know that they are about to be affected. They are married to a healthy husband, with whom they are looking forward to spending long years of marriage, and they do not realise that in two or three years" time they might be placed in a difficult situation.
<P>
They think that they will have a lifeline to help them whereas they will find that that lifeline is limited, and has a span of only six month.
<P>
The amendments try in every way imaginable to ameliorate that situation. Some have been tabled by my hon. Friends and me, some by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel). They all seek to do the same thing, which is to find a way to cut back on the harshness of the six months rule. Although I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Newbury, I can speak for my hon. Friends in saying that all the amendments represent a second-best solution. The best solution would be for the existing protection, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) referred, to continue. The amendments are all second best they are amelioration amendments.
<P>
The clause exists to pay for the equality that the Bill would introduce. In its attempt to help men by offering them parents bereavement allowance, it will cause great injustice and inequality among women. A number of cases have been taken before the European courts, in which men looking after children have been disadvantaged because widow's benefit related only to women. I accept that that injustice existed. However, in striving for equality, the measures will detrimentally affect women, and widows will be considerably damaged. The cutting off of the bereavement allowance after six months will cause widows real hardship. The way in which we treat the bereaved is a test of a civilised society. People are at their most vulnerable at the time of their bereavement and, with this measure, we are abandoning women to their fate.
<P>
We have been fortunate to receive high quality briefing from the National Association of Widows and the Widows Advisory Trust, which have experience of and expertise in the problems of widowhood. They say that it takes an average of two years for a person to adjust. The briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The proposals given an allowance of six months after which the widowed person is expected to be fit to move through the system into full-time paid employment. In our long experience of bereavement care we would identify six months as being a crucial point in the grieving process. In the early stages of grief the shock goes some way to numb the pain, however at six months the shock is fading and the loss becomes a reality. Imagine the difficulty at this point for a woman who may not have worked outside the home, may have nursed her husband for many months, and still grieving, having to register as unemployed and begin actively seeking work."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not believe that Labour Members are cruel or without care, but what I cannot believe is that anyone who has experience of bereavement who has either lost a spouse or seen a mother, sister or daughter go through the experience could accept the measures. People with experience of bereavement know how debilitating it is.
<P>
I am not sure whether any Committee member has suffered the loss of a spouse I hope that they will be spared that experience for many years but I know what it felt like to lose my mother in my mid-20s. It had an absolutely numbing effect. You have no judgment I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, I did not mean to address you directly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is apologising. I lost my mother when I was 21. I know exactly what he is talking about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I recall having no judgment. I went through a period when I thought that I was recovering and then something happened and it hit me again. It is a recurring problem. Anyone who has seen a friend or a relative suffer from the effects of widowhood will know that it affects people in different ways. There is a denial phase and a woman may go into deep grief on a wedding anniversary or a birthday, when the loss is especially felt. We are about to have a public holiday. Easter, like Christmas and Whitsuntide, brings memories of happier times. When families are gathered together, the loss is felt all the more. When families that are that not suffering from bereavement are enjoying themselves and a person is excluded from those celebrations, the loss is acute.
<P>
There are many famous examples of bereavement. It is easier to talk about historical figures than our relatives. I am reminded of Queen Victoria and the loss of Prince Albert. She was without Albert for a longer period of her reign than she was with him. After his death, she had his clothes put out every morning and his shaving bowl filled with hot water the routine of the house went on as it always had. Relatives of mine who have suffered a bereavement were unable to take their husband"s clothes out of the wardrobe. The example of Queen Victoria is interesting because she put the court into mourning for many years, to such an extent that it threatened the viability of the monarchy. Any one who has read her highland journals will understand how deep was her loss.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Another extreme in bereavement may be that a bereaved person quickly plunges into a new relationship. They may do so because they need companionship, although I do not suggest that their loss is any less, or out of economic necessity, although that influence was greater before pensions were available. I want to give an historical example rather than to discuss people whom I know have experienced a loss. My example will be of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who is a keen military historian. During the Napoleonic wars in the early 19th century, it was the habit for many wives to follow the Army they drew lots for the right to do so. After a fatality on the field, it was common for a widow to be married before nightfall. Frankly, they did so out of economic necessity.
<P>
My worry about the Government"s proposals is that they may push a widow into a rushed relationship, partially because economic necessity

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My worry is that widows pensions were not available during the Napoleonic wars. The hon. Gentleman should return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. I thought that my remarks had returned to the amendment. The point is that the Bill will abolish the widows pension. I do not suggest for one moment that it will be as hard for widows as it was during the Napoleonic wars the state exists to offer support but the Government"s proposals will involve a degree of genteel poverty. When the benefit is ended after six months, people will be forced to reach out for emotional and economic security.
<P>
You accepted, Mr. McWilliam, that after a bereavement, people are in no position to make value judgments. It takes a long time for people"s emotions to settle down, if they ever do. It must be much harder and the loss will be all the more acute if a spouse died not because of a long illness or an accident but because of suicide. All the emotions that we feel loss, grief, and asking the question, "Why me?" are greater when the person has committed suicide.
<P>
I am sure that all Committee members received a letter from Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide. I am grateful to Patricia Thomas, its liaison officer, who wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am extremely concerned by the lack of appreciation of the effects of bereavement, especially in cases such as suicide which inevitably causes significant traumatic shock. The suggestion that a widow will, six months after such an event when she is still suffering from shock, be capable of applying for jobs, attending interviews or coping with the further rejection of not being offered a post, is completely unrealistic."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that all Committee members would agree with that view. Such difficulties are compounded where a widow has devoted herself to supporting her husband"s career at the expense of her domestic life. She may have moved around the country because her husband was promoted or changed jobs. Wives often fit in with the needs of the family by taking up part-time work.
<P>
Given that Mrs. Thomas is of an age whereby she will not be affected by the proposals, the strength of her argument is enhanced. Despite having obtained an honours degree in adult teaching, she accepted a series of relatively low-paid jobs. She also emphasises that the six-month rule is wholly inadequate for those who are bereaved through suicide.
<P>
Mrs. Thomas"s letter also raises the question of wives who cared for their sick husbands for a long time and under the new regulations husbands who cared for their wives on a long-term basis. I know of people who have looked after their spouses for two or three years prior to their death: the impact of seeing a loved one deteriorate and die before one"s eyes is considerable. Many widows have recurring nightmares about those traumatic events. Although the widows pension cannot reduce the grief and the nightmares, it offers some security while they prepare themselves, where appropriate, to enter the workplace.
<P>
It is generally accepted that wives no longer stay at home, looking after the children and doing the hoovering, and that a work force of women are instead engaged heavily in the market. However, it is not merely Opposition Members who recognise that the economic power of women, particularly middle-aged women, has been greatly exaggerated. On page 42 of research paper 99/19 on the Bill, the Social Security Advisory Committee express a similar worry about the older bereaved women. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The emphasis on their regaining financial independence through employment we regard as unrealistic."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the previous sitting, Mr. McWilliam, the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) made an interesting speech, in which she exalted the possibility of people aged between 60 and 64 training and returning to the employment market. Such people do not have a realistic chance of returning to the jobs market. The combination of lack of qualifications and it must be admitted ageism, prevents bereaved people in that age group from having any realistic opportunity of gaining a substantial income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Except, of course, in demeaning jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I accept my hon. Friends point, but anybody who is gainfully employed is worthy of respect. The result will be genteel poverty, as people are pushed further down into means-tested benefits.
<P>
Cruise Bereavement Care stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"losing a spouse from the age of forty-five to retirement age is usually devastating and can result in financial hardship. In particular, many parents in this age group still need to continue to support their older teenage or young adult children through further or higher education or training."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mrs. Thomas also gave a good example of how her income fell initially by two thirds after bereavement. After a series of redundancies, her income decreased by a further half. Her case illustrates my hon. Friend"s point.
<P>
The purpose of the allowance was to give people a little extra help, which would prevent them from dropping into means-tested benefits. As the Committee will be aware from an earlier debate, 16 per cent. of widows receive means-tested benefits a relatively small number in comparison with similar people in that age bracket. As a direct result of the ending of the allowance after six months, many people will be pushed into means-tested benefits. The £500 million a year cut will only cause further growth in the social security budget.
<P>
One of the amendments would offer additional help to those who cared for a spouse on a full-time basis immediately before the death. Other amendments take account of age difference by increasing the period in which the allowance could be paid to the surviving spouse. The amendments, some of which were tabled by my hon. Friends and some by the hon. Member for Newbury, suggest increasing the period of payment to two, three five or six years. I reiterate my earlier point that these are second-best solutions 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I am confused. I thought that amendment No. 105 would remove any time-limiting on the benefit. Perhaps I misunderstood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to pick me up on that point. I was talking generically about the series of amendments that follow and the various solutions that they offer, although this amendment does not meet the Government"s needs. The hon. Gentleman is probably a more optimistic chap than I, but I do not think that the Government will vote for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I hope they may.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; hope springs eternal. I am just giving the Government an opportunity to grab at branches as they fall from the tree. They will regret introducing this provision because it will cause great hardship, so we are giving them opportunities to stop the process. If the Government think that one of the amendments is acceptable, or if they anticipate what will happen on the Floor of the House and can say which of the amendments they find acceptable, I am sure that we can find a way to overcome the difficulties.
<P>
In conclusion, a common thread runs through the amendments, previous amendments and amendments that are still to be considered; that is, a breach of the contributory principle. Men have made contributions for many years under the assumption that, in the event of their untimely demise, part of the income available will be the widow"s pension. It is a tremendous shock that the contributory principle that we pay in and expect to get something back in certain circumstances is being breached. There will be an outcry about this, although the outcry will be limited to those people who are involved with organisations or those who are especially affected by the measure. The victims of this savage and unpleasant measure are as yet unknown. They continue in their daily lives in ignorance of the fact that this measure will affect them greatly.
<P>
The Government have made a real mistake. They want to cut the social security budget, so they have chosen this particular set of victims because they are not a group of people who naturally come together. Grief tends to be private and will be spread throughout the whole community. However, it is not too late for the Government to change their mind and I strongly urge them to do so because that is the only way in which we can deliver a civilised and just society.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) keeps referring to me in the plural. I am singular. There is only one of me, and it is far too early in the morning for the hon. Gentleman to be seeing two of me.
<P>
In addition, I have received a report that the engineers are "looking into" the smell. The Committee will meet in Committee Room 14 this afternoon and I shall arrange for the Room to be roped off so that the maximum number of visitors can attend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Having served under your tutelage for some time now, I always regard you as being omnipresent.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It seems that way only when hon. Members are out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Committee today, particularly on the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) and myself. I wish to apologise to the Committee on behalf of my hon. Friend, who has unfortunately gone down with a severe stomach problem and will, therefore, not be able to join us today. He hopes to be back with us after Easter.
<P>
The amendments that I have tabled are, largely in line with the comments made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. They would give the Government a number of options. The Government claim that to extent to widowers benefits that applied only to widows there is unanimity that that should happen would mean taking money from somewhere else. Although I understand that argument, I believe that if the levels of benefit were right for widows, they will probably be right for widowers. It is a pity that the Government cannot run the economy sufficiently effectively to extend the payments to widowers because, as there are far fewer of them, the amount involved would not be that great. If we accept that the Government have to find the money from somewhere, it is not unreasonable to find it within the overall compass of bereavement benefits.
<P>
In response to a parliamentary question that I tabled a long time ago, the Government gave the overall level of savings that they were expecting to achieve. Even with the extension to widowers, the overall saving should be £500 million. That would give us a considerable sum to play with if we assume that bereavement payments in general should not suffer an overall cut. The amendments contain a succession of extensions of the payment of bereavement allowance from 26 weeks onwards. The extent to which that would eat into the £500 million would depend on the extension of time, but it would leave plenty of money to spend on measures that are proposed in our other amendments on bereavement payments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 95 and 98 would extend the payment of bereavement allowance from 26 weeks to five years; amendments Nos. 96 and 99 would extend it from 26 weeks to three years; and amendments Nos. 97 and 100 would extend it from 26 weeks to one year. The extension to one year would eat into the savings by a mere £50 million, which would leave a great deal of money to be used to extend the bereavement allowance in other ways. The extension to three years and five years would take £200 million and £350 million respectively from the savings. Even an extension to a full five years would leave the Government £150 million to go on other bereavement payments.
<P>
Plenty of money is available. The Government should not be worried about extending the payments if we make the reasonable assumption that the overall level of payments to widows and widowers should not be cut. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, it is odd for the Government to choose to target widows and widowers to make saving as if they were the least deserving members of our population. I find it hard to conceive that a Labour Government would think in that way, but this one does.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It is not a Labour Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> That is a good point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Sedentary interventions should be deplored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Deplorable though it was, the point was excellent: this Labour Government are more Tory that the Tories (Interruption.)
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must not heckle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Government said that there is a growing something-for-nothing culture in the welfare system. I find it hard to believe that widows are getting something for nothing. The opposite is the case. National insurance contributions that were made by husbands or wives for a considerable time will be largely ignored when they die. Should the worst happen should a spouse unfortunately die at a comparatively early age they will not get the pay-out that they were expecting to receive on the grounds that they had paid their national insurance premiums for a long time.
<P>
During the Bill"s passage through the House, the Government have sought to stigmatise widows and widowers as scroungers who want to get something for nothing, but they should not have done so. They will not get something for nothing. On Second Reading, a Labour Member said that the Government were attempting to give widows and widowers "nothing for something".
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar made it clear that the contributory principle is being eroded. Age Concern's parliamentary briefing contained an interesting case study. It referred to a 52-year-old woman who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"described the reform "as a very cruel and pernicious attack on potential widows who, by virtue of their age and National Insurance contributions paid by their husband thought they were in the system." Her husband, who is some 20 years older, had assumed that his state widow"s pension and half his occupational pension would provide a moderate income for her were he to die before pension age."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, that will no longer be the case.
<P>
In October 1998, The Independent on Sunday published a letter on the potential cuts to widows benefits, about which rumours were then circulating. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No insurance company would dare to announce ... suddenly that it was not going to pay pensions to its customers. What this Government is planning is to renege on the contract made with taxpayers and those who have paid National Insurance Contributions, naively believing that they would pay for their families should anything happen to them."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar mentioned the Social Security Advisory Committee, which argued that the proposal involved 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unilaterally withdrawing rights earned by many years of contributions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Government"s proposal is worse than mis-selling, in which the victim at least had some choice about whether to make use of the product? The Government"s proposal involves mis-taxing or mis-taking. The deceased husband had no choice about paying national insurance contributions, which will be stolen from his widow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman"s comments. Mis-selling and mis-taxing are equally pernicious. The Government will take from widows and widowers what they believed was theirs by right. The Government"s proposals will mis-use the tax system and destroy the contributory principle.
<P>
The Leader of the House of Commons sat on the Standing Committee that considered the Social Security Act 1986. She said that the then Opposition the Labour party considered that it was indefensible casually to abolish benefits to which people had contributed for years. It is interesting that the Government are taking the opposite view to that taken in 1986 by the right hon. Lady, who is now one of the Cabinet"s most senior members. The Government"s proposal will increase reliance on means-tested benefits, which now involve 35 per cent. of benefit spending. That figure is roughly double the figure that applied when the Conservative party came to power in 1979, when it was only 16 per cent.
<P>
Six months is simply too short a time limit and it should be extended. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar gave various examples, which I shall not repeat, and he quoted the moving evidence that was given by Patricia Thomas of Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide.
<P>
As those of us who have ever been unemployed know, it can take many months, perhaps even years, to find another job when one has been made redundant or, as in this case, when one"s circumstances have changed to the extent that one needs to find work after being out of work for many years, perhaps while looking after a family. In those circumstances, a person might not have been expecting to need to go back to work and would not have anticipated the need for training. To give people six months to do that is nothing like sufficient.
<P>
When their money runs out after six months, I am sure that many people will find that they are unable to find paid employment, either because they are still traumatised by what has happened or because they have not had the relevant training and experience to get back into work within that time. In those circumstances, people will inevitably have to move on to means-tested benefits.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government are ignoring the problems faced by older people in gaining employment, particularly the problems for women who have been out of work for some time. Those problems will be exacerbated in the cases of widows and widowers who are going through a traumatic experience and are unable to concentrate on training or retraining in order to find work.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to the remarks of the Social Security Advisory Committee, but he quoted only the middle of a somewhat longer section, which I should like to repeat. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are also concerned about the position of the older bereaved especially women without dependent children under the new arrangements. The emphasis on their regaining financial independence through employment we regard as unrealistic. As with disabled people, the labour market does not easily absorb those without specific skills, especially when employment is contracting and competition for work intensifies."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the past few days, we have read in the papers about the row between the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Chancellor. The Secretary of State has recognised that employment difficulties lie ahead of us and that it is likely that unemployment will rise in the next year or two. That will make his task more difficult, especially in relation to the new deal. If the Secretary of State"s task will be more difficult, the task for widows and widowers, in getting back into work when they are unexpectedly bereaved, will be very difficult.
<P>
Cruse Bereavement Care commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The short term bereavement allowance is not an adequate substitute for the pension, especially for those who may be struggling very hard to keep their heads above water and to keep a family together; if introduced it should be for a minimum of at least one year."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are giving the Government an opportunity to consider various extensions to the bereavement allowance, even if they have to restrict it to some extent in order to prevent overall costs from rising.
<P>
I hope that the Government will say that they are prepared to relax the rigid six-month limit. I hope that they will recognise that there is a growing feeling among Government Back Benchers that the Bill is not in  line with the policies, ideals and philosophy of the Labour party. I hope that they will recognise that it is time for them to admit that they are wrong to introduce such a severe cut in widows pensions. In doing so, I hope that they will have the humility to accept that some of the ideas in the amendments are better than the Government"s proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> There are two sides to today"s debate. The Government could seek to take on the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar and the hon. Member for Newbury have advanced so skillfully that those who are widowed need a pension but I doubt that they will. I suspect that the Minister of State will say that he has no choice but to extend equality to widowers. He will take the hon. Member for Newbury to task as Ministers often do with Liberal Democrat spokesmen for wanting to be all things to all men, for being free in spending other people"s money and for not living in the real world. I can see the Minister"s arguments forming in his mind he is already choosing careful and compassionate words to express them.
<P>
I want to differ my argument slightly from that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar and the hon. Member for Newbury. I shall use the freedom of the Back Bench to do so. Before thatÊ I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. McWilliam I want to reinforce some of the previous arguments.
<P>
The Government rightly wish to avoid legislation that irritates whole groups of people. When the Conservative party was in government, it was too prepared to do what was right [Interruption.] Labour Members may not agree that what we did was right, but we thought that it was right and were prepared to take on various interest groups. Perhaps that was a mistake; perhaps that was what made us so unpopular.
<P>
Surely the test of a good Government is not popularity but doing what is right. The proposal will cause the Government not one jot of unpopularity. It will receive no attention, except from tiny organisations, and will result in no newspaper stories. None of us knows when we will die we could make great speeches and be taken this evening and we will soon be forgotten. Nobody knows when bereavement will occur. The victims of the proposal are therefore unidentified. That does not mean, however, that the Government are right. They are not right; they are wrong.
<P>
I do not know what will happen in this Committee not a great deal, I fear but I urge my hon. Friends to press for further votes on Report. That may result in an interesting debate and in different voices emerging from the Labour party.
<P>
The Government"s philosophy is that everyone must work there is nothing wrong with that in some senses. I am sure that the Committee will agree, however, that staying at home to bring up children is as important as other work; indeed, it is more important. Raising children is not only important for children, it is a stressful and very skilled job. Sadly, it does not equip those who do it for most jobs in the marketplace. I am attracted by many of the amendments, which try to help the Government who do not want to go the full distance to give some credit to older women who will find it more difficult to get into the marketplace.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, rightly took me to task when I said that some women might be forced into demeaning jobs. I agree that no job is demeaning. Working on a cash desk at Sainsburys is not demeaning to somebody in her mid-30s or a young woman who wants to earn extra money, but it is demeaning for a woman who is forced into that job.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The widows pension enables people to take jobs of smaller remuneration and keep their heads above water. The Government are removing that capacity and forcing people to rely simply on their job on the till at Tesco or Sainsburys.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I imagine that many widows especially young widows want to get into the marketplace, meet people and get any kind of job, even if it is slightly demeaning. It may pay pin money, but as my hon. Friend says they have some security. That is different from being forced into the marketplace after six months, which is wrong.
<P>
Many promises have been made about national insurance. The hon. Member for Newbury used a telling phrase which we should not forget the "nothing for something" society. We have also heard powerful arguments about shock. As the death of my father demonstrated, the early weeks of widowhood are not the most difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downes): This clause is at the heart of part V of the Bill and the amendments would offer the Government a choice on potential let-outs. I object to the clause in four crucial ways. First, it will constitute the major undermining of a national insurance scheme that people have come to understand. One might as well say, "Oh well, let"s redefine old-age pensions as well." Standard universal benefits such as widows pensions and old-age pensions are central to national insurance. If one is making clever cuts to redefine such benefits, one could redefine other universal benefits similarly. Contrary to the view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, the smell in the Room will, in my view, become a national stench when people realise that this highly complex Bill will abolish the widows pension.
<P>
Secondly, the Bill lacks clarity. Yet again, its wording is tremendously complex, as are the explanatory notes. I remain unclear as to the position of women under 55 and under 45. In effect, the Government are saying, "Isn"t it wonderful that we will pay pensions to widowers and increase bereavement allowances?" At the same time, they are hiding away in the Bill their intention to abolish the pension to which widows are currently entitled, until they qualify for old-age pension.
<P>
The third of my crucial points concerns the time-limiting of widows pensions, which I do not support. If there is to be time-limiting, substantial notice must be given. The proposal "appointed day" provides a ridiculously short amount of notice. People make financial provisions that they can afford according to their understanding of their entitlement under national insurance. To rob and remove the widows pension at only two years" notice is wrong. Ten years" notice should be given, which would allow people time to make alternative private provision.
<P>
If you are going to cut significant national insurance contributions, in theory, you should cut contributions to allow people to make their own private arrangements 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There was an entire flock of "you"s" in that sentence. I am going to do none of those things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam, for the flight of that flock of "you"s" [Laughter.]
<P>
My fourth point is that women in the House of Commons tend to assume that it is the norm for all women, particularly women under 50, to want high-powered careers, or that it will become so. My experience is that most women do not want high-powered, full-time careers. A large number of my wife"s friends, who are aged about 50, and my three daughters all want to be good mothers and wives, although they may want to work part-time as well. We shall not have a society in 10 years, let alone two years, in which all women want full-time, high-powered careers.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The question is not what women want, but the reality facing women in their 40s and 50s now. The majority of those women do not have high-powered jobs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The point is that women should have a choice as to what they wish to do. Most women who are widowed will not have high-powered careers that have continued or to which they can easily return. It will not be easy for most of them to go back to work and earn a decent living. That is not something that lady Members of Parliment, lady lawyers and so on have to worry about, but it will not be easy for the majority of women. As a man, I selfishly welcome the introduction of the widower"s allowance, but I would rather not benefit from it if it is at the expense of the genuinely more needy, which is what the proposal boils down to.
<P>
The crucial point, as other hon. Members have cogently argued is that six months is too short and two years" notice is too short. Will the Minister explain more clearly the precise transitional arrangements? I have read the notes many times and I believe that most people here, let alone the public at large, do not fully understand how the transitional arrangements will work. The crucial objection is the notice and the reduction to an inadequate age.
<P>
A standard, universal widow"s pension up to retirement age is still necessary and appropriate in our society, even if the number of widows is falling. As it has been said, that mere fact, means that the cost is not huge. If widowers must be added because of EU legislation, then so be it, but it is not a justification for removing the pension from those with greater need.
<P>
Finally, it is not acceptable for a Government who allegedly support the national insurance principle to undermine it thus by stealth. I hope that Conservative Members will make that even clearer and will be firm in not supporting it. We support continuation of clear, socially necessary, basic universal benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 go to the heart of the principle, but I shall refer also to smaller amendments covering transitional arrangements should Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 be defeated.
<P>
I emphasised earlier the two main underlying principles: honouring the contributory principle and the message that we send to households of modest means with regard to saving and self-provision.
<P>
People who have paid their national insurance contributions for many years did so in good faith, in the belief that it would provide not only for their old-age pension, but for the widow, if the husband died first as they do in the majority of cases, for the simple biological reason that women live, on average, six years longer than men.
<P>
The hardest cases of all are those people who chose voluntarily to make contributions. A constituent who came to see me in my surgery the other day had chosen to make a voluntary contribution of just under £1,000 about 16 or 17 years ago. It is extraordinary that such people should be disadvantaged. He did not come to see me about widows benefit, but his widow would have been affected, had he died shortly after that, and had the proposals already been in force.
<P>
Do we as a Parliament and do the Government believe in the contributory principle? If the Government do not believe in it, if the social security system is simply to become a means with which to scrape the most disadvantaged up from the bottom of the pile, and if that is all that the national insurance system and the Department of Social Security are about, let us hear the Government say so. If that is the case, the whole idea of the Beveridge principle to return to the wartime consensus about our benefit system has gone.
<P>
The second issue is the messages that we are sending to those on modest incomes. A number of my hon. Friends have commented on what is happening to the savings ratio in this country. My main concern is not with the overall level of the ratio. It is a straightforward macro-economic point that the largest factor influencing a savings ratio is those who, when choosing whether to save or not, are above the areas affected by incentives. My concern is more narrowly focused on the message on savings that we are sending to those with modest means, who can choose whether to provide for themselves, or to rely on the state to do so.
<P>
A strong  and increasingly sharp debate on that subject took place in the Conservative party during the last few years before the election. Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 go to the heart of that matter. Are we telling people, "You should provide for your widow, in case you die early"? Or are we saying, "Don"t save small amounts, don"t provide for a modest amount of support, because the state will be relatively generous towards your widow if you don"t bother. However, if you do bother, after six months she will be on her own."
<P>
I share the concerns of my hon. Friends about the emotional impact involved, but I ask Ministers to think seriously also about the economic and fiscal effects. The proposals are wrong and unwise. I have mentioned this in an earlier debate, and I shall not dwell on it now, Mr. McWilliam, because you would rightly call me to order, but the pensioner population sent a huge message in 1988 when the Conservative Government introduced capital tests, with extra benefits for those who did not save and a loss of benefits for those who did. Almost 500,000 pensioners dumped their savings in the subsequent two or three years. We were criticised then both by our own Back Benchers and by the then Opposition, now Her Majesty"s Government. What message do the Government want to send?
<P>
Before I deal with the transitional arrangements, I want to underline both points by suggesting to Ministers that one argument should not be deployed. In asking the Committee to vote down amendments Nos. 105 and 106, I hope that Ministers will not allude to the measures that were introduced by the Conservative Government in 1988, which were shown to fail and were deeply unpopular. What Labour said in its manifesto about a hand up and not a handout, combined with what its spokesmen said before the election, made it clear that they want to get back to universal principles to encourage self-provision. The Government were elected on a mandate this was not a specific pledge, but a general idea to reverse the approach to self-provision. Our Front Bench spokesman made it clear that we should get away from means-testing, in particular capital-testing and tests that bear so heavily on income that they discourage self-provision. Referring to the sterile arguments of the past is no defence. If Ministers urge the Committee to oppose amendments Nos. 105 and 106, they must say why the contributory principle is dead for bereavement payments and why it does not matter that they give such economic messages to those on modest incomes who are considering self-provision.
<P>
As for the other amendments, it is sad that I have to talk about transitional arrangements. I should love to think that the Minister would accept amendments Nos. 105 and 106, but it is right that we have tabled these amendments as second best. All hon. Members stressed the fact that, if there is to be a transitional arrangement, six months is too short. I do not want to repeat their arguments except to say that I have not experienced a close relation being bereaved. I was a small child when two grandparents were bereaved, so I am not as in touch with the problem as some or my hon. Friends. However, there is something deeply insulting about six months, which is the time that someone who has lost a job is allowed before going on to the jobseeker"s allowance.
<P>
A widow has to suffer a treble impact: the loss of her husband and all that that involves; the need to get out and look for work; and the need to cope with the huge disadvantage of never having done a full-time job or not having done it for a long time. Those are three disadvantages: the emotional disadvantage, the disadvantage of having to go into the workplace for the first time, and the disadvantage of the ordinary business of having to look for a job. Do Ministers believe that facing all that can be compared with someone who has lost their job, for whom six months is not an unreasonable period? If Ministers urge the Committee to vote down amendments Nos. 105 and 106 they have an overwhelming majority the very least that they owe the Committee and the public is an explanation of how they arrived at the period of six months.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): During our debate, reference has been made to amendments to previous clauses on which I need to put the record straight. I stand by and always will my comments during a previous debate on women"s strengths and talents being under-utilised, the opportunities which they now have in the workplace which they did not have, and the fact that many women are now self-supporting. It may interest the Committee to know that members of my family have many, varied jobs and that most of the women work and have always worked. It is not odd that, in bereavement, women should continue to work when they have done so before and that they should have the opportunity to continue thereafter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> No, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me I shall press on.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar suggested that during a previous debate I linked the ages of 60 to 64 with women"s ability to go out to work. He will recall that that wide-ranging debate covered almost all aspects of the provisions and not merely the amendment that was being discussed. My comments were made about the generality, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Then does the hon. Lady accept that her comments are appropriate to someone aged between 60 and 64?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I have argued that there are many opportunities for women aged between 60 and 64. Many women over the age of 70 have a lot to offer and may want to make a contribution to society. Linking age to a particular circumstance is wrong. Young people often do not have the same talents as old people. That sort of ageism takes us nowhere. We were debating a different issue, but I made my comments as part of the wide-ranging debate on women"s ability to support themselves in bereavement as well as men.
<P>
I accept some of the arguments of Opposition Members that the state of shock suffered by bereaved people sometimes goes on and on. I have not lost a husband through death, but my first grandchild died very young and my daughter had a terrible time, although she returned to work soon afterwards. It was her choice to do so because work helped her to get over that terrible bereavement and loss. People make different choices.
<P>
We must consider the amendments before us. Conservative Members have produced no evidence to suggest that some other period is more appropriate that six months. No evidence has been produced to suggest that two years or six years might be better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> In the closing comments of my speech, I explained why six months is not long enough and why, from the menu of longer options, the Minister should at least justify the fact that the Government have focused on the length of time that applies to someone who has simply lost a job.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> My point is that hon. Members have not justified the argument that the period is not long enough. As they tabled the amendments 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> No. Conservative Members should justify what they are saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> On that point, will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> No. Conservative Members are forgetting the totality of the proposals, which focus on families and the way in which they support themselves. I cannot find any justification for treating women differently from men. The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) said that some women might be particularly badly affected and I said to myself, "If he mentions Victoria, I shall go mad." I shall have to be committed to an asylum.
<P>
I do not recognise Conservative Members" view of women. I know lots of women from lowly backgrounds who would be insulted by the suggestion that they would be less able than their partners to cope after the death of a loved one. I have found the contrary to be true. Women are often much stronger and more able to cope than men. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that.
<P>
It may be true that women who have never previously had an opportunity to work need special help. I spoke to some women this morning who had found new partners and a happy life after bereavement. They said that they were able to pick themselves up after a tremendous loss and carry on. Opposition Members have not recognised the fact that women do not crumble to the ground in a heap, incapable of continuing. I cannot accept and do not recognise that view of women. Legislation has to involve fairness between the sexes, and the Government"s proposal does so. It allows a time for bereavement and, crucially, it allows a longer time for parents who have children to support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Lady. I learned with amazement that she is a grandmother, although I still feel some incredulity about that. All Committee members will sympathise with her over the sad incident that she recounted. We also pay tribute to the father of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough he was a distinguished man in public life, whom I met on several occasions.
<P>
The hon. Lady is wholly admirable. She is against sexism Opposition Members share that point of view and she appears to be against ageism. Will she try to persuade the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities to implement her party"s pre-electoral promises on age discrimination, for which I believe he has responsibility? She may recall that I took up that matter when I was on the Back Benches in the previous Parliament. I am sure that her comments on ageism and sexism were sincere. The Labour party made extravagant promises about ageism when it was in opposition, but after the general election, we have seen no action in the form of legislation, although it gave promises to that effect.
<P>
The hon. Lady is admirable for another reason: she is willing and able to make a speech in the Committee. In that respect, she distinguishes herself markedly from her colleagues, who have not covered themselves with honour or glory during our consideration of the Bill. I have some sympathy with them: they may have been included on the Committee only because they were considered to be relatively docile 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As Chairman of the Committee of Selection, I find that remark rather odd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As Chairman of the Committee of Selection. Mr. McWilliam, you understand better than I do how the system works. I am surprised that you find my remarks odd, and I have no intention of withdrawing them.
<P>
On the whole, Labour Members share the Opposition"s human response to people who are disadvantaged by bereavement, disability or some other misfortune in life. It must be painful for Labour Members to have to sit in the Committee and listen to the Minister and the Under-Secretary defend policies that do not stand up to scrutiny and which are, in many cases, extremely repulsive. However, must Labour Members respond by maintaining total, embarrassed silence. I do not know what account they will give of themselves when they see their constituents during the Easter break. They will be asked, "What have you been doing during the past three months?" and they will reply, "I have spent hours and hours in the Committee considering the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill." Their constituents will say, "Oh, really? What sort of contribution did you make to the discussions? What amendments did you propose? What did you say? What influence have you had on the Bill?" They will answer, "Absolutely none. I just sat there week after week completely silent and stupefied." We should be delighted if that was their reply to their constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Whatever mistakes we made 10 years ago, our manifesto stated that we would focus benefits on the less well-off. Was the proposal to cut widows benefits included in Labour Members" election addresses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Indeed. All the really unpleasant aspects of the Bill perhaps not surprisingly are aspects that no one could possibly have anticipated would be introduced by the Government, either from listening to the Labour party"s rhetoric while in opposition or from reading the Labour party manifesto.
<P>
There are three illusions relating to the suspension of widows benefit after six months in cases where there are no children below the age of 16 or 19 in full-time education. I want to deal with those three illusions in turn because they must be exposed in our debate, whether or not we can do anything about the text of the Bill.
<P>
The first illusion that must be exposed and dispelled is that the only or main reason for taking such harsh measures against widows is because they are a necessary counterpart of extending equivalent benefits to widowers. They are the price for removing an element of sex discrimination in the benefit system. That is wrong, and it can be proved to be wrong by looking at the arithmetic, which I set it out in greater detail during our previous sitting. It shows that, net of the cost of increasing bereavement allowance to £2,000 and extending benefits to widowers, for six months the Treasury is recouping from the bereaved a total net sum of £475 million in a full year. That is a gain for the Treasury of virtually half a billion pounds as a result of this measure. It is not true that women are being told, "I am sorry but you cannot have such generous benefits because you must now share them with men" a sort of reversal of what was, unfortunately, often the practice in the past when women were not given a fair deal.
<P>
There has been a tendency to portray these measures in that light, and it is fundamentally bogus to suggest that that is what is happening. Perhaps the Treasury took the opportunity to do something about the discriminatory aspect of the legislation in order to make the proposals that it favoured, but what has happened is that the proposals that the Treasury wanted have been introduced and meekly adopted by Ministers at the Department of Social Security, who sit here and defend the steady erosion of the national insurance system for which they are statutorily responsible. The Treasury has said, "We want to get half a billion pounds out of widows, and we will get half a billion pounds out of widows." The rest is cosmetics. No one should be so foolish as to suppose that a system under which £50 billion is given on the one hand and £530 billion is taken away on the other is anything other than a net loss of benefit to the sum of £475 million or £480 million.
<P>
The second illusion that I want to dispel is the notion that the main losers will be women "without dependent children", to use the bureaucratic phrase. The implication is that the losers will mostly be widows who have no children at all. The implied argument is, why should someone who gets married and does not have children receive a benefit, paid for from the national insurance system, simply because her husband dies? Why can she not look after herself, at least after six months?
<P>
In reality, the great losers will be women with children, who, if their children are young when they are first bereaved, will continue to receive the widows benefit, but will then find that, when their children reach the age of 16, they will be forced back to work. That will be very difficult for a woman in her 40s or 50s, who had devoted her life to bringing up her family. Suddenly, the family are grown up, the last child reaches the magic age of 16, and the Labour Government say, "Right, you go back to work. You are now on non-contributory jobseeker"s allowance. If you do not take a job, we will cut your benefit. We will send you on a course, and if you do not do that, we will cut your benefit. You are now under the disciplines of the jobseeker"s allowance system." That is harsh for someone in those circumstances, who has spent her whole life looking after children, and who feels that her most active, energetic years are past.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley that many people retain their dynamism, energies and enthusiasm, get involved in life, and remain active in their 60s, 70s or even 80s. The Father of the House, for example, does not seem to have lost his enthusiasm for or interest in politics; that is splendid. Would that everyone were like that. This is not a sexist point. However, some people, having spent 20 years bringing up a young family, feel exhausted and at a great psychological and intellectual disadvantage in the labour market. It is those people who will suffer under this measure.
<P>
It is wrong for the Government to try to disguise that reality, and Labour Members should face up to the need to speak to such people. I hope that they will have the courage, when they knock on doors and visit people with such cases in their constituencies, or when those people come to their surgeries, to look them in the eye and say, "Yes, I sat on that Committee, and I voted for those changes. I deliberately decided that you, Madam, would have to go back to work now that your youngest child is 16. You will now have to line up in the labour market with everyone else, including people who are much younger and more able-bodied and who have not spent 20 years of their lives dedicated to the task of keeping a home going."

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that there is another category of bereaved person who currently benefits from the widow"s pension? That is someone either with or without children who goes out to work, but cannot get a highly paid job. This allowance operates as a lifeline to her, to ensure that she has a decent standard of living.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. As he said in his excellent speech earlier, one of the great virtues of the widow"s benefit system is that if a widow goes back to work once her children are off her hands, she can take a modestly paid or part-time job and fully enjoy the incremental earnings that the job brings, because the widow"s benefit is not at present means-tested, and is therefore added to her earnings. She feels more comfortable as a result and does not face the disincentives of the benefit trap, with which we are all familiar, and which is being extended every month by the new Labour Government as they extend means-testing. One of the most economically damaging, and humanly unfair and unattractive aspects of what the Government are doing is the endless extension of means-testing. As my hon. Friend says, one of the great virtues of widow"s benefit is that widows are not currently subject to the benefit trap.
<P>
However, people in the position that I have described, who have no training or background in the labour market and are therefore unlikely to command a considerable level of earnings, and who will probably have difficulty getting into, or back into, the labour market in their 40s and 50s, will find that they are classic victims of the benefit trap. What they might receive in means-tested benefits will not differ greatly from what they might receive initially on their return to the labour market. Widows will feel triply aggrieved because of being forced by the state to return to work in difficult circumstances, with no recognition whatever as a result of the removal of widows benefit of their many years of hard work in bringing up their family. Their remuneration will amount to a tiny pittance above what they would receive if they were on income support. That is undesirable. It leads people to try to avoid the obligations of the jobseeker"s allowance and to stay on income support.
<P>
I made it clear in our previous sitting that I am in favour of disciplines for those who earn jobseeker"s allowance. A lady in her 50s who was not bereaved but divorced visited me at my surgery with her two daughters on Saturday to say that it was unfair that she was being forced to look for a job because she was on jobseeker"s allowance. Stamford job centre was threatening to take part of her benefit away because she had been accused of not doing enough to try to get the jobs for which she had been interviewed and because she had refused to go on a course. I may have lost three votes which I do not regret, as I believe that I said the right thing because I said that she should make an effort to try to find a job and should recognise that it was not sensible for society to keep her if she did not have family obligations and was not disabled.
<P>
I took a tough line, as I am prepared to do when necessary. The lady in question was not a widow she did not have a husband who had contributed to the national insurance system in the confidence that, if something happened to him, all her work as a wife and mother would be recognised. She did not have the justified sense, which many widows will have if the Bill is passed, that she has been cheated by the state.
<P>
The final illusion that must be dispelled is that the provision is anything other than a further breach in the structure of national insurance. Clearly, the Government feel guilty, because Ministers respond in two ways to such strictures, often in the same wildly and blatantly incoherent speech. The Minister may plan to do that at the end of this debate, or perhaps I have warned him away from such a course.
<P>
On the one hand, Ministers say that there is no reduction in the national insurance system, to which they are totally devoted, and that it is wicked Tory propaganda that the Beveridge contributory system is being destroyed. Such a charge is not propaganda but blatant truth. On the other hand, they say that Conservative Governments changed national insurance benefits retrospectively and without warning.
<P>
Those two arguments are inconsistent the Government cannot have it both ways. They could say, "We criticised the Tories for doing something, but now we are in power we want to do even more of it. Thank you for electing us, but we will give you a worse deal not a better one". That, at least, would be honest and coherent. They cannot continue saying that they are not damaging the national insurance system and that they are absolutely committed to it, while also saying that they are merely doing what a previous Conservative Administration did. I did not approve of many such changes may by previous Conservative Administrations. In retrospect, they were mistakes. However, in many cases, considerable notice was given. I do not pretend that the story of widows" entitlement to SERPS, which we shall discuss in due course, is a good one. Both Conservative and Labour Administrations owe the public an apology for what happened in that regard. Nevertheless, changes that were made 13 years ago in 1986, will come into force next year, which will give a period of notice of 14 years. I do not seek to justify what was done, or our reprehensible failure to explain our actions to the public. However, the Labour Government"s decision to continue on the same course for most of their first two years in power is even more reprehensible.
<P>
Husbands have had 14 years in which to adjust the provisions that they make for themselves and their widows. As has been noted, the Government are being considerably less generous in providing people with less than two years in which to adapt. Widows will no longer be cared for in the way that their husbands expected. That is worrying. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar argued so ably, the solution to that may be simple for husbands on high incomes. They may say, "Given that I cannot continue to rely on the national insurance policy, on which the Government have defaulted, I will put aside more money for my widow.  Because the national insurance policy no longer exists, I shall have to take out some form of private insurance policy."
<P>
However, the rational calculation of those on average incomes of £18,000 to £20,000 a year on whom we focused when considering stakeholder pensions and, a fortiori, of those on lower incomes, will be precisely the opposite to that made by those on high incomes. They will say, "For God"s sake, the last thing that I want to do is save money and leave my widow with a small amount of savings or a private insurance policy on my life. That would deprive her of thousands of pounds a year in means-tested benefits, income support, housing benefit, council tax relief and so on."
<P>
The sending of that signal to people on average and below average incomes opens up a dismal prospect. As I said, such people consitutue more than 50 per cent. of the population. The average income of £18,000 a year is a mathematical mean between those who earn the statutory minimum wage of £5,000 or £6,000 a year and movie stars, football stars, lawyers and people who earn multiples of £1 million a year. Therefore, the weight in terms of numbers is towards the bottom of the income scale. The introduction of those perverse incentives and, above all, the sense of unfairness that they will create, will destroy the incentive to save and impact on the happiness and well-being of the majority.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, the aspect of the provision on which the Labour party most congratulates itself in private, and about which Alastair Campbell sings in his bath, is the identifying of a group of people who will deliver £500,000 a year to the Treasury without protest, because they do not know who they are. They will not vote against the Labour party or tell the opinion pollsters that they have turned against the Labour Government because they do not know that they will be clobbered.
<P>
That approach is ruthless but clever. It is similar to the calculation that the Government made when they decided to abolish the dividend tax credit, which will take £5 billion from people"s pensions. If the Government had increased indirect or direct taxation or let inflation rip, they would have reduced current disposable income, which would have had an immediate political cost. However, the Government said, "We shall do something very clever. We shall raise money by reducing people"s future disposable income. They will not feel an immediate loss of purchasing power and they will be too stupid to realise what we have done."
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Labour party is treating the public as if they were educationally subnormal, but it will pay a price. Abraham Lincoln"s principle will always be valid in a democracy, although it is unclear how long it will take for that principle to take effect.
<P>
In this context, the Government said, "Lets take £500 million from the income of future widows. By definition, no one knows who those future widows will be, so there will be no protests." Widows who are bereaved will be bereaved singly. Although there may be several hundred or perhaps 1,000 bereavements a week throughout the country, widows will not be in touch with each other they will concentrate on their personal grief and their family"s problems. The Government may get away with their policy, which is clever, ruthless, heartless and unpleasant. The public need to know what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The last thing that a bereaved person wants to do is to join an organisation or to start a campaign. They want to concentrate on their loss and on pulling their life back together. That is why those victims are a soft touch to Mr. Alastair Campbell and spin doctors.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Mr. Alastair Campbell is employed by the Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, who must take moral responsibility for the policy. Mr. Blair has employed an entirely ruthless character to try to deceive the British public about the Government"s policies Mr. Campbell is an expert at spin doctoring and a master in the arts of delusion and black propaganda.
<P>
The Government know very well what they are trying to hide. The decision to attempt systematically to disguise what they are doing was taken by the Government, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I have no doubt about the fact that they deliberately set about trying to abstract money from the public with the minimum political loss, although no previous Government have made such a ruthless calculus.
<P>
Opinion polls make it clear that, in the short term, the Government have got away with their approach. They are laughing behind closed doors and they think that they have been extremely clever. However, they have not been clever and, in the medium term, their behaviour will have some nasty political consequences. I hope that there will be a revulsion against such spin doctoring and media manipulation if there is not, one will be forced to conclusions of ultimate political cynicism. For example, one might conclude that it does not matter what one does, or how much one does people down so long as one hires a spin doctor who is clever enough to delude people into thinking that black is white, white is black, and reality does not matter. If that happens, there will be no point in having a parliament system or discussions such as ours. It is important that the Government"s ruthless, if brilliant, strategy for deceiving the public does not succeed.
<P>
Given the docility I repeat that word because it is appropriate of Labour Committee Members, Opposition Members have no illusions about the fact that we shall not win many of the votes, although it is clear that we are winning the arguments. We certainly won them on the earlier parts of the Bill. The argument now is that the Government are significantly winding down the national insurance system. Can the Minister refute that? He may say, "That is the sort of thing the Conservatives did. They did not attack widows, but they did other things." If he says that, he will give me the point.
<P>
The arithmetic makes it clear that the Government are taking money from widows. The net take is nearly £500 million. I hope that I have ridden the Minister off that line if he was tempted to take it. He cannot get away with saying that the money is being redistributed to widowers. The Secretary of State"s announcement in the House was written by some spin doctor perhaps his own spin doctor or even Mr. Campbell and that is how the proposal was presented. The essential arithmetic was disguised from the public and it was left to the Conservative party to analyse the statement, read the small print and point out the reality of the proposal. The Government do not believe in telling the public the truth about what is going on. The truth is grim and bleak and we shall vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham) rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), hon. Members must refer to other Members of the House, whether they are members of the Committee or not, by their constituencies. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford should have referred to the right hon. Member for Sedgefield or the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I support everything that has been said by Opposition Members about the revulsion we all feel at the change in principle and the way in which widows are being treated in the Bill. We all believe strongly in the insurance principle and we deplore and deprecate the fact that that is being capped in the Bill. Historically, I have always supported the extension of benefit to widowers, but the £25 million cost, which my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford set out, could be contained within the social security budget because the cost has fallen so dramatically in the past 30-odd years.
<P>
The hon. Member for Colne Valley accused us of not giving the reasons for our amendments. I am happy to do so, but she must realise that we tabled them because it was impossible to say that we wanted the status quo in the Bill. We tabled the amendments to ameliorate the effect of the Government"s proposals, not because we support their proposals.
<P>
A number of hon. Members have suffered bereavements and I sympathise with the hon. Member for Colne Valley and the bereavement that her daughter suffered, but it struck me during our debate that we seem to be living in two different lands. The hon. Lady said that everyone she knows works and always has worked. I could probably say that about the women in my family. Opposition Members implied that no women work and that they will be all poor, grief-stricken widows. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. Most of the women in my family work, but I also have more distant relatives who do not work and who would fall into the category described by my hon. Friends.
<P>
I support the amendment because it would taper the pension up to two years to deal with the wide variety of reactions to bereavement. Those of us who have met widows or widowers in our surgeries will know that every individual reacts differently. To put everyone into a six-month straightjacket is cruel and heartless and the Government deserve all the condemnation that we can pour on their head.
<P>
My mother, who was widowed 40 years ago, went back to work the day after the funeral, but she is now suffering from survivor"s syndrome and all the problems associated with that. The Government will have to pay, through the cost to the health service, when others suffer from ill health and other problems resulting from survivor"s syndrome. Many of us have had people in our surgeries suffering from survivor"s syndrome because of what they suppressed at the end of the second world war. Grief and bereavement have the same effect.
<P>
Some people will go back to work within six months and believe that they are on top of the job. However, general practitioners say that those who are bereaved will present with a health problem within the following two years, because of the strong correlation between ill health and grieving. Others may need two years to come to terms with their loss.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to Queen Victoria. I would like to think that, had Queen Victoria lived today, when we are more psychologically aware, she would not have had to grieve for so long. In a sense, her grief was pathological and a psychological problem emerged in it. I hope that enough supportive services and knowledge exist today to deal with such a situation more sensitively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I had some criticism from the hon. Member for Colne Valley. I chose Queen Victoria because she is an extreme example and also because I have no emotional attachment to her. I have considerable emotional attachment to a number of people who have suffered grief in that way and I would have great difficulty speaking about them in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend makes a sensible and sensitive point, of which Opposition Members are aware. I did not mention Queen Victoria in a sense of criticism. I was simply trying to point out that in modern times grief can perhaps be dealt with more sensitively than it could in Victorian times.
<P>
If we recognise that people grieve in different ways, we must allow them to choose how they come to terms with their grief. That is why the amendment states two years. We could have made it three or four years or preferred to go back to the status quo.
<P>
Another practical problem is that women over the age of 45 may wish to get out of the house. Much as women like working full-time, and perhaps all our relatives work full-time, the bulk of women"s work is still part-time. Bereaved women who have not worked for some time are most likely to go into part-time work initially, or they may choose to go back to some form of education or training to ready themselves for a full-time job. However, it is not clear what access they would have to the grants to enable them to do a degree. How could those people be given easy access to the sort of education that many would feel they needed to re-enter the work force:
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some women might want not to work, but to help in a charitable or voluntary organisation. Many widows" organisations I am thinking of Bereavement Care in particular were set up by women who used that work to help them grieve and to right what they saw as an injustice when they were bereaved. Our voluntary and charitable organisations would be devastated if those women were no longer able to volunteer for work in them, to help themselves and the people around them. By a cruel and heartless benefits change, the Government are taking a direct knock at the charitable and voluntary sector on which, let us face it, so much of British society relies.
<P>
What concerns me most about the six months is the inflexibility and the putting of women, in particular, into a straitjacket of grief, when there are so many different ways in which people come to terms with a tragic loss. I ask the Government to consider some flexibility in this matter. Without that, I fear, like my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stanford (Mr. Davies) and my other hon. Friends, that we shall have a tragedy to deal with, which will rebound badly I should worry on the Government. They will regret the day they tried to fit everyone into a straitjacket that corresponds with the way they, in their innocence, think they would react to bereavement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford gave us his usual amusing speech about Alastair Campbell, who is clearly much in his thoughts whenever the Committee meets. However, apart from that we have had an interesting debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I am glad that my hon. Friend has begun his remarks in a way that enables us to dispense straight away with the issue I want to raise. Will he give us his observations on whether Conservative Members" speeches have improved or deteriorated since Amanda Platell has been writing them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, but the person to whom he refers has clearly not made the same impact on the public consciousness that Alastair Campbell has.
<P>
The debate on the amendments has been interesting and, at times, moving. I am glad of that. The amendments would all extend the period for which bereavement allowance would be paid. I am pleased that they have been grouped together. The credibility of some of the amendments was undermined by the fact that, until the hon. Member for Beckenham made her remarks, no one had argued for any one of the periods of time specified in them. She settled for one at least I thought that she had, but on reading the amendments again I found that there is no amendment that mentions the two-year period to which she referred. The one that came closest was the Liberal Democrat amendment, which suggests three years. The Conservative amendment No. 103 refers to six years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The point that I was making was that everyone grieves differently and that, therefore, we need flexibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, the hon. Lady made some interesting points, including those about flexibility. She certainly went further than some of her hon. Friends in recognising the changes that have taken place. She is right to do so, but I do not share the conclusion that she has drawn.
<P>
I listened carefully to all the arguments proposed by hon. Members, and no one has suggested how the changes for which they have argued should be paid for. The cost of the changes, as the hon. Member for Newbury said, ranges from £50 million a year to £700 million a year. Opposition Members have every right to propose extra spending in that way. They do, however, owe us an explanation as to how they propose to pay for the effects of the amendments. What other spending would they cut, or which taxes would they raise, to pay for the changes? Of course, it may be that the amendments are not intended to be taken seriously, in which case it does not matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Obviously, it is not the job of the Opposition to set out individual spending plans. However, the cost of the minimum income guarantee for pensioners will be substantial. That provision is targeted at those who have not provided for themselves, and will have paradoxical effects similar to measures in other Bills, as we have already pointed out. That might be something that the Minister will consider. There is also a limit to the extent to which either the Minister or Opposition Members can pursue this course if they wish to stay in order with the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Opposition Members have a responsibility to explain to the Committee how they would pay for their proposals. The hon. Gentleman proposes the abolition of the minimum income guarantee, thereby reducing the income of hundreds of thousands of pensioners who are not well off at the moment. That is an interesting suggestion. If Opposition Members intend us to take the amendments seriously, they must tell us how they intend to pay for them. If that is not their intention, it does not matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am sure that the Minister is not deliberately being disingenuous, but he must realise that, contrary to the impression that he is giving, the Government"s proposals are not revenue neutral. They raise almost £1 billion a year, as I said earlier. It is not for the Opposition, in resisting the Government"s measures, to cost their own, alternative proposals. We are simply arguing that the Treasury ought not to be raising an additional £500 million in this way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My understanding is that Opposition Members support the extension of bereavement benefits to men. They are therefore not arguing for savings, but for substantial additional costs. If they wish such a proposal to be taken seriously, they should tell us how they intend to pay for it, which they have not done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister says that there will be substantial increased costs in extending the widow"s benefit to widowers. However, the answers that he has given in parliamentary questions make it clear that the cost of the extension is about £200 million, and the total cost of the saving is about £700 million, leading to a net saving of £500 million. The cost is therefore insignificant in comparison to the overall savings that he is trying to make, which are far bigger.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is not the case. The extension of the existing system to men would lead to substantial net costs. From memory, I think that it would be about £250 million a year.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury keeps referring to the figure of £500 million. There will indeed be a saving of about £500 million a year in due course, but in the first year in the early years there will be substantial additional costs of about £100 million a year. The view that he has put to the Committee that there is a pot of £500 million a year sitting around somewhere not doing anything, which could be drawn on to pay for all the amendments that he proposes is simply not true. That pot is not there.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury must take responsibility for what he advocates. The amendments that he has already tabled to this part of the Bill would cost £200 million a year. Today, he tabled further amendments costing up to £700 million a year. He gave no clue as to how he would pay for them. If his intention is merely to make bullet points and headlines, it is not necessary for him to explain how to pay for his proposals. If they are for the Committee"s serious consideration, however, he should provide some explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> For the moment, I shall accept the Minister"s argument that an alternative must be proposed. Given that widowers are more likely to be self-reliant and in good paid work notwithstanding the need to meet our responsibilities to the European Court is there not a way of phasing in the increased benefits for widowers while preserving pensions for widows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That proposal is not on the amendment paper. If it had been, there might have been a basis for debate.
<P>
I reject the picture drawn by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford last Thursday he has been more concerned with Alastair Campbell this week of a pathetic little woman in a council house whose children have grown up and who spends her time polishing the brass ornaments. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley dealt with that argument effectively. It is wrong to suggest that people in that position in their early 50s or late 40s should merely receive a small pension and stay at home polishing the ornaments. The principle underlying our reforms is work for those who are able to work and security for those who are not. That principle is right and changes in this part of the Bill are consistent with it.
<P>
Through the single gateway and the new deal for the over-50s, which the Chancellor announced a couple of weeks ago, we are making changes to allow people who were written off by the previous Government to engage in work again. That fundamental change is unquestionably in the best interests of such people. We must move on from the patronising images of women polishing the ornaments and we will provide help to make that possible. That is the context within which changes are taking place.
<P>
The current arrangements do not help the least well off widows 35,000 widows receive no widow"s benefit because they immediately lose income support. In contrast, widows earning a substantial wage receive all the benefit for years when they do not need it. That system cries out for reform along the lines proposed by the Bill
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not so much abusing the national insurance principle as failing to understand it. The reason why those widows receive that money is that they are entitled to it because their husbands, before they died, contributed to the national insurance system and to the provision of that benefit. That is no more shocking or surprising than someone who has bought fire insurance and whose house burns down making a claim on the company concerned. The Minister of State has made it plain that he has no commitment whatever to the national insurance principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall come to the national insurance principle in a moment and I shall respond directly to the hon. Gentleman"s inaccurate point. Conservative Members demand that bereaved men should receive an allowance for longer than six months whether three, five or six years but Conservative Governments provided men with no allowance at all for 18 years.
<P>
Amendment No. 219 extends the period for which bereavement allowance is payable to a year, where a widow spouse has cared for his or her spouse before the death. Opposition Members said little about that, but the benefits system already recognises the difficulties, on bereavement, of those who have cared full-time for their spouse. Special provisions in income support allow the bereaved carer to retain the carer premium for eight weeks and to continue to claim income support during that period without having to meet jobseeking requirements. Our proposals go beyond that with a non-means-tested benefit for 26 weeks.
<P>
The consultation document recognises that widows and widowers who have been out of work for a long time will find the prospect of work difficult. We are especially concerned about a smaller number of older widows who have never worked, or not worked for a long time, for whom the expectation of supporting themselves may be unrealistic. Those aged 55 or over at the start of the new arrangements, who are widowed in the first five years after the changes are implemented, will be able to claim income-related help without signing on for work.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) asked me to explain the transitional arrangements. He is not in his place, so I shall not dwell on that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is attending a memorial services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I meant no criticism of the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
A special premium in income-related benefits will help to ensure that the income of those who receive them stays at the level of the six-month bereavement allowance until they reach pension age. It would be wrong to continue to write off younger widows and widowers, many of whom will have had regular employment. The help that our reforms will provide needs to be made available sooner rather than later. A longer delay, which would be the effect of the amendments, would increase the danger of getting stuck on benefits, which is in no one"s interest. Our reforms will help men and women to retain financial independence during working age and in retirement. We want to remove the barriers to work to ensure that work pays. That is the principle at the heart of our reforms.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am most fascinated. I thought that the Minister understood that what is paid is a widows pension, not a widows benefit, which is what the Government are changing it into.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is a benefit. The hon. Lady"s distinction is not clear [Hon. Members: What?] What I am saying is that the amendments would delay the point at which those who are receiving the allowance need to think about looking for work and obtaining help through the single gateway proposals, which are contained in subsequent clauses. That delay is not in their interests. The help needs to be provided sooner, not later. Our proposal makes that possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister acknowledged that this is a serious debate. Before he sits down, will he undertake to reconsider the matter, given that there is a net saving to the Department, and find out whether it is possible to Report to extend the period beyond six months in certain circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I was not about to sit down, but the hon. Gentleman made a serious point. Opposition Members have said nothing to persuade me that the issue needs further examination. The proposals in the consultation document and the Bill are the way forward. They strike the right balance between ensuring that help is available for people when they need it and that no payment is made to people who do not need it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will, then I must continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister talked about whether and when help would be available. The hon. Member for Beckenham made the point, with which I agree as, I am sure, does the Minister that it takes people varying amounts of time to get ready to go back to work after bereavement. The Minister believes that it would be better to force everyone to go through the single gateway after just six months because that would give them the help that they  need. Would it not be far better for the Government to offer that help from bereavement onwards, so that people could take it up when they needed it, but also to give people the opportunity to wait more than six months in those cases where they need the benefit to recover from bereavement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is right to provide help earlier rather than later, and not to give people the impression that it does not matter if one does not do anything for a couple of years. People need seriously to think through, earlier than that, what is the best way forward for them.
<P>
That the needs of children should be given priority is a theme running through the Government"s work. In cases where there are children under 16 to be cared for this was not made clear by Opposition Members the benefit will be paid exactly as it is now, except that it will be available, for the first time to men as well as to women. Accepting the amendments would undermine the principles on which the reforms are based and add significantly to the costs.
<P>
I should like to respond to several points raised by Opposition Members, but I shall be brief. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar made an interesting speech at the beginning of the debate, but he seemed to misunderstand the purpose of bereavement benefits. That leads me to the point made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about the national insurance principle. The purpose of bereavement benefit is as an insurance benefit for loss of income for people of working age. It is not, and never could be, compensation for grief. Many people, other than those who are married to someone who dies, suffer grief. Many hon. Members have spoken, some from their own experience, about the scale of grief, but the benefit does not relate to that. We must be clear in our discussion about the purpose of this insurance benefit.
<P>
It is right for the benefit system to reflect changes that have occurred in our society. As we have said, 50 years ago, one in eight married women worked. Today, seven out of 10 work, which proportion is six times greater. That change has consequences for the benefit system. Almost half 47 per cent. of all widows today have occupational pension income. That would have been extremely unusual 50 years ago, and that change has consequences for the benefit system.
<P>
According to the latest labour force survey, of the minority of women in the 35 to 54 age group who are not working, only 16 per cent. had left work more than five years ago or not worked at all. That is a small minority in that group. However, that is not the picture portrayed in the speeches of Opposition Members. In the benefit system, we must reflect the situation that exists today. The benefit system must reflect those changes because, if it does not, the system will be weakened and those people widows, widowers and others who really depend on the system to provide security for them, will be the losers. We will not allow that to happen, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was very disappointed by that response from the Minister. I was especially disappointed because the Government do not seem to understand the difference between the principle of national insurance and a benefit. I do not know whether the Minister was deliberately trying to confuse the Committee or whether he genuinely does not understand the difference, which is straightforward. People pay into a scheme in the expectation that, should they need it, they will receive help. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford clearly said, it is like fire insurance: should a fire occur, the insured will receive some money to help. That is exactly what the widows pension was. Millions of people have made payments on the assumption that, if something happens to them, their bereaved will be taken care of. It is not compensation for grief; it is to give them some time and the opportunity to make the right decisions.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that this has been an interesting debate. Due to our backgrounds and age, nearly all members of the Committee have some experience of bereavement, even it it is one step removed. That is why it is easier to speak about historical figures than to speak about individuals. As we have been discussing the proposals, I have been thinking about the individuals I know my friends and relatives who, had they been widowed, would be in a perilous state under these proposals.
<P>
I respect the moving comments made by the hon. Member for Colne Valley about her grandchild. However, although it may be right for some to return immediately to work for others it is not. The current system enables choice and gives people space to make the right decisions. The amendments would not write off anyone or require them to stay at home and polish the brass. We are not arguing that people in their 40s and 50s who have not worked before are incapable of doing great things. On the contrary, the amendments would offer people a lifeline by giving them the chance to get their lives together before moving on. Many people will have to come to terms with an enormous cut in their income, while still having to pay for their car, mortgage and all manner of things. The amendments would give them a slight edge in that respect.
<P>
The Minister was right to say that great changes have taken place. More women now work and that is a good thing. However, during our discussion of income splitting on divorce, he pointed out that many women work on a part-time basis and receive relatively low incomes. Indeed, a substantial number of women have never worked. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham made a good point about education and training. A period of three to six years would enable people to acquire, for example, a vocational qualification. I worry that the bereaved are being used as a battering ram to achieve social change in respect of people"s capabilities and aspirations. Such social change should be embedded before we abolish the widows pension.
<P>
The Minister and the hon. Member for Colne Valley said that the Opposition have failed to support their arguments with evidence. However, careful examination of Hansard will show that Age Concern, the Social Security Advisory Committee, Cruse Bereavement Care, Survivors of Bereavement by Suicide, the National Institution of Widows and the Widows Advisory Trust organisations with a great deal of relevant expertise have all said loud and clear to the Government that six months is simply inadequate.
<P>
The Government asked us, "Where will the money come from?" That was a pale imitation of Conservative Ministers of the mid-1980s. They pretend that the measure will not substantially cut the pension system, but it will save £500 million a year, which is an enormous sum of money. I wondered whether the Minister was saying that he is prepared to consider the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that benefits be phased in. If so, we would be willing to table an amendment to that effect on Report.
<P>
We must understand that it is women on whom such bereavement impacts and it is women who will be the main losers by the provision. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham spoke well about survivor"s syndrome. We must appreciate that the effect of bereavement does not automatically kick in after six months, but occurs at different times. The experience of grief differs enormously from person to person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This has been a revealing debate. The Government have again tried to throw sand in the eyes of the Committee. The Minister is a past master at that, but we will not allow him to get away with it. There is no point in telling us that we must cost our proposals. We are resisting proposals
