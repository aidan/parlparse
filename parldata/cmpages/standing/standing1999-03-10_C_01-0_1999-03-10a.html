<H2><center>Standing Committee C </center></H2>
<H4><center>Wednesday 10 March 1999 </center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Bowen Wells in the Chair] </center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/012/1999012.htm">Protection of Children Bill</a></center></H3>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Debra Shipley </B>(Stourbridge): This is the first time  that I have had the honour of serving in Committee under  your chairmanship, Mr. Wells, and I am grateful for the  opportunity to do so. I am also grateful for the opportunity  to pilot the Protection of Children Bill through the House.  
<P>
This Bill has an important aim: to prevent children  being harmed. That intention was recognised on Second  Reading, when the measure received serious attention  from Members of all parties, who raised valuable points  for the Committee's consideration.  
<P>
I beg to move,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Protection of Children Bill the  Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at  half-past Four o'clock.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge):  I, too, am delighted to have the opportunity to serve under  your chairmanship, Mr. Wells. I hope that I shall be part  of an operation that will ensure that a well-intentioned  Bill is honed into a measure that will receive a Third  Reading on the Floor of the House.  
<P>
As the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley)  mentioned, the Bill gained all-party support on its Second  Reading. However, serious concerns were raised about  certain details, especially in relation to implementing  those principles that enjoyed that broad support. My  approach like that of all hon. Members who spoke was  to address those concerns constructively, in the hope of  improving the Bill in Committee.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge would acknowledge  that the Bill has substantive and technical defects in its  current form. I have not served on a Committee  considering a private Member's Bill before, so I was not  sure whether the Government would table amendments or  steer the hon. Member for Stourbridge towards tabling  amendments that would clean the measure up. I fear that  some important issues have not been addressed by the  amendments that have been tabled.  
<P>
I am a little disappointed that the hon. Member for  Stourbridge has not tabled more amendments. On Second  Reading, she appeared to note hon. Members' concerns  and accept points that were made in a constructive and  generous spirit. I hoped that that regard would turn into  amendments that would make the Bill acceptable to all  reasonable Members of Parliament.  
<P>
The Committee should be grateful to the hon. Member  for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett), who has tabled  many amendments that encapsulate points that he and  other hon. Members made on Second Reading. I hope that  the gratitude that I am expressing is appropriate, as   amendments have been tabled in a constructive spirit and  are not merely tactical, as was the case with a recent  infamous, and ultimately ill-fated, private Member's Bill.     
<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for South  Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) for his thoughtful and  carefully considered amendments. I hope that the  Committee will proceed in the spirit that was apparent on  Second Reading. We agree about the principles of the  Bill, but it should be tightened. We should acknowledge  that, while the measure cannot be a comprehensive  solution to such a large problem, none the less it can  contribute to improving the current position. It would be  folly to try to make the measure a comprehensive  solution. Above all, the Bill must be approached in a spirit  of compromise and with a desire to tackle all the  legitimate objections that were raised on Second Reading.  I hope that we shall make rapid and constructive progress.  
<P>
Question put and agreed to.  
<P>
Resolved,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Protection of Children Bill the  Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at  half-past Four o'clock.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is  a financial resolution connected to the Bill. Copies are  available in the Room. As a general rule, adequate notice  of amendments should be given. I shall not call starred  amendments, including those that may be reached during  an afternoon sitting.  
<H4><center>Clause 1 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Duty of Secretary of State to keep list </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): I beg  to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 13, at end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or should no longer be included in it.'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I refrained from speaking on Second Reading to ensure  that we finished in time and to enable others to express  their views. I am keen for the Bill to be enacted, but I  want to ensure that we protect not only children but the  civil rights of those whose name may be put on the list. I  shall try to be as brief as possible when moving  amendments.  
<P>
I do not like categorising people, but it is possible to  divide those whose name may appear on the list into two  categories. The first group might be described as people  who are predatory or who prey on young people. I do not  believe that the behaviour of most people in that category  will change in their lifetime. Therefore, one could present  a reasonable argument for keeping their name on the list.  However, there is another group of people whose  behaviour on one or more occasions is totally  inappropriate, and possibly criminal, but whose likelihood  of putting children at risk again will disappear as their life  goes on. Therefore, the Secretary of State should have the  power to remove from the list the names of people who  have been wrongly included in it and of those who no  longer pose a danger or threat.  
<P>
Including such a provision in the Bill is simple, but the  process of removing a name from the list may be more  complicated. Nevertheless, we should provide for the   Secretary of State to remove from the list the names of  people who have been included wrongly, perhaps as a  result of a false accusation, and of those who are unlikely  to cause problems in later life.  
<P>
On occasions, people are deprived of opportunities to  work in a specific job because of some misdemeanour that  occurred a long time ago, yet all the evidence shows that  the misdemeanour is not likely to recur. That is sad. I  plead with my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge to  accept the amendment because it would improve the Bill.     
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I paid close attention to my hon. Friend's  carefully reasoned argument, but I cannot accept the  amendment. The Bill is designed to protect children from  harm. My hon. Friend spoke about someone who, later in  life, is not likely to cause harm I paraphrase his remarks.  Children should not be placed at risk in any  circumstances; for that reason, I do not accept that  someone who seriously harmed a child should, even much  later in life, be allowed to work with children.  
<P>
The Bill contains many mechanisms, the most crucial  being an independent tribunal, which means that no one's  name will appear on the list unless they have seriously  offended. I reject the amendment for that reason.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I was not planning to speak to the  amendment because I presumed that it would be accepted  without argument. The amendment tabled by the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish is necessary; it would  give the Secretary of State a reserve power to act when it  was manifestly unreasonable to leave someone's name on  the list because of the stigma attached. As the Bill stands,  the Secretary of State could remove a name only if it  became clear that it should not have been there in the first  place. It may have been right to put a person's name on  the list in the first place, yet with the benefit of 20 or 30  years' effluxion of time it may become clear that it is no  longer appropriate for that person's name to be on the list.  
<P>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Stourbridge  about the alternative safeguards. Yes, there is a tribunal,  but it will act when a person's name is put on the list,  because that person will have the right to apply to the  tribunal. However, in the Bill as drafted, the tribunal  would not have a role 20 years down the line in reviewing  whether it was still appropriate for that person's name to  be on the list. The Secretary of State would not have the  power to remove the name of such a person perhaps  someone who had become seriously ill or disabled from  the list. There are various scenarios in which a person  could no longer be said to be a hazard to children. There  may not be many such cases, but the Secretary of State  should have the reserve power to step in when it is  obvious that an injustice is being perpetrated.  
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, if the Bill does not  operate fairly and deliver natural justice across the board  it will not be credible or durable. I urge members of the  Committee to accept the amendment.     
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I want to return to the points  made by the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish, who  said that there are two categories of people who may end  up on the list: paedophiles and people who deliberately  abuse children, for whom we know that there is no cure   or hope of anything happening to change that predilection,  and people who are guilty of some incompetence or  misjudgment. We might imagine someone early in a  career making a mistake that, while not serious enough to  put a child in grave danger, was of a level of  incompetence that could mean inclusion on the list under  the Bill. With maturity and growing experience, such a  person would not be a risk of any kind to children.  
<P>
I am sure that many members of the Committee are  parents. There will have been occasions for all of us when  we were fortunate that something that we did with a child  did not result in his or her falling downstairs or being run  over by a bus. We will have learnt from such a mistake  to be more careful next time, or to take hold of a hand. To  put someone's name on the list for a lifetime, for minor  incompetence rather than serious neglect or intentional  abuse, will not only attach a lifelong stigma to that person  but bar him or her for life from working or volunteering  in a child care organisation.  
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be natural justice to give the Secretary of State  discretion to remove from the list, at a later date, a person  such as I have described, should an application be made,  and provided the Secretary of State was satisfied that the  applicant passed the test of no longer being a danger to  children. I am very disappointed that the hon. Member for  Stourbridge feels unable to accept the amendment. I hope  that she and her hon. Friends may reconsider their view.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I had  not intended to speak. I confess that I am in two minds  and would like to explore one or two thoughts. Perhaps  the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish will be able  to help me out, with respect to his own thinking about  the amendment.     
<P>
My presumption, on first reading the amendment, was  against it. It seemed that the purpose of the Bill, as I noted  on Second Reading, was to provide as far as is  possible absolute levels of protection for children. Of  course that is not achievable, but the object is to go as far  as possible towards it. In that sense, any balancing that is  done is between the privilege of being able to work with  children and their right to be looked after in a harm-free  environment. From that viewpoint, even though a person  whose name had been put on the list believed, years later,  that he or she would no longer represent a threat to  children, society's obligation might be to take the view  that the fact that they had once harmed a child or brought  about circumstances that could have done so warranted  permanent inclusion in the list.  
<P>
Without wanting to anticipate future debates of this  Committee you would rule me out of order if I did,  Mr. Wells it strikes me that we have yet to discuss  the circumstances under which a person's name would  be included in the list. That presents a difficulty.  Perhaps it will be decided that inclusion in the list will  arise from gross misconduct, misconduct or what I  should term gross incompetence or possibly we should  leave out the question of incompetence, in accordance  with amendments tabled by the hon. Member for  Denton and Reddish. If those harsher grounds were the  basis for inclusion, it would be reasonable to decide  that people should remain on the list.   
<P>
However, the hon. Member for Taunton raised the  possibility that incompetence causing harm or risk of  harm might be a reason for inclusion in the list. That is  not exactly the same as the test of serious harm that the  hon. Member for Stourbridge described. We could  probably all conceive of circumstances in which a person  who had been incompetent in that way could later be  demonstrably no more likely than anyone else to cause  harm to children or, adopting a commonsense approach,  might even be less likely to cause harm to children. We  all know that the one mistake or incompetent act that we  do not commit is the one that we committed in the past.  Under those circumstances, the hon. Member for Denton  and Reddish makes a good point.     
<P>
I intend to narrow the text slightly at later stages of  the Bill so that we are talking, for example, about "gross  incompetence"  that risks harming children. I should tell  the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish that, at this  stage, I shall not support his amendment. However, if  amendments narrowing the inclusion on the list are not  passed, we should consider returning to the issue on  Report and offer a mechanism similar to the hon.  Gentleman's, which would allow the Secretary of State to  receive an application for a name to be removed from  the list.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I have a good deal of  sympathy for the amendment proposed by the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish. If I were the Secretary  of State, I would not want to have to choose whose name  should be on the list. Clause 3 already provides a sort of  right of appeal to the Secretary of State for those whose  name may have been accidentally placed on the list or  those who do not deserve to be on it. That would be  broadened only slightly if we allowed an appeal to those  who should no longer be included on the list.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton argued that someone in  charge of children who was incompetent at an early stage  of a career might have an unblemished record for the next  20 years. In those circumstances, such a person may not  deserve to have a lifelong sentence with respect to the list.  My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire  was right in saying that we must examine the criteria for  inclusion. At the moment, they are relatively broad and  might include incompetents as well as sex offenders.  
<P>
One relevant point that emerged on Second Reading  was the problem of deciding what should happen to  people who have been prosecuted for, but acquitted of, a  sex offence. Will they be added to the list after acquittal  by the court? Is it only those who have been acquitted  who will not be added to the list? Will the names of those  who have not been to court but against whom serious  evidence exists be added to the list?  
<P>
I may be broadening the debate slightly from the terms  of the clause, but it is important to ask about the criteria  for inclusion on the list. That is an administrative process  rather than a legal process, but it will impinge on the legal  process. We must decide what to do when people have  been taken to court, prosecuted and cleared by a jury.  Are they to be added to the list automatically as potential  suspects? Will some people who commit sex offences  against children be found to have been cleared by the  courts?  
<P>
There is also the danger of catching all sorts of people  whose fault is not to have been very competent when in  charge of scouts. Yet the burden of proof in a court case  may prevent others who are serious offenders against  children from being convicted. We shall have to address  those problems as the Committee progresses.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I was disappointed by the reply by my  hon. Friend the Member of Stourbridge and I hope that  she will give the amendment further thought. I do not  want to take up too much of the Committee's time with  hypothetical examples or those drawn from my  experience. I must tell my hon. Friend, however, that in  drafting a Bill to protect children, it is important not to  end up harming children.  
<P>
I would like to give one example from my experience  as a member of Oldham borough council a long time ago.  A well run children's home worked on the principle that  the house mother was employed by the local authority  and her husband received accommodation and food from  the council.  
<P>
The husband died and about four years later, the house  mother informed the committee that she intended to  re-marry to someone who regularly delivered goods to  the children's home. In order for her to remain the house  mother, the local authority had to vet her husband to find  out whether he was a suitable person to become a house  father and to be, in a sense, employed by the authority  although he received emoluments instead of a wage.  
<P>
The committee discovered that the man had had a  criminal conviction for an offence against a young girl,  when he was about 18 years old. I do not approve of that;  the girl was 15 years old at the time, and it should not  have happened. As things stand at present, that man's  name would not be on the list. However, if he had been a  council employee at the time, his name could easily have  been put on the list as a result of that conviction. Some  30 years after the conviction, was he a suitable person for  the local authority to allow to move into the children's  home? If he did not move in, the house mother, who had  looked after those children for a substantial period, would  almost certainly have had to move out.  
<P>
The committee had a difficult decision to take. It  eventually agreed that the conviction had taken place so  long ago that the man was unlikely to harm the children  in the home. As far as I know, no difficulties arose from  that decision during the remainder of my time on Oldham  borough council. However, if the name of someone like  that had been put on the list 20 or 30 years earlier, it  would now be impossible to remove it, because the  conviction is not in dispute, and there is no means of  removing a name simply because the passage of time and  the present circumstances might suggest that it was  reasonable to do so.   
<P>
I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge is keen to protect children. However, when  faced with the dilemma of whether to disrupt the house  in which they live and treat as their home, the house  mother whom they understand      
<P>
<B>Mrs. Llin Golding </B>(Newcastle-Under-Lyme): One can  never know. That is what the Bill is about. If that man  were put in a position where he had the opportunity to  commit a crime again and it would be a crime, in my  opinion he might take it. One can never know, and one  should not take the risk.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I think that one can take risks. No  behaviour that that man would be likely to engage in  could be as much of a crime against those children as  explaining to them that the house mother, whom they  regard as a parent, would have to either not marry or move  out of the home and cease to be a parent to them. There  should, therefore, be a mechanism whereby someone can  be taken off the list in exceptional circumstances.  
<P>
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for South  Cambridgeshire that we may be able to approach the  matter differently later, when we examine the question of  incompetence. However, it would be far better to  introduce a safeguard. I am willing to accept that, because  our priority is the safety of children, such a safeguard  should be a very rarely used power, but future Secretaries  of State will be in a difficult position if they do not have  the discretion to remove from the list the names of people  whose circumstances have dramatically changed.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to  respond to some of the points raised.  
<P>
I would like to emphasise that there is currently no right  of appeal or independent tribunal for those on the  consultancy index. Such people may not know that their  name appears on the index. The Bill provides a voice for  the first time for those who might have had their name  included on the index incorrectly. It is an important check  and balance to the initiatives that I am proposing to  protect children. I am grateful to the hon. Member for  South Cambridgeshire for reminding the Committee, as he  reminded hon. Members on Second Reading, that working  with children is a privilege not a right. We should always  bear that in mind. I should tell the hon. Members for  South Cambridgeshire and for Poole (Mr. Syms) and my  hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish that the  criteria for inclusion will be raised at a later stage, when  I will have a number of things to say.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> At this stage I will not press the  amendment to a vote. I am obviously disappointed; we  shall try to return to the issue later. I beg to ask leave to  withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the  Bill.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> Would you give me guidance here, Mr. Wells?  
<P>
<B>  The Chairman:</B> Yes. The next procedure is to adopt  clause 1 and have it accepted as part of the Bill. If no  hon. Member wishes to speak on clause 1, I will simply  put the question and we will move on.

Question put and agreed to.  
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.  
<H4><center>Clause 2 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Inclusion in list on reference to Secretary of State </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in  page 1, line 18, after `has', insert `lawfully'.     
<P>
A large number of amendments have been tabled to the  clause because it is the crux of our debate on the  balancing of civil liberties. In our earlier debate, we drew  attention to the fact that the crucial issue for many of us  is the level at which people are put on the list. As it stands,  the clause does not impose a requirement for a dismissal  to have been lawful before someone's name is put on  the list.  
<P>
I know that we shall come to this debate later, but there  is no criterion for the seriousness of the level of  misconduct or incompetence that needs to have been  exhibited before someone's name is put on the list.  Indeed, the name of a person whose dismissal had been  found by a tribunal to be unlawful could still be included  on the list. If a tribunal found that he had not been  dismissed for valid reasons, it would be unfair for him  still to be barred from working in child care for the rest  of his life. The amendment is simple. Everyone is entitled  to a fair hearing before there is a restriction on his or her  right to work. Any dismissal should have been lawful in  the first place.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I sympathise with what the hon.  Member for Taunton is seeking to achieve. However, I  fear that this is not the place to make this change, and that  it would not achieve her objective. Clause 2(2) talks about  the conditions that must be fulfilled for an organisation to  report someone to the Secretary of State. If an  organisation has dismissed an individual, except in rare  circumstances of malicious behaviour it must be presumed  to believe that it has dismissed him lawfully. It would  therefore report the dismissal to the Secretary of State. I  suspect that inserting the term "lawful"  at this point, as  the hon. Member for Taunton proposes, would not have  an impact on the behaviour of reporting organisations but  might leave them vulnerable to legal action at a later stage  by the person being reported if the dismissal was  subsequently overturned by a tribunal. That would be  onerous, particularly for smaller or voluntary  organisations.  
<P>
We shall have to return to the matter, but I think that  what the hon. Member for Taunton is seeking would be  more effectively achieved if the reference to lawfulness  were inserted in clause 2(6), thereby making the test that  the Secretary of State, before putting someone on the list,  must determine that dismissal had been lawful. He might  then wait for any appeal tribunal process to run its course  before making his decision. The distinction is therefore   whether the Secretary of State has to believe, on the  balance of evidence, that dismissal was lawful before  putting a person on the list, or whether   
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument seems  plausible, so why did he not table an amendment to that  effect?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not necessarily consider it my  role to police hon. Members' amendments. I read the  amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Taunton in  detail only last night, and only in the past few minutes,  after reading the Bill once more, have I realised that there  is a better place to deal with the issues that she raises. I  speak in a constructive spirit when I say that unless the  hon. Lady is suggesting that organisations are dismissing  individuals, believing that doing so is unlawful, I do not  think that her proposal would have any practical effect. In  my view, we should return later and achieve what she  rightly seeks by changing clause 2(6).  
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I support my hon. Friend's view to the  extent that I think that the question whether dismissal is  lawful or otherwise should not govern whether an  organisation reports a person to the list because, as my  hon. Friend explained clearly, presumably the  organisation, except in the case of malice, would act on  the basis of its expectation of its own decisions falling  within the law. That is not the point.  
<P>
However, I do not concur with my hon. Friend the  Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)  that we therefore need this answers the point made by  the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish to seek later  an amendment that serves his purpose. As far as I can see,  the test applied by the Secretary of State for references  made to him is not a test of whether a dismissal was  lawful, but relates to the circumstances of the reference  and the information supplied with it, and to whether, on  that basis, the Secretary of State believes a person to be  guilty of misconduct or, as it may prove to be,  incompetence leading to harm.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not disagree with my hon.  Friend's point. I merely attempted to suggest  mechanistically that what the hon. Member for Taunton  had in mind could be better achieved elsewhere in the  clause.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> But my hon. Friend will probably accept  that he must not try to be too helpful or the hon. Member  for Denton and Reddish will chastise him for not tabling  helpful amendments.  
<P>
My initial conclusion is that the Secretary of State will  not make a test of whether a dismissal was lawful; a test  will be made on the basis of the evidence offered. If the  circumstances of dismissal were germane to the issue of  whether it was lawful, the evidence could be provided to  the Secretary of State by the person in question. If the  Secretary of State included a person's name on the list,  and evidence was brought to bear during an employment  tribunal that the dismissal was not lawful because, for   example, errors of fact had been made by the employer,  and the dismissal was overturned, there is no reason why  that person should not make the same case to the tribunal  proposed in the Bill.  
<P>
If the errors vitiated the argument that somebody was  guilty of misconduct, it would be reasonable for the  tribunal to reach that judgment. Under the Bill, the  tribunal would not be conducting a test of whether  somebody had been dismissed from a position lawfully,  but rather, having considered all the circumstances of the  proposed case, whether the person had been guilty of  misconduct or incompetence leading to harm to children.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The debate has shown that there is a  misconception on the part of the hon. Member for  Taunton about the roles of the employment tribunal and  the Secretary of State and the criteria that are used. For  that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I notice that the Minister is present. It  would be useful for him to put on the record his  position on such a point. There is always a difficulty  about how courts interpret legislation. On the whole,  the words in an Act have to be examined. However,  there is a legal ruling that I can never remember,  whereby gradually the Law Lords have accepted that  on occasions the intentions of the Minister during  discussion of proposed legislation may be considered. I  am worried about that, because although I understand  that the Law Lords can examine the intentions of a  Minister, I am not certain whether, in the case of a  private Member's Bill, the intentions of the promoter  may be examined. Will the Minister tell the Committee  what the Government think about some of the  important issues?  
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for  Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I was intending to say a few  words about the amendments at the end of the debate.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> The Minister did not seem to be rushing  to do so.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I was waiting for the debate to come to  an end before I indicated to the Chairman that I wanted  to say a few words. The reason why I wanted to leave my  contribution until the end is that my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge made the position clear when she  briefly made her response to the amendment.  
<P>
There has been confusion during the debate about the  role of an employment tribunal and the responsibilities of  the Secretary of State as set out in the Bill for deciding  whether a person's name should be included on the list  that he would maintain.  
<P>
As the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said in  his helpful contribution, it is conceivable I would not  say it more strongly that an employment tribunal might  conclude in an individual case that the reason for a  dismissal was fair because misconduct might have placed  a child at risk of harm but that the dismissal itself has  been unfair, and therefore unlawful, because the  employer's own disciplinary procedures had been  breached.      
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for  Taunton could mean that the Secretary of State would  have no powers to put a person on the list because,  although the tribunal had concluded that there were  reasons, such as misconduct, to justify dismissal, for other  reasons the dismissal was found to be unfair. Someone  could have committed an act of misconduct and placed a  child at risk of harm, but the Secretary of State could not  place that person on the list because the industrial tribunal  had decided, for procedural reasons, that the dismissal  was unfair.  
<P>
The criteria according to which the Secretary of State  will operate his powers are set out clearly in clause 2(6).  They are different from the test adopted by an  employment tribunal. If he is satisfied that the referring  organisation reasonably considered, on the balance of  probabilities, that the individual was guilty of the alleged  misconduct that is the test applied by the tribunal the  criteria in clause 2(6)(a) will be met. He must then  consider the individual's suitability to work with children.  
<P>
There are different sets of criteria, and two different  roles will be discharged. The employment tribunal will  consider all the circumstances of the case, including  compliance with disciplinary procedure. The failure to  comply with such a procedure could make a dismissal  unfair, even though a tribunal had established the reason  that justified dismissal.  
<P>
<H5>11.15 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
For those reasons, I strongly support my hon. Friend  the Member for Stourbridge and consider the amendment  unnecessary and unhelpful. It would make it possible for  the name of someone who had placed a child at the risk  of harm not to be included in the list because of a  technical breach in the dismissal procedure.  
<P>
I have trepidation about intervening, given the  comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and  Reddish about the possibility of the Law Lords  interpreting my remarks when considering litigation. I am  not sure of the position concerning private Members'  Bills. I have tried to set out the Government's view on  the amendment, and I hope that that will clarify the matter  in the Committee at least. I am not sure about the  implication of my comments on any possible litigation  procedure. I know that Pepper v. Hart was an important  decision that guides ministerial comments during the  passage of Government legislation.  
<P>
I have stated the Government's views on the merits of  the amendment. I hope that hon. Members will be  reassured by our view that it is unhelpful and unnecessary.  I trust that the hon. Member for Taunton will withdraw  the amendment.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am grateful to the Minister: his  intervention was helpful and it amplified points made by  the hon. Member for Stourbridge.  
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said that  an organisation that dismissed someone would assume  that that action was lawful. If that were true, we would  not need employment tribunals. people are often  dismissed because that is convenient for the employer, or   out of malice. Dismissals are not always lawful; that is  why employment tribunals often find in favour of  employees.  
<P>
I accept the Minister's argument that a dismissal might  be found unlawful for purely technical reasons and that,  therefore, the amendment might not be helpful and might  achieve the opposite of my intentions. There might be a  more sensible time to raise the matter, so I beg to ask  leave to withdraw the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in  page 1, line 19, leave out `misconduct' and insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`sexual or other intentional abuse'.     <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are now getting to the heart of the issue. I do not  know whether there is a legal definition of misconduct  perhaps someone will tell us during the debate. Could a  lapse of attention that led to a child not being harmed but  being put at risk of harm be considered as misconduct? If  that were the case, I suspect that all of us, in our working  and private lives, have been guilty of such a lapse of  attention.  
<P>
Could breaking the rules be construed as misconduct,  even if the rules were not sensible? Could colluding with  or turning a blind eye to children in a residential  establishment who were having a midnight feast be  understood as misconduct? What about teachers who  reveal their political views? Is that misconduct?  
<P>
As the hon. Member for Stourbridge said on Second  Reading and in Committee, the Bill will try to unearth  people who deliberately harm children through sexual  abuse or other abuse or neglect. The amendment would  spell that out on the face of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps the hon. Member for Taunton  and I are going to switch roles occasionally during the  Committee. I think that the definition in her amendment  is too restrictive, although I have some sympathy for what  she says and understand why she is proposing it.  However, it seems that there are examples of  "misconduct"  for which someone should be placed on the  list that are not.  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sexual or other intentional abuse" .  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton gave the example of  someone acquiescing in a midnight feast in a children's  home, but what about someone acquiescing in the taking  of prohibited drugs in a children's home? That seems to  me to be the kind of "misconduct"  that must remain in  the scope of the clause, and it is not clear that that would  be covered by the term  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sexual or other intentional abuse" .  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We will consider amendments that introduce the  concept of seriousness into the definition of "harm" . I  remind the hon. Member for Taunton that the test is not  only that the person involved has been dismissed for  misconduct, but that such misconduct has led to harm or  put children "at risk of harm" . One of those amendments  will seek to strengthen that test by rewriting the clause  to read.  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at risk of serious harm" .   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I have considerable reservations about the breadth of the  subsection as it stands, but I cannot believe that the hon.  Lady's amendment will be helpful, as it would narrow the  definition of the type of misconduct covered. I urge her  to withdraw the amendment and rely instead on the  amendments that are to be considered later that will  introduce the seriousness test.     
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The Bill's scope is not intended to be  limited to sexual abuse. As the hon. Member for  Runnymede and Weybridge has pointed out, it needs to  have a much wider scope than that. It is important to bear  in mind that our definition of "harm"  is based on that in  the Children Act 1989, in which  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`harm' means ill-treatment or the impairment of health or  development;  
<P>
`development' means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or  behavioural development;  
<P>
`health' means physical or mental health; and  
<P>
`ill-treatment' includes sexual abuse and forms of ill-treatment  which are not physical."   <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I would like to explore what my hon. Friend  the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said. If  someone in charge of a children's home was aware that  children were taking a prohibited drug and was trying to  stop them, would he or she still be held responsible for  those actions and so be added to the list?  
<P>
Let us imagine that a child of either sex from a local  authority's children's home was engaging in prostitution,  as, I am sad to say, occasionally happens. There is a  difference between an individual who abuses another  individual, and an individual who knows what someone  in his or her care is doing and is trying to stop them. If a  young girl is picked up off the street for prostitution,  might the head of the home who might have been aware  and have warned the child end up on the list and  therefore lose his or her livelihood? That would seem to  be against natural justice.  
<P>
How do we juggle such issues? There is a difference  between someone sleeping with a girl at a home, and  someone trying to control a child who may have had a  difficult childhood who is known to disappear on  occasions. It is an important question of balance.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not intend to respond to all the  amendments, as I am sure that my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge can competently respond to most  of them. However, the hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge has raised a reasonable question, and, at this  point, I shall try to reassure him about the Bill and how  we envisage it working. He must be clear about the  structure of the Bill and the circumstances than can lead  to the inclusion of a person's name on the list. The  employer has to be satisfied that a person has committed  an act of misconduct or incompetence. The Secretary of  State then has to be satisfied that, because of that  misconduct or incompetence, the person is unsuitable to  work with children.  
<P>
We can all exercise common sense certainly in the  example cited by the hon. Member for Poole. If a person  has taken practical steps to prevent a child from being   exposed to harm, no reasonable employer is likely to  conclude that such action constitutes misconduct. I am  sure that the hon. Gentleman and other members of the  Committee will appreciate that we cannot determine,  given the wide variety of circumstances that cannot be  predicted, when a person will be included on the list. The  Bill lays out a clear structure about a person's misconduct  and incompetence that places a child at risk, and the  Secretary of State must be satisfied that that conduct  renders that person unsuitable to work with children.     
<P>
The Bill's structure is robust. It is designed to prevent  people who are suitable to work with children from  ending up on the list. If people are suitable to work with  children the Bill will not pose any risk to their future  employment in a job that brings them into contact with  children. It will ensure that such a person as described in  the example cited by the hon. Member for Poole does not  end up on the list if he has acted reasonably and has taken  steps to ensure that children under his care are not  exposed to harm. The Secretary of State must be satisfied  in each case that the person who committed misconduct  or incompetence is unsuitable to work with children. Such  a robust structure will withstand the concerns expressed  by the hon. Member for Poole.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am puzzled by what the Minister said.  I understand that the Secretary of State or the tribunal has  control over the final list, but what about the preliminary  list and the length of time that someone can be on it?  The preliminary list is activated merely by an organisation  putting forward a name. The Minister's reassurance  applies only to the permanent list, not the temporary list.  However, someone may stay on the temporary list for a  substantial period and that may have considerable  consequences for their future employment.  
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge talked about examples of misconduct that  could lead to entry on the list and cited the example in  contrast to my example of a person acquiescing in the  use of illegal drugs. Clearly, aiding or abetting in the use  of illegal drugs is against the law, but what about a teacher  who decides not to report the 16 or 17-year-old who was  found using so-called soft drugs to the police? That  happens in many public schools; indeed, it may be the  school's general ruling not to report someone who uses  so-called soft drugs, but to change that person's  behaviour. Would that teacher's action constitute  acquiescing in the use of drugs?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If, as the hon. Lady hypothesises, it  is the policy of the school to take such action, the person  who followed that policy could hardly be dismissed for  misconduct.  
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I should be surprised if such action is  the written policy of many schools or is laid down in  the school prospectus. However, if some kids are found  smoking pot, many schools will not march them down to  the police station, but instead warn them that they must  not do it again or they will be in trouble. Such schools  take a realistic rather than punitive attitude towards such  activity. If the matter blew up in the newspapers, however,  the head may decide that that was grounds for dismissing  the teacher because it was giving the school bad publicity.   
<P>
We can all think of cases of misconduct that would lead  to a child being at risk, so the person committing that  misconduct should be included on the list. Some cases  could be described as cases of misconduct, that may lead  to harm. Someone may take a more draconian attitude to  the use of drugs, saying that they lead to harm and that  the person involved should be taken to the police station.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> May I develop the point that I was making  a little earlier about someone in charge of a home? If a  girl was going out on the streets, the head of the home  might say to her, "I do not want you to go out, but if you  do, for goodness' sake use a condom, because there are  many nasty things that you can catch these days. Please  practice safe sex."  Would that be encouragement, or  would it be good advice? How would a tribunal view it?  It could be misinterpreted; it is a difficult question.  
<P>
<H5>11.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> It is indeed difficult, which is why I  moved the amendment. I think that the terms  "misconduct"  and "at risk of harm"  are too widely drawn.  I am worried that people may be drawn into the net whom  any reasonable person would consider unlikely to be a  lifelong danger to children. In fact, given the criteria for  being on the list, I suspect that most parents, in their  parenting role, could end up on it. Indeed, the hon.  Member for Poole reminded us that many parents know  that their under-age teenage children are sexually active.  If a parent says to a teenager "I do not approve of what  you are doing it is not very sensible but if you are  going to do it for goodness' sake take these  contraceptives" , it could be construed as misconduct  leading to the risk of harm to the child. All sorts of other  things that parents might do could put them on the list if  they were subject to the provisions.  
<P>
I am wary of the fact that the Bill's sponsor keeps  saying that our concerns will be dealt with later in the Bill  and that we will then be satisfied. If the hon. Member for  Stourbridge means that she will accept some of the later  amendments, which would narrow those definitions a  little and make it less likely that someone could be put  on the list wrongly, I would be happy to withdraw the  amendment, which I clearly shall have to do because if I  pressed it to a vote it would not be accepted. It would  help if the hon. Lady would let us know soon that she  would be willing to accept some of the amendments that  have been tabled in the names of other hon. Members.  We are trying to make the Bill fairer to those wrongly  included on the list. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> It seems a formidable list of  amendments, but most of them are consequential. Some  amendments would leave out "incompetence" , and others  would insert "gross"  or "serious"  before "incompetence" .  
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge  can suggest an improvement to this provision. It became  clear on Second Reading that this is a crucial matter, and  I think that all members of the Committee are keen to  legislate. It is important to avoid making amendments to  a private Member's Bill on Report, but unless the  Committee can come up with a solution, some hon.  Members, if not members of the Committee, will be  tempted to table further amendments to clause 2. It would  be a pity if the Bill got bogged down on Report.  
<P>
People will have no difficulty in putting someone  firmly on the list who has committed offences against  children and is likely to continue to commit offences.  However, there is no evidence that those who omit to do  something through incompetence will always be  incompetent in a particular situation. In most  circumstances, the behaviour of people who abuse  children does not change, but someone's competence  changes frequently. We all know that we are incompetent  occasionally, but we hope that we are not incompetent too  often. Therefore, to state that someone who is  incompetent in looking after children must be included on  the list is extremely dangerous.  
<P>
Drugs were mentioned when we debated amendment  No. 57, but one of the most difficult problems for those  who run children's homes to deal with is the behaviour of  children. In particular, when children of both sexes are  involved. People who run homes are often under   considerable pressure from those youngsters to let them  behave in totally inappropriate ways. If one is responsible  for looking after those children in the evening, it can be  a nightmare to try to stop boys getting into girls'  bedrooms and vice versa.  
<P>
The organisation running the home might well tell  someone who is on duty in the evening to be much stricter  with the children. The organisation can go through a  whole procedure, but the conclusion might be that that  individual is simply not capable of controlling those 13  or 14-year-olds in that children's home. That person is  clearly incompetent and he or she should not continue to  work in that children's home in those circumstances.     
<P>
Are we saying that that person is totally unsuitable to  work with children ever again? I do not believe that that  is necessarily the case. Ten or 15 years later, that person  might have the maturity and authority to return to exactly  the same situation and, by force of personality, stop young  people misbehaving sexually. Someone like that could be  employed in many other circumstances.  
<P>
Under the Bill, if the organisation dismisses that  individual because of his or her failure to maintain  standards in a home, it will have no option but to report  that person to the Secretary of State. It might be argued  that the Secretary of State and the tribunal will consider  those circumstances, but one of the problems is the length  of time that someone might be on the provisional list. We  shall return to that matter later. It would be far better to  state that people must be put on the list because of their  misconduct, not because of either their misconduct or  their incompetence.  
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge  will accept the deletion of the word "incompetence" . If  she cannot, I certainly hope that she will sympathetically  consider including either the word "gross"  or the word  "serious" . That would make it clear that we are not after  those who omit to do things that they should do in  particular circumstances. We are after those who  misbehave.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sure that the Committee is grateful  to the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish for moving  the amendment in such clear terms. He has helpfully set  out the parameters of the debate. It is important that we  get the clause right now for precisely the reasons that he  gave at the beginning of his speech.  
<P>
I started, I confess, by thinking that it would be right  to delete the word "incompetence" . I concluded that it  would not be right to do so for two reasons. First,  language in legislation is interpreted by courts; it is not  interpreted simply on the basis of how we describe it,  notwithstanding the case of Pepper v. Hart. That case still  constitutes a narrow judicial intervention into the  interpretation of legislation by reference to proceedings in  the House. Courts will generally interpret legislation on  the basis of what is in front of them, according to the  plain meaning of words. We must therefore ask ourselves,  what is the plain meaning of the words that we want to  put into legislation? We must, as far as possible, try to  leave our intentions out of account, and try to focus on  what the legislation means.   
<P>
We shall be in a definitional mire if we are not careful,  but specifying "misconduct or incompetence"  is not  simply tautology. There is a difference between the two.  Misconduct is essentially sins of commission, and  incompetence is sins of omission. I recognise that those  are not hard and fast definitions. Notional circumstances  could arise in which the extent of neglect of an action that  should have been taken is not simply a sin of omission,  but becomes misconduct because of systematic  incompetence. However, we are dealing not with such  circumstances alone but with other circumstances, in  which incompetence is such as to lead to the claim that  someone has brought harm or risk of harm on children,  and should therefore be included in the notification  procedure.  
<P>
If those two words are not tautological, in including  "incompetence" , we have something in mind. The  question then becomes, is it reasonable to exclude it? Is  it reasonable to require an employer to notify someone  who has been incompetent to the point where a child has  been harmed or placed at risk of harm? For me, the  answer is yes, we should arrive at that point.     
<P>
The next question is, should we arrive at that point for  any circumstances in which incompetence has led to such  an outcome? Many such circumstances may arise. The test  is not whether someone in the course of their employment  or otherwise has been incompetent so as to cause harm or  risk of harm to a child, but whether someone has been  dismissed for that reason. Other circumstances may arise,  but they are analogous to dismissal.  
<P>
We may, therefore, be considering circumstances in  which someone is dismissed on grounds of what might be  called serious or gross incompetence we shall discuss  the difference between those two later. However, many  other circumstances may arise, in which people leave  employment, are changed to different positions or are  dismissed for reasons that do not, strictly speaking, relate  to such an instance. In such circumstances, an employer  will none the less on prudential grounds argue that the  incompetence that led to harm or risk of harm was a factor  contributing to the change of an employee's position, to  his resigning or retiring at that point, or to the fact that  he was going to be dismissed. We can identify several  circumstances in which employers might have a  responsibility to make a notification about incompetence  that might not necessarily constitute the sort of gross  incompetence that would of itself lead to dismissal. It  might be a contributory factor, but at a lesser level.  
<P>
My second reason for being chary of removing  "incompetence"  is that, after receiving notification that a  person has been incompetent so as to cause harm or risk  of harm to a child, it does not automatically follow that  the Secretary of State will include that person on the list.  The Secretary of State has a second test that the  individual is unsuitable to work with children. A de  minimis test will apply. It may, perhaps rightly, become  the practice of employers to make notifications on several  occasions, more than have been made to the consultancy  index, for example, in the past. The Secretary of State  will, in effect, apply a de minimis test to the  circumstances not that someone has been wholly  blameless, but that the amount of blame to be attached  arising from incompetence is so minimal that it does not   render the person unsuitable to work with children. That  is a safeguard. Removing the word "incompetence"  would  exclude the Secretary of State from reviewing cases that  should be reviewed because of the sins of omission.  
<P>
<H5>11.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
When I considered whether we should leave the word  "incompetence"  in the Bill, I concluded that incompetence  can occur in very many instances at a modest level of  guilt and blame. The Secretary of State could end up with  an enormous number of cases that must be decided on  qualitative grounds which are not expressed in the  legislation. Someone may not be unsuitable to work with  children even though he or she may have been responsible  for incompetence that led to harm to children. We do not  want to be put in that position if we can avoid it, so we  should set out plainly what we intend.  
<P>
Our intention should be that notification to the  Secretary of State should occur when there has been  serious or gross incompetence. I am not qualified to say  what a court will judge as serious or gross incompetence,  but most of us would recognise it when we saw it. The  sin of omission is when a person reasonably should have  seen the harm that could occur and failed to act to prevent  it. Gross incompetence is language that conveys that,  although the hon Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme  (Mrs. Golding), who will speak to amendment No. 50,  may think that the word "serious"  conveys it. There may  be certain difficulties in linguistic definitions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the  words "serious"  and "gross"  are interchangeable, or is he  suggesting that there is a gradation between the two?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am working on the basis that the two  words are interchangeable. The hon. Member for  Newcastle-under-Lyme and I did not have a chance to  discuss amendments we probably tabled ours at much  the same time. Gross incompetence is a form in which I  have seen the language used in the past. If I were to  distinguish between the two, gross incompetence seems  to me not to require an additional test of what is or is not  serious. The courts are used to something being referred  to as gross or not gross; it is a sort of black-and-white test  applied by them.  
<P>
If something is serious, there is the question of what  criteria to apply to determine the level of seriousnesss.  We are not proposing to apply a test of what is serious.  The courts will have to decide, so it would be better to  use language that offers a yes or no solution, rather than  to require courts to make calculations on criteria that will  not be set out in the Bill.  
<P>
I do not support amendment No. 2, which would delete  the word "incompetence" . I prefer amendment No. 39,  which I tabled, or amendment No. 50, tabled by the hon.  Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme.  
<P>
<B>Mrs. Golding:</B> I rise to speak to amendment No. 50  and consequential amendments Nos. 51, 52, 53 and 54. I  agree with everything that the hon. Member for South  Cambridgeshire has said. It is a matter of choosing the   right word. I cannot agree that the word "incompetence"   should be withdrawn from the Bill. There can be  incompetence when there is no misconduct.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport  (Mr. Jamieson) introduced a private Member's Bill,  dealing with the control and regulation of adventure  training holidays. It became the Activity Centres (Young  Persons Safety) Act 1995. Members of the Committee  may remember a serious case in Plymouth when a group  of children went out in a boat and many of them were  drowned because of the lack of training, the  unseaworthiness of the boat and the absence of lifejackets.  My hon. Friend introduced his Bill to prevent that from  happening again.  
<P>
The owner of the adventure training holiday scheme  was guilty of criminal misconduct because he knew that  the boats were unseaworthy and that he should be doing  much more. That was serious, criminal misconduct and  something happened to him. However, the actions of the  person who took the children out in the boat seem to have  been based more on incompetence than misconduct. He  was obeying the owner's instructions; the owner was  responsible for ensuring that the equipment was  seaworthy and that the children were safe in it. The man  who took the children out was incompetent because he  did not realise the seriousness of the situation and did not  question his own actions. He did not think that it was his  responsibility to do so. He was completely unsuitable for  the job of looking after children, because he was incapable  of understanding his own unsuitability. Incompetent, not  criminal, is the word to describe him; he did not intend to  harm the children, he was just incompetent.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I accept that. There are many  circumstances in which people are incompetent. Most of  us are incompetent, but if we are incompetent at an  activity all the time, we should stop performing it. Most  people take steps to ensure that. Someone who gets into  difficulty while performing an outdoor pursuits activity  hopefully, not as severe a difficulty as in the hon. Lady's  example should be dismissed. However, the clause  provides that if someone is guilty of incompetence,  perhaps at the age of 17 or 18, he or she should never  again be allowed to work with children. That is going too  far. Incompetence is reasonable grounds for dismissal, but  an individual may learn from his or her experience,  become more competent and then be suitable for work  with children.     
<P>
<B>Mrs. Golding:</B> My hon. Friend has hit the nail on the  head; if we are incompetent, we realise it and take steps  to do something about it and to protect children in our  care. The man in my example did not do that; he did not  have the experience to do so and he simply did not see the  danger in which he placed the children. That was serious  incompetence and such a person should never again be  put in the position of making judgments about children's  safety. Whether we call such actions gross incompetence  or serious incompetence I accept the point of the hon.  Member for South Cambridgeshire that the term we use  has legal implications and that we should use the one that  is clearer in court we need to keep "incompetence"  in  the legislation.  
<P>
<B>  Jackie Ballard:</B> Perhaps the hon. Lady has been on the  same kind of courses as I have, where one is told about a learning ladder. One goes from unconscious  incompetence, where one does not know enough about an  activity to know that one is not competent at it one has  perhaps never done it before to conscious incompetence,  where one knows that one is doing something incorrectly,  but one does not care or is reckless. Are we not trying  to differentiate between unconsciously incompetent and  consciously incompetent individuals?  
<P>
<B>Mrs. Golding:</B> The only time that I have been in that  position is when I was fishing I was blinkin' certain that  I was not competent because I was not catching any fish  and so tried harder. I do not really accept the hon. Lady's  distinction. It does not change the fact that  "incompetence"  needs to be included, whether we qualify  it as "serious"  or as "gross" . Incompetence is very  different from misconduct and removing it as a category  will harm the Bill and detract from its purpose, which is  to protect children.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I listened carefully to the three  arguments that have been made. I agree that the  incompetent discharge of duties in relation to the care of  children must be addressed. However, I am not convinced  that the Bill is the appropriate vehicle for dealing with  that problem.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton raised an interesting  matter. She talked about incompetence amounting to  recklessness that results from people continuing to perform  duties that they know they are incompetent to perform. I  agree that that is a serious matter, but I suspect that in most  situations recklessness amounts to misconduct, and would  therefore be covered by the Bill's definition of misconduct,  if incompetence were removed from clause 2.  
<P>
That matter was well rehearsed on Second Reading.  The list will have a considerable stigma attached to it. On  Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for  Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) said that the tabloid  press would describe the list as a perverts list. People who  are guilty of a momentary lapse or incompetence in a  broader sense must be dealt with, but they should not be  stigmatised in the same way as people who actively abuse  children. I therefore find the arguments of the hon.  Member for Denton and Reddish more persuasive than  those of my hon. Friend the Member for South  Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for  Newcastle-under-Lyme.     
<P>
Misconduct alone does not warrant someone being  placed on the list, especially as amendment No. 1 has  been withdrawn. A person who is included on the list by  virtue of incompetence will have no opportunity to be  removed from it after their initial appeal to the tribunal.  That means that 10, 20, or even 30 years after such an  inclusion, the Secretary of State will have no opportunity  to recognise that youthful incompetence has matured into  something quite different. I am happy to be corrected if  my interpretation of that process is mistaken.  
<P>
Earlier, I said that the Bill is not a comprehensive  solution to the problem. It must deal with misconduct. The  problem of incompetence must be handled differently, and   is better addressed by requiring appropriate qualifications  and by professional regulation of areas in which people  work with children.  
<P>
The Government have signalled that they intend to go  down that route in the medium term, ensuring that those  working with the vulnerable are properly registered,  controlled and qualified. Will the Minister tell us how  those ideas will interact with the Bill's proposals? What  is the time scale for those proposals?  
<P>
The Bill would make more progress and would have a  greater chance of succeeding if it were narrowly focused  and recognised that issues that need to be addressed, such  as incompetence, would be better dealt with by other  means. The amendment is critical to our consideration of  the Bill, as many of the tests that are imposed must be  much more stringent if incompetence is included in the  list of crimes and misdemeanours warranting a person's  inclusion in it.  
<P>
I suspect that many Members will intervene on Report  if incompetence is left in the Bill. The hon. Member for  Denton and Reddish made a tactical argument for keeping  a narrow focus in the Bill, so as to ensure success on  Report against what might be called the libertarian  tendency. That is a powerful argument in itself, but there  is also a philosophical argument for making a clear  distinction between incompetence which can be  overcome by education, learning and maturing and  misconduct, which, to my mind, implies a character defect  or a personality trait.  
<P>
<H5>12 noon  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to  address a core aspect of the Bill. I discovered on Second  Reading that this aspect worried Members on both sides  of the House. I have given it close attention. The areas of  abuse and harm to children that I purposely omitted from  my speech in the Chamber were harrowing. They were  horrifying, and I chose not to use them. The underlying  concern was to stop children being harmed.  
<P>
The points that the hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge has just brought up are fundamental to the way  that I have approached the amendment. In view of the  huge knowledge and experience that my hon. Friend the  Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme has in these matters,  I believe that I should accept the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Which amendment?  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I am sorry amendment No. 2. I have  been persuaded that serious and gross incompetence  would be covered by misconduct because it is the basis  on which an employer refers to the list. The organisations  that will refer names have a wide and varying view of  what incompetence might be, which obviously raises real  concerns. I said that I would wish to balance within my  Bill the rights of the individual and the rights of the child.  I recognise that the Bill cannot be comprehensive; I said  so on Second Reading. I see this as a building block and  the way that we must go to protect our children.     
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Perhaps the remarks that I intended to  make need not be made because of the hon. Lady's  gracious acceptance of the amendment, but it is worth  putting on the record the reason why I put my name to  the amendment.   
<P>
When I was 21, I was a trainee social worker. That was  some years ago, and social work practice has improved  greatly since then. I had a large case load of children on  the at risk register. That would not now happen to an  unsupervised trainee social worker. Any number of  children on the at risk register for whom I was responsible  could have come to serious harm as a result of the actions  of their parents. One parent would ring me regularly,  saying "I'm dangling Charlene out of the 24th floor tower  block window and if you don't get round in half an hour,  I'll drop her."  Of course I would tear around, and it was  not because of my skill or experience that any of the  children on my case load did not come to serious harm;  it was more luck than judgment or more by the grace  of God.  
<P>
It could be argued that my employers were guilty of  incompetence in not realising that someone so  inexperienced and immature should not have had that  amount of responsibility, but that was fairly common  practice in social work in those days. If one of those  children had come to serious harm I could have been on  this list, if incompetence had remained in the clause. I  could not have had the career that I have had working  with children in other spheres ever since. That personal  knowledge and experience led me to believe that it was  inappropriate to have the term incompetent and to be able  to draw in so widely a net of people who would not by  any stretch of the imagination deliberately harm or abuse  children, but might have acted out of inexperience or  immaturity, or have lacked appropriate supervision. I am  delighted that the hon. Lady feels able to accept the  amendment, which I think will improve the Bill. Those of  us who have not pressed previous amendments to a vote  may feel more comfortable now.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It may be appropriate for me now to  support my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge in  her acceptance of the amendment moved by my hon.  Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. I assure my  hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme that  I should not give that support if I thought that the  amendment would compromise either the architecture of  the Bill the foundations on which we want to build  better protection for children or the protection that the  Bill will provide. I do not believe that the amendment will  diminish protection for children.     
<P>
We have carefully examined the matter at the  Department of Health. Perhaps it will reassure my hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge and other hon.  Members including the hon. Member for South  Cambridgeshire, who expressed reservations about  amendment No. 2 to know that we have examined the  cases on the list and have been unable to produce any  examples of incompetence that would merit inclusion on  the list in their own right but would not also fall within  the definition of misconduct. We have never intended low  levels of incompetence to lead to inclusion on the list.  We are satisfied that reliance on cases of misconduct will  suffice to protect children. Hon. Members, including my  hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, gave  many examples of gross incompetence, which can, we  feel, be dealt with in the category of misconduct. We are  satisfied that the Bill remains robust and strong even with  the amendment.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Lansley:</B> May I explain my one reservation? I  accept that gross or serious incompetence amounts to  misconduct in all the circumstances that the Minister has  examined. The clause covers an organisation's dismissal  of an individual for misconduct and as amended it  would be only misconduct   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether or not in the course of his employment" .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
It is not clear to me whether an employer who was  considering dismissing someone could focus on  misconduct, which might include an assumption of duty  to the employer and dereliction of that duty, as distinct  from incompetence, which might have relevance outside  the duty to the employer, and dismiss a person on those  grounds.  
<P>
I worry that the employer will say that the grounds are  misconduct, and that relates to the duty that the person  has towards him as an employer and any decision to  dismiss him. We want to arrive at circumstances where  incompetence could be the grounds for dismissal and  notification.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Bearing in mind Pepper v. Hart and all  the background, I shall try to choose my words carefully.  What we always had in mind with respect to conduct  outside the course of employment was conduct by an  employee that raised a question as to his or her suitability  to work with children. It is perfectly possible that such  behaviour would be considered by an employer in  deciding whether to dismiss the employee on grounds of  misconduct. That is perfectly well established in  employment law and practice, and I do not think that the  hon. Gentleman's example raises a substantive concern  for the Committee.  
<P>
We feel confident in recommending the amendment to  the Committee.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I thank the Minister for his comments  and my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge for  agreeing to accept the amendment.  
<P>
Amendment agree to.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be useful to the Committee if  I explain that the amendments that are consequential to  the Committee's decision will be called when we consider  the relevant provisions of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 20, after `of', insert `serious'.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following  amendments:  
<P>
No. 14, in page 2, line 38, after second `of', insert  `serious'.  
<P>
No. 18, in page 3, line 10, after `of', insert `serious'.  
<P>
No. 22, in clause 3, page 3, line 34, after second `or',  insert `serious'.  
<P>
No. 27, in clause 4, page 3, line 47, after `of', insert  `serious'.  
<P>
No. 60, in clause 4, page 4, line 6, after `of' insert  `serious'.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Bennett:</B> I have some difficulty because I am not  sure of the consequences of removing "incompetence" . I  do not know whether I need to press the matter further  because the major issue has been tackled. The definition  of "serious"  has already been discussed. Therefore, I do  not want to take up too much of the Committee's time on  the amendment.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's  confusion in view of the acceptance of amendment No. 2.  However, amendment No. 3 still has merit.  
<P>
Inclusion in the register is serious and will carry a  stigma. That should not be trivialised. When we consider  the measure, we are discussing serious harm to children.  The examples that have been given are invariably of  serious harm.  
<P>
A person who is in charge of children may be guilty of  misconduct if he acquiesces in illegal, under-age  consumption of alcohol. That misconduct may cause a  statutory authority to dismiss the person, regardless of the  seriousness of the consequence. However, when  considering inclusion in the list, there is a difference  between acquiescing in a child's illegal consumption of a  glass of wine and agreeing to or organising an all-night  vodka drinking party in which people pass out and regain  consciousness 12 or 16 hours later. The latter poses a  serious risk to children's welfare. [Interruption.] The hon.  Member for Taunton comments from a sedentary position.  The example was suggested to me by an article that I read  in a Sunday newspaper about alleged drinking in a well  known and expensive public school.  
<P>
The Bill should provide for a test of serious harm, not  of minimal risk. We all accept that drinking any alcohol  could put a 15-year-old child at some risk, but I would  not feel comfortable about including someone on the list  when the risk to the child as minimal. Therefore, I urge  the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish to press the  amendment, and other members of the Committee to  support it.  
<P>
There is also a tactical argument. Including the word  "serious"  in the Bill would tackle some of the objections  that were made on Second Reading.  
<P>
However, if the amendment is accepted there will be a  technical defect in the Bill. I readily acknowledge that I  shall be chastised by the hon. Member for Denton and  Reddish for not having tackled the problem by tabling a  further amendment. However, there may be such an  opportunity on Report. The defect is that the word  "serious"  would be inserted before the word "harm"  and  the clause would state:     
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"misconduct...which seriously harmed a child or placed a child at  risk of serious harm" .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
If the child had merely been placed at risk, it would have  to be risk of serious harm. If the child had actually been  harmed, the seriousness test would not apply. To make it  consistent, it would therefore be necessary to insert the  word "seriously"  before harm, so that the clause would  state:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"misconduct...which seriously harmed a child or placed a child at  risk of serious harm" .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I hear intakes of breath; perhaps I am proposing  something that would have a greater consequence that I  realise, but it would be necessary merely to ensure   consistency. The form of words appears several times in  the Bill, and a consequential amendment would have to  be considered on Report. I hope that the hon. Member for  Denton and Reddish will press the amendment and that  the Committee will support it.

<P>

<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I urge my hon. Friend the Member for  Denton and Reddish to withdraw the amendment, as I  cannot accept it in the light of accepting my hon. Friend's  previous amendment, which has serious consequences for  the Bill's direction and focus. It is worth bearing in mind  the definition of harm in the Children Act 1989. The Bill  should remain robust and strong   
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> This is rather a mean intervention, but I  ask my hon. Friend to read out the definition of harm in  the Children Act 1989.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I should be delighted to do so. It is an  important definition, and well worth remembering. The  Children Act 1989 defines harm as  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ill treatment or the impairment of health or development;  `development' means physical, intellectual, emotional, social or  behavioural development;  
<P>
`health' means physical or mental health; and  
<P>
`ill treatment' includes sexual abuse and forms of ill treatment which  are not physical."   <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I trust that my hon. Friend has finished  her response. Reading out the words in the Act clarified  the issue. I have slight reservations because it is better for  words to be in the legislation. I shall consider tabling a  further amendment to include the definition in the Bill  rather than being referred to another Act, which is  unhelpful. However, as I can see from their faces that  some Opposition members of the Committee want to vote  on the amendment, I shall not withdraw it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> May I add one or two comments to this  important debate? We risk losing sight of the main  features of the Bill and of how someone may end up being  permanently included on the list. An employer may be  satisfied that an employee has committed an act of  misconduct that places, or has placed, a child at risk of  harm as defined in the Children Act 1989. The Secretary  of State must then be satisfied that that person is  unsuitable to work with children. I understand the  anxieties expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for  Denton and Reddish and others, but we must consider the  Bill as a whole. Tests must be complied with before a  person's name is put on the list permanently, and the  Secretary of State must be satisfied that that person is a  risk to children. That should reassure my hon. Friend the  Member for Denton and Reddish about the strength and  quality of the Bill and overcome some of his concerns.  My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge is therefore  right to resist the amendment, which is an unnecessary  addition to the Bill: it already contains robust safeguards.     
<P>
On a wider note, the hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge repeatedly referred to tactics. However, it is  important for the Committee not to confuse tactics and  principles. Our job is to report back to the House the best   Bill possible based on the principles that govern our  deliberations and our fundamental principle is how best  to protect children. That is what should inform our debate,  not an individual's perception of the best tactics.  
<P>
We want the best possible legislation; I am sure that  my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge will deliver  that. I have tried to reassure my hon. Friend the Member  for Denton and Reddish about the architecture of the Bill  and the safeguards built into it. As I said, my hon. Friend  the Member for Stourbridge is right to resist the  amendment and to ask my hon. Friend the Member for  Denton and Reddish to withdraw it.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subject to the proceedings of any tribunal under section 4 below,'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment  No. 59, in Clause 4, page 3, line 40, after `list;', insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) a referral made to the Secretary of State under section 2(2)(b)  above'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> As has been said, reference to the  Secretary of State and inclusion on the list will have  profound consequences for an individual. It is therefore  essential to ensure that people are referred correctly,  not maliciously. I am particularly concerned about  subsection (2)(b), which deals with circumstances in  which individuals have resigned or retired from a post.  The organisation can say that if those individuals had  not done so, it would have considered dismissing them.  However, that test for inclusion on the list is set too  low.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge will argue that, in  some cases where individuals are known to have or  thought to have abused or harmed a child, the organisation  would prefer them to go quietly than to make a fuss and  draw attention to the institution. Thus a deal may be done.  The person quietly resigns and may then find work  somewhere else where he can continue to abuse children.  I accept that the hon. Lady wants to prevent that from  happening; so do I.  
<P>
However, I am worried that entry on the list, albeit  provisional at first, is not for a defined period of time,  after which a tribunal would have to be held if an appeal  is lodged. There are amendments seeking to limit the time  that a person can be on the list before a tribunal must hear   the matter. In the meantime, that person cannot work in  any child care organisation, which may be the only  profession in which he has experience. The purpose of  amendment No. 58 is to make entry on the list subject to  the outcome of a tribunal process, so that the tribunal  would take place before, rather than after, a person had  been put on the list. That would apply in circumstances  where an employer referred the person for inclusion on  the list for the sole reason that he would have been  dismissed if he had not resigned. Amendment No. 59 is a  linking amendment, consequential on amendment No. 58.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree with the hon. Lady that  clause 2(2)(b) is unsatisfactory. Later amendments will  address that. However, with great respect to her, I do  not believe that her proposal would do what she thinks  it would do. It does not put the tribunal into the  proceedings at an early stage, as she has suggested.  Clause 4 to which amendment No. 59 pertains does  not deal with appeals against a referral by an employer,  as does clause 2(2). It deals with appeals against a  decision by the Secretary of State to place a person on  the list. An employer will determine that a person  would have been dismissed had he not resigned, and  will refer his name to the Secretary of State, who will  then look at the facts and consider whether to include  him on the list. If he is to be included, that person  would then have a right of appeal to the tribunal.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am listening carefully to what my hon.  Friend says, but I am not quite in agreement with him.  
<P>
Although the hon. Member for Taunton referred to  amendment No. 59 as consequential on amendment No. 58,  that is not really the case. In effect, amendment No. 58 is  consequential on amendment No. 59. Amendment No. 59  gives an individual the right to go to a tribunal to appeal  against a referral to the Secretary of State, rather than  against a decision by the Secretary of State. I do not  necessarily agree with the hon. Lady, but we shall come to  that later.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for drawing  my attention to that point. It is always useful to be in  Committee with him, because he has an eye for detail that  I do not always possess.  
<P>
Clause 2 deals with the grounds on which an employer  may make a referral to the Secretary of State. It seems to  come at a later stage in the chronology for the Secretary  of State to determine whether the person should be  included on the list, and for that person then to appeal.  Before my hon. Friend intervened, I was making the point  that this is not an appropriate place to do what the hon.  Member for Taunton seeks to do. There are better ways  to deal with the problem that she has identified, and we  shall have an opportunity to do so when we consider other  amendments later.     
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> It may be worth pointing out to the hon.  Member for Taunton something of the structure of how a  person gets on to the list, and what happens from there.  
<P>
An employer takes action against an employee on any  of the four grounds itemised in the Bill dismissal,  retirement, transfer and suspension on the basis of an   individual having harmed, or there having been a risk of  harm. Only if any of those criteria are met can a name be  put forward. An appeal and tribunal procedure would  follow. It is important that those steps stay as they are,  because the ultimate sanction is the independent tribunal  system. This must work properly and smoothly.  
<P>
In my view, the proper role of a tribunal is to determine  appeals against decisions by the Secretary of State. The  Bill provides for this.  
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for  Stourbridge rather than the hon. Member for Taunton, for two reasons. The first is that the hon. Member for  Stourbridge was right to say that the role of the tribunal is  consistent throughout the structure the architecture, as the  Minister described it of the Bill: the tribunal is there to  review decisions made by the Secretary of State.  
<P>
The second is that the hon. Member for Taunton is  attempting in her amendment to make the referral of a  person to the Secretary of State a substantive event in  itself which ought to be able to be reviewed by the  tribunal. But it is obviously the Secretary of State's role  to reach a decision on the merits or otherwise of a referral,  and it does not automatically follow that it will lead to  inclusion in the list.  
<P>
There is a further reason. My hon. Friend the Member  for Runnymede and Weybridge, who underestimates  himself I have been a member of a Committee with him  and have seen him reach detail that I have not even  attempted has noticed that amendment No. 59 is  defective in that, were it to add referral to the Secretary  of State to the circumstances in which an appeal to a  tribunal could be undertaken, an internal contradiction in  the structure of clause 4 would be created. Clause 4(1)  states that only  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an individual who is included otherwise than provisionally in the  list kept by the Secretary of State...may appeal"   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
to the tribunal. If the phrase "otherwise than  provisionally"  were replaced, amendment No. 59 might  be viable. It is defective because the provisional listing  is not the basis upon which an appeal can be made to  the tribunal.

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> It must be obvious that I am not a  lawyer, but perhaps this place has enough of them.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Stourbridge pointed out that there  were four reasons for an individual getting on to the list.  I felt that one of them was less of a hurdle than the other  three. When a person is put on the list and decides to  appeal, we have no idea how long he must wait for the  appeal date and the tribunal's decision. Most of us do a  great deal of case work for constituents who appeal to  tribunals for different reasons, and we know that a long  time can elapse before a tribunal hears an appeal. While  a person on this list awaits the tribunal's decision, he wil  be denied an opportunity to work in the profession that  he may have practised for years.  
<P>
The hurdle in clause 2(b) is less difficult: it is much  more serious for an employer to dismiss an employee,  transfer him to another job or suspend him than to say,   when he has left his job, "If he had not left of his own  accord, I would have got rid of him anyway."  Having to  refer an employer to the Secretary of State is not a strict  test for an employer to have to pass. What I tried to  achieve with my allegedly faulty amendment was to say  that if a person was referred on those grounds the tribunal  process could begin immediately instead of the Secretary  of State putting his name on the list, allowing him to  appeal, and the person having to wait for the tribunal to  decide whether his entry on the list was justified. As I  said, I am not a lawyer and if, as everyone says, the  amendments are defective, it would not be clever to press  them to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment.  
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
(e) that the individual has resigned or retired and, in a period  not exceeding five years from the date of that resignation  or retirement, information has come to light such that the  organisation would have dismissed him, or would have  considered dismissing him, on such grounds had he not  resigned or retired." .  <P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or would have considered dismissing him.'.     <P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I have just considered picking up the  bottle that is in front of me and smashing it over the head  of my hon. Friend the Minister.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That would be serious  misconduct.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I was wondering whether you would  make a judgment on such action, Mr. Wells. Actually, I  was hoping that you would remain quiet and judge  whether it was likely that I would so that.  
<P>
Under the clause, an organisation has to refer someone  for inclusion on the list after it has considered the matter.  It is not a matter of whether there is a likelihood of such  action happening, but of whether dismissal had passed  through the organisation's mind. For example, I  considered using the bottle, but I had quickly dismissed it  from my mind before you called me to order, Mr. Wells.  One must judge whether my using it was a real possibility.  That is the problem with the provision. It is not a question  of whether the organisation thought that the person should  have been dismissed, but whether it would have  considered dismissing that person.  
<P>
If the tribunal were judging whether an organisation  had considered dismissing someone, it would consider the  evidence. Under the Bill, as soon as the procedure is set  up, the trigger mechanism would be activated and the  organisation would have to make a referral. I accept that,  at the end of the process, the Secretary of State may make  a judgment and further down the line, in respect of the   permanent list, the tribunal will have the opportunity to  make a recommendation. It is dangerous to say that a  referral can be made if an organisation has merely  considered dismissing that person without it having to  qualify how seriously it thought about it. Such a provision  would be unsatisfactory.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the Bill's  current wording? The clause is trying to cover cases of  employees who resign or retire before the employer has  had the opportunity to consider dismissing them. If my  hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, such cases could  not be referred to the Secretary of State. The employee  who resigns quickly before the employer has had the  opportunity to consider dismissing him could bypass the  Bill and continue to work with children even though he  was unsuitable.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That is not correct. The clause states:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The individual has resigned or retired in circumstances such that  the organisation would have dismissed him" .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That covers the point made by my hon. friend the  Under-Secretary. If the grounds were such that the  organisation was considering dismissing that person it  was somewhere between a remote possibility and a mere  certainty the clause would be reasonable. But leaving  the grounds so vague, and requiring merely that the idea  had gone through the mind of the organisation that such  action might be appropriate, is not the best way in which  to draft the provision.  
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman as concerned as  I am that it will be unlawful for an employer not to refer  someone to the list? An employer may err on the side of  caution if it has passed through is mind that he might  dismiss a person, as it passed through the mind of the hon.  Gentleman to pick up the bottle. The employer may think  that he has a legal obligation to refer that person.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That is the way I read the provision. I  am willing to admit that I am no lawyer. I should be  pleased to hear from the lawyers on the Conservative  Benches and from my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge.     
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): Surely a member  of an organisation would have to make a complaint. I  believe that the hon. Gentleman is right: an organisation  should not be asked to consider something if it was not  involved in the dismissal.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am worried about the wording of  subsection (2)(b). The best thing that I can do so that  the proceedings are not prolonged is to listen to my hon.  Friend's response.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon.  Gentleman. I agree that it is absolutely essential to retain  the phrase "would have dismissed" . Such matters came  sharply into focus during the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.  Many people think that there is something wrong with a  system that allows people to escape disciplinary  proceedings by resigning just before they are begun.   However, we are talking about a much weaker test,  involving the use of the phrase "would have considered  dismissing him" .  
<P>
Notwithstanding what the Minister has said, the issue  is clear. An organisation faced with someone who resigns  in circumstances that are relevant to the Bill will have to  ask itself whether it would have dismissed that person.  The organisation might have to undertake its normal  disciplinary procedure against that person, in absentia.  That procedure might have led to the dismissal of that  person if he had not chosen to resign. The organisation  must decide whether it honestly believes that it would  have dismissed him if it would have done so, it must  report that fact to the Secretary of State. It is not  unreasonable to ask an employer to undertake that  procedure and decide definitively whether or not it would  have dismissed the person. It is not sufficient to determine  that it would have considered dimissing him, which means  almost nothing at all.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I have been involved with local authorities  that have undertaken such procedures. The individual has  the right to have his say or to be represented. Indeed, there  are often appeals. If an individual resigns, goes abroad or  does not co-operate with an organisation that wants to  undertake those procedures, there will be no natural justice  because the individual will not be questioned and will not  give evidence. How will that problem be overcome?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree that difficulties would arise if  an individual did not co-operate. However, it would not  be impossible for employers to review the facts and reach  a reasonable decision as to whether they believed that, on  the balance of the evidence available, they would have  dismissed the employee. I strongly suspect that, under the  Bill as drafted, the Secretary of State will assess the  available evidence and decide for himself whether it is  likely that the person would have been dismissed if they  had not resigned. The practical difficulty mentioned by  my hon. Friend the Member for Poole is not insuperable.  
<P>
Unfortunately, having argued eloquently for the  deletion of the term "would have considered dismissing  him" , the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish has  inadvertently included that phrase in amendment No. 38.  Although he wants to delete it from subsection (2)(b), he  is trying to include it in what would be subsection (2)(e).  I am sure that that is not what he wants to do. I suggest  that, if we do not get that far today, it might be appropriate  for him to withdraw that amendment and submit it in  redrafted form. The amendment would have a great deal  to commend it if the reference to an employer who "would  have considered dismissing"  were removed.     
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I feel strongly that I cannot accept the  amendment. There are countless examples of abusers  slipping away and moving on to other places because  somebody has started to uncover them but has not been  able to continue with that procedure. I feel passionately  that the amendment would keep open a loophole that is  being cruelly exploited.

<P>

<B>  Jackie Ballard:</B> Will the hon. Lady help the Committee  by explaining what to her mind is the difference between  "would have dismissed"  someone the situation that I  think that she was describing and "would have  considered dismissing"  someone?  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and  Weybridge made many points that I would have made. I  accept that there appears to be a fine definition, but we  have to allow employers to report people whom they  consider on the balance of probability to be abusers.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I do not think that any members of  the Committee are arguing against that. Will the hon.  Lady accept that the Bill as drafted does not merely permit  employers to report someone who on the balance of  probability is an abuser, but requires them to report  someone whom they would have considered dismissing?  If an incident had occurred prior to the resignation that,  under the normal disciplinary procedures of employers,  would have had to give rise to such consideration, that  resignation would have to be reported even if it was  apparent to employers that they would not then have gone  on to dismiss the person.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that  it is a requirement. It is an important instrument for the  employer. Employers who are involved in child care must  be required to take responsibility. It is important to put  the onus on them to investigate in the way in which I  have outlined.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I agree with the hon. Lady entirely.  Will she not accept that we are arguing for that? Requiring  employers to go further and decide not merely that they  "would have considered dismissing" , but that, having  regard to the facts, the probably "would have dismissed"   is not too much to ask of them not too many hoops to  ask them to jump through if that will assist the  protection of children.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I am struggling with the semantics of  language.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Perhaps I can help my hon. Friend. We  are trying to ensure that this part of the Bill covers all the  scenarios that might arise in such cases. My hon. Friend  will agree that we want to ensure that the informing  organisation could refer someone to the Secretary of State  if it would consider dismissing that individual but had not  concluded whether it would be appropriate to do so, due  to the individual resigning or retiring. We need the dual  wording of "would have dismissed"  and "would have  considered dismissing"  because an employee might have  retired before the first of the two conclusions had been  reached.     
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the  Minister for that intervention. I wish that he had gone on  a bit longer because I need more time to think things  through. Every member of the Committee is engaged in  the same endeavour and wants to reach the same end  point. We must also bear in mind the threshold of harm  as defined in the Children Act 1989.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Syms:</B> I raised with my hon. Friend the Member  for Runnymede and Weybridge the point about going  through the procedures and perhaps not having the  co-operation of the individual involved. However, is there  not a slight risk that we shall give too much power to  some employers? Malicious employers exist, and trade  unions sometimes have good reasons for representing  employees at appeals. A Conservative councillor  persuaded me of the contribution that trade unions can  make for employees.  
<P>
It might not be appropriate now, but we must consider  such issues carefully. In some private organisations there  may be disputes over money or other matters. It is very  easy to pick on an individual. We hear much about the  bullying of employees these days, and the provisions of  the clause could be thrown into a dispute over money.  
<P>
<B>Ms Shipley:</B> It was always my intention that the Bill  should have sufficient checks and balances so that the  rights of individuals are met. The process of provisionally  listing or finally listing someone will involve appeals and  tribunals that will adequately resolve the hon.  Gentleman's fear.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am trying to follow the circumstances  that the Minister and the hon. Lady mentioned. As I  understand it, we must consider subsection 2(b) along  with 2(d), and we must realise that several sets of  circumstances apply.  
<P>
An event might come to light that leads an employer to  conclude that one of his employees has abused children.  In such a case, the employer's responsibility will be to  suspend that person pending an inquiry, and the  provisions of subsection 2(d) will apply.  
<P>
Subsection 2(b) contains the phrase  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would have considered dismissing him" .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That will relate to circumstances in which an employer  discovers that an event occurred that would have forced  him to consider dismissing someone who had already  resigned or left the employment. That is different from  the test in subsection 2(a).  
<P>
If the Minister is seriously suggesting that the proper  test of whether someone should be notified is not whether  he has been dismissed, suspended or transferred to a  non-child-care position but whether his employer has  considered such eventualities, that should be made clear  in subsection 2(a). It should not appear in subsection 2(b)  or deal with circumstances in which someone resigns and  the employer asks himself, "Given that we now know  what this person did, would we have considered  dismissing him?"  The answer may be yes in many cases.  One test appears in subsection 2(a) and the consequential  test in subsection 2(b) should relate to the question  whether the employer would have dismissed that person.     
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said, it may  be difficult to get compliance when someone has moved  on. However, an employer might consider the evidence  available to him and conclude that he would have  dismissed a person on the basis of that. If so, there should  be no bar on the employer notifying the Secretary of State  of that person. However, that person should have the right  to provide information to the Secretary of State or to  appeal if he thinks that the notification is unjustified.  
<P>
<B>  Mr. Bennett:</B> I am looking at the clock and see that  seven minutes of our sitting remain. The Committee is in  some difficulty, and I would like to persuade my hon.  Friend the Member for Stourbridge to reconsider. If the  matter is not resolved before 1 o'clock, we could table  another amendment for the next week and my hon. Friend  could come up with an alternative proposal. I hope that  the Committee will bear that possibility in mind and that  you, Mr. Wells will think about when we should adjourn.  
<P>
We must be absolutely clear that the clause does not  allow for choice. That is what worries me. Subsection (1)  says:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A child care organisation shall,"    
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
that is not discretionary   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and any other organisation may, refer to the Secretary of State an  individual who is or has been employed in a child care position if  any of the following conditions is fulfilled."   <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The conditions are listed in subsection (2). We can forget  about paragraph (a), and go straight to paragraph (b),  which says:  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the individual has resigned or retired in circumstances such  that the organisation would have dismissed him" .  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That covers the point made by my hon. Friend the  Member for Stourbridge  
<P>
I believe passionately that people should not be able to  take the easy option, slip away simply by resigning, and  then disappear. Such people usually reappear, and  continue to offend somewhere else.  
<P>
Paragraph (b) adds to the condition,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that the individual has resigned or retired in circumstances such  that the organisation would have dismissed him" ,  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
the further condition that the organisation  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would have considered dismissing him" .     
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
That is where judgment comes in and not only a judgment  whether there was sufficient evidence to take action. The  very fact that the organisation considered taking action,  triggers the mechanism. That alarms me, because it means  that discretion will have to be exercised, first by the  Secretary of State and then, if necessary, by the tribunal.  
<P>
The tribunal will be at a considerable distance   
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that  the test of whether one has considered something is  difficult to apply to an organisation? Does it mean, "Has  any person in the organisation any of the managers or  other responsible people there at any time considered  that they might have dismissed the person in question?"   Is that a fair test to apply?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I do not think that it is. When a person  resigns or retires early from an organisation, and someone  then says, "Something has happened, and we are not  happy about it,"  any responsible organisation has to start  considering whether it would have considered dismissing  that individual. Once it starts to exercise that judgment by  going through the process, it is not left with much of what  I understand by the word discretion. I am not a lawyer,  and any hon. Member here who is a lawyer may be able to  tell me better, but it seems to me that there is an absolute  requirement for a child care organisation to do that,  without necessarily having made a judgment.  
<P>
<B>  Jackie Ballard:</B> None of us is a lawyer.  
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman think that under that provision,  if someone resigned and moved on to work in another child  care post for a couple of years, and then a problem in the  original organisation put some doubt in the employer's  mind along the lines of, "Oh, if I had known that, I might  have thought of sacking that man,"  the organisation would  then have to the word is not "may"  or "can" , but "shall"   refer that person to the Secretary of State for inclusion on  the list? At that point, they would have to be removed from  the job in which they were then working. That is my  interpretation, and if it is correct, the test seems unfair.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Yes, that is how I interpret the process.  We should give a little more thought to it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that  although the Minister's intervention was helpful in  clarifying the Government's thinking, the point that he  raised could be better addressed by introducing the test of  whether someone would have been suspended, rather than  a test involving a judgment whether something would  have been considered? That would at least be a concrete  test. 
<P>
I understand what the Minister said about wanting to  avoid a gap between a person's resignation and the  exhaustion of the process through which they would be  included on the list a gap in which they might do harm  elsewhere. As paragraph (d) already uses the concept of  suspension, we should make use of that concept, which is  appropriate here, and ask whether a person would have  been suspended. Does the hon. Gentleman agree? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That is a helpful suggestion. I do not  know whether my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge will tell the Committee whether she is  prepared to consider the idea, but I sense that in the  Committee there are hon. Members who  
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Everyone else seems to be interrupting  my hon. Friend, so I shall do the same. As I tried to say  earlier in support of my hon. Friend the Member for  Stourbridge, my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and  Reddish is reading more into the clause than is there. He  has every right to do so, but I think that he is wrong. 
<P>
We are trying to ensure that a person cannot retire or  resign before the employer comes to a decision  [Interruption.] That situation is not covered by the first  part of the provision.
