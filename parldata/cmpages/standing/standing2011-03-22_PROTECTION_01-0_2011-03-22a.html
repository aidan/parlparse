                           </strong> Good morning, everybody. Before we begin, I have a
few preliminary announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their
jackets during Committee proceedings. Will all Members please ensure
that mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned off or switched to
silent mode during Committee sittings? As a general rule, my fellow
Chair and I do not intend to call starred amendments that have not been
tabled with adequate notice. The required notice period for Public Bill
Committees is three working days, so amendments should be tabled by the
rise of the House on Monday for consideration on Thursday, and by the
rise of the House on Thursday for consideration on Tuesday. The
deadline for the Tuesday sitting immediately following the Easter
recess will be 4.30 pm on Tuesday 19 April. The deadline is a full week
due to the Easter public holiday. The deadline for tabling amendments
for the sittings on Thursday 28 April and Tuesday 3 May are also
affected by public holidays and will also be a full week before the
sitting. There is a money resolution in connection with the Bill and
copies are available in the
room.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000014">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees, so it might help if I explain briefly how we will
proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an
hour. The Minister has tabled an amendment because an organisation is
unable to field a witness, so once he has moved the programme motion,
we will consider that amendment before we decide on the motion itself.
We will then proceed to a motion to report written evidence, and then a
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral evidence sessions. I hope that we can take that formally.
Assuming that the second of those motions is agreed to, the Committee
will move into private session, and at that stage I am afraid that I
will have to ask witnesses and members of the public to leave us for a
short while. You will then be invited back into the room and our oral
evidence session will begin. If the Committee agrees to the programme
motion, it will hear oral evidence this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000015">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Streeter,
as we consider the Protection of Freedoms Bill. It will also be a
pleasure to serve under your co-Chair, Mr Caton. I and my hon. Friend
the Minister for Equalities, who also has responsibility for criminal
information, look forward to detailed discussions on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 3<a class="bkMark" name="Column3">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the provisions. I am pleased to see some familiar faces on the
Opposition Benches, having served with them on the Police Reform and
Social Responsibility Bill Committee. I look forward to continuing the
healthy discussions on that Bill that are relevant to this Bill as
well. I look forward to constructive exchanges with each of the
Committee members on the Opposition Front Bench, as well as other
Opposition and Government members of the Committee, during our detailed
scrutiny of the legislation, which is a key part of the
Government’s agenda to rebalance freedoms and ensure that we
strike a proper, proportionate balance between the rights of the state
and the rights of the
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
believe that the programme motion provides more than adequate time to
enable proper scrutiny of this important Bill, which delivers a number
of our coalition commitments to restore freedoms and roll back
unnecessary state intrusion into people’s lives. Judging by the
contributions made on Second Reading, we can anticipate some lively
discussions about the retention of DNA and the vetting and barring
scheme. There are, however, many other important provisions, including
the regulation of CCTV, the prohibition of wheel clamping, stop and
search provisions relating to counter-terrorism and so on, which are
equally deserving of proper
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
we embark on clause-by-clause consideration of the Bill, the programme
motion provides for two days of oral evidence from 25 individuals and
organisations. Those witnesses will, I am sure, represent a range of
views and will help inform the Committee’s consideration of the
Bill. The Committee will notice an amendment in my name to the
programme resolution which, Mr Streeter, you have already made
reference to. Unfortunately, one of the proposed witnesses, the British
Security Industry Association, is now unable to attend to give
evidence. The amendment therefore removes the Association from the list
of witnesses. It would have been useful to have the opportunity to hear
its views on the Government’s proposals for the further
regulation of CCTV, but I very much hope that it will be able to submit
written evidence for us to
consider.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
deliberations on the Bill will also be added to by a new and
experimental innovation, the public reading stage. I am aware that
Members may not have received the report, which was intended to have
been received by them for this morning’s sitting, although it
was circulated yesterday. I am making urgent inquiries to ensure that
further copies can be submitted to the Committee. I would have
preferred that all Members had received the report in time for this
morning—that was our intention—but I hope that Members
will recognise that it is an innovative new approach seeking to engage
the public in the consideration of legislation. We have received over
500 comments on the Bill from members of the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000020">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to detain the Committee further; I know that there are lots
of witnesses for us to get through, and accordingly I invite the
Committee to agree the resolution, subject to my
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000021">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Streeter. If it is your pleasure, I shall stay seated. Good morning to
everyone on the Committee. It is very good to see that my legal brief
has come with me from the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill.
I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Northampton North 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>here; we are both raring to go. I thank the Minister for his
introduction to the Bill. As he says, there are some important matters
to be discussed; there is a balance between civil liberties and public
protection and where we draw the line on that will be a matter for
debate on a whole range of
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also grateful for the Minister’s comment about the public
reading stage. It is somewhat regrettable that we have not seen the
report—certainly, I have not seen it; that may be my fault, but
it has certainly come in very late. I appreciate that this is a pilot,
but the deadline for comments was, I think, 7 March and it has been a
couple of weeks since then. If we are to scrutinise the Bill, the
evidence sessions are very helpful; we have expert witnesses coming to
give us all their thoughts and views and professional opinion on the
whole range of issues before us and that certainly informs our debate
and adds significantly to it. Clearly, the whole point of the public
reading is to take into account the points of view of many people out
there who might not otherwise have the opportunity to comment. It would
have been interesting to have those points of view and it may have
informed one or two of the questions that we might have asked our
professional witnesses. I appreciate what the Minister has said and it
is important that we get those points of view as soon as we possibly
can.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
another matter, the generality of the programme motion is fine, but I
want to ask the Minister to explain to the
Committee why we are discussing clauses on stop and search in the Bill
when the Government have passed a remedial order that, in effect,
brings into law those very clauses. The Minister will know that the
whole area of guidance and law around stop and search has been somewhat
chaotic. In July last year, in response to the judgment of the European
Court of Human Rights, the Home Secretary announced interim guidance to
prevent the police using Section 44 stop-and-search
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am reluctant to interrupt, Mr Coaker, but would
you relate this to the programme

                           </strong> The programme motion has within it our discussions
of clauses 58 to 62. These clauses are amendments to the law with
respect to stop and search. The remedial order, which the Government
have published and which came into law on 18 March, in effect puts into
practice and into law the clauses before us in the Bill. I am trying to
ask, Mr Streeter, why we have clauses before us to discuss which the
Government have already, through the remedial order, put into
law?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Last July,
the Home Secretary published guidance which said that there should be
no reasonable suspicion; then there was the counter-terrorism review
which said that there may be some problem with that; then more guidance
was published, which came into effect on 6 March, which has
now been superseded by new guidance which came into effect on 18 March.
Surely, in the programme motion, the Minister needs to explain to the
Committee why we are discussing clauses which bring into law things
that are already in law because the Government passed a remedial order.
It is, frankly, chaotic and this is a serious part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
senior police officers with us who are receiving different guidance
about stop and search all the time. Three or four different codes of
practice, sets of guidance, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have been sent out to police about the operation of stop and search and
whether reasonable suspicion can or cannot be used. I want the
Minister, through you, Mr Streeter, to tell the Committee
why we are discussing these clauses. This prevention and suppression of
terrorism remedial order, the Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial)
Order 2011, was made on 16 March 2011, was laid before
Parliament on 17 March 2011 and came into force on 18 March 2011. Why
is it appropriate for us to include in this programme motion clauses
that are already law? Surely, this Committee, or Parliament, should
have had the opportunity to debate these clauses before they came into
law. What is the point of having clauses in a Bill that are already
law? Will the Minister respond to
that?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000028">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Gedling will, I am sure,
make a number of comments on the detailed consideration of the
provisions relating to counter-terrorism stop and search, as, I am
sure, he will on other issues, but the purpose of having the provisions
within the Bill is to provide the very scrutiny and analysis that he is
seeking of provisions to set out the long-term framework for ensuring
that the police have the powers that are required to protect the
public. I am sure he will wish to raise questions with relevant
witnesses that will appear before the Committee this morning, whether
from the Association of Chief Police Officers or the independent
reviewer of counter-terrorism, who will, I am sure, be able to answer
his questions on the necessity of those powers and, equally, the
necessity of having provisions in place to cover the period between now
and Royal Assent. That is why it is appropriate to have the provisions
in this legislation to allow consideration and scrutiny of what is an
important part of this legislation and to ensure that there is detailed
examination during the taking of evidence this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000030">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Unusually for the Minister, that is totally
inadequate. If the Government wanted a debate about laws on stop and
search, they could have arranged for a debate on the Floor of the
House. This Committee is going to be asked to consider clauses on stop
and search that are already in law. I suggest that that is not the way
to conduct business on something as serious as this. Parliament, or
even this Committee, should have had the opportunity to debate it,
whatever the rights and wrongs of the remedial order before us. If the
Minister thinks that there is a problem because there is a gap in the
guidance between 6 March and 18 March, then there should have been the
opportunity to debate it on the Floor of the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000031">&#160;</a>

Sims:</strong>
                           </em> Let me start by saying that I picked up very
early in your deliberations the notion of balancing civil liberty with
security. ACPO utterly understands the importance of achieving that
balance. We have always regarded that central question as being a
political deliberation rather than a police service deliberation and I
still see it very much in those terms. ACPO has worked with successive
Governments and we felt that the Crime and Security Act 2010
represented a fair balance and was evidence-led, in that there was a
body of research around how that measure would play out in protecting
the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposal before the Committee today seems to me to draw its authority
from the Scottish model, which does not appear to be evidence-led in
the way it has been constructed. I am concerned that there has been a
lot of rhetoric about the removal of innocent parties, which implies
that the database is primarily a punishment, rather than a mechanism
for public protection, which is how ACPO has always regarded it.
Addressing your specific question, there has been some suggestion that
the proposal will make no difference to the level of protection
offered. From our work—it is notoriously difficult to put
figures on this—there would be a loss of about 1,000 matches per
year by the proposed changes; so on 1,000 occasions that a match would
have been reported to us under the current rules, that match would be
lost under the changes taking place. It is impossible to predict the
offence types on those 1,000 occasions. There would be a mixture of
serious and less serious
offences.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the things that we have repeatedly spoken to Governments about is
the need to minimise the cost, the bureaucracy and the risk associated
with inputting and deletion. We have always said that the safest way to
do that is to ensure that any proposal can be automated—that it
can operate, in effect, from algorithms buried within the police
national computer. In the way it is drawn up, this measure is far more
complicated. So for any single decision there are at least 13 different
outcomes, which makes it much harder to

We then made some judgments on whether and how long DNA profiles should
be retained on the DNA database to minimise the risk. A certain amount
of data were published during that Act’s progression through
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000078">&#160;</a>

the national DNA database. We have always argued that it is impossible
to create a regime of individual intervention for a database of 6
million. We have to make decisions based on automation. In effect, the
Scottish model has to rely on a judgment being made
against an individual profile when it reaches three years.
That system is very difficult to apply other than in exceptional
circumstances. We have been clear from the start that we would envisage
extending from three years to five years only in exceptional
circumstances in which the case is of such prominence that it comes to
light for other reasons and a decision can be made about
application.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000083">&#160;</a>

interested to hear you saying that the current system for DNA retention

application for DNA retention, but I am sure ACPO is aware that there
is something of a postcode lottery at the moment with DNA retention.
Some forces are refusing to remove DNA after a case is closed, and
others are accepting it routinely. Could you explain that inconsistency
if there is such an evidence base? Do you think it is an acceptable

colleagues across the country have been placed in a really difficult

a parliamentary lead to inform us of the way we should be making such
discretionary judgments. I really welcome the fact that the measures
before you contain the codification of how that judgment should be
made. The so-called postcode lottery has come about because we have
waited for a number of years now for the S. and Marper issue to be
resolved. The legislation that was passed last summer has not been
enacted, and we are back here speaking to you again. The enactment of
this legislation will resolve that issue.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000085">&#160;</a>

need more than simply DNA evidence?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000088">&#160;</a>

being done on the 1,000 matches that will be lost if the measures in
the Bill are enacted? Is there any indication of what proportion of
those would be serious as opposed to less serious offences? Secondly,

has committed an offence; has any work been done on the number of
people who have managed to demonstrate their innocence as a consequence
of DNA matches, and is there any reflection of that in the

on the detail. We have been looking at the latest proposal and testing
it against the matches that the database has thrown up during the
defined period, and asking whether those matches would have occurred if
the rules now before you had been applied. It is much too small a
sample to draw conclusions about the mix of cases, other than
understanding that the mix of cases is never determined by the previous
offence; it is determined by behaviour afterwards, so it is likely to
be a fairly random mix. Regarding the really important category you
describe about proving innocence, the sample size is too small at the
moment to make judgments.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000093">&#160;</a>

previously, because there is a significant number of matches from that
group—that is clearly the heart of the debate around striking
the right balance in terms of retaining DNA of those arrested but not
convicted—I do not have the figures of the cost of that
particular group. Clearly, we derive from those significant matches

we call a speculative search on everybody who has been arrested. That
is different from the Scottish model. In very famous cases, such as the
Bowman case, the conviction came about as a result of speculative
search. There are costs associated with change. About £80
million has been estimated in costs associated with producing the
change, and an ongoing £2.9 million with the

Sims:</strong>
                           </em> You are right, the £80 million is
principally about the costs involved in disposing of the samples that
are held. I do not think that there is any controversy from our side
that it is the right time to be disposing of the samples that have been
in existence since the start of the database. That is a one-off cost
that must be borne. Deletion, we understand, is about deleting from the
main biometric databases—fingerprint and DNA—and the
associated records that go with it. If you go further into defining
deletion, and you get into a level that involves the case material held
by suppliers, for example—and there are other
pieces—there are two issues. One is that the costs involved go
up at a hugely alarming rate, because it would require people to comb
through literally filing cases full of material to make the deletion.
More importantly, there is a direct conflict between other legislation
in terms of disclosure and fairness of trial, which I know is
exercising Ministers to work a correct path through. For the purposes
of the Bill, our understanding is about deletion in terms of the
database and its immediate ancillary information.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000113">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I want to add to the point about batches. In
the national DNA database, the DNA profiles are a string of 20 numbers
and that is what the database stores. Those 20 numbers are derived from
an analytical process in which samples are analysed by forensic science
providers. They are analysed in batches, so within that batch it holds
all the raw data. What is actually contained,

			Column number: 13<a class="bkMark" name="Column13">&#160;</a>
                           </div>I think, within one of the provisions of the Bill, is the notion that if
we remove the demographic and personal information from that raw data,
then it ceases to have any impact in data protection law, for example.
We have been in close discussion with the Information Commissioner, who
sits as an observer on the strategy board, to work through what are the
most effective processes in terms of how we meet the requirements of
the Data Protection Act 1998, recognising that that batch process may
contain a profile that is deleted, as well as other profiles that are
retained. We hope in the future to programme in more sophisticated ways
of doing that. Certainly, as an immediate precaution, what I have done
is remove from the forensic science providers all of the demographic
data that relate to deleted profiles. So, we have taken steps to
protect the privacy of individuals who have been
deleted.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000114">&#160;</a>

justice system, but you said that 20% of those held on the DNA system
are not convicted. Do you not think it is appropriate that we should be

someone comes into custody—is arrested—a sample of DNA
and fingerprints are taken and that sample is run against the database
of crime-scene stains. From those searches, matches are obtained
between outstanding crimes and people who may not have come into
custody before. As part of the proposal, in certain circumstances, the
sample will be taken onto the database. In other circumstances, the
sample will be destroyed after the speculative search. That has proven
to be a very important protection and it has been built into the
legislation that you are considering.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000133">&#160;</a>

Pugh:</strong>
                           </em> It is the distinction between search and
retention of DNA profiles. Therefore, when an individual is arrested
and the database is searched and the database contains the DNA from all
the unsolved crimes that we have obtained a profile from, we are
effectively revealing any matches to crimes committed by that
individual in the past. That is very powerful. Chris mentioned the
Sally Anne Bowman case as an example. There have been many high-profile
cases in which an individual arrested for a relatively minor offence
has connected to a very serious offence, a rape or a murder. Hence, I
echo Mr Sims’s comment that the ability to speculatively search
every individual who is arrested provides a very important tool in
detecting
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000135">&#160;</a>

out routinely of the DNA database. In the past, all DNA has been
retained on the database, so, in a sense, you have been collecting it.

of—and someone may be in a cell for 24 hours. Do you think that

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Streeter. Deputy Chief Constable
Gerrard, there is a proposal in the Bill for increased regulation of
surveillance cameras, and I would like to know whether you see a need
for that, and what your views are generally. It is also a recognised
fact that we will have a code of practice for the development and use
of surveillance cameras in the provisions of the Bill. What are your
views on that, and on the appointment of a surveillance camera
commissioner?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000149">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In 2007, ACPO and the Home Office jointly
produced a national CCTV strategy. In that document, we asked for some
standards around images, the retention period for images, the quality
of images and ensuring that systems are fit for purpose. We also
requested some sort of framework for regulation and a sort of oversight
body for CCTV. So in principle, we are supportive of what is being
suggested. We are, however, slightly disappointed that it appears that
the police and local authorities, certainly in the initial stages, are
the only agencies that will have to have regard to the surveillance
camera code. When we wrote the strategy, our concern was not, as you
will understand, about our use of CCTV; it was about the poor quality
of images that we were getting from agencies other than local
authorities and ourselves, where we can control the
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000150">&#160;</a>

Gerrard:</strong>
                           </em> Yes, it is our view that the provision
should go wider than the police service. The police service works very
closely with local authorities, in partnership, and in the main is very
pleased with the quality of the images that they provide to us.
However, the vast majority of images that we seize through the
evidential process are not from local authority systems or police
systems; they are from private
systems.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of figures, we recently published some data on how many cameras
we think there are in the UK. Instead of the 4.2 million that was often
cited, we now think that the figure is closer to 1.85 million. Of
those, only 29,700 are cameras operated by local authorities on the
streets—public space CCTV. The police service manages very
little public space CCTV. It is mostly in the hands of local
authorities. We operate some temporary or redeployable systems, and one
or two police forces operate town centre systems, but most of it is in
the hands of local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
codes of practice will not relate significantly to the police service
in terms of the operation of a system, because we do not operate many;
local authorities do. However, the measure also talks about the use and
processing of images. We use images from the systems and we process
images from everybody’s system when we convert that into
evidence. In that respect, the codes of practice will significantly
apply to
us.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000160">&#160;</a>

They have significant concerns that lumping ANPR camera technology in
with CCTV in the same codes of practice will cause us some significant
difficulties, because the technology is very different. The outcome is
very different and actually our use of ANPR is far more regulated,
albeit internally regulated, than the use of CCTV

this, and there is the Data Protection Act 1998 and so on. How do you

suggest. There is already a code of practice provided by the
Information Commissioner. There is an opportunity, I suspect, to have a
joint code of practice. This particular code of practice is far wider
than what the Information Commissioner has produced. Theirs relates
specifically to CCTV, not to camera systems and surveillance camera
systems, which, given the way the Bill has been written, could be
absolutely any camera if you are using it at the time for surveillance
purposes. Surveillance is not defined in the Bill, so I have used the
dictionary definition. I suspect it can be as wide or as narrow as the
authors of the codes of practice wish it to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000166">&#160;</a>

some bemusement that I read that the Minister is proposing setting up

Cabinet Office. Given where public policy is going on the privacy
space, would it not make your life simpler if all the new commissioners
who are supposed to be regulating the state’s intrusions into
people’s privacy were wrapped into one, so that we get a kind of
super-privacy commissioner who can deal with all aspects of this? You
would get a single point of contact, citizens would know where to go,
and we would not have the Government creating all sorts of waste by
recreating five different organisations that all need new

                           </strong> Mr Gerrard, how helpful would it be to the police
to have codes of practice that apply to the private sector, such as BP
garages? I shall give you

                           </div>an example. In one particular ward, 20% of police time is spent on
dealing with drive-outs and shoplifting at one BP petrol station. There
are black spots in the CCTV coverage, the images are often not of an
appropriate quality, and the police are actually required to go to the
petrol station to collect the material. That is a huge waste of police
resources. Do you think that a code of practice would be helpful in
ensuring that the police could deal more effectively with such
incidents?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000174">&#160;</a>

Gerrard:</strong>
                           </em> Yes, and I think that is the intention,
although initially it will be voluntary for agencies other than the
prescribed authorities. You are right; we spend an inordinate amount of
time looking for CCTV. Very often we do not know where it is. There is
no requirement for anybody with a camera to register the fact they have
a camera, even if they have put it in an area that covers public space,
so first of all, we have to go looking for CCTV. Having found it, we
have to determine whether it has captured the image. Very often we not
know that until we have seized the image, taken it back to the police
station and found some equipment on which to play it. Exporting the
images is not always easy. There are all sorts of different playback
systems. Having done all that, we then find that the quality of the
images is pretty awful or the camera was not switched on or not
pointing in the right direction, or the image is pretty poor quality.
The police service spends a lot of time and effort collecting CCTV, so
anything that drives up the standards of the quality of the image and
also gives us some indication of how long the images will be kept would
be helpful. For example, the codes of practice produced by the
Information Commissioner recommend keeping images for 30 days before
they are overwritten. Research in Cheshire indicated that at least 10%
are kept for less than three days. We do not know that at the time, so
image retention periods would be very helpful for us in terms of
knowing where the material is and how long we have to go and get
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000175">&#160;</a>

of CT investigations in relation to the emerging international aspects
and the proliferation of technologies in day-to-day life, such as
memory sticks, mobile phones and iPads. All those need searching. The
people who are using those technologies are also using encryption and

I think that, within seven days, there would be an emerging picture.
Whether it is complexity of technologies, outstanding forensic matters
or continuing international inquiries that emerge, the interesting
challenge that we need to ensure we consider is that at a crucial time
in what would clearly be an exceptional investigation, we would be
drawing investigative resource away—whether prosecutors and/or
police officers—to make sure that the bid for an exceptional
case was made. We would face a range of challenges, but I would suspect
that within seven days, there would be an emerging picture of what the

Brake just asked. Are you in discussions with the Home Office about
that? If 60% of cases are resolved in the first seven days, that leaves
40% going on between seven or 14 days. Correct me if I am
wrong. The process that operates between you in counter-terrorism and
the Home Office will be needed in relation to the early identification
of an individual within that 40% who might require additional
detention. Clearly, it would be difficult to get people together on a

reasonable suspicion. Then there were the guidelines that came into

clauses of the Bill. Those guidelines came into force on 18 March and
do not require reasonable suspicion. Have you been in discussion with

incredibly difficult, and the events at Glasgow airport have shown
that. The section 43 requirement is one that we can use when suspicion
takes place in the environs of an airport. It has previously been at
Heathrow and transport hubs that the majority of these section 44
searches have taken place. We have noticed that there is an uplift now
in section 43 searches, but that is absolutely right as long as the
grounds are properly set out. But there are provisions in the
legislation for us to provide safeguards to
airports.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000195">&#160;</a>

by Disclosure Scotland, for example, in terms of disclosing information

so-called “brown envelope disclosure” has only been used
a couple of hundred times. Of those, our research has shown that some
have perhaps been cases in which normal disclosure should have been
used. In accepting the recommendation in the run-up to the Bill, we
also recognise that we would need on occasion to make disclosures. In
doing so, we would have to revert to common law and the urgent,
pressing need for disclosure, which is currently used, for example in
the notifiable occupational scheme. For example, if a teacher was
arrested, we would deal with it very urgently. We need to make sure
that we refine our processes and deal with things under common law. We

                           </em> Let me attempt an answer. There are
probably two types of removals. The first is where a vehicle is
committing an offence and moved to a car pound, and someone is charged
to take that vehicle away. In central London, for example, the Hyde
Park car pound is full of such
vehicles.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are other removals. For example, during demonstrations, we do
street-to-street removals. We take the vehicle away, move it to another
street and put something on the police national computer to show where
it has been parked, so that when the person comes back, they can find
their car again. Those are the two different
types.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000225">&#160;</a>

Bromwich takes a different view. He is concerned that the new
legislation will prohibit him from clamping cars that are parked
illegally outside his church. There are also a number of manufacturers
outside the West Bromwich Albion ground who have been plagued by that
for years. Are you concerned that the Bill might put a greater
obligation on your capacity to deal with such issues if it is taken out
of the hands of the private sector, and people go to the police to deal
with parking illegally and causing a

relation to convicted individuals generally, we anticipated some of the
provisions in the legislation. Instead of requiring a volunteer sample
from someone who is convicted, the Crime and Security Act 2010 gave a
power to take DNA and fingerprints from those who are convicted. I have
been working with colleagues and ACPO. We currently have an operation
with police forces. We have provided them with the details of
individuals who would fall within the provisions of the Crime and
Security Act that have now been enacted, and they are carrying out a
risk-based approach to look at those individuals and use the power to
take DNA and fingerprints. We are on the

look at the codes of practice for some requirement about people who

cameras in areas where there is not that support ultimately get damaged

                           </strong> Good afternoon, Lord Macdonald, and thank you for
coming. I have a couple of questions to begin with on the issue of
surveillance. The main driver for the Bill is the disquiet that there
has been about local authorities’ use of the powers. In your
review, did you see lots of evidence of local authorities using
counter-terrorism powers
inappropriately?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000254">&#160;</a>

Macdonald:</strong>
                           </em> No. The overwhelming preponderance of
evidence gathered by the review showed that local authorities were
using their powers quite proportionately and in quite important areas
of business—weights and measures, sale of tobacco and alcohol to
under-age people, and keeping checks on the fitting of gas appliances,
and so on. My impression was—I had a meeting with the
Surveillance Commissioner, and he certainly was of the same
view—that most local authorities’ use of RIPA powers was
fairly proportionate. Indeed, if they were prevented from using them, a
lot of the areas that I have just described would no longer be capable
of proper investigation, because I doubt that the police would pick up
much of that work.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000255">&#160;</a>

is
required?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000256">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The Government’s conclusion is a
matter for the Government, but I assume that their conclusion is based
upon the view that it is critical to maintain public support for these
sorts of processes. There is certainly no harm in having an additional
safeguard, which judicial authority clearly provides. It is arguable
that we should always have had judicial authority. If you are going to
allow local authorities to intrude into people’s lives in this
way, arguably, that should always have been done only as a result of
judicial authority. For my own part, I was very comfortable with the
conclusion of the review, which was that there should be judicial
authority for such processes because they are intrusive and they
interfere with the privacy of individuals. Therefore, they ought to be
properly authorised and properly
surveilled.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000257">&#160;</a>

highlighted in the newspapers, where powers seem to have been

local authorities is very much in the public interest, so we do not
want a situation where the public lose faith in the way local
authorities are doing that, whether as a result of stories in the

that there has not been widespread abuse, but am I right in thinking
that the current system is open to widespread abuse, and that,

required is the authorisation of a relatively senior council official.
I suppose that any system is open to abuse. The insertion of a judicial
process means that it is less likely to be open to abuse, so to that

are exempt from requiring that judicial authorisation. Do you think
that, given some of the recent disquiet about some of these operations
and so on, you could apply the same argument about public confidence to
the police and intelligence services? Or would you see that as
potentially compromising those investigations, if they had to seek
judicial authority for using surveillance
powers?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000264">&#160;</a>

quite a fierce debate in Whitehall, and indeed in Government, about
that over the years. Personally, I have always favoured judicial
authorisations wherever possible, precisely because I think they add an
appropriate level of policing to those processes, but they also raise
public confidence, as your question
implies.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000265">&#160;</a>

am not saying that in every single circumstance where the security
services or the police involve themselves in surveillance they ought to
have to go to a judge—one thinks in particular of
emergencies—but the balance ought to be in favour of obtaining
judicial authorisations for operations that intrude so much into
people’s privacy. Obviously, such operations are absolutely
desirable in the public interest, but it is also in the public interest
that the public have confidence in them.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000266">&#160;</a>

authorities are involved in are not strictly counter-terrorism
activities. Some of the powers emanate from counter-terrorism
legislation, but they are very much involved in things such as weights
and measures, the sale of alcohol and so on. I certainly think you are
right. I am sure the public take a different view of MI5 or MI6
conducting surveillance as opposed to Surrey county council, for
example. Most people would probably say, “We are relatively
relaxed about MI6 or MI5 doing it; we are not so relaxed about Surrey
county council doing it,” although I do not mean to single it
out unfairly. That is why the Government have come to the conclusion
that there should be judicial authorisation for

evidence overwhelmingly pointed to a reduction to 14 days, and I am
absolutely sure that that was the right conclusion. There was then a
debate about whether there should be some means to go back up to 28
days in particular circumstances. The options were to give the Home
Secretary an order-making power or have emergency legislation, and the
review came down in favour of emergency
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000271">&#160;</a>

must say that, having looked back at the evidence, including the
evidence at the time when I was Director of Public Prosecutions and we
prosecuted the biggest terrorism cases, I find it quite difficult to
imagine a case in which we would require more than 14 days, because the
police and prosecutors have become so expert in this jurisdiction at
dealing with those issues. I do not think that we needed 28 days even
for Operation Overt, which was the airline plot. I think that could
have been dealt with in 14
days.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000272">&#160;</a>

employ this emergency legislation, you would be thinking about
simultaneous mass-casualty attacks in a large number of
cities—London, Manchester, Birmingham, Hull, Sheffield and
cities of that sort or in that category—so that the police and
prosecutors were simply overwhelmed. If we were in that territory, we
would be in a state of national emergency anyway. An additional bit of
emergency legislation to raise detention from 14 to 28 days would
hardly be out of the ordinary, as we would be facing a national
catastrophe in that situation. One has to imagine that sort of scenario
to imagine our needing to go up to 28

that during the review. We asked the Crown Prosecution Service to
provide detailed evidence about Operation Overt, the airline plot,
because scores and scores of computers were seized in that operation.
We did quite a bit of research around that. The conclusion of the

rather than 28. Some of that work is detailed in the review document
itself, but not all the research has been published, for obvious

know, this all arose because of a European case called Gillan, which
said that the section 44 power was unlawful. The section 44 power
allowed the police to stop and search people for terrorist material,
without any suspicion. In other words, they could do it on a purely
random basis. The European Court said that that was
unlawful.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000286">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the other hand, many of us thought that we could not simply abolish the
power of the police to carry out without-suspicion searches. For
example, let us suppose that the police had strong evidence that
someone was planning to car bomb Parliament square. You might say that
in those circumstances the police ought to be allowed randomly to stop
cars coming into Parliament square—limited to that location, for
a limited period. The review concluded that we could not entirely
abolish without-suspicion searches, but we would have a
without-suspicion search that was limited geographically, limited in
time and pursuant to specific information about a terrorist offence.
That is what the Bill seeks to achieve. I think the balance is

at an airport called a section 7 search, which is quite controversial

the case of Gillan was argued in Strasbourg, there was some suggestion

were in a different category because they are major international

                           </em> I don’t think we’re talking
about a marginal situation where the police or the prosecutors, who are
just as important in this situation, are thinking, “We’re
going to need 15 days or 16 days.” If they think they need 15 or
16 days, they will just have to work harder and make sure they do
things in 14 days. The reality is that the sort of case in which I
would envisage the emergency legislation being activated would be one
where you would know right at the beginning that you were absolutely
overwhelmed and that you could not make things work within 14
days.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000298">&#160;</a>

reality is that it would be clear not just to the police and the
prosecutors, but to everybody, that we were in an entirely new
situation, that we faced an enormous national crisis and, therefore,
that we would have to bring in emergency legislation. I don’t
really agree with him—again, with respect—that they would
be making marginal calls after seven, eight, nine or 10
days. Police and prosecutors will have to order themselves and put
sufficient resource into these cases so that they can come up with
charges, in appropriate cases, within 14 days. I am quite sure that,
apart from in the catastrophic cases I’ve described,
they’ll be able to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000299">&#160;</a>

we hear what you say—that it is most unlikely that there will be
a degree of marginality, and that we will get to seven, eight or nine

agree. Do you know the system that the Americans use? They have a
pre-charge detention period of only one or two days, do they
not?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000305">&#160;</a>

comparisons are difficult because people have different systems. For
example, the Americans use holding charges, and we do not. Our system
is that we select what we hope is the right charge right at the
beginning. In the States, if you want to hold someone beyond one or two
days, you just file a holding charge. You can then keep them; the
problem goes away. With respect, I think that international comparisons
are a bit tricky. It is true to say that Australia and
Canada—common-law countries that are closer to ours in their
charging philosophy—have fewer than 14 days. I think that is
true, but I will be corrected if I am
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000306">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The proposal is that if you want to go beyond 14
days you will need emergency legislation. One thing that lawyers have
raised about that is the integrity of the process, with respect to the
individual who may be subject to the application, or to the reason why
there has been a request to extend the 14-day period. Even as a
non-lawyer I can see that issue, because in a sense we are saying,
“The case of this individual is so serious that we require the
extension.” How would Parliament work with the legal system to
ensure that the integrity of this system was maintained, with respect
to ensuring that individuals had the fair trials that we are all
entitled

Macdonald:</strong>
                           </em> This is a very real concern, and I have
expressed it on a number of occasions to other Committees of the House.
It is a serious question, and it underlines, I think, that only in the
most serious circumstances would you seek to bring emergency
legislation before the House. Clearly, the danger would be that the
very fact of the emergency legislation would underline the gravity of
the charges against the individuals and, therefore, the precariousness
of their position, in terms of the finding of guilt. All I can say to
you is that I hope that it would happen only in the most exceptional
circumstances, and I am sure that parliamentarians could be relied on
to conduct themselves cautiously in such a situation. Emergency
legislation is not unprecedented, is
it?<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000308">&#160;</a>

                           </div>unfortunate largely because if that were done, the judge would probably
stop the trial as an abuse of process, and they would all go free. I
think that parliamentarians would want to understand that they could
sabotage the trial if they were not careful, and I would hope that
people would take that message seriously. The same would apply to the
House of Lords,
obviously.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000309">&#160;</a>

Home Secretary an order-making power. The review concluded that that
would be undesirable, because what is, in essence, done at the moment
by an independent prosecutor—that is, requesting an extension
from the court—would be handed over to a member of the
Executive, a senior Minister. There was a feeling that that would be an
undesirable intrusion into the trial process by a very political
figure—the Home Secretary—who deals with the most
sensitive issues, and the review concluded that such a development
might not win public confidence. The review also felt that it was
likely to be such a rare occurrence that emergency legislation was the
appropriate route, not least because we could imagine such a process
being necessary only in a real state of national emergency. That was
the thinking. I am sorry if I have not made that clear, but that is the

Paul Kennedy:</strong>
                           </em> I head a team of trained
inspectors—a chief inspector and six others—that has been
in existence since 2005. They inspect, on my behalf, local authorities
in relation to communications data. We are talking about clause 27 of
the Bill, and ultimately, schedule 7, paragraph 7, which we may look at
towards the end.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
and most important point is that local authorities have no power to
intercept; they cannot listen to anybody. They do have limited power to
gather communications data—to whom a mobile telephone belongs
and certain other information about its use—but they have no
power to obtain what is called field traffic data about where the
mobile telephone is when it is being used. They therefore have a
limited amount of power. As far as we are concerned, inspecting local
authorities is a small percentage of the work. We have calculated that
that takes a fifth of one inspector’s time over a year, though
one inspector does not do it all. It is actually relatively
small.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Almost
all the authorities that use communications data have been inspected
since the inspectorate came

                           </div>into existence in 2005; 27 were inspected in the last calendar year. I
emphasise that the inspectors have found no evidence of abuse. They do
not use this power in relation to trivial matters and when they use it,
they use it proportionately. It is mainly used by trading standards
departments and fire and environmental health departments in relation,
for example, to rogue traders, those who are abusing housing benefits,
fly-tippers—that kind of community disadvantage. There are two
quite good examples given in my last annual report, published in 2009;
they are in paragraph 3.45 and relate to two particular local
authorities, but they give a good flavour of the
work.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000325">&#160;</a>

Paul Kennedy:</strong>
                           </em> There are 433 local authorities that
have the power, some of which are quite small. They need to use it when
they have the sorts of problem that I was talking about, such as
fly-tipping. The procedure requires them to go through hoops: the
applicant has to put his case to the single point of contact, and the
SPOC has to get the designated person’s approval and then go to
the service provider to get the information. That is not a big deal,
but on the other hand it is a procedure that they have to follow. In
reality, I suspect that local authorities that use their powers twice a
year either forget the procedure or get nervous about it and simply do
not use it, and so the fly-tipper simply does not get detected. That is
only an inference, but one that can be derived from looking at who uses
it and who does not.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To some
extent, that has been importantly addressed. The local authorities have
a body called the National Anti-Fraud Network, and they have used it to
form a central body—one based in Tameside and one in
Brighton—to which local authorities can go to do the job for
them. Effectively, they can ring up and say to the National Anti-Fraud
Network, “Will you act as single point of contact, see whether
this is an appropriate case in which to seek authorisation, and do the
groundwork for us?” Now 50 local authorities have signed up to
NAFN, which, incidentally, was funded by the Home Office, so money has
been spent setting it up. We have inspected NAFN and, in our
estimation, its performance is Rolls-Royce. There is no difficulty
about what happens through it. We encourage the others, as far as we
can, to use
NAFN.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000345">&#160;</a>

unnecessary and will cost money. I repeat the figure: 1,811. The Home
Office put on the website the cost of this exercise: 20 minutes of
judicial time at a cost of £365 an hour. I did the arithmetic;
it is £250,000 a year for this exercise for local authorities on
the magistrates court and Ministry of Justice side alone. I cannot say
this with confidence about other areas in which we work, but in
relation to local authorities, we have audited almost every application
they have made. However, where there are only two or three
applications, we look at them all. With the bigger authorities, one
cannot say quite the same thing, but we have audited a very large
percentage of the applications over the last six years and there is
simply no evidence of abuse, so there is no problem on which to spend

answered. A lot of the examples that have been given to justify this
section of the Bill have been things like bin-snoopers. In one
particular case, a local authority investigated someone sending their
child to a school. It believed that the person did not live in the
catchment area and had no right to apply for that school. Did you
investigate that particular case, and did you find that that was not an
appropriate use of

is a point that I also want to make. There are other powers, under the
social security Acts for example, to get the same type of information
from a mobile telephone number. For some time, we have tried to
prevent—we cannot prevent, but we can discourage—local
authorities from using those powers, because there is no oversight at
all of them. Although RIPA in 2000 was intended to create a requirement
of oversight across the board, the way in which law always operates, as
you all know, is that a subsequent Act takes precedence, as it were,
over the previous one and the social security legislation happened to
be post-2000, and is therefore not caught by RIPA, which says that you
must go this way.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000361">&#160;</a>

oversee, I see no evidence and therefore I have no idea where it has
come from. If I can try to answer the question, what I think it has
come from is that people have not distinguished between, for instance,
surveillance and the acquisition of communications data. It is a
technical distinction and therefore, if I may say so, it is
understandable that the tabloid newspapers do not make that kind of
distinction. However, it is an important distinction for this area,
because it is only in relation to the communications data that I say
that there is no point in spending money dealing with something that is
not a problem.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000374">&#160;</a>

to the type of work that I am concerned with—that is what we are
talking about here, although it concerns a lot of other
things—the fact is that, if you put yourself in the position of
a householder, through the letterbox comes a card with a mobile number
on it. It says, “I will take away all that unwanted rubbish in
your garden, just dial this number”. The rubbish is taken away
and fly-tipped, and the only lead you have is the mobile number. If the
Bill comes into effect, in order for a local authority to discover to
whom that mobile number belongs it would have to go to a magistrate. So
I do not think it is

Last year was 1,700 and something, so it has gone up slightly. The
figures will now become slightly more difficult because of the
intervention of NAFN. Some of the figures will be collated centrally,
and the others will be retained by the authorities that make use of
their powers directly without using the central agency. If you want, we
can provide the figures since
2005.<a class="bkMark" name="110322108000400">&#160;</a>

has to prepare a document to present to a magistrate. Somebody has to
go and present it, and in a slightly cynical judgment my guess is that
