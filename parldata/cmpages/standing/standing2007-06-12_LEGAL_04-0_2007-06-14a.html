							<b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): My hon. Friend the
Member for North-West Norfolk made the valid point that the commitment
set out in the amendment should not become open-ended. I totally agree
with that, and it is a point that we tried to address in the second of
our amendments in the group. The Minister also picked up on that point,
in a rather dismissive way, I thought. She dismissed our efforts to
reduce the exposure, by saying, &#147;Well, even if you put that in
place it still wouldn&#146;t work&#148;. To be frank, it is true
that the amendment might not be enough, but we were trying to make the
point that just because the original amendment would need to be
limited, that does not mean that the thought behind it was wrong. We
simply need to look at the issue in a more constructive
way.</div>
					<a name="07061442000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey said the measure was standard
practice in other bodies, and the Minister disputed that. I think that
she gave the example of Ofcom. Having the advantage of the break, I
thought that I would have a quick look at the provisions for Ofcom,
which are quite interesting. Section 16(6) of the
CommunicationsAct 2003 states:</div>
					<a name="07061442000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The arrangements made
by OFCOM under this section must also secure that the Consumer Panel
are able, in addition to giving advice on the matters mentioned in
subsection (3), to do each of the
following&#151;</div>
					<a name="07061442000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
at the request of OFCOM, to carry out research for OFCOM in relation to
any of the matters in relation to which OFCOM have functions under
section 14&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
obviously is similar to what is in the Bill. However, section 16(6)(b)
says</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>
					<a name="07061442000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">
						&#147;to make
arrangements for the carrying out of research into such other matters
appearing to the Panel to be relevant to the carrying out of the
Panel&#146;s functions as they think
fit&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000454"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):
						</b> I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I,
too, have had some research done during the break, and he is quite
right. I inadvertently misled the Committee by quoting section 16(3) of
the 2003 Act, when in fact, as he rightly points out, section 16(6)(b)
allows the Ofcom consumer panel to carry out research into matters that
it perceives as relevant to its work. Of course, the consumer panel
also has a memorandum of understanding with Ofcom regarding the scope
of the panel&#146;s research, which it set out at the beginning of
its year. On that basis, I am happy to put the record straight on that
aspect of the debate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000455"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification, but
it means that we have established that there is precedence in other
regulatory systems for the amendment that we are suggesting. The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey was rightto bring
the matter up. What is suggested by the amendment is not unusual and it
exists elsewhere. The amendment is rational and makes sense, but we
have concerns about cost and the other issues that the Minister
mentioned.</div>
					<div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061442000456"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): On cost, the same
briefing from the National Consumer Council makes the point that Ofcom
has a budget for the consumer panel to handle matters, so its costs are
to that extent controlled. That makes amendmentNo. 223
potentially
otiose.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000457"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> That is not necessarily the case, because the
money would otherwise come from practitioners in such circumstances.
However, I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, in so far as
the issue would need to be looked at again, and there is existing
precedence for the process working in other scenarios. As a way of
going forward, therefore, the measure should be looked at instead of
simply being dismissed, as the Minister did earlier.</div>
					<a name="07061442000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, we would like
the Minister to look at the issue again. She has come back to it once,
and perhaps she will return to it again when she has more time.
Therefore, in order to allow it to be looked at again, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

end add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) It shall be
the duty of the Board (subject to subsection
(5))&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) to provide the
Consumer Panel with all such information as, having regard, in
particular to the need to preserve commercial confidentiality, the
Board considers appropriate to disclose to the Panel for the purpose of

					<div class="hs_brev">it is reasonable for the Board
to refuse to disclose it to the
Panel.&#146;</div>
					<a name="07061442000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment again comes from the National Consumer Council, and we have
tabled it on a probing basis. It would work alongside amendment No. 222
by ensuring that the consumer panel has access to the information that
it needs to carry out its functions&#151;information held by the
board, subject to appropriate restrictions. Just as an individual needs
the appropriate resources in order to do their work, so the consumer
panel requires access to certain information in orderto carry
out its work to the highest possible level. However, the amendment also
recognises that there may be some instances in which it may not be
appropriate for the consumer panel to receive such information.
Therefore, the amendment would give the Legal Services Board the
discretion to decide on such cases.</div>

						<a name="07061442000459"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Mann</b> (Bassetlaw) (Lab): &#147;Commercial
confidentiality&#148; is a term that I have heard quoted a lot in the
context of this Bill, and it has been quoted to me in numerous cases.
One of the big issues is that individual members of the public, who,
for example, wonder whether to make complaints against solicitors,
often struggle to get hold of their files from the solicitors. Another
example could be that of a coal miner&#151;someone who knows nothing
about the law, has never had to deal with the law and is not an expert
on compensation schemes, but who nevertheless wants to know whether
their case has been handled properly. He might like his Member of
Parliament to take a look at his file to see whether the services
aspect of the claim has been put in.</div>
					<a name="07061442000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The services aspect of the
claim can be three, four or five times the amount of the rest of the
claim, so this is not a small issue. However, only someone with the
relevant knowledge would be able to identify whether or not the case
contained a potential services claim that had not been applied for.
That information can only be found by looking at the file. However,
certain solicitors refuse to hand over those files, and at the moment,
self-regulation appears powerless to do much about that. Where is
access to justice in relation to that?</div>
					<a name="07061442000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some paperwork has been refused
on the basis of client confidentiality. Let us take the example of a
contractual arrangement between a claims handling company and a
solicitor that the individual concerned does not know about it. How can
that individual make a rational decision about whether they have a
justified complaint, if &#147;commercial confidentiality&#148; is
cited as a reason not to give copies of the information?</div>
					<a name="07061442000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take a more generic
case, because this is exactly the kind of issue that the panel should
look at. Let us say that an industrial injury claim is given to a legal
executive who has no great experience and no precise knowledge of the
law, and who routinely gives that work to a barrister, who examines it
in the same way that a member of the Committee might and writes a short
report in 10 minutes, spelling out what is a straightforward case. The
barrister sends it back and charges the solicitor&#146;s company,
which passes it on to the individual. The individual can do nothing
about that, but how does he know what transactions took place, to
enable him to make a complaint and say that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>he had been hoodwinked because the issue did not require a barrister? A
barrister was used only because, unbeknown to the individual, the
solicitor had passed the papers to an executive, not a solicitor. The
paper trail required can therefore be deemed to be commercially
confidential.</div>
					<a name="07061442000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
consumer panel or the Legal Services Board to know whether the
transaction had been done routinely, it would need access to what
clearly could be described as commercially confidential documents, such
as those relating to the financial relationship between the solicitor
and the barrister or, say, a solicitor and a medical handling company.
The solicitor might have just happened to set up such a company, passed
the medical case through it and taken a cut of the money. Moreover, as
we have seen inmany cases, such a relationship might be with a
loans company that is giving out large loans for legal expenses and
receiving good commission. The case might be shared around. Many such
issues might be deemed worthy of examination by the consumer panel or
the board.</div>
					<a name="07061442000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
restriction of confidentiality in such matters is absurd. It means that
the very issues that need exploring will not be explored. While it is a
slight point, given some of the amendment&#146;s aims, it masks a
greater sin, which is the ability of the consumer or the individual to
receive redress. More important is the consistent ability to look at
the overall system and advise the board&#151;and perhaps
Ministers&#151;of the law and weaknesses within the system that have
been legally but, in some eyes, immorally exploited by those in the
legal profession. Hiding behind commercial confidentiality has been the
precise tactic used by particularly wealthy solicitors who have
benefited from their interpretation of the rules in such
claims.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061442000460"></a>
							<b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): My hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley and I both support the
amendment because it has merit. I had not intended to say much more
than that, but I have now been prompted to do so because the hon.
Member for Bassetlaw has made a good point. I completely understand the
concern that, if the conventional phrase is put into legislation that
states that it shall be the duty of the
board</div>
					<a name="07061442000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to provide the
Consumer Panel with all such information as, having regard, in
particular to the need to preserve commercial
confidentiality&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07061442000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">it will
bring about an undefined and potentially broad
exemption.</div>
					<a name="07061442000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I spend
much of my time wondering why so much local
government information is secret. The most common reason given is that
something is commercially confidential. We could be talking about the
largest piece of publicly owned land in our constituencies and the
generally held view that members of the public, their councillors and
their Member of Parliament should know what is going on, but then be
told that it was not something for whichwe could see the
paperwork. I agree with the hon. Gentleman in that, if we were to have
such a good proposal and if there were to be limits, there would have
to be a clear definition of the
limits.</div>
					<a name="07061442000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
might be able to answer, either now or later, a question asked in that
regard. I am not sure whether this is dealt with later in the Bill,
because I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>have not checked. Does the Bill addresses the question of commercial
confidentiality? The convention exists that when you, Mr.
Cook, the Minister or I employor engage a solicitor&#146;s
firm, the relationship is confidential, unless it comes out into the
open because we take action against another party or because the matter
goes to court. That is right and proper.</div>
					<a name="07061442000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal is a good one. I
understand the point about not wanting to make it effectively useless
by making the exemptions so big. Perhaps the Minister could help us by
deliberating on that. The hon. Member for Huntingdon and his
colleagues, and my colleagues and I, could deal with any issues that
need
addressing.</div>

							<a name="07061442000461"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> I rise to support what the hon. Member for
Bassetlaw has said. There is an issue about the transparency of
payments, but, in practice, the amendment would start by giving a duty
to provide some information to the consumer panel. Without such a
provision, there would be no duty to provide it with any information.
The transparency of payments is clearly an important point, but it is
not necessarily part of
this.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061442000462"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): The amendment
would place a duty on the Legal Services Board to provide information.
Surely that would be a great deal better than the clause, as drafted.
As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley pointed out, there is no
obligation or duty on the board to provide any information. That is why
clause 11 is deficient. It states:</div>
					<a name="07061442000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Consumer Panel may,
at the request of the
Board&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div>
					<a name="07061442000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Board must consider any advice given... The Consumer Panel may
publish such information as it thinks fit about advice it
gives&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no duty
on the board to provide information.</div>
					<a name="07061442000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take on board the point made
by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw. In our enthusiasm to widen the scope
of the clause and to ensure that provision was made for such a duty, we
decided that we would be cautious, which is why we included the
qualification about preserving commercial confidentiality. Surely he
would agree that amendment No. 224 would improve the clause, despite
his concerns about the commercial confidentiality qualification. I
notice that he did not table an amendment to improve the clause
further, in a way that he would find more powerful and effective than
our proposal.</div>
					<a name="07061442000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
trying to sing from the same hymn sheet, because we are trying to give
the consumer panel much more power, influence, focus and direction. We
hope that it will therefore attract large numbers of high-calibre
people to serve on it. In the light of the Committee&#146;s debate, I
hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at our
proposal.</div>

						</b> Being the magnanimous person that I am, I agree
that the consumer panel should have all the information that it needs
to carry out its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>functions. The amendment clearly seeks to allow it to make requests in
that regard. It is important to recognise that clause 10 already
enables it to do so, simply by making representations to the board,
which would be obliged to consider them. It is likely thatthe
board and the consumer panel could agree a framework,
not unlike the memorandum of understanding between Ofcom and its panel.
I have made reference to that arrangement.</div>

						</b> Looking particularly at clause 10, it seems that
the Legal Services Board will be more likely to know what information
may be necessary for the consumer panel. If the consumer panel does not
know that some information is necessary, it cannot ask forit.
That is why the duty to provide information is stronger than a
situation where the panel can ask for information and be told that it
cannot have it.</div>

						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman and take that
point, which is why I shall be quite positive in my response to the
amendment. I wish to put on record that it should be clear from the
very fact that we are establishing a consumer panel that we want it to
be furnished with the information that it needs.It is
fundamental that the organisation that makes representations to, and
consults with, the board conducts research, gives advice as requested
and receives the information that it requires. How else could it
achieve the aims that we have set out? However,I have a couple
of niggling concerns about the amendment; I am not entirely convinced
that it will achieve what hon. Members want. I ask the hon. Member for
Huntingdon to withdraw the amendment on the basis that I will
positively consider the matter to find out whether we can come to some
arrangement.</div>
					<a name="07061442000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bassetlaw rightly highlights at every opportunity
some of the scandalous practices that have taken place as regards some
of our constituents. On access to information, a client should be
entitled to the file that relates to their case. Under the Bill, if
they are not satisfied with the service provided by a lawyer, they can
go to the Office for Legal Complaints. The ombudsman will have the
power to require a party to a complaint to provide all the documents
and information necessary to consider it, which is a wide-ranging
power. I shall discuss the amendment further with consumer groups and
other stakeholders to ensure that we achieve exactly the hon.

possibly provide research material to the consumer panel. The panel
will carry out a number of major projects, and we want it to have a
wide range. A consumer group might be involved already in a major
campaign that involves informing its membership, with articles in a
publication or surveys and questionnaires.</div>

fours with a consumer panel initiative, and it would be sensible if the
two initiatives could be brought together. Will the Minister tell the
Committee whether she sees any merit in such an approach and whether
she is attracted to my suggestions? The clause stand part debate is the
time to look into the matter in more detail. I should be most grateful

panel to carry out research and give advice to the board, following a
board request, and any opportunity for the panel to pick up on good
research should be welcomed. I am not in favour of reinventing the
wheel. If certain consumer organisations were doing research,
therefore, it would be foolish for the consumer panel not to be able to
access it. I shall consider whether there are ways in which we can

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 210,in
clause 12, page 5, line 26, at end insert&#151;&#145;(ea)
preparation of
wills&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
now moved on to part 3 of the Bill, which deals with reserved legal
activities, as defined by the clause. The Opposition propose that the
writing of wills should be included in the list of reserved legal
activities that may only be carried on by authorised persons. The
clause identifies six forms of legal activity that will be regulated as
reserved legal activities: the exercise of a right of audience in the
courts, the conduct of litigation, reserved instrument activities,
probate activities, notarial activities and the administration of
oaths.</div>
					<a name="07061442000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">This probing
amendment is intended to prompt the consideration of whether will
preparation should be added to that list, as recommended by the Joint
Committee on the Draft Legal Services Bill, which
said:</div>
					<a name="07061442000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We note
that the offences in clause...12 will apply to a range of
situations where consumers may need protection... We recommend
that will-writing for fee, gain or reward should be included within the
new regulatory framework. The draft Bill should be amended to provide
for regulation subject to any exemptions necessary in the consumer
interest.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>
					<a name="07061442000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Joint Committee noted that
there is no existing regulatory framework for will writing or existing
professional body with responsibility for will writing. Accordingly,
there is a significant risk of consumer detriment from the activities
of unregulated will writers. The Government identified a similar risk
in relation to the claims management sector in the context of the
Compensation Act 2006. In that case, they
wanted</div>
					<a name="07061442000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A major change in
quality and behaviour by claims management companies so that the
service provided to consumers is significantly improved and
consumers&#146; expectations are not falsely raised through
potentially misleading advertising and other sales
practices&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some bodies, including the Law
Society, consider that the same changes and developments should occur
in relation to will writing. In fairness, it is arguable that there are
differences between writing wills, which relate to only one person, and
complex litigation. For most people, an off-the-shelf, do-it-yourself
will, purchased from a high street shop, would probably be perfectly
adequate.</div>
					<a name="07061442000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
like the Minister to tell us whether the Government have conducted any
research on the issue. In particular, would extra regulation be likely
to reduce the number of people making wills? That is a key issue,
because too many people currently do not make a will, and we should
encourage, rather than discourage, will making. The Government have
already made clear that they wish to increase consumer protection by
bringing will writers into the scope of the regulatory
framework.</div>

regulator?</div>

whatever.</div>
					<a name="07061442000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude,
my concern is that, if there were regulation, far fewer people might
make a will. Most wills are pretty straightforward documents; it is
when complexity comes into will making that the possibility of mistakes
increases. That is the potential problem area, and I shall certainly be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s
views.</div>

						</b> I am a little confused by the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s speech, because he appeared to argue against his
amendment at the end. To quote the helpful explanation under the new
Bill system, of which I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>thoroughly approve, the Members&#146; explanatory statement for the
amendment says:</div>
					<a name="07061442000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To add will-writing to
the list of reserved legal activities which can only be carried out by
authorised persons.&#148;</div>

members of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association wish to
participate in debates on transport, they must exclude themselves from
the deliberations, because they are deemed to have a vested advocacy
interest. There are other such examples.</div>
					<a name="07061442000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chairman of the Select
Committee on Standards and Privileges clarified the issue precisely on
14 May 2002, <i class="I">Official Report</i>,<i class="I"> </i>columns 731-750. I shall
quote only the relevant line, which says that</div>
					<a name="07061442000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;from now on the only restriction
on Members&#146; freedom of action will be that they must not seek to
confer benefit exclusively on a body in which they have a pecuniary
interest.&#148;&#151; [<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 14 May 2002; Vol.
385, c. 732.]</div>
					<a name="07061442000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I vary from
Parliament&#146;s view, because I do not believe that any restriction
is sensible. Transparency is the principle, but the issue prompts an
interesting question of Members.</div>
					<a name="07061442000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would confer a
benefit exclusively on a set profession: it would be the only
profession that could benefit from that work, and it would do so
exclusively. Should a practising solicitor who is a Member of the House
wish to vote on the amendment, it could be argued that their company
would benefit and that, either indirectly through the profits of their
company or directly through their own work, they would
benefit.</div>
					<a name="07061442000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
good juncture at which to explore the issue of advocacy. I do not wish
to see anyone excluding themselves from any votes here, but this is as
precise an example as it is possible to get. The benefit would be
exclusively to the said profession, as outlined very helpfully in the
Members&#146; explanatory statement; that is what this provision
would do. It could not be argued that voting against it would confer an
exclusive benefit, but voting for it could.</div>
					<a name="07061442000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I merely make the observation
that should Members proceed on that basis, it would set a
precedent&#151;possibly very helpful&#151;for the limits on
advocacy and the Nolan principles. I would regard that as very
sensible. Some of the nonsense in the past, such as TSSA members being
excluded from a Committee because of their membership of that
organisation, was ludicrous, but that is what
happened.</div>

towards preventing people from doing things, rather than towards
transparency. The key principle is transparency, and one&#146;s judge
is one&#146;s voters. As long as there is transparency, the voters
will be the final arbiters of anyone&#146;s behaviour. That is my
view; it is not the view of the House, as determined on its behalf by
the Standards and Privileges Committee.</div>

							<a name="07061442000481"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I shall return to the central purpose of this
clear and important amendment. As the hon. Member for Huntingdon said,
we are on to part 3 of nine as we rush on. We are doing well. It is
another part that starts with a definition and comes to the statement
later, just en passant.</div>
					<a name="07061442000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 3 is about the regulation
of legal activities and which legal activities are governed by the
Bill. First, we define the reserved legal activity and legal activity
in clause 12, and then the relevance of defining them
appears first in clause 14, which sets out the
proposition with which this part deals. That proposition is that if one
carries out a certain activity, one has to be approved to do so and if
one is not approved, it is an offence to carry it out. Clause 12 lists
those activities, which are</div>
					<a name="07061442000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the exercise of a right of
audience...the conduct of litigation...reserved instrument
activities...probate activities... notarial
activities...the administration of
oaths.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061442000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall come back
to that list, but the obvious omission, which has been proposed for a
long time, is the writing of wills. I have thought about the subject a
lot, and I start from the position that we should not seek to regulate
things unless we have to regulate. That is always my position in life.
We have far too many laws and regulations, so I am not in favour of one
more.</div>
					<a name="07061442000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are three
generic ways in which a will can be written. First, people can write
their own, and no one is suggesting that there should be any reduction
in the number of people who do that, or control of them. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>Secondly, people go to a solicitor who has wills and probate as part of
their advertised job. Many solicitors do wills as part of their
business, and some have wills and probate as a key part of their
business. Some generalist solicitors see wills, probate and
conveyancing as their main, routine, run-of-the-mill work.</div>
					<a name="07061442000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, other people also do
will writing. This debate is a bit like the one that we had on the
Compensation Bill. We are talking about people about whom one would
probably never have known until one day, a flyer came through the
letterbox, there was an advert in the local paper, a leaflet was handed
out atthe shopping centre or one was told about them.
Alternatively, someone might give staff at an old people&#146;s home
information about local will writers. Bluntly, most people would not
have a clue about who those people were or what competence and
authority they had. That is a real concern. I want to cite some
examples.</div>

					<a name="07061442000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
owned up&#151;as I did and as others have done by
implication&#151;to the fact that there is a fourth category of
people about whom we are concerned: those who have never addressed the
question at all and have done niente about it. We all need to do
better, especially if we are beyond our 20s and 30s and have family
responsibilities, and other people depend on knowing what the score
is.</div>
					<a name="07061442000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course we
should encourage people to write wills. That does not necessarily mean
encouraging them to go to lawyers to do so. If the wills are simple,
people can make them themselves; they could get the advisory pack from
Woolworths or somewhere else. I am conscious that there is a campaign
to have more will writing. I have owned up to the fact that I supported
such a campaign, prompted by a firm in my constituency that produces
the packs that provide such a service. I am sure that the firm offers
that service,as
well.</div>

standards of will writing and related services in order to protect
consumers&#146;. We note the Government's conclusion that this could
most effectively be achieved by voluntary regulation, codes of conduct
and consumer education. We do not
agree.&#148;</div>

					<a name="07061442000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recommend that will-writing for fee, gain or reward should be included
within the new regulatory framework. The draft Bill should be amended
to provide for regulation subject to any exemptions necessary in the
consumer interest. We note that there is currently no existing
regulatory framework for will-writing and no existing professional body
with responsibility for will-writing activities. We note that these
hurdles have been overcome in respect of the claims management sector,
in the context of the Compensation Bill, and urge the Government to
consider whether will-writers might be brought within the scope of the
regulatory framework in a similar
manner.&#148;</div>

						</b> I beg the hon. Gentleman&#146;s pardon. Durham
is a nice city in a nice county, although I am not sure about the
constituency boundaries. During the Compensation Bill proceedings, both
hon. Gentlemen argued that we should bring that group of activities
within the law&#151;and we have done so, courtesy of the Government.
My current argument is similar, and I hope that the hon. Gentlemen find
it attractive. I am not arguing at all that we should set up a separate
profession of will writers; that is not my case. We need to debate
whether all those different professions need to exist as such, and I
shall come to that point in the clause stand part debate. I am
concerned about thejob of will writing, rather than the
professional occupation. It could reasonably be done by other people.
One could go through a door marked &#147;A variety of
services&#148;, and will writing could be one of
them.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07061442000421"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07061442000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to give
three examples of why the issue is important. In fact, my first point
is not an example, but comes from my own experience. In the years of
practice following my law degree, I found that interpreting wills was a
fantastic source of work. Often, people&#146;s wills do not reflect
what they want them to reflect. If people get bad advice, they often do
not write down&#151;or it is not written down&#151;what they wanted
to happen.</div>
					<a name="07061442000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we all
know, issues such as wills are greatly sensitive. Once someone dies and
the will is looked at&#151;not in the old-fashioned way when it is
read out in front of all the prospective beneficiaries&#151;the most
terrible rows can ensue, because people think that they should have
been included or that someone should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>have been excluded&#151;first wives or first husbands. There are
debates about when the will was written. There are also the issues
connected with old people: have they been pressured into writing their
will and who was there at the time?</div>
					<a name="07061442000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those issues make massive
work for lawyers. They make even more work if they are not clear.
Someone might write a will leaving everything to their daughter, which
is clear and unarguable. That might happen without a will anyway if
there is only one daughter. However, somebody may have six daughters.
If they write &#147;I leave everything to my daughter,&#148; that
would not be clear and a debate would be needed. There is a fantastic
amount of debate out there. People often have to go to solicitors or to
the courts. That causes great angst, trauma and family disharmony.
Therefore, there is a real live issue out in the
community.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000490"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes quite a compelling case.
Does he not accept that there is one caveat? Probate issues cause the
most bitter rifts in mining communities. They are the most divisive of
issues. The problem is usually to do with principle, rather than large
amounts of money. One of the problems is not so much that wills are
unclear, but that there is no will. Will the measure entice more people
to make a will, or
fewer?</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000491"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Of course, that is an issue. I believe that we
should encourage people to make a will. If people do not make wills,
the law decides where their property goes. If they are married, their
property goes to their husband or wife. I think that, if they
havea civil partner, it goes to their civil partner.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> If a Back Bencher says that that
is not the case, I stand corrected. Certainly, if someone is married,
their property goes to their husband or wife. If someone is single but
has children, the property goes to the first generation. A statute
deals with the administration of estates. It is not always terribly
clear, but there is a law.</div>
					<a name="07061442000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman was right
when he said that it is hugely problematic if someone has not
specified, or not specified clearly, what should happen to their
property. We ought to be encouraging people to make wills and to make
them as simple as possible.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061442000492"></a>
							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): The only connection
I have ever had with a will&#151;apart from making one&#151;was
when I prosecuted someone for trying to forge one, which is not the
issue now. I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Does he
agree that his point was reinforced by a debate in the other place?
When difficult and intractable disputes occur over a badly drafted
will, one of the problems is that, in a sense, it is too late. The
person whose intention is in question is dead. Expensive litigation is
the only means of rectification, which hits the person&#146;s nearest
and dearest. That is a compelling argument for
regulation.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000493"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The legal case might be fine if one is dealing
with the estate of rich Texan millionaires or billionaires and
well-proportioned women 60 years their junior, and even their children.
Bluntly, there is plenty of money floating around, so going to court to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>dispute who is to inherit the estate will not take a significant amount
of it. However, that is not the case for lots of people. The smaller
the income, the bigger the issue. A legal dispute can use up
everything; everything can disappear.</div>
					<a name="07061442000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society made a good
general point in its briefing that gives me an introduction to my
examples. We live in a society of changing family structures, and there
are more categories of family. Families are more complex. There are
single people, straightforwardly married people, cohabiting people,
civil partners, people who are separated but still married, divorced
people&#151;sometimes living together, sometimes
not&#151;legitimate and illegitimate children and many step-families.
I shall use that fact as a peg on which to hang my three
examples.</div>
					<a name="07061442000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I alluded to
the first during the debate on Tuesday. The estimable nephew of mine
whose birthday I said fell on the same day as that of the hon. Member
for Enfield, Southgate was very excited when I rang him up to tell him
that his happy birthday would be featured in <i class="I">Hansard.</i> Well,
relatively excited; &#147;very excited&#148; is overstating things.
He was intrigued and relatively excited. He married just over two years
ago, and he and his wife have brought into the family a child of their
own, as well as his child and her children from previous relationships.
If his will said, &#147;I leave these to my children&#148; and did
not specify, that self-evidently would not answer the question, because
it would not say whether it meant his natural children or his
wife&#146;s children whom he took on.</div>
					<a name="07061442000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know what will happen.
My nephew might never formally adopt or take legal responsibility for
his wife&#146;s children, who live with them in their joint home, but
that is exactly the sort of issue about which bad advice, bluntly,
could have exactly the wrong result. If, having written a will, he died
and the will was not clear, a dispute could immediately arise between
his natural children and those who became the children of the family,
who by then might be married adults with children of their
own.</div>
					<a name="07061442000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
example concerns a constituency case with which I am dealing at the
moment. I am trying to sort out for a constituent, for the purposes of
probate, some money from the sale of her elderly mother&#146;s flat,
which was sold when she became ill and incapable of running her own
affairs and had to move into residential care. It is a common
circumstance. Her daughter, one of two, was given power of attorney
while the mother was still compos mentis enough to do so. She sold the
flat and her mother moved into residential and other care, and
subsequently died.</div>
					<a name="07061442000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the beginning, the daughter simply used the funds to pay for
residential care and so on as necessary&#151;topping up the care
given, paying for an assessment&#151;and she did not think to put
that money into a separate account. She put it into her account, and
eventually her bank said to her, &#147;You ought to put it into a
separate account to make it clear that it is the residuary amount from
the sale of the flat.&#148; She put it into a separate account, but
an account in her name. Nobody had said to her that she ought to put it
into an account for her mother, so she just opened an additional bank
account in her name.</div>
					<a name="07061442000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then her mother died and she
was very busy dealing with the funeral, paying for it out of the
account and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>paying disbursements. When she next had the opportunity, she passed
affairs to a solicitor to deal with probate. When she gave the bank
account books to the solicitor&#151;we are not talking about big
money; it was about &#163;15,000&#151;and said, &#147;Please sort
this out and get probate,&#148; she did not immediately think about
the residual account in her name. She went back to the solicitor later
to say, &#147;I beg your pardon; I should have added this, because
although it is in my name, I have never touched it other than in
connection with my mother&#146;s affairs, and I am clear that it
should be dealt with as part of probate.&#148; If the daughter had
died before that was resolved and had left a will, would it have
included the money in that account? That is exactly the sort of
question that we must ask. There is probably more money in that account
than is coming to her in another
way.</div>
					<a name="07061442000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to my last
example. Often, people want to give particular things to particular
organisations&#151;charities, for example. People sometimes give
extraordinary amounts to extraordinary charities, but that is their
choice and they are entitled to do
so.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07061442000494"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000495"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Indeed, but I do not think that the Liberal
Democrats are a charity, technically, although that may be the view of
Committee members. However, the party has good, radical roots as an
organisation, like the Labour party, and it is different from the
Conservative party. But it is not a charity. Our political parties have
special status.</div>
					<a name="07061442000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
give to charities, but if an organisation ceases to exist&#151;the
cats&#146; home might be closed, or whatever&#151;what happens? Was
it intended that the sum should go to something similar or something
else, or to another charity that was mentioned? I have just given three
examples, but they are real-life practical ones. If people decide to do
it themselves&#151;we all agree that, ideally, one should write a
will&#151;they need someone to give them competent advice. There is a
strong case for such people to come under the regulatory umbrella. I
hope that the Minister is
sympathetic.</div>
					<a name="07061442000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of all
the amendments on the amendment paper, this is probably the least
complicated, so the one defence of all good Ministers, which is that
they will have to take advice on the drafting, is not
available&#151;at least, I should be surprised if it were. The
Minister might say that she must talk to all the people in government
who are concerned with the end of time or the end of
things&#151;there might be a lot of those at the moment&#151;but I
hope that she will be sympathetic. This is an important issue and, on
balance, I think that we ought to follow the Joint Committee&#146;s
advice. I hope that we can do so, subject to a later debate about not
necessarily creating a separate profession, because that is not a
necessary
outcome.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000496"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> There is a famous saying that people can live
without lawyers, but cannot die without one. That is pertinent to what
the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has said. We have all
encountered constituency cases where total nightmares have been created
by wills being fought over by relations, often on the basis of easily
avoidable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>mistakes, which could have been circumvented if the right legal advice
had been taken.</div>
					<a name="07061442000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two current constituency cases, where a number of family members
are now in serious legal dispute about the estate. In one, various
members of two branches of the family are all taking different legal
advice. The estate will be completely dissipated by legal fees and
nothing will be left for the family members, who have been fighting
over the will, to divide among themselves. As the hon. Gentleman said,
the larger estates can probably withstand legal fees and the legal
advice that is needed to try to sort out the mess when serious errors
have occurred. However, in respect of smaller estates&#151;often,
involving families who do not have a huge amount of
money&#151;everything can be wiped out as a result of such
complications.</div>
					<a name="07061442000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report of the Joint Committee on the Draft Legal Services Bill is quite
compelling. We have heard exactly what it said. May I ask the Minister
why the Government did not take the advice of that Committee, on which
my hon. Friend the Memberfor Enfield, Southgate served?
Furthermore, am I not right in saying that, among the Joint
Committee&#146;s recommendations, is the one at paragraph
216:</div>
					<a name="07061442000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is currently
no existing regulatory framework for will-writing and no existing
professional body with responsibility for will-writing
activities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061442000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister can tell me whether I am right in saying that two bodies
now represent the interests of the independent will writers and that
those will-writing organisations cater for and self-regulate those will
writers who have set up outwith the legal profession. Those
organisations are, in many ways, doing agood job.</div>
					<a name="07061442000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like my hon. Friend the Member
for Huntingdon, I am not a natural regulator, so I tabled this probing
amendment to hear what the Minister has to say. I should be grateful
for an answer; I hope that her officials will know the answer. I have
it on good authority that the two organisations that I mention were set
up.</div>
					<a name="07061442000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 5 of
schedule 2, in volume II of the Bill, describes &#147;Reserved
instrument activities&#148;, whichrefer to</div>
					<a name="07061442000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;preparing any other instrument
relating to real or personal estate for the purposes of the
law...or instrument relating to court
proceedings&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
slightly confused, because a disposition of landor property by
me during my lifetime is a reserved instrument activity and therefore
has to be done by a qualified person, but a disposition of land by me
in my will can be done without having my hand held. I should like the
Minister to comment on
that.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07061442000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="07061442000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">With my request
for clarification on those two points, I should like the Minister to
consider our probing amendment, because we feel strongly
aboutit. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
pointed out, it is a simple amendment. The Minister is rejecting the
Joint Committee&#146;s recommendations. We need to know why she is
doing that and what her current view is on how this small but
flourishing industry is managing its affairs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>
					<a name="07061442000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am speaking slightly against
our probing amendment now, but if it were accepted&#151;the Minister
will tell us her views on that in a moment&#151;and will writing
became a reserved activity, the problem would be that the two
organisations that have been set up, as well as the numerous will
writers out there, could presumably carry on as alternative business
structures, but would have to wait until the ABS regime had been
introduced. As far as I am aware, we have not received representations
from will writers, but I know that they are doing a good
job.</div>
					<a name="07061442000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I would
reject strongly any suggestion that Opposition members of the Committee
do not have either a right or locus to speak on the issue. We have had
a discussion about interests, and we have all declared our interests.
We have been completely honourable and above board about that, so the
idea that my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate could
benefit if the amendment were accepted is ridiculous and fatuous. I
hope that the Minister will explain the situation and look on our
probing amendment in a positive
light.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061442000497"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I do not want
to repeat unduly what has been said in support of the amendment, but I
should like to respond to the hon. Member for Bassetlaw. I take note of
your concerns about not straying into uncharted territory,
Mr. Cook, but it is important always to listen carefully to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of the Committee on
Standards and Privileges, so I await with interest to see how much he
participates on clause 15 when we reach it and whether he wishes to be
consistent with his remarks
elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07061442000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly take issue with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s main basis for
concern about the amendment and the Members&#146; explanatory
statement, which says that
the</div>
					<a name="07061442000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reserved legal
activities...can only be carried out by authorised
persons&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Plainly, those
authorised persons do not necessarily mean solicitors, those authorised
by the Law Society or, indeed, particular firms. &#147;Authorised
persons&#148; does not refer exclusively to a particular body;
indeed, the whole rationale behind the Bill is to extend legal service
activities to a range of groups. The Willwriters&#146; Association or
any other group may well want to get involved, but the amendment is not
exclusive, as the whole point of the Bill is to avoid a closed
shop.</div>
					<a name="07061442000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is not about saying that we should increase services and activities for
solicitors firms and thereby ensure that they have a closed shop on
will writing&#151;far from it. One has genuine admiration for the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s fight on miners&#146; compensation and for
the passion with which he follows through his constituents&#146;
concerns, but as I understand it, he is not necessarily on a personal
campaign against individual lawyers; rather, his concern is about the
need for robust regulation, as he said on Second Reading. He may make
that argument, but on the other hand he doesnot support an
amendment that would introduce regulation in a currently unregulated
field, as this amendment
would.</div>
					<a name="07061442000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether other hon. Members have mentioned constituents who come to
their surgeries to complain about the great grievance and injustice
that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>caused when their relative&#146;s clear intention to provide a proper
inheritance for a family member is frustrated. One cannot equate that
injustice with others, and nor does one want to create a hierarchy of
industrial injuries, pecuniary loss and injustice from a probate
dispute.</div>
					<a name="07061442000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is whether we should allow a field of increasing complexity to be so
unregulated. Family relationships are increasingly complicated, and
inheritance tax is an issue as well. With property prices rising, the
Chancellor is taking more and more from the estates of many of my
constituents, and they need proper advice on how to deal with that.
There is no doubt that the regulation proposed by the amendment would
be in the interests of consumers. Hon. Members should rest assured that
the amendment applies a light
touch.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000498"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000499"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> Absolutely. However, there should also be
consistency. If there are protestations to the effect that there should
be robust regulation, and if there are cases showing the area to be one
that should be regulated, rather than one in which a voluntary code can
be relied on, there should be a consensus of support for
change.</div>
					<a name="07061442000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, will
the Minister say whether, since the response to the White Paper and
since the Government&#146;s own comments on such activities, which
included concerns about quality control and standards, the Government
have been satisfied that voluntary regulation and codes of conduct are
satisfactory? What steps have been put in place to improve consumer
education, and, in the substantial intervening period, has there been
improvement such that regulation is not
warranted?</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000500"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The debate has been interesting and I have a
great deal of sympathy with some of the examples that hon. Members have
given. We have all had constituents at our advice surgeries who have
had problems with probate and other such issues. However, it was
interesting that among all the anecdotal examples cited, there was no
evidence that bad advice had been given by people who were not
solicitors, for example, or that bad advice was necessarily being given
by non-professionals. That is why ultimately, I shall resist the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07061442000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
beginning of his remarks, the hon. Member for Huntingdon asked me what,
if any, research the Government have done on the matter. We have indeed
done research and we have been reviewing the matter for some time,
because, in essence, will writing sounds like something that could or
should be considered a reserved legal activity. In March 2005, the Lord
Chancellor said that we would consider the issue of will writing and of
estate administration services. Since then, we have worked with
consumer bodies and we have asked the Office of Fair Trading to review
the matter. The OFT, consumer bodies and the current providers of
will-writing services were asked to provide us with robust evidence
that might be suggestive of systematic failure in the current system
that could put consumers at risk.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>
					<a name="07061442000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">A comparison was made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Bassetlaw with claims management, which I think
was a fair comparison. We have had shedloads of evidence of claims
management services being badly run and badly handled, and giving bad
advice that was hugely detrimental to consumers. Lots of opinions were
expressed about will writing, but no evidence has been supplied to
support the idea that regulation is the way forward at
present.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000501"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The Minister said that there was shedloads of
evidence in respect of claims handling. We all accept that, but surely
she would agree that the injustice potentially done to people is
measured not by the quantity of such incidences, but by the damage done
to those individuals. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey said, such problems are experienced by ordinary people with
small estates; they do not receive the attention of Members of
Parliament, and they are not the subject of the able campaigns that
arose in respect of claims handling. Just because there is not
shedloads of numerical evidence, that does not mean that there is not a
real risk below the radar screen. It would therefore be sensible to
regulate all those who write wills, whether or not they are members of
the

enough, which is why we are here&#151;at least such a system exists.
If a solicitor gives a person&#146;s family bad advice about a will
or probate, there are steps that can be taken. I assume that someone
could tell us how many complaints related to wills and probate have
been received. However, there would be nowhere to go if we could not go
to a solicitor. There is no other organisation that we could check in
the same way.</div>

						</b> I shall come to that point in a moment because
it relates to the issue raised by the hon. Members for Enfield,
Southgate and for North-West Norfolk about the organisations that
represent will writers. The important thing is that any regulation must
be proportionate. I chide the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate for
using that horrible phrase, which I am trying to ban hon. Members from
using in relation to this Bill. However, regulation must be
proportionate and based on an assessment of risk. The Government do not
at the moment see any serious evidence of systemic
failure.</div>

					<a name="07061442000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk asked about reserved instruments and why wills
are not included. One reason is that a will is a set of instructions
rather than a disposition. Even if real property is left in a will,
some other formal transfer would almost certainly have to take place.
The Government&#146;s approach in the Bill is exactly the same as
that set out by the Solicitors Act
1974.</div>

Minister is trying to make. Of course, if one writes a will saying
&#147;I give my field to Auntie Mabel&#148;, when one dies, there
has to be a probate that acts as the transfer. We have got cover for
probate, which is dealt with elsewhere. The issue arises when a will is
not clear. The fact that the one matter is covered does not mean that
the other should not be covered, because if the will is wrong, the
probate will by definition also be
wrong.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair
point.</div>
					<a name="07061442000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk mentioned will writers&#146; organisations.
The amendment would mean that, as a reserved activity, will writing
could be done only with the proper authorisation and approval of
regulators such as the Law Society. If it wanted to authorise and
regulate the supply of such services, the organisations that represent
will writers&#151;the Society of Will Writers and Estate Planning 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>Practitioners and the Institute of Professional Willwriters&#151;would
need the approval of a regulator. That is technically possible, but it
would mean that the representative bodies would be brought under, for
example, the Law Society&#146;s regulatory
activities.</div>
					<a name="07061442000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon asked what discussions I have had with the
professions. Last year, there was an event involving the Law Society,
the Institute of Professional Willwriters, the Society of Will Writers
and Estate Planning Practitioners and some of the consumer
organisations. It was accepted that, although there is currently no
statutory regulation of will writing, the Legal Services Board will be
able to recommend that the Secretary of State bring it under such
regulation.</div>
					<a name="07061442000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That event
was followed in May last year by another that was hosted by the Office
of Fair Trading and the DCA, which was attended by the same
organisations. The possibility of enabling people to apply to the OFT
under its voluntary code scheme was suggested. For the sake of the hon.
Member for Enfield, Southgate, I shall outline what the scheme does.
Obviously, it is not as strict as statutory regulation, which reflects
the fact that different types of work need different types of
regulation. The scheme aims to safeguard consumer interests by helping
them to identify businesses that have a higher standard of customer
care. By signing up to the approved code, a trader has agreed to
provide the consumer with the benefits outlined in the code, which
include clear pre-sale information&#151;I know that, like me, the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has advocated that at
length&#151;fair contracts and access to independent redress
mechanisms. Those are the key issues that were identified in improving
will-writing services. The code offers higher levels of consumer
service than are required at present. The organisations are considering
whether to take it on board, although I understand that many are
waiting for the Bill to achieve Royal Assent before they go any
further.</div>
					<a name="07061442000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is for
those reasons that, much as I appreciate the examples that have been
given, I cannot ask the Committee to accept the amendments. This would
be an ideal issue for the consumer panel to consider and, if it felt
that there was some systematic failure, to make recommendations to the
Legal Services Board. I cannot in all honesty recommend that we accept
it today, because we have no concrete evidence of sucha
failure, so I ask the Committee to reject the
amendments.</div>

Djanogly:
						</b> This has been an interesting debate. I have an
open mind on the subject. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw said that he
was not sure where I was coming from, but we needed to have the debate
and so tabling a probing amendment was worth while. The debate has
proven that to be the case. I have some sympathy with the
Minister&#146;s point of view, and she eloquently explained how
evidence is needed, ultimately, in order to regulate. I think that it
is, and I was supported in that by the comment made by my hon. Friend
the Member for North-West Norfolk that one should not regulate unless
it is required and that there should be evidence for it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>

Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey and my hon. Friends did not
make many valid points&#151;many were made, but many were anecdotal.
I have not received any complaints about will writers, and I have
received many objections to and complaints about various parts of the
Bill. I am not saying that such complaints do not exist, but I have
received none and I have not heard anyone else mention a particular
complaint.</div>
					<a name="07061442000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note
that clause 12(6) allows further legal activities to be added in due

that we can return to the subject. There are ways in which we can check
some of the things that the Minister said. If the hon. Gentleman
intends to withdraw the amendment, I will not resist that today, but I

							<a name="07061442000512"></a>Simon

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I would like to raise a question that comes
up only in this clause. Is it logical in 2007 and beyond in England and
Wales to separate into profession or activity some of the issues that
are in the list in clause 12(1)? There are currently six issues
inthe
list:</div>
					<a name="07061442000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a) the
exercise of a right of
audience;</div>
					<a name="07061442000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) the
conduct of
litigation;</div>
					<a name="07061442000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
reserved instrument
activities;</div>
					<a name="07061442000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d)
probate
activities;</div>
					<a name="07061442000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e)
notarial activities;</div>
					<a name="07061442000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">(f) the administration of
oaths&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061442000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask two
questions. First, is it clear in clause 12 and onwards&#151;and the
minister can take advice on this&#151;that we are not seeking to
alter the fact that under the current system lay people can act for
themselves? Obviously, one should be allowed to do as much as possible.
There are rules about which court a person can appear in as a litigant
and so on. I want it to be made clear in the Bill that we are not in
any way saying that people should not be able to do their own thing
where they can. Courts police that and judges ensure that people do not
abuse the process. Although 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>litigants in person are often difficult, I hope that we all understand
that that system should continue. Will the Minister make it absolutely
clear that individuals will still be allowed to represent themselves in
all those areas?</div>
					<a name="07061442000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
more technical point is this. I understand why, historically, there
were people who carried out the administration of oaths and why there
were notaries public. I exclude the Minister&#146;s advisers who, I
assume, are wise on these things, but I bet that, if I asked the
Committee, colleagues in the House and people on the street what a
notary does, or is entitled to do and what the difference is between a
notary and a solicitor, the chance of getting the right answer would be
about 1 per cent. Likewise, if &#147;administrator of oaths&#148;
is on a plate outside a door, would that person be a solicitor? Often,
the plate will say &#147;solicitors&#148;. It may say
&#147;solicitors&#148;, &#147;notaries public&#148; or
&#147;solicitors, notaries public and administrators of
oaths&#148;. I may be about to offend some great and august
organisations that represent the notaries and administrators of oaths,
but, if we are trying to act in the interest of the consumer, it seems
to me that we ought to put them all in one place professionally. If
someone wants an oath or an affidavit sworn&#151;I am not talking
here about being a witness to somebody&#151;logically, they should
not have to think, &#147;Do I need to go to this place? Is this
authorised or regulated?&#148;. There should be one group of people
who offer a broad range of legal services similar to that of a
traditional solicitor. It is time to have administrators of oaths,
notaries public and solicitors all doing one job so that all the people
who offer those services, although they are separate jobs, will be in
the same professional organisations.</div>
					<a name="07061442000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful if the
Minister would put onthe record, probably as much for my
education and elucidation as other people&#146;s, what notarial
activities are. I know that we will hear definitions of such terms
later on, but I do not think that we have a separate definition of
notarial activities. I will probably be shown later that we do. We all
understand what administrators of oaths do: they are people before whom
we can swear an oath. But do they do anything else? We all understand
what it means to exercise the right of audience. I presume that we all
understand the conduct of litigation and probate activities. This is a
plea, first, for the Minister to reflect, possibly out loud, on advice,
on whether it is time to roll those things together in the consumer
interest and secondly for her to think about whether we need to provide
different arrangements, definitions and so on. In the interests of
simplicity, we are regulating the legal profession and sorting out
legal services. Let us seize the moment and get rid of a bit of history
that, although it may have been relevant in the past, is no longer
justified or logical, as far as I know, in the
present.</div>

						</b> As the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey says, six activities are reserved under the Bill. They are
all currently regulated and will be overseen by the Legal Services
Board, once established. Anyone who carries on or pretends to be
entitled to carry on any of the relevant activities will be guilty of
an offence under clauses 14, 16, and 17.</div>

					<a name="07061442000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I direct the hon. Gentleman to
schedule 2, as he suggested I might, which defines the scope of the
reserved activities. Paragraph 7 of schedule 2 contains a definition of
activities relating to legal systemsin other jurisdictions,
which are therefore different activities from many others carried out
by solicitors. However, I have some sympathy with what the hon.
Gentleman said about there being a one-stop shop, and all the rest of
it, if that were possible. I am reminded of the classic question for
law students about whether there should be a unified profession. I
thought that he was going down that road, but this Committee is not the
place to develop that
debate.</div>
					<a name="07061442000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Lord
Chancellor can extend the list of reserved activities under clause 24
and, under clause 26, the board can ask the Lord Chancellor to remove
an activity from the list. For example, if probate appeared never to
cause anybody any problems whatsoever, it would be possible for the
board to recommend to the Lord Chancellor that it be outwith the
designated list. I call the Committee&#146;s attention to subsection
(3), which is important and sets the scope for the activities that
would be regulated by the board in
future.</div>

fact no statutory definition of notarial activities. The requirement is
not one that derives from English law, but from foreign
jurisdictions&#151;not from England and Wales or Scotland, but mostly
from Latin countries such as Spain or Italy. They are the jurisdictions

						</b> Indeed. In practical, everyday terms, however, I
think that the hon. Gentleman is slightly doing down the role of
notaries. By the way, they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>heavily used in Germany too, not only in Latin countries. Although their
purpose on the continent is to document agreements, if people in this
country want to enter into contracts with a party on the continent,
they often have to go to notaries. The result is that they are used
frequently in this country by people doing business in Europe. There
are not that many notaries, but those that exist tend to fulfil a
useful role.</div>

							<a name="07061442000522"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I have absolutely no doubt that they fulfil a
useful role and I am sure that I shall personally discover all the
notaries in England and Wales as they will now make themselves known to
me and justify their fantastic work. I absolutely understand that
people who practise law in one country and dealwith another
need a cross-referencing professional qualification. My understanding
is that the entire range of non-common law jurisdictions has the
notarial facility&#151;Italy and Spain, France and Germany, the low
countries and so on, as well as Scandinavia and all the rest; in fact,
all European Union countries except probably the common law countries:
the UK, Cyprus and Malta.</div>

If we are modernising and reforming legal services, this might

today, the law might be changed sooner as a result of today&#146;s
little poke at the system.</div>

					<a name="07061442000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reasoning behind clause 13(4) is that, as thehon. Member for
North-West Norfolk might remember, there were some horrific examples of
dubious characters giving appallingly bad advice to people regarding

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000534"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> I have two observations to make about the clause.
The impersonating of a solicitor can lead to an individual being locked
up and further increase the pressures on the prison community. Clearly,
that is in order but, as for solicitors being disciplined, last year
there were 743 matters against 1,094 individuals that had a
disciplinary issue recorded against a solicitor and a further 495
matters involved 529 individuals that referred to other bodies,
including the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Association of
Chief Police
Officers.</div>
					<a name="07061442000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often, such
matters do not need to be put in the public domain. For example,
disapprovals, warnings, reprimands and severe reprimands can be kept
private and confidential. The public&#151;even the initial
complainant who has provided information&#151; need not be, and often
is not, informed of that. Does the Minister consider that the issue
needs to be looked at further even though the law is more than
protecting the solicitor or other legal professional as it rightly does
under the clause with appropriate strict measures? I commend her on
that. We must also ensure that in a large number of cases&#151;much
more than has been suggested in Committee&#151;such matters should be
made public.</div>
					<a name="07061442000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point concerns when the Government have acted as an employer through
the Department of Trade and Industry in coal mining cases. There have
been several examples when people have gone to those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>whom they believe to be solicitors and the Government have entertained
cases being brought forward as ifon a common law basis,
including more than 10,000 industrial deafness cases brought by a
private company called Vendside Ltd. People often think that
theyhave a solicitor representing them when they do not.
Should not the Government look at their own practises that may be
encouraging people whom some of my constituents, and many others,
believe to be impersonating solicitors? That is apparent both in the
hearing loss claims and in respect of claims handlers, who people are
still coming to me about, believing them to be solicitors when they are
not, who have been allowed to take cases to the Government under the
coal mining claims handling
agreement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000535"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Once the Bill becomes law, does the Minister
envisage that she or I, or anybody, would be able to go to a website
and check the name of somebody who said that they were John Mann or
Simon Hughes, for example, and were competent as a probate solicitor,
or whatever? Will there be one place where people can check on an
up-to-date, guaranteed-to-be-correct database whether people are
approved and regulated? Again, if we are trying to make life easy, we
need a list, giving details of who is legitimately carrying out the
activities, which can always be relied on, then people would be much
less likely to carry on activities illegally and end up in the courts
as a
result.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000536"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> I just want to make the Committee aware that the
penalties are consistent with those in the Compensation Act 2006 in
respect of regulated claims management. Criminal convictions are a
matter of public record and in that sense would be available to all. I
cannot go as far as the hon. Gentleman has asked me to and guarantee
that the relevant information would be available or that people could
see on a website whether a person has the right to carry out a reserved
legal activity. However, that matter runs parallel with another that he
raised earlier, about people being able to know when they walk through
the solicitor&#146;s door what individuals do. People can check their
solicitor&#146;s credentials by going to the Law Society&#146;s
website. It maintains a list of all solicitors that are properly
qualified. This part of the Bill extends that provision to cover
everyone involved in the new
framework.</div>

						</b> If I want somebody to do some plumbing, I know
that the person who comes to do the central heating boiler, or
whatever, will need to conform with the CORGI registration scheme,
under which plumbers are CORGI-registered. Again, I should like the
Minister to reflect on whether the objective should be for people to be
able to check at any time whether anybody in the legal services field
is, on that date, registered to do the job on the official list. Data
systems are never perfect. However, given that the purpose of the Bill
is to establish an umbrella in relation to reserved legal activities,
with the Legal Services Board regulating all the people involved, the
consumer interest must be that people should be able to go to one place
and should not have to duck and dive. We are talking about people who
are not familiar with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>the places the professionals inhabit and do not necessarily understand
the distinction. Perhaps the Minister could reflect on that, because if

					<a name="07061442000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We do not intend the
Bill to regulate in any way lay trade union representation, whether
whole or part-time in the workplace, nor to place additional burdens on
those unions that provide legal advice or representation to their
members.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 6
December 2006; Vol. 687,c.
1167.]</div>
					<a name="07061442000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are doing
that because unions are in a different position from most legal
services providers. They carry out a great deal of work through
officials in the workplace, who are usually elected by colleagues
rather than professional union staff and are working at some distance
from the union&#146;s head office, and they do it in a specific
context.</div>
					<a name="07061442000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I need to say
this not so much for my colleagueson the Government side of
the Committee but for Members of the Opposition who may not be as aware
of trade unions and their remit as the rest of us are. Although a union
official may give advice, the purpose is not just to help the member.
It is part of the wider role of fostering good labour relations. The
officialin that situation can advise only members, retired
members and family members and no one else. The union does not offer
that service to the general public. I want to say that up front because
that might be an area in which some of the argument will be fought out.
The union is giving advice only to its own
members.</div>
					<a name="07061442000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">One other
feature that the Opposition need to remember is that unions are already
regulated by the certification process. The work of officials is
governed by the union&#146;s rule book, and that is enforced through
the certification officer. Therefore, unions that provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>legal services do not need the same degree of regulation as bodies that
are offering services more widely or
commercially.</div>

						</b> A member of a union is someone who pays the
union levy, abides by the union rulebook, and works
collectively with other members of that union and, sometimes,
inter-collectively with colleagues in other unions. It also applies to
relations of a particular member and people who have been members of a

Minister&#146;s description of this type of legal service was on the
basis that it was limited and non-commercial. Surely if there was a
competing legal service or a new service, the regulation would be
applied in a very limited way to its members on a non-commercial basis.
Would they also be exempt from regulation in the same way as
unions?</div>

						</b> I do not know which part of the Lords debate the
hon. Gentleman is referring to. It was during the debate on Second
Reading that the Lord Chancellor signalled that we would exempt trade
unions. We have had continued discussions with the TUC and the Law
Society, which has raised concerns about the issue. That is why the
amendments have come 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>forward at this stage&#151;in part, because the TUC was concerned that
the way in which the Bill was originally set up did not achieve what
the Lord Chancellor said that it would achieve. In fact, if the hon.
Gentleman refers to column 1167 of the <i class="I">Official Report </i>of the
Second Reading debate in the other place, he will find what the Lord
Chancellor said. We have had important discussions with the TUC and the
Law Society about the position of trade unions. That is why it has
taken some time to come to the present position.</div>
					<a name="07061442000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision will allow
employed lawyers to work, for example, for bodies linked to their
employers, such as subsidiary companies, for colleagues, or on a pro
bono basis, without their employers needing to be treated as providers
of legal services. The Bill will enable the work of those employed
lawyers to continue as now. However, there are tight restrictions on
that exception, which applies only if the provision of legal services
to the public is not part of the employer&#146;s
business.</div>
					<a name="07061442000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the point about other bodies thatmight be non-commercial, the
problem would be in identifying that the work that such bodies were
doing was absolutely confined to members only. However, if such bodies
were working for a section of the public, they would not secure an
exemption under the Bill.</div>

						</b> The Minister makes the point about such bodies
being limited to advice given to members, but can she help us on how
&#147;members&#148; will be defined in that context? I ask that
because, in a debate referring to miners&#146; compensation claims,
the hon. Member for North Durham properly highlighted the extraordinary
situation of the National Union of Mineworkersin Durham, which
had a large number of associate members. It seemed that they were
members of the union, but they paid only an access fee, simply for some
legal services, and had no voting rights within the union, as far as
was ascertainable. How will she ensure that what appears to have been,
in effect, a bogus membership arrangement is dealt with? Could unions
provide legal services to associate members, such as those in the
Durham NUM, without being caught by the
provision?</div>

consider. I accept that the certification officer regulates trade
unions, but I say to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>my hon. Friend the Minister that I got a letter today from the
certification officer telling me that the fully paid-up membership of

officer&#146;s letter to me did not answer my question about what
rights the individuals concerned have. I do not think that they are
covered by the definition of a member of a trade union, which, as I
understand it, means someone who voluntarily joins a union to get its
benefits. They joined on associate membership with no rights whatever,
so the matter needs clearing
up.</div>

point is that reserved activities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>will still need to be carried out by authorised persons&#151;in other
words, by qualified lawyers. They will still be subject to full

						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham said,
from a sedentary position, that it happens every day. I do not know
whether that is the case, but I know that it happens fairly regularly.
The most obvious example is that of personal injury cases, which
involve trade union attendance in court on behalf of members. I am told
that the unions use outside firms to conduct that litigation most of
the time.</div>
					<a name="07061442000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
qualified lawyers is already subject to all the rules of the
regulators, and any rule change made by those regulators would apply
equally to the union lawyers as to everyone else. It would always be
open to a trade union to seek to be licensed under the low-risk
provisions in part 5 of the Bill, and they mightchoose to do
so if they wished to provide services commercially or to a wider
section of the public. I suspect that they would not, because it would
probably not be in their financial interests to do so. However, a
further situation in which they might seek a licence would be if they
were not content with the rulesunder which the approved
regulators regulated their employed
lawyers.</div>
					<a name="07061442000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might also
reassure the Committee to know that the Office for Legal Complaints
will be able to handle 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>complaints about union services. Many unions provide only a very basic
legal service to their members and use outside firms for other

forward, but not for those 1,400 because their claims disappeared. To
whom would those women complain? A similar case would be one in which,
say, an individual was advised by the union that they did not have a

claim against the union itself through the union mechanism. If a lawyer
gives legal advice in the capacity that my hon. Friend mentioned, the
complaint could go through the Law Society&#146;s complaints
mechanism. The Law Society could even, for example, make its rules more
restrictive. That would limit the union&#146;s ability to provide
reserved services. There would be two mechanisms&#151;the first
through the certification officer and the other through the lawyer
following the rules of his or her legal authority&#151;in this case,

							<a name="07061442000591"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> The Government amendments to clause 15 and other
measures winged their way to the Opposition a few days ago from out of
the blue. Frankly, they have come as something as a shock to us. Rather
than making special provision for unions within the regulatory
framework, the amendments go further to explicitly exclude unions from
regulation. Is that justified? We say that it is not. The amendments
are a clear example of the Labour party kow-towing to its union
paymasters, flying in the face of reason, considerations of fairness to
the consumer, and frightening recent experiences, not least those
highlighted by the hon. Member for North Durham in a recent Adjournment
debate in which I also
spoke.</div>
					<a name="07061442000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
hon. Member for North Durham will speak on the issue. In the debate on
coal health claims on 23 May, he showed how certain trade unions abuse
their unregulated position. For the Government to amend the Bill to
abolish regulations on trade unions is
outrageous.</div>
					<a name="07061442000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
talk about vested interests. The Conservatives have no objection to the
mechanisms by which trade unions and commercial entities may provide
legal services, as long as there is proper regulation to protect the
public and individual consumers. Under the original Bill, trade unions,
like every other non-lawyer body wishing to provide reserved legal
services, would have to do so as an alternative business structure
firm. The Bill now makes special provisions for trade unions to reflect
their constitutions. In particular, it excludes trade unions from the
requirement for a head of financial administration or a head of legal
practice. That approach arose from the Government&#146;s view that
trade unions should be able to provide reserved legal services, rather
than having them establish ring-fenced subsidiaries to do so, as
commercial providers of legal services are likely to
do.</div>
					<a name="07061442000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite those
special provisions for trade unions in the alternative business
structure regime, the TUC has apparently been unhappy about the
principle of trade union legal services being subject to any
regulation. It argues that it would be inappropriate for unions to be
regulated by a legal services board, and claims that unions are
effectively regulated by the trade union certification officer. The
TUC, however, has no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>difficulty with the proposition that individual lawyers providing
services will be regulated as individuals by the relevant approved
regulator. I shall return to the matter of the trade union
certification
officer.</div>
					<a name="07061442000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trade
unions point in particular to the possibility that, if they were
required to become an ABS under the Bill, advice on potential
employment disputes given by lay shop stewards could fall within the
ambit of regulation. That is arguable. From their point of view, it is
undesirable for such advice to fall within legal services regulation.
However, there are two ways in which such advice could be exempted
without needing to exempt trade unions from the provisions of the Bill
altogether. First, trade unions could provide reserved legal services
through a wholly owned ring-fenced entity, which would obviously not
include the lay advisers. Secondly, there could be a specific provision
in the Bill exempting lay &#145;shop floor&#146; advice from the
ambit of
regulation.</div>

Hemming:
						</b> I am confused, again, about regulated legal
services and legal services. A few moments ago, it appeared that advice
was not a regulated legal service. If that is so, informal advice from
the union convenors would never be regulated, unless it were added as a
regulated legal service under clause 24. Therefore, most of the debate
about advice is
otiose.</div>

							<a name="07061442000593"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I
shall be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views on that. I
speculate that such advice would probably be in connection with
litigation, but I look forward to the Minister confirming that that is
so.</div>
					<a name="07061442000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trade unions
pressed for a wider exemption. However, the Government&#146;s
intention to concede that only appeared in the Minister&#146;s
statement on Second Reading. I put on the record that the Conservative
party is thoroughly unimpressed with the
Government&#146;s lack of transparency and their lack of consultation
on this issue.</div>
					<a name="07061442000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
been told that, in discussions with the Ministry of Justice and the
TUC, the Law Society considered the possibility of an exemption for
legal work that was ancillary to the trade unions&#146; collective
bargaining role. That would mean that the trade union would not be
required to become an ABS to pursue litigation arising out of an
employment dispute, an injury at work and so on. Even then, the
individual lawyer would, of course, be regulated. However, on advice
from the SRA, the Law Society concluded that it is unwise for there to
be such an exemption. I shall return to the SRA&#146;s view on that
later.</div>
					<a name="07061442000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SRA is,
with the Law Society&#146;s support, increasingly moving towards the
regulation of the entities through which legal services are provided,
rather than just the regulation of individuals. It is difficult to
regulate to ensure proper quality of service and client care by
regulating individual lawyers alone, rather than the entity through
which they provide legal services. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw gave a
good example of that. Accordingly, it does not make sense for services
provided by trade unions to be exempted from that approach and it
certainly cannot be assumed that there are no problems with services
provided by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>trade unions. Some unions&#146; roles in the miners&#146;
compensation cases has caused particular
concern.</div>
					<a name="07061442000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is to what extent the certification officer can regulate the union. We
agree with many, including the Law Society, that any regulation
undertaken by the certification officer cannot possibly fill this gap.
The certification officer cannot realistically deal with issues about
client care or quality of service as they relate to legal services.
Indeed, the certification officer does not appear to have been able to
help with the issues arising in the miners&#146; compensation cases.
The Minister, in her earlier remarks, failed to deal with that or with
the related point made by the hon. Member for
Bassetlaw.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000594"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the
certification officer could not act in relation to the miners&#146;
compensation claims because the claimants were not members of the
union, but ex-members? On that basis, he said that he could not take up
the
case.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000595"></a>Mr.

						</b> In the particular circumstance that the hon.
Gentleman mentions, I accept that that may be
so.</div>
					<a name="07061442000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not accept
that unions do not, in practice, sometimes act as claims handlers. This
matter arose in the debate secured by the hon. Member for North Durham,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst mentioned in
his earlier
intervention.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000596"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> But if unions act as claims handlers, as the Durham
National Union of Miners certainly does, they would have to be
registered under the new Compensation Act 2006&#151;and I understand
that they have gone for regulation under that
act.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000597"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> Again, I agree that those are particular
circumstances in relation to claims handling for which regulation may
well be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07061442000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendment goes far beyond even what was discussed by
officials. It will exempt trade unions from the requirement to become
an ABS in relation to all services provided to members, former members
and relatives of members, provided that those services were part of the
membership package, whether or not they were part of the employment
relationship.</div>
					<a name="07061442000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have emphasised that trade unions will have to provide
reserved services through qualified persons. I think that the Minister
confirmed that earlier. We assume that those qualified persons will be
fully subject to the regulatory requirements of their professional
bodies. If that assumption is correct, the SRA or another regulatory
body may conclude that the public interest requires lawyers to provide
particular reserved services to trade union members only in a regulated
environment. In that case the SRA could, as it can now, make rules to
that effect. Those rules would, of course, require the approval of the
Legal Services Board and could therefore be made only if there were a
demonstrable regulatory need for them and the proposed restriction was
a proportionate
response.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07061442000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
amendments do not preclude a trade union from becoming an ABS or
establishinga separate, wholly owned vehicle that would itself

<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>become an ABS to provide reserved legal services to members.
Accordingly, if regulators concluded that lawyers employed by trade
unions should provide particular reserved services to members only
through a regulated entity, unions would readily be able to adapt.
There is thus no risk that such a decision by regulators would preclude
trade unions from providing particular legal services to members. Will
the Minister confirm that that is the intended effect of the
amendments?</div>
					<a name="07061442000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
discussed those matters with the Law Society, I then thought that I
should approach the SRA, as it has an important part to play and its
view is pertinent to the issue. It is important to put its response on
record. It asks hon. Members to reject the amendment, which it
says</div>
					<a name="07061442000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will have the
effect of exempting trade unions from being regulated in the same way
as other bodies who provide legal services to the extent that they
provide such services to their
membership.</div>
					<a name="07061442000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">The SRA
are opposed to any route that would exempt trade unions from Part 5 in
relation to reserved legal activities. The SRA&#146;s view is that
trade union members deserve the same protection in relation to reserved
activities as any other consumer of legal
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061442000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">It states that
it opposes an amendment effectively stating that activities are
reserved legal activities when done by an in-house solicitor but not
when done by a union. The issue, it states,
is</div>
					<a name="07061442000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a matter of
principle&#151;the principle that the Bill is seeking to achieve for
the future, and the principle envisaged by the Clementi Report. This
principle is that any organisation providing reserved legal services to
the public or a section of the public needs to be properly and
proportionately
regulated.&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000598"></a>Stephen
Hesford:
						</b> I am listening with care to what the hon.
Gentleman is saying. Is he making a point about competition&#151;that
the amendments will somehow give trade unions an unfair competitive
advantage&#151;or a consumer protection point? If it is the latter,
does he have any evidence from union members that they want protection
from their own unions? Or is he making both
points?</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000599"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I had not thought about the competition aspects,
but that might be an angle tobe considered. Has the Minister
received any representations on that? It might be a relevant issue to
discuss. On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second question, we can take
the issue of miners&#146; compensation. Thousands of so-called
members have a serious problem with the way they have been treated, and
many of them want their membership subscriptions returned to them by
their unions.</div>
					<a name="07061442000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Clementi report considered that the new principle whereby both bodies
and individuals are regulated should apply to both new commercial
bodies providing reserved legal services and not-for-profit
organisations such as law centres and trade unions. It recognised that
otherwise, there would be gaps in the regulation intended to protect
consumers and the public interest. The SRA has argued that exempting
certain providers of reserved services from the consumer protections of
regulation should be done only in exceptional circumstances, when there
is clear evidence of public interest. To do otherwise would be to place
the interests of providers above those of consumers. The example of
abuse by trade unions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>during the coal miners&#146; compensation scandal shows why exemptions
are
dangerous.</div>
					<a name="07061442000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the SRA, the concessions already made in the Bill in relation to the
regulation of trade unions and other low-risk bodies will ensure that
the regulation is proportionate. It agrees that the concerns of the TUC
about the position of lay advisers in the workforce are legitimate. The
SRA believes that the non-reserved legal activities of lay advisers can
safely be exempted from the ambit of part 5 of the Bill on the proviso
that the union organises the activities of such advisers so that they
are not subject to the supervision of a solicitor or an authorised
person. It assumes that that is currently the case for shop stewards,
other local representatives and elected national
officials.</div>
					<a name="07061442000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SRA
believes that that may be achieved by providing that legal
advice&#151;not a reserved legal activity&#151;given by union
representatives who are employees and not acting in the capacity of
authorised persons or under the supervision of an authorised person
should be defined as not being &#147;legal activities&#148; for the
purpose of the Bill. It believes that amendments could be made to
ensure that such work would be entirely outside the concerns of part
5.</div>
					<a name="07061442000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SRA says that
the Government believe that the regulation of the individual lawyers by
their respective approved regulators is sufficient. The SRA disagrees
with that view. Its powers in relation to the individual solicitors it
authorises do not provide full consumer protection. Also, in-house
teams include individuals who are regulated by different approved
regulators and subject to different rules and protections. The
Bill&#146;s main objective is to provide that the same consumer
protections and rules benefit those receiving legal services from an
organisation. It should not matter whether the service was provided by
a solicitor, barrister or licensed
conveyancer.</div>
					<a name="07061442000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current situation in which in-house solicitors can do restricted types
of work because the organisation is not subject to regulation is very
much a second best for consumers. It is the lesser of two evils under
the current statutory framework, and we do not believe that it gives
appropriate scope for the work of the union solicitor, nor that it
gives the right level of protection for the client and the public.
Ensuring that a trade union that chooses to provide such reserved legal
services through authorised employees is within the part 5 regime would
perfect the current imperfect powers of the SRA and other approved
regulators.</div>
					<a name="07061442000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give an
example, based on experience, the SRA sets out what it hoped would be a
rare, but possible, scenario. A trade union provides, through its
in-house legal team, litigation and advocacy services relating to
occupational disease cases. There is evidence that a union employee has
written to members making claims, telling them precisely what to say to
medical examiners, apparently whether true or not. It is not clear
whether the in-house lawyers providing the litigation and advocacy
services were aware of or complicit in the sending of the letters, or
whether union officials were aware or whether it was simply the work of
one employee. It goes without saying that writing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>such a letter in the context of litigation goes to the heart of
upholding the proper administration of justice and is a serious
matter.</div>
					<a name="07061442000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, in the
example, the SRA regulated only the in-house solicitor and not the
union, and the Bar Council regulated the in-house barrister, then any
investigation would have to relate to that individual solicitor and
barrister. Problems may arise in seeking information, documents and
explanations from other employees or union officials to be able to get
a complete picture of who was responsible for what. Any interview with
others to help find out what the solicitor&#146;s involvement was
would largely
voluntary.</div>
					<a name="07061442000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there
was evidence that the solicitor was complicit, disciplinary action
would be taken against the solicitor, which might result in the
solicitor being struck off. That would take the solicitor out of the
union, but would not prevent the union from continuing to provide
reserved legal services through other authorised persons.</div>
					<a name="07061442000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an in-house barrister was
also a member ofthe team, the Bar Standards Board would have
to undertake a separate investigation into the conduct of that
barrister. No action could be taken by the SRA or the Bar Standards
Board against any union official or employee. They could not prevent
the union from providing reserved legal activities through authorised
employees.</div>
					<a name="07061442000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the SRA,
or another licensing authority, regulated both the union&#146;s legal
activities and the lawyers, the powers of investigation under the part
5 regime would allow for a full investigation of all involved. There
would be rights of access to all documents and rights to interview all
employees. That would allow the SRA to determine appropriate
responsibility. It could take disciplinary or regulatory action against
the lawyers and it could take action in relation to non-lawyer
employees and in relation to the union itself. If there were concerns
about the union&#146;s fitness to provide reserved legal services,
its licence to provide those services could be withdrawn. The current
situation is a disgraceful state of affairs and wholly without
justification. I shall recommend that my hon. Friends vote against the
amendment, with the aim that the Government have a rethink, but this
time, I hope, with consultation.</div>
					<a name="07061442000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">In recent days, a group of
concerned regulators has been asking the Minister for clarification on
how such an unacceptable set-up would work in practice. I therefore end
my comments with an excerpt from a letter that the president of the Law
Society sent to the Minister three days ago, on 11 June. I shall not
quote the whole letter, but just the key points, which
state:</div>
					<a name="07061442000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government
has proposed an amendment to the Bill which goes far beyond even what
was discussed between officials. The Government&#146;s amendment
would exempt trade unions froma requirement to become an
ABS...As you made clear on2nd Reading, trade unions will
have to provide reserved services through qualified persons. As we read
the amendments,the qualified persons concerned will remain
fully subject to the regulatory requirements of their professional
body. So if the SRA...concluded that the public interest required
that lawyers should provide particular reserved legal services to trade
union members only through a regulated environment, they
could&#151;as they can now&#151;make rules to that effect. Any such
rules would of course require the approval of the Legal Services Board,
and so could only be made if there was a demonstrable regulatory need
for them.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>
					<a name="07061442000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">As we read the amendments, there
is nothing to stop a trade union from becoming an ABS&#151;or from
establishing a separate, wholly owned vehicle which would itself become
an ABS&#151;in order to provide reserved legal services to members.
Accordingly if regulators did conclude that lawyers employed by trade
unions should provide particular reserved services to members only
through a regulated entity, trade unions would readily be able to adapt
to that, and continue to provide whatever legal services they wish to
their members.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061442000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Now we are getting
down to the nub of the situation. I would appreciate hearing whether
the Minister agrees with what the Law Society said.</div>
					<a name="07061442000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government need to be more
transparent about their intentions, which remain opaque. If the
intention is that the Bill should entrench trade unions&#146; ability
to provide legal services to their members through lawyers without any
need for regulation of the entity through which those services are
provided, that would represent an unjustified special treatment of
trade unions that would be contrary to the public and consumer interest
and difficult to understand on any rational basis. If, however, the
intention is simply to leave the questionof the extent to
which trade unions&#146; legal services should be provided through a
regulated entity to be determined by the structures established by the
Bill, that would less problematic, although we should still like the
Government to set out exactly what they
propose.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000600"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> Actually, I support the amendment. The hon. Member
for Huntingdon has just shown his lack of understanding of how trade
unions operate, although he has raised some points that I agree with,
and which I should like the Minister to clarify. The way in which trade
unions are organised is quite different from how commercial operations
are organised. My experience, as someone who used to run legal services
for a trade union, but who is not a legally qualified solicitor, is
that most of the time, most trade unions employ lawyers and barristers
to fight cases in courts and tribunals.</div>
					<a name="07061442000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes, test cases are taken
that the individual would not be able to fund without the support of
the trade union. I sometimes used to wince when I had to sign cheques
for expensive barristers, but on certain occasions they were well worth
it, because of the amount of compensation in the test cases that they
won and because the precedents set were important. In those cases,
although a trade union is employing those solicitors, it will be
covered by regulation. The unions are not exempt at all, and I would
think that that would be the bulk of their work.</div>
					<a name="07061442000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other side of the matter is
something that I do not think that it would be helpful to bring into
legislation, and that is the advice given by the trade union in
workplaces by lay representatives at internal disciplinary meetings and
industrial tribunals. I usedto go to industrial tribunals
every week, even thoughI was never legally qualified, unlike
some of the esteemed barristers against whom I used to come up. I had a
good strike rate, and beat a few of them.</div>

					<a name="07061442000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
issue about in-house lawyers, and I need it clarifying in my own
mind.</div>
				
					<a name="07061442000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">If they are a qualified lawyer, they will
clearly be regulated, because they will be a member of the Law Society
and will fall within the ambit of the regulation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>My confusion is over whether a lawyer acting on behalf of a trade union
and conducting work solely on behalf of that union is exempt as an
individual. We need some clarification. I suspect that the answer is
that they are not. If we are not careful, we could take regulation into
areas where it would not help to bring access to justice for many
people, nor good industrial relations.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000601"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman has experience of trade
unions, and when he said that they frequently employ barristers I took
that to mean that the barristers were employed by the trade unions as
employees. He is saying now that the trade unions contract with
solicitors who contract with self-employed barristers. There is no
contract between the trade union and the barrister, not that that is
particularly relevant. However, it is relevant that it would not even
fall under regulated legal services because the trade union employees,
acting for the trade union, might offer advice but would not conduct
litigation or exercise a right of audience. The employees of the trade
union would give that work to a firm of solicitors. The hon. Gentleman
has more experience of trade union legal services than I do, so will he
tell me whether there are any circumstances in which a trade union has
an employee who is a barrister who goes to court to represent members
of the trade
union?</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000602"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I do not speak on behalf of every trade union, but
I have never been aware of a barrister who is employed directly by a
trade union. What used to happen in the cases on which I used to engage
barristers was that we got to know some of them quite well, so we would
select them to do specialist work on specialist pieces of law. They
were not employees of the union, but were engaged case by case.
However, when unions have to deal with certain areas of industrial
injury law, certainly, they employ the same barrister on quite a few
occasions because they are usually the best for the job.</div>
					<a name="07061442000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another area that needs
clarifying is what is defined as membership. The certification of an
officer is weak. I do not want to over-regulate the sector, but, for
example, people buy into so-called membership of Durham area
NUM&#151;they are associate members. They have no rights as a defined
member, but pay &#163;20 a year to access a legal service. The hon.
Member for Huntingdon will wonder how they get redress, and I have got
redress for them so far by going after the solicitors through the legal
complaints service, to the great anger of the law firm in question as
it has to pay the money out rather than the NUM. At the moment, that is
how I can get justice for those members.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000603"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> Clearly, that leads to the question of whether
it is fair that the solicitors have to pay for the
union.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000604"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> The answer is yes, because they should have known
better than to enter into such a relationship with the NUM.</div>
					<a name="07061442000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The canteen lady case and the
Durham NUM case are useful in illustrating that a gap exists. If people
have no trade union rights by means of which they can vote 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>people out or have any say, where do they go? I support the exemption,
but we need clarity on the meaning of membership.</div>
					<a name="07061442000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Things can get a bit fuzzy in
the area of the legal services that are provided for family members and
in the definition of family members. Some trade unions have a wide
definition, whereas others restrict the definition to spouses and
immediate family. A related matter is that of the time when someone
becomes a member. I am aware of cases in which people have joined a
trade union to obtain legal services, even though the legal services
started first and the people concerned might have stopped paying.
Again, some clarity is needed.</div>
					<a name="07061442000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, union legal services
are being extended, and I do not think for one minute that we should
diminish the access to justice that they provide&#151;at low cost to
the public purse&#151;to many thousands of people every year who
otherwise would not have access to justice. The hon. Member for
Huntingdon made a point about trade unions gathering steam. I can say
from personal experience that, if a trade union gives bad legal advice,
there is recourse for the individual to sue the trade union for
negligence. In the case of my own union, such an action cost it quite a
lot of money on one occasion. There are one or two routes that are open
to individuals to obtain redress for bad advice, other than through
certification
officers.</div>
					<a name="07061442000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Minister none the less to clarify the position on associate members,
because that is an issue that could come back to haunt us, and I want
to avoid situations in which we leave grey areas or loose ends that
could discredit the great work done by the majority of trade
unions.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000605"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> I admit that my confusion remains, because it
still appears to me to some extent that the debate on trade unions is
about solving a problem that the Bill does not create. If the trade
unions offer legal services, they are not regulated, although I agree
that, if they offer regulated legal services, there is an issue. We

offer.</div>

Jones:
						</b> The unions are regulated. The bulk of the work that
I used to deal with was representational and was performed by
barristers or qualified solicitors, and was therefore regulated. The
other large element of work was in industrial injury cases, for which I
believe most trade unions do not employ in-house lawyers, but use
contracted-out services. There is a whole host of activities that will
be regulated by the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000607"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> They are regulated, but the important point, and
the reason why the people to whom the hon. Gentleman referred could sue
the solicitors, was because the clients of those solicitors were the
union members rather than the union. The union might pay money and
underwrite cases, particularly for test cases, and that is right. The
union might underwrite a test case because an individual member might
not be able to afford the cost. However, the actual client of the
solicitors&#146; firm would be the union member rather than the
union.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>
					<a name="07061442000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Litigation involves signing
documents, such as claim forms and so on. The claim form can be signed
by a litigant in person or by a solicitor on behalf of his client. I am
not aware that a trade union can currently sign a claim form on behalf
of a union member. It can sign one on behalf of itself, but not on a
member&#146;s behalf, and to that extent the litigation that is
initiated by a member is not being conducted by the union. There are
issues around case management and claims management, and where the
responsibility for that should lie, but that is probably not within the
ambit of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07061442000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a certain amount of experience of working with trade unions, for
instance in employment representation matters involving Unison. Unison
might customarily go into internal disputes in which there is a hearing
in a city council or some other organisation. That is not regulated.
That is not legal advice. It is not a right of audience because it is
an internal matter. It may then go to an employment tribunal. That is
not a court. There are no rights of audience; people can turn up and do
their own thing. There is no difficulty. Because individuals are not
exercising a right of audience and the person who initiates the claim
at the employment tribunal is, to a great extent, the member of the
trade union, it is not a regulated legal service. Such an issue is a
legal service, but not a regulated legal
service.</div>
					<a name="07061442000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must get
something good from the Bill. I entirely agree that the work done at a
lower level by convenors, shop stewards and the like in advising people
is not something over which we need a complex regulatory process. Let
us consider the Middlesbrough case when the trade union was sued for
settling on an equal pay claim. That raises an issue about collective
bargaining and whether the law and way in which it has evolved has
undermined it as a way forward. There are great difficulties with such
matters, but they do not fall within the ambit of the
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000608"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I know that case well. The individual trade union
member did not consider that they had received good legal advice from
the trade union, and was out to get recourse by suing the trade
union.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000609"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> Yes. In other words, that was advice. It was not
a regulated legal service. It was a legal service and thus would not
fall within the ambit of the Bill. The reality is that any sensible
trade union should have a form of negligence insurance to handle claims
against it in respect of the advice that its people
give.</div>
					<a name="07061442000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Middlesbrough case was about an equal pay claim, which is a major issue
in many urban areas specifically in respect of local authorities. Such
cases have many complications, but they involve a legal service that is
not regulated, so they would not come under the Bill. If we are trying
to solve a problem through the amendments, we must be clear about what
the problem is in the first instance. Will writing is not one such
example, but the amendments would create a situation in which we could
ask the trade union to undertake a conveyancing job. Theoretically, the
amendments require that and want matters done through an individual
rather than through an organisational
agreement.</div>

							<a name="07061442000610"></a>
								Mr.
Jones:
						</b> The trade union for which I worked did
conveyancing, but we used to give such matters to a qualified law firm
that did it on behalf of the member. The law firm would therefore be
regulated underthe
Bill.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000611"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> Exactly. If we give the work to a law firm to
handle, it would not come under the Bill and the member is the client
of the law firm. Organisations, such as the Federation of Small
Businesses, have a legal insurance scheme. A certain amount is paid
after which it will send people to lawyers for advice. The federation
would not be worried by the fact that it would suddenly have to be
regulated and authorised because the Bill will not change anything. In
essence, a deal is done with various lawyers&#151;insurance-type
schemes and the like&#151;the end result of which works reasonably
well.</div>
					<a name="07061442000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reality is
that trade unions do not offer regulated legal services at present, as
defined under the Bill. Regulated legal services are provided by firms
of lawyers. Trade unions may pay them as a third-party payment, but
they are not providing the legal services
themselves.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000612"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a good point, but a
trade union can offer regulated services itself. It could well employ
an in-house solicitor who would carry out the work effectively in the
trade union&#146;s name, but only the in-house solicitor could be
regulated.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000613"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
I am talking about what happens at the moment and those with the most
experience of running legal services. As the hon. Member for North
Durham said, usually they use a firm of solicitors. No one is saying
that such matters should move in-house. We have not identified the
problem that we are trying to solve, yet we are generating statute to
solve the problem. People may go to the union in the hope that it will
pay for some legal services for them, but the union does not, as a
rule, provide regulated legal
services.</div>
					<a name="07061442000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
question, legal services are provided by many people. They are provided
informally by convenors, and there are issues about negligence and
being able to sue the union for duff advice and so on. Support is
offered at all levels of employment disputes, and that would not fall
within the provision. We must consider what problem we are trying to
solve and how it is defined in the Bill, before considering
amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="07061442000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061442000614"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Let me explain the problem as simply as possible.
The Opposition&#146;s opposition to the exemption misses the point
because they have not fully understood the situation and the key
principles, nor has the Law Society. I shall speak about the Law
Society&#146;s lengthy advice, not least because the case cited is
one that I initiated some time ago, so I know it
well.</div>
					<a name="07061442000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a union takes
on a case for a group of workers against an employer for industrial
injury, it can be handled in two ways. One is to have a lawyer, as
defined by everyone and in the Bill, to do the work&#151;forget
in-house and external, because that is not the point. A legal
professional could handle it. The second way is for someone like me to
handle it by putting the case to the employer and negotiating. I would
explain that a group of employees have industrial deafness, I would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>have them medically tested, I would demonstrate causation by the
employer, and I would try to negotiate a settlement with the employer.
The advantage for the employer is that the legal costs will not be
high, and the advantage for the individual members is that they will
not run the risk, individually or through their union, of adverse court
costs.</div>
					<a name="07061442000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The latter way
can be sensible and in this country we call it industrial relations.
They normally work, but if it is impossible to agree, some cases may go
throughthe legal process as test cases, with solicitors and,
if necessary, barristers on both sides fighting the case. That is all
covered. The issue is that the industrial relations side is not
covered, nor should it be.</div>
					<a name="07061442000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments seem to be
sensible, but on the question of where the individual union member
should go, the answer seems to be straightforward. If I negotiate on
their behalf, the remedies should be clear, and it would be helpful if
the certification officer could quantify them. It would not seem
sensible from anyone&#146;s point of view for the Law Society to
regulate my industrial relations negotiations&#151;even if I was
acting, in essence, in lieu of a solicitor, because that was the
sanction under which I negotiated. That is commonplace industrial
relations practice.</div>
					<a name="07061442000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no suggestion that the
Law Society should regulate any of that activity, but unions call
people different things. The union could give me the title, &#147;law
officer&#148;. If one is a solicitor, one is covered, as I understand
the Bill; and if one is not, and one is not performing one of the
reserved legal activities, which is the key point, the situation is
clear. It is importantthat the certification officer is given
clear guidance, because the role currently seems rather too woolly.
With respect to the hon. Member for Huntingdon, that course would have
been the more obvious one to take in order to achieve what he has
attempted with the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07061442000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who knows what mood his party
leader is in today on those issues, but I fear that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon is trying to presume his party&#146;s position on trade
unions, and that he oversells the case, because the vast majority of
the unions are not and never have been affiliated to the Labour party.
Fifteen unions are affiliated, and only two have become unaffiliated
inthe past 40 years. However, there are probably 70
or80 other unions in the TUC, and their number is increasing
mainly through specialist, professional unions, which have nothing to
do with the Labour party either institutionally or in any other
way.</div>
