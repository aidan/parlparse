<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Certain benefits to be known as tax credits</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [4 February]: No. 20, in page 1, 
line 7, at the end to insert the words `and there shall be a 
childcare tax credit which shall be a component of 
both.'. [Mrs. Lait.]
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be 
made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this 
we are taking the following: amendment No. 21, in
clause 16, page 8, line 31, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"including in both cases a childcare tax credit component.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 22, in clause 4, page 2, line 25, after 
second `credit' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and the childcare tax credit element of both.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 9 Division of childcare tax credit 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Where a childcare tax credit is payable as a component of either 
working families tax credit or disabled person's tax credit in respect 
of a child or children whose parents do not live together, then that 
childcare tax credit shall be shared between the parents in proportion 
to the amount of time in the course of a year, that each of them 
looks after the child or children, and any regulations establishing or 
amending provisions relating to tax credits shall so provide."	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury(Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> On a point of order,
Mrs. Dunwoody. May I make apologies for my hon. Friend the Paymaster General, who is with us today in body and spirit but, alas, not in voice? She has `flu' and 
has no voice to speak of. I crave the indulgence of 
members of the Committee. I am afraid that they will have 
to listen to me this morning and this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Further to 
that point of order; Mrs. Dunwoody. It is a cruel and 
unusual punishment for the Paymaster General to have to 
sit in the Committee through out the day. I think that she 
should take a lozenge and put her feet up. I would have 
no objection and would not regard it as discourteous were 
she to decide to leave.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is extremely helpful. The 
Paymaster General is of course responding to the rule in 
the House that, if a minister has been taking certain amendments, he or she must normally remain while that debate is taking place. We are grateful to the hon. Member 
for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) and particularly 
to the Paymaster General. We wish her well, as long as 
she keeps her germs to herself. Should there be an 
epidemic in the Committee, our sympathy might be a 
little attenuated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My point is directed to the now silent 
Paymaster General. She was very helpful at our last 
sitting, when we asked who would be elegible. The hon. 
Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) asked it is recorded 
in col. 76 of our proceedings whether a grandmother, 
sister or aunt could register. The Paymaster General made 
it clear that parents could not do so.
<P>
However, the eligibility remains uncertain. The latest 
pronouncement from the Library says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government are still considering possible definitions for 
`eligible childcare'"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The press release from the Treasury says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A major obstacle faced by many parents with young children 
who want to return to work whether they are lone parents or a 
couple is the cost of childcare. A radical new feature of the 
WEFTC the childcare tax credit is designed to help remove this 
obstacle. Choosing to stay at home with children is of course a right 
that many parents enjoy, and those with a working partner can also 
get support with WFTC."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that, under the new National Childcare 
Strategy,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"parents will be able to get help with childcare costs up to the 
September following the child's 15th birthday. For disabled children 
the childcare tax credit can be claimed until the child's 16th 
birthday."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In answer to an intervention from myself the Paymaster 
General said, referring to parents:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The simple answer is that the rules will prevent it. The eligibility 
criteria, in combination with the provisions of the Children Act 1989 
state that paid child carehas to be involved."	 [Official Report, 
Standing Committee D, 4 February 1999; c.77.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She was clear about the Children Act. Therefore, our 
questions are straightforward and relate to the eligibility 
criteria.
<P>
Will the criteria include grandparents, aunts and 
uncles? Will neighbours who provide mutual support by 
looking after each other's children meet the eligibility 
criteria?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) 
raised a matter that goes to the heart of the problem. One 
of her constituents consulted the Benefits' Agency and the 
Employment Service about her current status. She is 
separated, wants to set up her own company and is 
concerned that, in the meantime, she may lose benefit. The 
Benefits Agency and, I believe, the Employment Service 
said that the best way for her to retain benefit would be to 
set up a child-minding business. Will the setting up of such 
a business render a person eligible for the working families 
tax credit? If those questions are answered, we will move 
on.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I should begin by telling the hon. 
Gentleman that Labour Committee members appreciate 
the manner in which he responded to my point of order.
<P>
I will do my best to answer his questions on the way 
in which the provision will work. As he acknowledged, 
the procedures, which I shall briefly recap, were set out 
clearly by the Paymaster general during last Thursday's 
Committee proceedings, the Hansard account of which I 
have read.
<P>
The rules governing the working families tax credit will 
broadly follow those that now govern family credit. As 
was said, those rules use registered care criteria contained 
in the Children Act 1989 to define persons who provide 
eligible care for the current benefit and, therefore, for the 
tax credit.
<P>
As many Committee members will know, many child 
minders are themselves parents or relatives of young 
children and are not currently prohibited from registering 
as child minders. The hon. Gentleman asked about 
grandparents, who will of course be able to register as 
child minders indeed, child minding is an occupation 
that grandparents often decide to undertake. Registered 
child minders are in the business of providing child care 
and they certainly provide eligible child care.
<P>
With regard to the eligibility scenario that the hon. 
Gentleman outlined, there must be a business relationship 
between the parties concerned. My hon. Friend the 
Paymaster General made that clear during last week's 
Committee proceedings and in her opening speech on 
Second Reading. Parents and relatives, including 
grandparents, can register as child minders, but family 
credit legislation does not consider payment between 
partners to be a relevant child care charge. That provision 
will be incorporated into the rules governing the working 
families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Will the Financial 
Secretary confirm that she is widening although not in 
the legislative sense our understanding of the number 
and categories of people who can register as child 
minders?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche</b> indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am now confused. I thought that the 
Government hoped that those people who provided 
informal child care, such as relatives, would remain as 
informal child carers and not register as child minders. 
I now get the impression that they will be able to register 
as child minders. As the child care allowance can be paid 
to them, the cost of the measure will sky rocket.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. The hon. Lady is confused. I do not 
mean to be disrespectful, but that confusion was apparent 
from our proceedings on Thursday and her speech on 
Second Reading, in which she made some interesting 
points. Clearly, there must be a business relationship. 
Registration under the Bill builds on the same principles 
that are enshrined in the legislation that relates to family 
credit. If we bear in mind that we must look to a business 
relationship, we will avoid confusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is an important point. The Financial 
Secretary says that there must be a business relationship. 
Perhaps she could define that. I assume that it means a 
regular, agreed payment. Section 71 of the Children Act 
states that a parent or relative of a child is not eligible 
for registration.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The principles are exactly the same. 
There must be a business relationship and that involves a 
transaction for the provision of services for monetary 
reward.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am becoming more and more confused 
about the Financial Secretary's definition of a business 
relationship. If people register as child minders, they are 
creating a business. They do not have to register as a 
company, but they are a self-employed business. 
Therefore, even if they are looking after their 
grandchildren, they are in a business relationship in which 
they will submit an invoice, get paid I assume, by 
cheque and send their returns to the Inland Revenue. 
They will, in effect, be running a business.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Then am I right that a relative could set up 
a child-minding business to look after, for example, his 
or her daughter's child in an acknowledged business 
relationship? Am I also right that, because informal child 
minders will find it worth their while to become a 
business, the cost of child care tax relief will soar, 
probably to the £4 billion predicted by the Institute of 
Fiscal Studies, which we contend is the likely sum?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady has always been 
remarkably generous. She was one of the most generous 
Whips I have ever known I hope that that has not 
destroyed her career and I wholeheartedly accept her 
remarkable contribution to Treasury matters.
<P>
Opposition Members misunderstand the purpose of the 
provision. The scenario that the hon. Lady outlined could 
happen under the Bill, but it could equally happen now 
with family credit. When I read the proceedings of our 
previous sitting, I noted that the hon. Member for 
Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) used the word "Marxist"	. He 
said that he would not accuse the Paymaster General of 
being a Marxist because she is the very epitome of new 
Labour, but the Opposition's arguments are deeply 
Marxist. They are suggesting that people decide how their 
children should be looked after solely on the basis of 
economic reasoning and that they will enter different 
relationships not on the basis of what is the best care 
arrangement for their children, but purely on how the new 
arrangements will be

<P>

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister for 
giving way and I would certainly not accuse her of being 
Marxist. The hon. Lady will remember the context of my 
comment I was talking about the debasing of the 
language. Does she accept that she has just said that 
parents would not have to make change in the care of 
their children?
<P>
The law will offer a substantial cash incentive for them 
to change an existing arrangement into a substantial 
generator of income, by dint of filling in some forms and making some applications. It is a traditional view throughout most of the political spectrum that people tend 
to act in their economic best interests. That change will 
become very attractive. Besides the points made by my 
hon. Friends, there is one big difference between the new 
arrangement and that for family credit because the former 
will extend to a much larger group of people.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be fairly 
brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> My apologies, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> If I may say so, the hon. Gentleman's 
comment was slightly misleading, but not intentionally so. 
We are discussing the eligibility criteria as they exist in 
legislation. I do not accept the portrait that he painted. It 
is certainly not the way in which people arrange child 
minding and I say that as a constituency Member of 
Parliament and a parent of a school-aged child.
<P>
We have had an extensive discussion of these matters 
and the amendments are superfluous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This may help. Would it be fair to say 
the hon. Lady has been straight with the Committee, 
which we appreciate that the difference between the IFS 
estimate and the Government's estimate is a difference in 
the understanding of the way in which human nature 
operates?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the point that the hon. 
Gentleman is making. I would have more regard for it if 
Opposition Members had made the same points about 
family credit legislation, but they did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): 
Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I really must make some progress.
<P>
The child care disregard provides families with help to 
pay for child care costs and the extra money can at present 
be claimed by using registered child minders, whether or 
not they are grandparents. The amendments would not 
advance the legislation and I urge the Committee to 
oppose them if pressed to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> For the sake of the health of all of us, I am 
delighted, that the Paymaster General has seen the light 
and gone back to bed. However, I am most grateful to 
Treasury Ministers for their assistance in trying to 
untangle the problems that we have foreseen.
<P>
The issues raised are of sufficient concern to require 
further thought. In addition, we have not been able to 
debate a few matters that have recently come to light: 
taxing child benefit at 40 per cent., the interaction of that 
tax with working families tax credit and child care tax 
allowance, and the Social Security Committee's report on 
fraud in relation to family credit. Therefore, I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer of functions relating to tax credits</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in
page 1, line 17, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an officer of the Board"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert "the Treasury"	.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following amendments: No. 28, in page 1, line 20, 
leave out "Board"	 and insert "Treasury"	.
<P>
No. 29, in clause 3, page 2, line 13, leave out from 
"the"	 to end of line 14 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Treasury by section 2(1) shall be transferred to the Treasury."	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 30, in clause 5, page 3, line 18, leave out "Board"	 
and insert "Treasury".
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendments would remove the words 
"officer of the Board"	 and "Board"	 from the legislation 
and replace them with the word "Treasury"	. In other 
words, clause 2(1)(b) and (c) would replicate clause 
2(1)(a) as well as the other clauses.
<P>
The amendments deal with the growing trend in 
legislation to transfer powers from Ministers, who are 
directly accountable to Parliament, to officials, who are 
indirectly accountable to Parliament through Ministers, so 
they raise an important issue of parliamentary 
accountability. I am aware that multiple precedents for 
doing so have been set by previous Governments and that 
many precedents exist in the current tax code for giving the 
board of the Inland Revenue such powers. I am also aware 
that, in practice, many of those functions will be carried out 
by officials. Indeed, most of the functions under clause 
2(1)(a) will be carried out by officials, even though the Bill 
refers to those functions being carried out by the Treasury. 
The legal fiction is and should be that the Minister, who 
is directly accountable to Parliament, should carry out those 
functions. Indeed, the Bill transfers functions that are 
undertaken by the Secretary of State for Social Security to 
the board of the Inland Revenue and its officials.
<P>
Some in the Conservative party might argue that many 
such functions would be more competently handled by 
officials than by Labour Ministers who am I to argue 
with that? In our parliamentary democracy, we elect a 
party and those in it to do a job, however technical that 
job might be. Those elected can take all the advice that 
they need from officials and experts, but if having taken 
such advice they make a mess of the job it is up to the 
people to elect different individuals or a different party. 
Although we live in an increasingly technical and 
complicated age, I hope that we continue to be run by 
those who are elected by the people, rather than by 
technicians appointed by other technicians.
<P>
That may seem a wide point to make on a technical 
clause, but my worry is the accumulation of such 
measures rather than the measure itself.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I listened with some astonishment to the 
hon. Gentleman's remarks. It was as if the record of the 
previous Administration, and their move towards next 
step agencies, had been wiped out completely. Clearly, the 
two previous Parliaments escaped the hon. Gentleman's 
attention. He must have led a Rip van Winkle existence; 
he has only just come to life, in the cloak of someone 
who is here to protect parliamentary democracy.
<P>
What impressed me was the hon. Gentleman's straight 
face, which reminded me of the word "chutzpah"	 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The rules of the House of 
Commons state that we use English. Although the word 
"chutzpah"	 is marvellous and almost untranslatable, it 
would be kind of the Minister to stick to Anglo Saxon.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Indeed, I will. I know that I have no need 
to translate the word for you, Mrs. Dunwoody, but for the 
benefit of the Committee, I was about to do so. The best 
way to translate that wonderful word which I will not 
mention again in this Committee, as it is not Anglo 
Saxon is by means of illustration. The best illustration 
that I know is that of the man who murders both his 
parents and claims, in his plea of mitigation in court, that 
he should not be treated harshly as he is an orphan. I was 
reminded of that when I heard the hon. Gentleman's 
speech.
<P>
The amendment would change some of the transfers of 
functions in the Bill and it may help the Committee if I 
explain why the functions are transferred in such a way. 
Clause 2 provides for the transfer of the functions relating 
to the working families tax credit and disabled person's 
tax credit to either the Treasury, the board of the Inland 
Revenue or an officer of the board. The reason for the 
division is that the board of the Inland Revenue, which 
has statutory care of management powers, is responsible 
for the day-to-day running of the tax system. It is 
absolutely right that the purely administrative powers 
relating to WFTC and DPTC should be vested in the 
board. Powers affecting the levels of WFTC and of the 
disabled person's tax credit, or DPTC, are transferred 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand why the Financial 
Secretary is using acronyms  one does so when one is 
familiar with a subject but I must counsel Committee 
members to give titles in full. The House trips itself up 
when initials are eternally used in discussions that need 
to be followed exactly.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I absolutely agree, Mrs. Dunwoody. 
I shall do my best to avoid using acronyms.
<P>
The Bill also provides for the function relating to the 
making of decisions to transfer to officers of the board 
of the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue will remain 
responsible for decisions that are made by its officers, 
who will follow the guidance that is issued to them by the 
board in this respect, and it will be accountable for them 
to Ministers and to Parliament, which is the usual 
arrangement. Amendment No. 27 proposes that the 
function should be vested in the Treasury.
<P>
It is normal practice for decisions about the rest of the 
tax system to be made by officers of the board, and the 
provision simply matches that arrangement. The previous 
Government used exactly the same arrangement in their 
legislation.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the amendment is not in accordance with the 
means by which legislation is normally enacted and is 
absolutely unnecessary. If the hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) presses it to a 
Division, I advise Committee members to oppose it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am saddened by the Financial Secretary's 
response. She accepted in her opening remarks that there 
was a trend away from giving Ministers direct powers, but 
she displayed no sympathy towards my concerns, which is 
a sad reflection on the Government's tone and nature. This 
is a serious issue. It shows that those who care deeply 
about parliamentary democracy need to remain vigilant 
about similar proposals in the future. Having made my 
point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 1, 
line 20, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) the relevant Minister shall report annually to the House of 
Commons on the exercise of these functions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be brief, because the amendment involves a 
similar theme. Given that the Committee did not accept 
previous amendments, by necessity the Minister should 
report annually on the exercise of the functions that have 
been transferred to officials and to the board of the 
Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I regret having to be harsh with the hon. 
Gentleman, but I am afraid that the amendment leaves me 
no choice. I speak more in sorrow than in anger when I 
say that it displays ignorance about the duties of the board 
of the Inland Revenue, which will administer the tax 
credits. The board already has a duty to report annually 
to Parliament and to account for all matters for which it 
is responsible. The new responsibilities that the Bill will 
give the board will be included in the report. I see no need 
to duplicate such provisions, as the amendment would do. 
As you will be aware, Mrs. Dunwoody, duplication in 
legislation makes for bad legislation. Moreover, the 
chairman of the board appears before the Select 
Committee on Public Accounts in his role as accounting 
officer. The amendment is therefore unnecessary and I 
advise the Committee not to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment does not ask the chairman 
of the Inland Revenue board to report annually to the 
House of Commons; it asks the Minister to do so. If it is 
not a problem for the chairman of the board or the 
Minister to report annually to the House, I see no reason 
why the amendment should not be accepted. However, as 
we have aired our concerns, I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 1, 
line 24, leave out from `Board' to end of line 2 on page 2.
<P>
This amendment is on the same theme as the previous 
two amendments, so I shall not detain the Committee. 
I am saddened by the Minister's response to this group 
of amendments, because I believe that Ministers should 
report directly to Parliament, should be accountable to 
Parliament and should take decisions themselves, albeit 
with advice from officials and experts. Again, I wait to 
hear what the Minister says on that theme.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am slightly perplexed about why the hon. 
Gentleman seeks to remove the board of the Inland 
Revenue from these provisions. He will appreciate that this 
is a practical provision resulting from the fact that, as family 
credit awards are made for 26 weeks, when the work is 
transferred to the Inland Revenue, awards will still be 
running on. As the staff currently administering the awards 
will transfer to the Inland Revenue on the introduction of 
the tax credit, without this provision the work would have 
to be carried out by another part of the Benefits Agency. As 
the hon. Gentleman and, I hope, the rest of the Committee 
will appreciate, that would be an administrative nightmare 
for the Department of Social Security and, consequently, 
for claimants, which is an important consideration.
<P>
I want to be fair to Opposition Members, but I cannot 
believe that when they tabled the amendment they did not 
realise that that would be the consequence. I shall give 
them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they tabled 
it in error. If the hon. Gentleman does not seek to 
withdraw the amendment, I shall ask the Committee to 
reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The amendment, like the others, was tabled 
so that we could debate the transfer of powers from 
Ministers who are directly accountable to Parliament to 
officials who are not. In view of the fairly wide-ranging 
debate on the subject, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I beg to move 
amendment No. 23, in page 2, line 4, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Treasury, in making regulations under any of the 
functions transferred by subsection (1) above, shall ensure that in 
the case of a dispute as to which member of a couple shall receive 
the tax credit the recipient shall, in the case of one-earner couples, 
be the non-earning partner, and in all other cases the mother.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment involves the important issue of purse 
versus wallet, as it is known in the jargon. Whether the 
money from the wage or benefit is received by the mother 
or the father, it is extremely important for the family. At 
present, under family credit, a cheque comes through the 
post or is picked up at the post office, according to how 
the family wants to operate its finances. It therefore comes 
into the family home, where, more often than not, it is 
received by the mother who, according to voluminous 
research undertaken on these matters, then spends it on 
the children. One of our grave problems with the 
Government's proposal is its effect on the established 
position whereby, on the whole, mothers receive the 
family credit top-up to the family wages. The amendment 
relates to our concern about what will happen where there 
is a dispute.
<P>
The Government have given in to pressure and have 
allowed couples to elect who is to receive the top-up part 
of the wage the WFTC element, which replaces family 
credit. Although a tax credit, it remains essentially a 
benefit. Two-parent families can decide which parent will 
receive the benefit whether it will be paid in a wage 
packet, be picked up at the post office or arrive, as it does 
now, through the post. Later amendments will press for 
single-parent families also to be allowed to elect to have 
WFTC paid to them in the normal way, through the post 
office or by post.
<P>
We are discussing disputed procedures that involve 
two-parent families. Of those receiving family credit, on 
which WFTC is based, about 50 per cent. are 
single-parent families and the remainder are two-parent 
families. The man is the primary or exclusive breadwinner 
in about 75 per cent. of those two-parent families. It is 
unclear how the Government intend to resolve a dispute 
about into whose purse or wallet the extra resource for 
the family budget should go to look after the children 
the state's primary purpose for introducing this measure.
<P>
We want to be reassured about the form that couples 
will complete to receive WFTC. We are concerned that 
people should understand how the new arrangements 
work. It is reasonable to believe that most couples who 
will receive WFTC instead of family credit will not truly 
understand the change. For all the Government's 
protestations about the new arrangements, we are 
incredulous we do not know whether people will 
understand what is happening and whether WFTC will 
contain the incentives that are not in family credit.
<P>
We also worry whether couples will understand how 
the delivery mechanisms will change and who will receive 
the money, which has gone to the mother in the past. We 
have grave concerns about how the form will be set out 
and how abundantly clear it will be that the wife must 
elect to receive the money if she wants to continue to 
receive it. She must understand that she will no longer be 
in receipt of a family credit payment and that her husband 
may receive the money in his wage packet. In some 
families sadly, we come across them in our surgeries 
and hear about them from other people husbands do not 
see their family responsibilities in the same light as 
mothers.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons </B>(Rochdale): Given that the hon. 
Lady has made much of her Select Committee experience 
of WFTC, I am sure that you share my surprise, Mrs. Dunwoody, that she is unaware that the form will go to the current recipient during the transfer from family 
credit to WFTC. Her comments are sadly misleading. She 
should know from the Select Committee's inquiry that the 
woman will receive the form if she is receiving family 
credit and that she will be able to fill it in as she does the 
family credit form.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I should make this point 
again interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons) is trying to split hairs. I thought that the hon. Lady and I would find a measure of agreement 
because, in this context, we both want mothers to be 
properly protected. I am sure that she accepts that some 
families that receive the credit may not be as comfortable 
with officialdom and with filling in forms as are 
Committee members. I am saddened that she does not 
share my concern to ensure that mothers are properly 
protected to the greatest possible extent.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I must stress that I share the hon. 
Lady's concern. If she re-reads my speech on Second 
Reading, she will appreciate that I have done much work 
to alleviate such concerns. I wanted to correct a point of 
fact I though that she was misleading the Committee 
and that she might want to rectify her comments.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I will have to disappoint the hon. 
Lady yet again, as I do not accept what she said. She does 
not sit on the Select Committee on Social Security and I 
am not sure that she speaks with great authority on its 
proceedings.
<P>
I want to be reassured about the fact that the forms are 
as clear as they can be. Will they be sent to current 
recipients only on a transitional basis? It is not altogether 
clear whether the Government will maintain that set-up 
for new recipients and I should be grateful if the Financial 
Secretary would explain who will receive the new forms. 
I am intrigued by the hon. Lady's intervention, but she 
has not added to the clarity of our debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would 
be helpful if the Financial Secretary made available to 
Committee members the draft forms, which we 
understand from the Child Poverty Action Group are 
available and in circulation in the Treasury? It would be 
useful if we could see those draft forms before the 
Committee completes its consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend raises an important 
point. It is somewhat insulting that Committee members, 
who are deliberating on these important issues, should be 
the last people to see a document that is germane to our 
debate outside organisations have already had that 
benefit. I hope that the Minister will say whether we will 
see the forms. It is important that they are clear.
<P>
What happens if there is a dispute about the forms? The 
father in a family may have a propensity to drink, to 
gamble or to spend his money in other ways such things happen and, although he may not want to be unfair or unkind to his family, he might prefer the money that goes 
into his wage packet to remain in his wallet rather than to 
hand it over to the mother of the family, who needs it in 
her purse to spend on the children, the family's meals and 
the household's bills, which can arrive weekly or 
monthly. It is important that the Financial Secretary spells 
out clearly the dispute procedure, which the Bill does not 
make clear. What will happen for example, if both 
partners in a couple have to sign the form as I believe 
that they will have to but one of them does not do so? 
What steps are the Government taking to ascertain that 
both partners have understood the new arrangement? 
What are the presumptions about where the money will 
be sent and, if the form is not properly filled in, about 
who will receive it?
<P>
What will happen in a straightforward dispute? The 
Inland Revenue might contact the couple to ask why a 
form was not filled in. I assume that that has been thought 
through and that there is a procedure. We wait to hear 
from the Minister what it might be.
<P>
There could be a genuine dispute in which the mother 
complains to the Inland Revenue that her partner drinks 
and gambles and insists that he has to have the money, 
which comes through his wage packet. Such a father does 
not understand the impact of his financial incontinence 
for want of a better word on the family budget. How 
will the Minister mediate in such situations? What will be 
the presumption as to who will receive the money? Will 
the Minister assure the Committee that in circumstances 
in which the mother protests that she wants to continue to 
receive the money in the forms of family credit, she will 
be entitled to go to the post office as, perhaps, she 
already does and put the money in her own purse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Collins </B>(Westmorland and Lonsdale): My 
hon. Friend makes a powerful case. Would she agree that 
it would be disappointing if the Minister were unable to 
give such an assurance, as the Chancellor made it clear 
that a primary reason for uprating child benefit was that 
it went directly to the mother? We would hope to see 
consistency in Government policy.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend is being generous in 
expecting consistency in the Government's measures. 
Sadly, they are inconsistent in many areas. Not least of 
those is the proposal to tax child benefit while extending the 
working families tax credit up the income scale to £38,000 
a year. Forgive me for digressing, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I 
was tempted. The Minister should answer those points and 
make it clear that mothers will be protected.
<P>
I would like to end on a note of caution. Family 
finances are often an electrifying issue in families and 
can cause great upset to couples. A wider reason for our 
opposition to the measures is that disputes will occur in 
couples who are eligible for working families tax credit, 
and that will undermine marriages, partnerships and 
relationships. The Government have removed the 
presumption that the money will go to the mother; instead, 
couples will have to reach an agreement, although there 
may be no prospect of such an agreement. In some 
situations, that could increase the possibility of family 
break-up, which is to be regretted by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. That reinforces our view that the case has not been made for the change from family 
credit to the working families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am pleased to support my hon. Friend 
the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), I agree 
with all her points. The amendment, and that which 
follows it, provides the Committee with the opportunity 
to debate what has been referred to in shorthand as the 
purse-versus-wallet argument
<P>
The Government have given us many reasons why the 
measure is necessary. It is supposed to be about ensuring 
that people have an opportunity to enter employment. 
However, if working families tax credit is to mean 
anything, its primary purpose must be to support children 
within families. Opposition Members believe that the 
chosen mechanisms will almost certainly result in less 
money being spent on children. In the case of a dispute, 
the most appropriate course of action is to give the money 
to the person providing care at home. In most cases, that 
will be the mother. On Second Reading, I referred to the 
study undertaken by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 
which estimates that, in most cases, a child is likely to 
receive more money from the state through the mother 
than through the father.
<P>
We received a briefing from the Low Pay Unit, which 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is however a real fear that the benefit currently paid to the 
principal carer, i.e., the mother, will now be transferred to the 
father's pay packet, which may adversely affect the family budget. 
Currently there are 300,000 couples where the man is a principal 
breadwinner receiving a total of £900 million in FC. Although 
couples will be able to choose who receives the credit, payment will 
default to the wage-earner if no choice is made."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We recognise that family disputes are likely to occur. An 
earlier debate revealed that it will not be possible to split 
the payment between those providing care. However, we 
believe that, where there is a dispute, payment should 
default to the mother.
<P>
We were given some indication of what the form will 
look like and it would be helpful if we could see a copy 
of it. Having read the proceedings of the Select 
Committee on Social Security on fraud and having 
discussed fraud with the various officers concerned, we 
do not believe that the system can be checked. Without 
the amendment, it will be increasingly vulnerable to fraud. 
Under the transitional and, as we understand it, the full 
arrangements, the mother will have to sign the form. 
However, it will not be possible to check whether the 
signature is genuine. Therefore, the Bill should make it 
clear that, where there is a dispute, payment should 
default to the mother.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove pointed 
out a number of problems. The man of the family may be 
an habitual gambler, or not particularly good at budgeting 
the family finances. In a marriage, one tends to know 
which partner is best at such things. Although one does 
not want to come between a husband and wife the care of 
the child must be the paramount consideration and must 
override normal considerations about the state interfering 
in such disputes.
<P>
As I have said, organisations such as the Joseph 
Rowntree Foundation and the Low Pay Unit have 
suggested that, in most cases, children are likely to benefit more if they receive state money through the mother rather than through the pay packet of the father. For the 
reasons that I have given, we believe that the Government 
should find the amendment acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): I would like briefly to 
reinforce the arguments that the hon. Gentleman 
powerfully presented and to add the Liberal Democrats' 
support to the amendment. Either there will be disputes 
or there will not be. If there are no disputes, the 
amendment, though superfluous, would not be damaging. 
If there are disputes, a simple resolution process will be 
required. It need not be an appeal tribunal, or a hearing in 
which cases are made it should be a simple, obvious and 
sensible rule. As far as I can see, the amendment proposes 
such a rule.
<P>
Paragraph 58 of the Social Security Committee report "Tax and Benefits: Implementation of Tax Credits"	 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that the claim form...should indicate that 
payment will normally be to the partner at home...but that, if both 
partners prefer payment can be made through the earner's pay 
packet"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems entirely sensible.
<P>
Briefly, on a point of information that may help the 
Committee, on Second Reading the hon. Member for 
Rochdale, who has looked into these matters, added an 
interesting statistic to the debate. If my memory serves 
me right, she said that in one third of cases involving 
two-parent families payment was made to a joint bank 
account.
<P>
I have looked at written answers on that subject in 
Hansard. When the Department was asked similar 
questions it said that it did not have the information or 
that the cost of providing it would be disproportionate. 
There seems to be some disjunction between the 
information being provided by the hon. Lady 
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> If it will help, I shall make the 
information that I have available to the hon. Gentleman 
outside the Committee. He may wish to revise his 
comments in the light of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> That is an intriguing offer.
<P>
<B>Lorna Fitzsimons:</B> I do not have it here with me.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, I hope that we are not 
going to have a repeat of the Second Reading debate. Any 
comments that hon. Members want to make should be 
made on amendments and our discussion.
<P>
Secondly, sedentary interventions are unnecessary. If 
hon. Members have something to say, they should catch 
my eye. They will then have the right to say it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> That you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I hope that the 
information will be made available to me and to all 
Committee members through the usual channels.
<P>
I raised the matter because we are discussing an 
amendment that specifies who should receive the money 
if there is a dispute. The number of cases in which the 
money goes into joint bank accounts gives some 
indication of how many people share resources and how 
many may be in dispute.
<P>
The Select Committee believes that people are worried 
about the default position. There will be disputes 
otherwise, we could leave the matter alone and we need 
a simple resolution procedure because the money must go 
quickly to whoever should receive it. A simple rule would 
be much better than a decision making process or appeal 
process. I hope that the Government will accept the 
amendment with good cheer.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> You and I, Mrs. Dunwoody, are among 
those members of the Committee who have reached the 
years of discretion and can remember debates 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not know.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I should hate to spoil your image,
Mrs. Dunwoody, but I suggest that you and I can 
remember debates before the introduction of child benefit. 
Some of our debates on the matter before us are 
reminiscent of those debates. I know that you campaigned 
in the House, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I campaigned in the 
country for women to receive child benefit to look after 
their children. Fundamentally, that is what we are 
discussing. The principal is the same that by and large 
the woman looks after the children and hence needs the 
money to spend on them.
<P>
I understand the Government's rather idealistic view 
that working families tax credit and disabled person's tax 
credit are a reward for work, but those of us who work at 
the sharp end know very well that, in practice, the carer, 
who is usually the woman, needs the money. What 
concerns me is that the provision is not as generous as it 
could be in terms of ensuring that the maximum number 
of carers or women receive the money for the children 
under this very generous tax credit. I suspect that disputes, 
which may not at present arise over child benefit, may 
arise over the tax credit because it is so much more 
generous. It will make a big difference to a pay packet, 
and its purpose is to help the children. However, if there 
is the slightest temptation for a partner to keep the money, 
for whatever purpose, the system will create disputes. 
Mothers of carers may not know how much tax credit 
partners receive. I add my voice to those who believe that 
we should see the forms before the Committee completes 
its proceedings. The woman needs to be assured that she 
is receiving from the husband the amount of money that 
he is receiving through his pay packet. As I understand 
the system we know little about it that may not be so.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Rochdale said, there will be a 
transitional system, which is a good idea, but it will come 
to an end after six months, and disputes may arise 
thereafter. There may be a settled agreement at the 
beginning, but disputes could arise after that. I accept that 
the forms may be complicated the first time that they are 
filled in, but as people get used to them, they will become 
more familiar with them and filling them in will become 
easier. The reality of the situation will sink in. the large 
sums of money that we are talking about will have an 
impact on couples' relationships.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can give us a much clearer 
definition of who can have access to the money and will 
move the balance towards the carer receiving it, instead 
of idealistically believing that the tax credit is a reward 
for work and hence should go to the male's pay packet 
rather than the female's. Problems with which we are all 
familiar and which have been debated since the 1970s, 
and will continue to be debated, will then arise, because 
it is in the nature of human relationships that women look 
after the children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This is an important amendment, because it 
seeks, first, to fill a gap in the Bill and, secondly, to 
ascertain the Government's policy on any dispute between 
partners claiming WFTC.
<P>
Regulation 4 of the draft Tax Credits (Claims and 
Payments) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 refers to what 
happens in the case of a couple. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the case of a claim for working families tax credit, where a 
married or unmarried couple is included in the family, the claim 
shall be made by whichever partner they agree should so claim."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is as far as the regulations go. Neither the Bill nor 
the regulations say what will happen when no agreement 
between the partners can be reached. That leaves one to 
conclude that one of two things could happen.
<P>
The first is that, because a box has not been ticked on 
the form through which a claim for WFTC is made, it will 
render the uncompleted form invalid. The Department of 
Social Security has been keener in recent months and 
years to ensure that forms are fully completed before it 
processes them. An incomplete form can give rise to 
enormous costs, as officials and civil servants try to fill 
in the relevant facts. I accept that it is better to insist on 
a completed form before any benefit is paid. If I am 
correct about the Inland Revenue and the WFTC form, 
the claim to WFTC will be invalid, simply because the 
partners cannot come to an agreement. That would be a 
harsh way to resolve a dispute between partners.
<P>
The alternative is for the Government to adopt an 
unofficial default position that the money will be paid to 
the earner through the pay packet, because it is 
Government policy to have as much of the WFTC as 
possible paid through the pay roll. That is different from 
the family credit default position: family credit is paid in 
almost all cases to the mother, unless serious incapacity 
in the mother can be shown, in which case the father can 
claim the money.
<P>
The Minister's response is important and will be 
examined closely, not only by members of the Committee 
but by many outside bodies such as the Child Poverty 
Action Group. She may argue that disputes between 
partners will be rare, that most couples get on that is 
why they are together and will in most cases be able to 
agree to whom the money should be paid, but the 
legislation needs to be able to cope with instances where 
disputes cannot be resolved. Although such instances will 
be rare, there will be cases where couples cannot resolve 
to whom the payment should be made.
<P>
The second part of the amendment states that, where 
both partners are working, the money should be paid to 
the mother. As my hon. Friends have said, that is because, 
if the money is paid to the mother, more of it is generally spent on the family than when it is paid to the father. The Child Poverty Action Group says in its briefing that 
research shows that 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall not always intervene on 
this point, but hon. Members should use their own words. 
I hope that large amounts of other people's briefing will 
not be read into the record. It is not flattering to Members 
of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was trying to paraphrase, Mrs. 
Dunwoody. The Child Poverty Action Group quotes the 
research from J. Goode, C. Callender and R. Lister in 
their report entitled "Purse or Wallet? Gender 
Inequalities and Income Distribution within Families on 
Benefit"	, which was published in 1998. They say that 
the presumption should be that the payment will go to 
the main carer of the children in one-earner couples, 
with an option, which the Government have granted, of 
making the payments to the wage earner where both 
partners agree.
<P>
The Low Pay Unit cites the evidence of the Joseph 
Rowntree Foundation, to which my hon. Friend the 
Member for Brentwood and Ongar also referred. It shows 
that, when money is paid to the mother, more of it is 
likely to be spent on the family.
<P>
The amendment therefore seeks to clarify the current 
position, which is unsatisfactory. It says that, for 
one-earner couples, the default position in the case of a 
dispute should be for the payment to be made to the 
non-earner, who is most likely to have day-to-day 
responsibility for the children. We had originally drafted 
an amendment which said that the default position should 
be that the money would be paid to the spouse or partner 
who has responsibility for the child, but, in a couple, both 
spouses have responsibility for the child, albeit one of 
them may be out at work. The easiest way to deal with 
that is to state that the default position should be that the 
money will be paid to the non-earner the spouse or 
partner at home.
<P>
In the case of a dispute between a couple where both 
partners are working we believe that because of the 
evidence from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and other 
outside groups the default position should be payment to 
the mother. That is also the present position under 
family credit.
<P>
The Social Security Committee felt strongly about that 
issue. Its report welcomed the Government's decision to 
allow couples to choose which partner could receive the 
WFTC, but is expressed a concern I shall quote just one 
sentence saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is crucial that the option of payment to the non-wage earner 
in a coupleshould be actively presented in a positive way."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was the point that my hon. Friend the Member for 
Brentwood and Ongar made about the design of the forms. 
The Select Committee's recommendation is that the 
default position should be to make payment to 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A record is being taken. I am 
sure that the hon. Gentleman will tell us not only the full 
name of the report but the page from which he is reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes. Mrs. Dunwoody. It is taken from 
paragraph 58 of the report, "Tax and Benefits: 
Implementation of Tax Credits"	, HC 29, at page xviii. The 
report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This could be done by making payment to the partner at home 
the `default' position."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Social Security Committee is right to recommend that 
default position.
<P>
The present position is unacceptable. Neither the Bill 
or the regulations state what should happen in the case of 
default. The absence of clarity in the Bill worries outside 
bodies. It should be unacceptable to the Committee that 
such a glaring gap in the legislation has not been filled. 
The amendment seeks to fill it. If the Government are not 
prepared to accept it as drafted, we shall accept an 
assurance from the Minister that they will table an 
amendment on Report to fill that gap.

The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) made

amendment, because that is what is before us.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. Being a natural 
coward, I would not want to incur your displeasure.
<P>
In an answer to a parliamentary question asked by the 
hon. Member for Northavon, my hon. Friend the Paymaster 
General said on 31 March that the Government's 
presumption was that when a couple disagreed about which 
of them was to receive the credit, it would normally be paid 
to the partner who mainly cared for the children. I assure 
Committee members that that is what we intend to do. 
However, the Bill is not the place for detailed rules of that 
sort. The bill will give the Treasury and the Inland Revenue 
the necessary powers to make the regulations that will set 
out the rules by which the working families tax credit will 
operate.
<P>
As has already been said, two sets of draft regulations, 
which relate to the powers that are contained in the clause, 
were placed in the Library on Monday. The hon. Member 
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to regulation 
4 of the draft Tax Credits (Claims and Payments) 
(Amendment) Regulations 1999, which fulfil our 
commitment to give couples a choice about who should 
receive the tax credit. They will build on the existing 
family credit regulations by substituting for the regulation 
that requires a family credit claim to be made by a woman 
a new regulation the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton quoted it earlier which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the case of a claim for working families tax credit, where a 
married or unmarried couple is included in the family, the claim 
shall be made by whichever partner they agree should so claim."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is obviously keen sighted: he noticed 
that that, too, does not include a procedure for resolving 
disputes in which partners do not agree about who should 
claim and therefore receive the tax credit. The 
explanation for that is simple. The best way to deal with 
a dispute between partners, which we hope will be a 
relatively rare occurrence indeed, that was reinforced by 
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
who used the word "rare"	 is by allowing the Inland 
Revenue to exercise its duties of care and management of 
the tax credit system and, exceptionally, to allow the 
WFTC application form to be signed by one partner rather 
than both partners. But the application form will need to 
show the family circumstances, including information 
about the other partner's income and savings, so that that 
award can be calculated correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> In summary, therefore, the Financial 
Secretary is saying that the amendment is a good idea, but 
that she does not want to support it now because it would 
be more appropriate to include it in regulations. That is 
not the problem. We are worried about the claim that it is 
best to trust the Inland Revenue. I suspect that the 
Government's battle-cry that we should trust the Inland 
Revenue, excellent though it is I hope that it will look 
favourable on my tax return will not gain them 
popularity. We are discussing an important point of 
principle which the Financial Secretary should reconsider. 
Surely it would be better to include the amendment in the 
Bill or at least in regulations.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Sometimes I fear for the hon. Gentleman, 
for whom I have some regard. Last Tuesday morning, 
there was an attack on Whips a dangerous move when 
the Committee is full of current and ex-Whips. There is 
now an implied attack on the Revenue. I am sure that 
when the Hon. Gentleman has time to reflect, he will 
reconsider his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I withdraw my remarks on the Inland 
Revenue. It is staffed by a wonderful bunch of people.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am sure that the Whips will have noticed 
the hon. Gentleman's refusal to withdraw his comments 
about them. I have done my best to protect him. As for 
his other remarks, engaging though he is, I am saying no 
such thing.
<P>
In cases of dispute about who should receive the tax 
credit, provided that the Inland Revenue has no reason to 
doubt the information given on both partners, it will deal 
with the application as though it had been signed by them 
both. In those circumstances, tax credit will be paid to the 
caring partner, either directly or through the wage packet 
if he or she is employed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If I understand correctly, the default 
position in the case of a dispute will not be that the 
payment goes through the payroll to the person earning or 
directly to the carer at home, but that it will go to the 
person who grabs the form. The Financial Secretary is 
saying she can correct me if I am wrong that the 
Revenue will accept a form that has been signed by just 
one partner and that that person will receive the money or 
make the choice. Therefore, the person who controls the 
form will determine the resolution of the dispute.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. 
The Inland Revenue will exercise its duties of care and 
management of the tax credit system to resolve disputes, 
which we hope will be rare. The new system is much 
better than the current system because the family credit 
unit has no such discretion. it always returns forms from 
couples with only one signature and it is impossible for a 
woman to get family credit without her partner's 
signature. Opposition Members have not referred to that 
situation, which the Bill improves.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am somewhat concerned about the 
proposed new system, which will give the Inland 
Revenue greater discretion. However effective the 
Inland Revenue is I am feeling benevolent towards the 
Inland Revenue because it has just paid me back some 
money and in light of the Social Security Committee's 
recent report on fraud in the family credit system, I am 
concerned that the potential for fraud will be greater in 
the new system.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady need not have that fear. 
The presumption will be to pay the award to the person 
who mainly cares for the children. That presumption 
should reassure her.
<P>
Our way forward is the most proper and efficient way 
to deal with the situation a situation about which I 
understand that hon. Members are concerned. We have 
publicly stated our commitment in that regard. That 
commitment will be turned into public guidance, which 
will accompany the application form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No.
<P>
I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn because 
it is unnecessary, but if it is not, I ask the Committee to 
reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am more confused now than I was at the 
beginning of the debate on amendment No. 23, although 
the purpose of Standing Committees is to ascertain what 
is in legislation and what is Government policy.
<P>
In responding to the debate, the Minister said two 
things. First that, in the case of a dispute between two 
partners of a couple who are making a claim for working 
families tax credit, the Inland Revenue will pay the money 
on the basis of one signature on the claim form, so the 
money will be paid to the person who signs the form. In 
the case of an earner, it will be paid through the payroll, 
and in the case of a partner who is at home with the 
children, it will be paid directly. The Minister then said 
after a piece of paper was handed to her by her 
Parliamentary Private Secretary that there will be a 
presumption in favour of the partner with care of the 
children. Those two statements are inconsistent. What will 
happen if the form is signed and handed in by the earner? 
How does the presumption that the money will be paid to 
the carer of the children fit in with the fact that the form 
must be signed by one person, who could be the earner 
and who might elect to have the money paid to him or 
her? How can those two statements be reconciled? We 
cannot leave this debate until we have an answer to that 
question.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. 
If one person signs the form, how will the Inland Revenue 
know whether a dispute is taking place and whether the 
form was grabbed by one person and sent off in the post 
the next day? Can the Inland Revenue look into people's 
minds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. 
If the form is sent in with only one signature and there is 
a presumption that the money should be paid to the 
partner at home, but there is no dispute, the Revenue may 
assume that there is a dispute because the form contains 
only one signature. We have heard irreconcilable 
statements from the Minister and the Government's policy 
does not hold water. The hon. Lady should have another 
go at clarifying the issue, not only for Committee 
members although their concerns should be 
paramount but for people outside the House. I know that 
representatives of the Child Poverty Action Group and the 
Low Pay Unit, who are very concerned about the issue, 
will write to Ministers and raise their concerns with 
Members of Parliament until the matter is resolved. Now, 
the Minister has an opportunity to resolve it once and for 
all. What will be the proper policy in the case of a dispute 
between two partners? What happens when the form is 
submitted with one signature? To whom will the payment 
be made?

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have done my best to try to assure the 
Committee. The statement that I made about the partner 
who mainly cares for the child was also made at the 
beginning of my remarks as regards the presumption that 
the Government have in mind. I have tried to clarify the 
matter for Opposition Members and I regret that I have 
not managed to do so. I hope that I have clarified it to the 
satisfaction of the other members of the Committee.
<P>

<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I hope that the Minister will forgive 
me for saying that she has not clarified the matter. She 
has raised many more questions in our minds about how 
the Inland Revenue intends to administer the scheme. My 
hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehamption amply demonstrated why we are more 
confused as a result of the debate.
<P>
Many groups outside the House have raised with 
Opposition Members the issue with which the amendment 
deals. Those groups will be deeply disappointed as I 
suspect that they will be as confused as we are by the 
Minister's reply. Therefore, we wish to press the 
amendment to a vote.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Treasury, in making regulations under any of the 
functions transferred by subsection (1) above, shall ensure that any

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Earlier, Mrs. Dunwoody, you 
admonished hon. Members for reading out briefs in 
Committee. If less of that were to occur in Parliament as 
a whole, business on the Floor of the House as well as in 
Committee would be conducted much faster.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In case there should be any 
doubt on the matter, I am not making up a rule. The 
Standing Orders unfortunately Members of Parliament 
never read the Standing Orders state that Members 
should make their own speeches and should refrain from 
quoting large chunks. It is not a revolutionary idea, but it 
is one that has not dawned on many Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I strongly 
support you on that, if I may say so. I hope that it is in 
order for me to allude to the fact that the amendment 
arises from submissions made by a large number of 
outside organisations the Confederation of British 
Industry, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of 
Small Businesses among others. I will not quote in detail 
from their briefs, but will focus on three issues that lie 
behind the amendment: privacy, security and the 
burdensome administrative impact on small businesses 
and, in some cases, on the individuals concerned.
<P>
In earlier debates in the Committee, a great deal of 
discussion took place on the differences in the ways in 
which privacy applies to family credit and to working 
families tax credit. It was established that, in both cases, 
checks must be made every few months with the employer 
to take the temperature of the income of the person 
concerned. If, as is the case with categories such as single 
parents, people are forced to receive the money in their 
pay packets the working families tax credit will, unlike 
family credit, appear week in, week out, or month in, 
month out, on people's pay slips.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> In trying to ascertain the relative merits 
of the two amendments, which are very similar, the hon. 
Gentleman mentioned categories such as lone parents, 
who are obliged to have the credit paid through the pay 
packet. Is he in fact aware of other categories, or are both 
amendments dealing with the specific issue of lone 
parents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I should be interested to hear the 
Financial Secretary's answer to that question. However, 
prima facie, the Conservative amendment and the Liberal 
Democrat amendment seem to approach the matter from 
the same direction, in that they deal with single parents. 
Will the Financial Secretary confirm whether broadening 
the amendments would deal with the hon. Gentleman's 
point?
<P>
Forcing lone parents and perhaps other categories 
to receive their money through the pay packet will allow 
anyone involved in the processing of pay information 
regularly to see whether such people are in receipt of what 
is a benefit in all but name. That is why the briefs of so 
many organisations have referred to the issues of privacy 
and stigma.
<P>
Privacy is important, but in some ways security is even 
more important. It is a sad fact that, from time to time, 
businesses go bust. Small businesses are more prone to 
such a fate than are larger businesses. Rather a lot of 
businesses are going bust during a recession that, 
officially, is not taking place. I am sorry to say that a 
number of small businesses in my constituency are going 
bust. Having been a Member of Parliament for many 
years, Mrs. Dunwoody, you will doubtless have received 
from time to time at your constituency surgery aggrieved 
delegations of businessmen who have gone bust, but who 
have yet to receive money owed to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis </B>(Bury, South): If my memory serves 
me right, under the previous Administration a small 
business went bust every three minutes. Does the hon. 
Gentleman recall that fact, and would he like to comment 
on it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I do, indeed, recall the depths of a 
recession that was worldwide, rather than confined to 
this country.
<P>
The sad fact is that, under the working families tax 
credit, single parents will for the first time join the 
unhappy queue of creditors of businesses that have gone 
bust. Under family credit, they are paid the money as of 
right. As we have acknowledged, there are administrative 
difficulties associated with family credit, and those may 
be carried over. Under the present system, employees of 
businesses that go bust, who receive family credit, know 
that that benefit will continue to be paid to them through 
the benefit office as of right.
<P>
Unless the amendment is accepted, single parents 
whose employers go bust may find not only that their 
wages are at risk but that their benefit is at risk. People 
should be able to insist that their money is paid through 
the Revenue, from which they can be sure they will 
receive a cheque, rather than through their employer, 
whose business may be in difficulty.
<P>
It would be quite wrong of me to extend the debate to 
consideration of this country's insolvency laws, which is 
one of my personal crusades.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, it would.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I stand admonished, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
As hon. Members who have dealt with insolvency cases 
through their constituency surgeries know, it can take a 
very long time to sort out payments. Surely the 
Government do not want to put single parents in that 
wretched queue.
<P>
I turn to administrative cost. The CBI's submission, 
which is closely echoed by the other organisations that I 
mentioned, points to the additional costs involved for all 
employers. It says that those costs will be particularly 
burdensome on small businesses and we have argued, 
through a series of amendments, that the measure will 
create problems for small businesses. The CBI calls for 
small businesses to be exempt from the provision. It is 
not unreasonable for a single parent to be able to say to a 
small business employer, as can a parent who is one of a 
couple, "I do not want to impose this extra administrative 
burden on you. I seem to be your only employee in this 
situation. For goodness sake, let me deal directly with the 
Inland Revenue."	 The employer could then say, "Well, 
thank God for that. That is one extra piece of paperwork 
that I do not have to take on."	
<P>
I want to pursue this important point a little further. 
One point of principle which the Government, the 
Conservatives and, I am sure, the Liberal Democrats, all 
share is that we want single parents to have the 
opportunity to work. A small business may employ only 
three or four people, none of whom is affected by the 
provision. It will know that taking on a single parent will 
almost certainly involve a burdensome amount of work. 
If it cannot say to that single parent, "Could you possibly 
fill in one of these forms so that the extra work goes 
through the Inland Revenue and does not fall to us?"	, that 
is a substantial disincentive to the business taking on a 
single parent. The family business with which I have most 
direct dealings I declared my interest at the beginning of 
our proceedings: my father owns one and my wife works 
part-time for another are besieged with paperwork. We 
must not give small businesses a substantial disincentive 
to take on single parents.
<P>
An additional wrinkle in the administration applies to 
both small businesses and single parents. An employed 
person may move fairly rapidly from job to job. There are 
a number of forms of employment in my constituency to 
which that applies. Many people do seasonal work picking 
fruit, hops and so on for a fairly short period and do 
different work during the rest of the year. Employers are 
now forced to take those people on as employees rather 
than treat them as self employed, for reasons that have 
been argued elsewhere and are way beyond the scope of 
the Committee. It is doubly burdensome to require those 
employers, on top of having to administer wages, 
employees' and employer's national insurance 
contributions, PAYE and so on for the few weeks that 
those employees are picking hops and fruit, to handle the 
working families tax credit. It is nonsense.
<P>
It is often the final wrinkle that extra straw on the 
camel's back which breaks the system. The ludicrous 
examples, such as I have described, may ultimately undo 
the measure, which, from beginning to end, is a muddle.
<P>
Those are my three arguments for why Government 
should not object to the amendment in principle. I have 
considered it long and hard, and can see no possible 
reason why anyone should object to it. Will the Minister 
not only respond to my three arguments, but explain what 
objection in principle there can possibly be to such an 
amendment?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The amendment is grouped with 
amendment No. 15 in my name and that of my hon. 
Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). 
Although the two amendments say much the same, 
amendment No. 15 is slightly narrower in scope, as there 
may be other marginal cases where direct payment is 
automatic.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> To assist the hon. Gentleman, I understand 
that, where both members of a couple work, there is no 
option but to have the payment made through the payroll. 
Therefore, amendment No. 24 seeks to allow such a 
couple to make the election as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
that clarification. The issue about forcing payment 
through the pay packet relates primarily to lone parents, 
although I accept the further category mentioned by the 
hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
said that the take-up for family credit is already high, but 
no one has yet pointed out that, for lone parents, it is even 
higher. The Government's own figures show that, for lone 
parents, a staggering 91 per cent. of family credit 
expenditure is taken up. Given that there are always a few 
people who do not take up their entitlement, such as those 
in transitional states who eventually will do so, almost all 
lone parents take up the family credit to which they are 
entitled. I infer from that that no significant stigma is 
attached to lone parents claiming family credit, because 
otherwise some of them would not claim it. If there is no 
stigma, all the Government's arguments to the effect that 
people feel good about something coming through the pay 
packet but bad about a benefit fall. Clearly, lone parents 
do not feel bad about claiming family credit, or they feel 
only marginally bad about it and are prepared to put up 
with it for the money and the WFTC will be worth 
more money.
<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury is right that it is hard 
to think of any reason why one would not want to give 
lone parents at least a choice about how they receive the 
money. Given that receiving it through the current 
mechanism is not stigmatising in any material sense, one 
can see no reason for not giving them the choice. The 
hon. Gentleman gave three telling reasons why we should 
ensure that the option is at least there. The Government 
would say that it is against the law to discriminate against 
a potential recipient of tax credit, but proving that will be 
inordinately difficult. If an employer chooses between one 
person and another who is of equal merit, it will be hard 
to prove that one person was rejected as a potential tax 
credit recipient. Another comment that we have heard is 
that the employer will not know, but in a small firm with 
few employees there are always informal conversations 
with prospective employees, perhaps before or after the 
interview, or even during the interview, when it will 
emerge whether the applicant has dependent children. We 
might wish that that were not so, but it may well be.
<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury referred to seasonal 
workers who go from job to job. As I understand the 
regulations, when the initial claim is made the payment 
will go to the lone parent directly in the first place, until 
the employer is up and running, when it will go to the 
employer. If the person then changes job, a form will have 
to go to the Inland Revenue to say how much has been 
paid and that information will be passed to the next 
employer. In the interim, the payment will go back to the 
employee again and then to the second and third 
employers.
<P>
All that bureaucracy seems wholly unnecessary to 
achieve what? The Government have made no 
assessment of what forcing lone parents to get the money 
through the pay packet achieves. It is hard to see what it 
achieves, because lone parents are as able as anyone else 
to add together what they get through the pay packet and 
what they can get through a bank transfer with family 
credit. Many people are paid by bank transfer or get their 
family credit by bank transfer. Lone parents are quite able 
to add the two together and to understand what the return 
from work is: they do not need it physically on a payslip.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have no wish to do the Government's 
work for them, but, as I understand it, their argument is 
that people will be more likely to find a job because they 
are being paid a tax credit rather than a benefit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is difficult 
to send voices in two directions. I shall shout louder.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is the point. Hon. Members 
should address the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I absolutely agree, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I 
apologise. I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon can 
hear what I am saying. I was asking him whether he 
thought it made a scrap of difference whether a person 
gets money through the pay packet or through benefit. If 
he believes that it makes no difference, why are we sitting 
here, because that makes the whole Bill fall?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> As the hon. Lady would expect, I have a 
great deal of sympathy with that point. Two categories of 
lone parents will move from, as the jargon has it, "welfare 
into work"	 those who know how much money they were 
getting at work, supplemented by the credits, and those who 
do not. For those who do not, how they get the money is 
irrelevant; for those who do, how they get the money is 
irrelevant. They know that they will get the money. Indeed, 
they will know with more certainty that they will get the 
money for all the reasons mentioned by the hon. Member 
for Canterbury if it goes direct to them and is not 
interrupted through transitions.
<P>
The charity TaxAid, which exists to help people to 
understand the tax system, says that, under the existing 
regime, firms often fail to provide P45s, P60s and 
payslips. Under the proposed system firms will also have 
to provide an outgoing employee with a certificate to say 
how much tax credit has been paid, so that that can go to 
the Revenue, which can then set up an assessment for the 
new firm. All that bureaucracy is not only unnecessary 
but will sometimes go wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making such a 
compelling case that I am embarrassed to intervene again. 
Family credit is already, with one organisation dealing 
with it, a complicated and burdensome matter, but at least 
it works. Complexity will now be introduced for a string 
of different employers, as well as the Inland Revenue and 
the recipient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. This is a 
transaction between the Government and the individual. 
A firm is reasonably required to provide information to 
assist that transaction, but has no role in delivering it. As 
there is no benefit to be gained by forcing lone parents, 
possibly against their will, to take the money in this way, 
the Government should not do it. Therefore, I support the 
spirit of both amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As I said in my intervention on the hon. 
Member for Northavon, amendment No. 24 allows lone 
parents and either member of a couple who both work to 
elect to have the payment made direct to their bank or 
home, and not through the payroll. On Second Reading 
and in Committee we have debated whether the WFTC 
will reduce stigma. The Opposition claim that it will not; 
the Government say that it will. However, the 
Government have not told us what they expect the take-up 
rate to be. I was impressed when the hon. Member for 
Northavon cited the figure that applies to lone parents, of 
a 91 per cent. take-up rate on expenditure. That proves 
categorically that there is no stigma attached to claiming 
family credit, at least for lone parents. The overall figure 
of 85 per cent. demonstrates almost the same for other 
claimants.
<P>
Our dispute could be resolve simply by letting WFTC 
recipients decide whether there is stigma. If they believe 
that there is stigma attached when payment is made 
through the pay packet after all, it is they, not Ministers, 
who will suffer the embarrassment of the stigma I see 
no reason why they should not be able to elect to have 
those payments made direct into their own bank accounts 
or to their home. That is the view of the Confederation of 
British Industry, which said that single parents may wish 
to retain the option because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"they wish to maintain confidentiality or avoid perceptions of stigma 
associated with payment of benefits."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is also the view of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 
In its evidence to the Social Security Committee, it said 
that people will observe that colleagues are receiving the 
WFTC, and that a stigma will be attached to receiving it.
<P>
I therefore see no reason why the Government should 
not give recipients of working families tax credit the 
option of electing to have the payment made directly. It 
would be kind and humane to do so, and I hope that the 
Government will accept either of the two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> In many ways, amendment No. 24 is the 
crunch amendment. It determines whether the 
Government believe in their measure; whether they 
believe that less stigma is attached to the working families 
tax credit than to family credit.
<P>
On Second Reading, it was claimed repeatedly, despite 
the evidence, that family credit was stigmatised. Neither 
Opposition Members, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation 
nor the Child Poverty Action Group believe that. The only 
people who believe it are Labour Members. The 
amendment provides them with the opportunity to in the 
old phrase put their money where their mouth is. If they 
were to vote for the amendment, they would be letting the 
people decide. Those who feel that it would be better to 
receive the money though the wage packet will be able to 
do so, but if they prefer to receive it directly in their bank 
account or across the post office counter, that will also 
be possible. That would be in accordance with the best 
principles of the House.
<P>
I should like to address a narrow point. The Committee 
has discussed Marxismi and the class system, which has 
been most entertaining. I stand before the Committee as a 
champion of workers' rights another compelling reason 
why people should be able to decide on the method of 
payment is to protect them for unscrupulous employers. 
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham referred to 
the informal ways in which employers could work out 
whether someone was receiving working families tax 
credit. In a similar way, it is possible to work out what 
kind of employer someone might be an unscrupulous 
employer or something of a Jack the lad. If workers 
receive payment through the wage packet, the employer 
is put in an especially strong position. That is particularly 
true with regard to industrial disputes when workers go 
out on strike, an unscrupulous employer will not be in a 
rush to make payments. That issue was raised in 
discussions with the Child Poverty Action Group last 
night, and it also worries the Low Pay Unit, which 
normally supports the Government on such matters.
<P>
The response to that is in an Inland Revenue document, 
which although I do not wish to incur the Revenue's 
displeasure is extremely naive. It suggests that 
employers must act reasonably and make the payments. That will simply not happen. it will give added weight to any industrial dispute by allowing employers to grind 
down the faces of the poor and end the dispute earlier. 
The workers will be denied not only wages but benefits. 
It may be that The Financial Secretary may find it strange 
to hear a Conservative Member speak in this way. I 
remind her that the first industrial relations legislation was 
introduced under a Conservative Government. I urge 
labour Members not to reject the message because of the 
messenger. Do not dismiss the point just because it is 
made by a Conservative Member. If people are not able 
to decide how to receive the benefit, it will put a 
considerable weapon in the hands of unscrupulous 
employers.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. 
Member for Brentwood and Ongar. It is good to hear the 
voice of Disraeli reasserting itself in today's modern 
Conservative party, and I look forward to the hon. 
Gentleman joining us in the Division Lobby this evening 
when, in his own words, he will have the opportunity to 
put his money if not his political career where his 
mouth is. I assure him that he will receive a warm 
welcome when he walks with us through that Division 
Lobby.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right on one point: 
this is a crunch amendment, because it rehearses the 
arguments that were advanced on Second Reading. the 
amendment goes to the heart of the Bill and clearly 
exposes the political difference between Government and 
Opposition Members, both Conservatives and Liberal 
Democrats. Indeed, when I made that point on Second 
Reading, the hon. Member for Northavon acknowledged 
that there is a different view about the way in which these 
matters should be addressed. We want to reinforce the 
link between payment as a tax credit and the rewards of 
work, so the tax credit should be paid through the wage 
packet.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. 
Is she saying that the Government are prepared to take on 
board the problems that will inevitably result when the 
carer, usually the woman, does not receive the money to 
which she is entitled in order to look after her children? 
Are the Government prepared to take that on the chin and 
deal with the fallout that will result?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course. The hon. Lady invites me to 
return to our previous debate, but she paints a scenario 
that I do not accept.
<P>
In order to address valid concerns raised by many 
groups outside and, as I have already acknowledged, by 
many hon. Members, the Government decided that there 
should be a choice about which partner received the tax 
credit. Of course, the choice will be dealt with in an 
even-handed way that favours neither the man nor the 
woman. If the person who receives the tax credit is 
employed, the money will be paid through the wage 
packet. We believe that that demonstrates the rewards of 
work in the clearest possible way. If the couple choose to 
have the money paid to a partner who has no earnings or 
who is self-employed, it will be impossible to pay it in 
that way. That is why direct payment will continue for the 
working families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> We come to the heart of the matter: 
families are to pay the price to maintain the smokescreen. 
Is the Minister really saying that she does not believe that 
single parents or, indeed, married couples in which both 
parties work, are incapable of adding up and working out 
what their pay packet amounts to at the end of the week? 
For sensible administrative and security reasons that I 
shall not repeat because they have already been outlined, 
there is a lot to be said for people having the right to 
choose payment through the Revenue. In order to 
maintain the smokescreen, people will be denied that 
right.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As I said to the hon. Member for 
Beckenham, who is not in her place at the moment, I 
do not accept any such scenario. The hon. Gentleman is 
rehearsing arguments that were made on Second Reading.
<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury made some specific 
and important points in response to an intervention by 
the hon. Member for Northavon about the scope of the 
amendments. Lone parents in employment and couples 
who are both in employment will receive payment in their 
pay packets. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and 
Littlehampton also made that point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury mentioned 
insolvency. The tax credit is not at risk. The Inland 
Revenue will make direct payments in insolvency cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> If the Inland Revenue pays money to an 
employer who goes bust a likely scenario will it make 
a second payment to the employee, or will the employee 
have to recover the money from the employer?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, many 
different situations will arise but the tax credit will not be 
at risk. The Inland Revenue will make a direct payment 
and it will sort out the problem with employers who do 
not pay as instructed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury rightly asked about 
privacy. I understand his concern. Employers and others 
who handle personal data are under a common law duty 
to protect that information from unauthorised persons. 
They are also required under the Data Protection Act 1998 
to preserve an employee's personal details. It is a private 
matter between employer and employee if employers treat 
tax credits like pay.
<P>
Opposition Members asked about discrimination 
against those in receipt of tax credit. They decided that 
the protection afforded to employees would be difficult to 
provide. I have heard that argument used in all debates on 
employment law, whether they were proposed by the 
Labour party or by others. Their arguments have no 
weight or merit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Unless the amendments are accepted, lone 
parents will have no choice. They wil not be allowed to 
exercise their preference for direct payments because the 
Government want to teach them the lesson that work pays. 
That is what the Minister said. Surely lone parents can be 
treated as adults. They do not have to be taught a lesson 
by the Government. They should be allowed to express 
their preferences. Is not that less patronising?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I have a great regard for the hon. 
Gentleman and for his expertise in this matter, but he is 
completely wrong. I am saying no such thing. The 
Governments are so committed to the Bill because it 
reinforces the connection with work. We are not being 
patronising; we are saying that work is important for 
people's dignity. That is what the Bill addresses.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 would give a new choice of 
payment method to lone parents 
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Financial Secretary has been very 
courteous in giving way. She has not dealt with my point 
about giving unscrupulous employers a considerable lever 
over employees. Several bodies, including the Chartered 
Institute of Taxation, made it clear that the regulations 
placed no obligation on an employer to make a working 
families tax credit payment when no other payments were 
due. What will happen in an industrial dispute involving 
an individual? That is different from the subject that the 
House will consider later today the trade unions barons. 
In this context, we care about individuals.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am shocked that the hon. Gentleman is 
already in retreat. I was about to leave the Committee 
when we adjourned for lunch not one second before, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, I assure you to break the news to the 
waiting world of the hon. Gentleman's conversation. Alas, 
I see that he has reneged already.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> What about my other point?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody. What 
has become of me?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a sedentary 
intervention, and I would not dream of answering it. If he 
had waited one second longer, I would have told him that 
in an industrial dispute that covered an entire pay period, 
the Revenue will pay the tax credit direct the employee 
will not miss out on a tax credit payment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Inland Revenue booklet, which I shall 
not quote, makes it clear that during a pay dispute, the 
employer 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I have misled the 
Committee. I am sure that Committee members accept 
that I do not want large chunks of other people's briefings 
to be read on to the record. We are here to examine the 
Bill line by line. If the hon. Gentleman would identify the 
document from which he wishes to quote it is perfectly 
legitimate for him to do so he would ensure that the 
Committee's record reflects what happened. That may be 
embarrassing from time to time, but we just have to live 
with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful. The Inland Revenue 
document, "Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled 
Person's Tax Credit"	, contains instructions about how the 
system will work in practice. It says that during a trade 
dispute, when employers have no obligation to pay a tax 
credit after one pay period if they are not also paying a 
wage, employers will have to give an employee a 
certificate of payment that shows the amount of tax credits 
that were being paid. The employee would take that 
certificate to the Inland Revenue, on receipt of which the 
employee would continue directly to receive working 
families tax credit. However, that requires the employer 
to give the employee that certificate. The point that was 
made by my hon. Friends the Members for Brentwood 
and Ongar and for Canterbury was that if there is 
acrimony between the employee and the employer during 
a dispute, it may not be possible to obtain those 
certificates. That is the key purpose of the amendment 
it would allow claims to be made directly even if a dispute 
was anticipated. How will the Financial Secretary deal 
with that problem, and the hardships that would be 
involved?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Very easily. In the very rare cases that 
the hon. Gentleman outlines, it will be for the Revenue to 
resolve the matter that is the normal practice. I am 
pleased that Conservative Members noticed the care with 
which we tackled the matter and the thought that we put 
into the ways in which payment could be made in such 
circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 15 would give a new choice of 
payment methods to lone parents alone. My right hon. 
Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) expressed 
concern on Second Reading about how vulnerable that 
group might be to pressures placed on them by employers. 
Despite those concerns, we believe that the protection 
contained later in the Bill, coupled with the procedures 
that the Inland Revenue will be putting in place I 
referred to that earlier to deal with non-compliant 
employers and safeguard the right of employees to receive 
tax credits, will amply protect the interests of that group 
in the same way as it will secure the working of the new 
system as a whole.
<P>
I hope that that reassures the Committee, but if the hon. 
Member for Canterbury does not see fit to withdraw his 
amendment, I shall invite the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> I am not persuaded and I may raise the 
matter on Report, but I shall ask the Committee's leave 
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am afraid that if the hon. Gentleman 
makes that move now, Mr. Webb will be precluded from 
commenting on the amendment during this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I very much share the lack of conviction 
of the hon. Member for Canterbury at the Government's 
responses. We have discussed three substantive issues and 
on each I have been left less convinced than I was at the 
beginning. I consider myself a fundamentally reasonable 
man who is swayed by argument and I have an alarming 
tendency to believe the last person I heard. That is 
probably why I am in the party I am  [Laughter.] 
However, on this occasion that tendency has not occurred 
and the force of argument has been with those who oppose 
the Bill. The issue is so substantive that it would be 
unfortunate if, by dividing the Committee now, further 
debate were precluded on the Floor of the House 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I make it clear that if we 
have a full debate in the Committee, hon. Members must 
decide whether they want to press the amendment. If it is 
withdrawn, they must not assume that there will be a 
debate on the same subject elsewhere. That is normal 
procedure and I want to make that clear. Withdrawing an 
amendment does not ensure that the subject will be 
debated again. That decision lies with the Speaker when 
the time comes, not with the Chairman of the Committee. 
I have control over the amendments discussed in the 
Committee. I want to ensure that hon. Members know 
what they are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, Mrs. 
Dunwoody. I certainly would not presume to second guess 
what Madam Speaker might choose to select on Report. 
However, amendment No. 24 is more comprehensive and 
more completely reflects the sort of points that I was 
making, so I shall not press amendment No. 15.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> On reflection, Mrs. Dunwoody, I have 
thought hard about your comments and about the 
Government's reply. I am not persuaded by the Minister's 
general defence of the position, but she has left us in a 
difficult position. In answer to the various points raised 
from the Opposition Benches, she has come up with some 
complicated answers that require further consideration. 
For example, she stressed the procedures that employers 
must go through when insolvency is threatened and how 
the Inland Revenue would handle that. She also referred 
to the safeguards that will protect employees form the sort 
of intimidation that has been mentioned. We hope to be 
able to consider those matters further if we are so lucky 
as to persuade Madam Speaker to return to them. I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 25, in
page 2, line 4, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Treasury, in making regulations under any of the 
functions transferred by subsection (1) above, shall ensure that 
payments of the tax credit are not made to individuals who have an 
income or to couples who have a joint income in excess of the 
income at which the higher rate of tax would be payable by an 
individual.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be reasonably brief. The reason for the 
amendment arises from an intervention by the hon. 
Member for Northavon to whom I pay tribute and in the 
coming weeks, I shall try to ensure that I am the last 
person to speak.
<P>
The amendment refers to the level at which the tax 
credit should end. We have criticised parliamentary 
answers from the Paymaster General concerning the level 
of £38,000 and I am putting my money where my mouth 
is. We believe that the tax credit should not be paid to 
individuals whose income exceeds the top rate of tax. 
Moreover, it should not be paid to couples whose joint 
income exceeds the higher rate.
<P>
You have castigated us for quoting too much,
Mrs. Dunwoody. What I am about is not contained in any 
of the Government or Opposition briefings. There should 
be a degree of honesty about the amendment. It is true 
that, if it were applied to family credit, certain people 
would lose out. I shall give a typical example. Let us 
imagine that the doors at the far end of the room crash 
open and the entire von Trapp family enters, along with 
their child minder. If they were in receipt of family credit, 
they would undoubtedly be worse off under the 
amendment. Families with seven children who are 
top-rate taxpayers as, I suspect, the von Trapp family 
was would undoubtedly lose out. Our contention is that, 
under the amendment, the von Trapps would have had 
their chips.
<P>
In pursuing their social policies, the Government are 
determining the top rate of tax and the income of families 
according to that top rate. Families will automatically 
move up or down according to those policies. We are 
concerned that the much-vaunted £1.5 billion is being 
frittered away by moving the working families tax credit 
further up the social and economic ladder. Instead, those 
sums should be concentrated on people at the bottom end.
<P>
Worries have been expressed to us about how the taper 
will operate and how the working families tax credit will 
operate against other benefits, particularly housing 
benefits. Those at the lower end of the income sale will 
not really benefit; materially, there will be virtually no 
effect.
<P>
The Government are saying two contradictory things 
about those at the top end of the scale whom, like the 
von Trapps, the amendment seeks to exclude from the 
provision. They claim that the new system is much more 
generous because it extends higher up the social and 
economic ladder, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has 
said that child benefit will be taxed. So, what the 
Government attempt to give with one hand, they will take 
away with the other.
<P>
The amendment would deal with the rather silly 
examples of the payment of tax credit to people on 
£37,000 or £38,000 a year with five children, and would 
ensure that the money is concentrated on those families at 
the lower end of the income scale who are most in need.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I sympathise with the spirit of the 
amendment and I shall offer a couple of brief reflections 
on it. Clearly, it is absurd that a reform that seeks to make 
work pay should apply to higher-rate taxpayers. If 
higher-rate taxpayers' jobs are not worth doing, we all 
might as well go home.
<P>
Nevertheless, I am not convinced that the amendment 
is the right way to tackle the problem. It would prevent 
the payment of the tax credit not only to individuals who 
have incomes above the higher rate threshold, but,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to couples who have a joint income in excess of the income at 
which the higher rate of tax would be payable by an individual."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that the amendment would therefore include 
couples who each earn £16,000.
<P>
Given that they introduced it, the Conservatives 
presumably accept the principle of independent taxation. 
If one accepts that principle, it seems rather hard to 
penalise a couple where both partners earn £16,000 and 
effectively treat them as though they were a couple.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is not the point that there is an overlap 
between the benefits system, which examines family 
income as a unit, and the tax system, which correctly taxes 
people on an individual basis. The amendment 
encapsulates the combination of the two systems. It is 
drafted to prevent unfairness creeping in to the application 
of an upper limit on the income that can be earned before 
claiming the working families tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The anomalies described by the hon. 
Gentleman apply under independent taxation. A couple 
with one earner on £30,000 will pay a lot more tax than 
a couple with two earners on £15,000. If that situation is 
anomalous under the independent taxation regime that the 
hon. Gentleman apparently supports, it is just as 
anomalous under the amendment.
<P>
There is a more substantive reason for disagreeing with 
the amendment it raises the targeting of the working 
families tax credit. It extends to higher-rate taxpayers 
partly because the taper is applied higher up the income 
scale, but the main reason in the taper itself. The taper is 
lower 55 per cent., not 70 per cent., so it stretches all 
the way up. We have not yet heard the Government argue 
convincingly that tapers matter. Clearly, combined 
marginal tax rates such as 99 per cent. or 96 per cent. are 
an absurdity and their removal is welcome, but the result 
will be that lots of people will lose 50p or 60p in the 
pound. No empirical evidence or research has shown that 
that is, on balance, beneficial in terms of work incentives.
<P>
Clearly, the few who no longer pay 90 per cent. 
might be willing to work slightly harder, but what about 
the many the Government speak about governing not 
for the few but for the many who will now lose 60p 
in the pound or more. What research has been done to 
show whether those people's work incentives will be 
adversely affected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a strong case, 
but the position is much worse than he suggests. The 
interaction with other benefits will mean that the marginal 
rate for those in receipt of WFTC and housing benefit, 
even assuming that they are not in receipt of council tax 
benefit, will be 89 per cent. Very high marginal rates of 
tax and benefit withdrawal will extend well up the 
income scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am not unduly worried by that, as 
relatively few people who are well up the income scale 
rent. Certainly there will be relatively few who, once they 
have received the tax credit, will not be floated off 
housing benefit altogether. The hon. Gentleman will find 
that the number of people who are in receipt of both 
benefits at the same time is fairly small and fairly 
concentrated, and not at the high income levels that we 
are discussing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That merely affects people at the lower 
end of the scale. One of our principal concerns in drafting 
the amendment was to ensure that such resources as are 
available go further down the income scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful for that interpretation of the 
gesture.
<P>
My impression is that many people who are in receipt 
of means-tested benefits would not know a taper if for 
want of a better phrase it hit them in the face. They do 
not know whether the taper is 70 per cent., 55 per cent., 
or anything about it. They know what they are getting 
now, and perhaps if they get a better job they will see 
six months later when the necessary adjustments have 
been made that they did not receive much net benefit. 
The evidence that tapers influence people's behaviour is 
negligible. Can the Financial Secretary cite academic 
studies showing that by changing tapers people change 
their labour market decisions or even that they 
understand what a taper is? I would be surprised to hear 
about them.
<P>
Imposing an arbitrary cut-off point, which would 
provide help if the income was a penny below the line, 
but none if it was a penny above, is not the way to solve 
the problem of higher rate taxpayers. Such a system would 
create discontinuity, which is undesirable. A better way 
would be to maintain the taper at 70 per cent. this is a 
slighly radical proposal and spend the extra money on 
higher credits. Therefore, the credit would extend a little 
further in terms of distribution, but not into the income 
ranges that we have discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes some valid points 
about the taper. Has he read the evidence given by Patrick 
Minford to the Social Security Select Committee? He said 
that by bringing an additional 750,000 people into higher 
marginal tax rates of between 50 per cent. and 60 per cent., 
the Government, in trying to deal with the unemployment 
trap, have worsened the poverty trap. They have reduced 
the incentives for people to improve their job skills and 
promotion prospects, which cannot be measured but will 
have an effect.
