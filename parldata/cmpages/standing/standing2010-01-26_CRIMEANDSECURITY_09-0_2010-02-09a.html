<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000314"></a>The
Minister for Policing, Crime and Counter-Terrorism (Mr.
David Hanson):</b> Thank you very much, Sir Nicholas. What a
pleasure it is to be here again with you in the Chair. Please pass on
our best wishes to Mr. Cook, who presided over last
week&#146;s proceedings in a most exemplary manner; we had a good and
enjoyable time. I am sure that you have read the proceedings of the
Committee and seen what fun we had last week.</div>
<a name="10020998000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
that commenced on Thursday morning covered clause 21 stand part and new
clause 28 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent,
South. We had a useful discussion and this morning I refreshed my
memory of the debate by examining <i class="I">Hansard</i>. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>I think there is general agreement among all Committee members that
tackling domestic violence remains a key issue.</div>
<a name="10020998000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Domestic
violence still accounts for about 14 per cent. of all violent crime,
although violent crime generally is falling. We remain concerned, as do
the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Carshalton and Wallington, that
the impact of domestic violence is devastating not only for victims and
their families, but also for communities. Trying to resolve domestic
violence issues occupies considerable police and other agency
time.</div><a name="10020998000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
and crucially, domestic violence is not a one-off incident; there is
often a pattern of abusive and controlling behaviour through which the
abuser seeks power and control over their victim. Agencies face a range
of difficulties, and over the past 10 years, we have put in place
legislation and policy objectives to reduce the incidence of domestic
violence, give greater legal powers to take action against perpetrators
and provide better support mechanisms. The Domestic Violence, Crime and
Victims Act 2004 introduced specialist domestic violence courts and put
in place 720 fully trained independent domestic violence advisers.
Therefore, the Committee can see that this is a serious matter for the
Government. Arrests are rising and conviction rates are growing. I am
certainly not complacent about the issue.</div>
<a name="10020998000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Family
Law Act 1996 and the 2004 Act introduced important measures, such as
non-molestation orders and occupation orders, which are designed to
help secure the victim&#146;s protection in the longer
term.</div><a name="10020998000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020998000315"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): One point that has been
raised is the use of section 60 of the Family Law Act, to allow a third
party to initiate proceedings on behalf of an alleged victim. My
understanding is that the provision is not yet in force. The Minister
highlights various measures in the 1996 Act that have been introduced,
but do the Government intend to bring that section into effect? It
would provide another route to allow third parties to bring actions on
behalf of a victim. Clearly, that is part and parcel of the
Government&#146;s proposals, so has that provision been
considered?</div>
<a name="10020998000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000316"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising
that point, because section 60 is an important provision. It has yet to
be implemented, as was raised in the evidence sessions, so it has been
discussed as part of our consideration of the Bill. However, the
domestic violence protection orders that the clauses are committed to
are substantially different. Section 60 makes provision for third
parties to apply only for protection orders, whereas the DVPOs under
this clause and others do three important things. They allow the police
to take the first step to issue a protection order; they offer
immediate protection in the aftermath of an incident of domestic
violence and they give the victim crucial protection and breathing
space, which is the determinant factor that we are trying to
establish.</div><a name="10020998000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000317"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister is right to highlight the
distinctions between the section 60 regime and the one contemplated by
virtue of the domestic violence protection notice. Do the Government
still intend to bring that section into effect as an additional
measure, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>sitting alongside the new provisions, given the concern that has been
rightly raised about the clearly described gap in support provided for
the
victim?</div><a name="10020998000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000318"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I appreciate the way that the hon. Member for
Hornchurch has brought forward that point. The Under-Secretary of State
for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth, in
conjunction with colleagues from the Ministry of Justice and the
Government Equalities Office, under the Minister for Women and
Equality, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Camberwell
and Peckham, are developing a strategy on violence against women. One
issue they are reflecting on is how and when we can implement section
60. That is something that I hope we can resolve in the near future
when the strategy is finally produced, which I expect to be
shortly.</div>
<a name="10020998000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, we found that there is still a gap in the protection of victims
of domestic violence. The issue before the Committee relates to the
domestic violence protection order, to ensure that we have orders in
place to stop an aggressor returning not just to the house but to the
whole area. The order would set aside a period of time for that
individual&#151;male or female&#151;to be away from the vicinity of
the potential domestic violence. Clause 21 and the others in this part
of the Bill will cover that
issue.</div><a name="10020998000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
21 is about providing the victim with counselling support, practical
options for getting away from the violent partner and securing
protection in the longer term. Unlike existing measures, the DVPN would
offer the victim crucial support and protection in the immediate
aftermath of the domestic violence incident.</div>
<a name="10020998000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The order
would prohibit the perpetrator from molesting the victim, including
being violent or threatening violence, and may also prevent the
perpetrator from entering a shared residence. There is a clear test in
clause 21 for issuing a domestic violence protection notice. We have
debated it on the Floor of the House and in the evidence sessions to
the Committee. The basic purpose is that a senior police
officer&#151;of superintendent rank or above&#151;could issue a
domestic violence protection notice when they have reasonable grounds
for believing that the suspected perpetrator has been violent or has
threatened violence towards an associated person, and when the officer
believes the notice is necessary to secure the protection of the victim
from further
violence.</div><a name="10020998000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020998000319"></a><b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): When I met my
local police to discuss the proposals in the Bill&#151;in particular
those relating to domestic violence&#151;they confirmed that there
are circumstances in which the police arrest both parties because it is
difficult to distinguish who is the most significant perpetrator. Has
the Minister any thoughts about whether there might be circumstances
when both parties might be issued with a notice and what would
happen?</div><a name="10020998000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000320"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We know that there are occasions when there are
counter-allegations between both parties. Domestic violence is rarely a
one-off event and can often involve both parties at different times. I
am not being judgmental about that; there can be occasions when that
happens, although most of the time, I suspect, it is one party versus
another. By the time the police have reason to believe that such a
notice as proposed in the Bill could 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>be issued, there will usually have been extensive background to the
case. It will not have been a one-off. The police may have visited the
property before. They have to intervene in the case because they know
they will have to go back the following week&#151;or even the
following day&#151;if they do not. There will be history. Even if
there are counter-allegations, I expect there to be an investigation
leading up to the issuing of a DVPN, and that there will be potential
for such an investigation to take
place.</div><a name="10020998000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also said that, if given legislative backing, the proposal would
be a pilot. One of the key things we are looking at is establishing two
pilots with a view to rolling out the scheme six months later. I am
looking at one large force and one small force. Brian Moore, the chief
constable of Wiltshire, is keen to have a pilot in his force, so we are
looking at Wiltshire plus one other force, although no decisions have
yet been taken. The types of things a pilot would look at are the way
the order operates on the ground, and the concerns raised by the
Committee and in the evidence sittings about superintendent ranks
having authorisation, their availability and so on. The order could be
made for both parties, but that would be difficult because excluding
both parties from the home depends on where they would go. The purpose
of the order is to keep one party away from another so that no domestic
violence occurs. It may be simpler to determine who the major party
is  and exclude them from the home; otherwise, we might end up
with both parties continuing the argument at another
venue.</div><a name="10020998000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000321"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The effectiveness of the orders will rely in
large measure on the support services that sit alongside the
provisions&#151;we will address that in other clauses. However, is
the order intended to operate when there is a specific domestic
violence court? The successes and improvements we have seen have tended
to result from situations in which victim and perpetrator do not come
into contact with one another due to the lay-out and design of the
court. It would be interesting to hear what discussions the Minister
has had with his colleagues at the Ministry of Justice on the operation
of the notice and on some of the practical issues where victim support
may be key to ensuring a positive
outcome.</div><a name="10020998000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000322"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> We have certainly had discussions and, as stated
on the back of the Bill, it is supported by &#147;Mr.
Secretary Straw&#148;&#151;the measures have the support of the
Ministry of Justice. There is no problem with that. We need to look at
some of the downstream issues, because they are important. Support for
a victim not only after, but during, an order is important. We are
planning to use magistrates courts. As part of the pilot, there may be
issues relating to access to victim support that are particularly
important for us to focus on. I hope that the Committee will
accept the initial principle of establishing a legislative framework
for the removal of a potential offender from a property and the need to
look at how that works in
practice.</div><a name="10020998000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="10020998000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will touch on two other issues that have been raised. The first was
raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South and I pay
tribute to him for doing so in such a constructive way. Clause 21(2)(a)
states:</div><a name="10020998000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;P
has been violent towards, or has threatened violence towards, an
associated person&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div><a name="10020998000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has given rise to
concerns, as voiced by the hon. Members for Carshalton and Wallington
and for Hornchurch during last Thursday&#146;s debate, as to who an
associated person would be, and it is the nub of the new clause tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South. In the Family
Law Act, the definition of an associated person is wide, and covers a
child of the perpetrator or a child living in the same household as the
perpetrator. When there are multiple victims, multiple domestic
violence prevention orders could be made to prevent the perpetrator
from molesting each of them. A partner or a child could be identified
as an associated person in need of an order. I hope that helps the
Committee.</div><a name="10020998000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see what my hon. Friend aims to achieve with new clause 28. It
focuses on ensuring that the Committee appreciates the concern about
domestic violence against children, who may sadly be involved in many
cases. I hope that I can assure my hon. Friend and the
Committee that under clause 21(2)(a), about an associated person,
children could be protected either directly or indirectly by the
domestic violence protection notice or the DVPO. The Bill provides that
both the notice and the order will be available to protect the person
associated with the perpetrator, within the meaning of the Family Law
Act. An associated person could be the child of the perpetrator, the
child of the perpetrator&#146;s spouse or the child of a person with
whom the perpetrator is cohabiting or has cohabited, and/or a child
living in the same household as the perpetrator but not a direct blood
relative of either. The order could be obtained in respect of a child
falling into any of those categories, and if a child has not been a
direct victim but their mother has, it is possible to obtain an order
in relation to the mother, which would give indirect protection to the
child by preventing the perpetrator from continuing the
violence. I am confident that the measures in the Bill are helpful, not
just to the victim but also to any
children.</div><a name="10020998000040"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000323"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister,
and he has helped to make clear the ambit and extent of domestic
violence protection notices in relation to children. Will the Minister
make it clear whether separate DVPNs would need to be issued to
children and the spouse or other victim of domestic violence? That
would have knock-on
connotations.</div><a name="10020998000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000324"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> If I am not correct I shall reflect on the matter,
but I understand that a non-molestation order would be issued against
each individual in the property, but under one domestic violence
protection notice. If there is a need for further clarification, I
shall give it&#151;perhaps in a
moment.</div><a name="10020998000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000325"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On a point of clarification, the domestic
violence protection notice talks about a person in the singular, but I
assume the Minister was saying that notices had to be multiple, with
one for each person to be protected. Obviously, that may have knock-on
connotations regarding whether individual court hearings would be
required, and what the interrelationship may be. For example, the facts
may be made out in relation to a child but perhaps not in relation to
the partner or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>another person living in the house. Have I properly understood that, or
does a different mechanism apply in those
circumstances?</div><a name="10020998000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000326"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall
reflect on that matter in a moment and return to it. Our record of the
debate can ultimately lead to case law, and I therefore want to ensure
that what I say is entirely
correct.</div><a name="10020998000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South will

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000328"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I ask my hon. Friend not to move the new clause.
Ultimately, it may be absorbed in our wider discussions, Sir
Nicholas&#151;however, we phrase that. It has been a long time since
Thursday when we started this debate.</div>
<a name="10020998000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend made an important point about new clause 28. Although I maintain
that the new clause and the proposed definition would not have a
significant effect on the Bill because of what I have said to date, I
should like to make sure that we effectively address his concern. I
would be willing to consider an amendment on Report to ensure that we
address the needs of child victims. I would be happy to work with my
hon. Friend to do that. I hope that helps
him.</div><a name="10020998000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
would need to be a separate domestic violence protection order for each
victim&#151;to take in the point that the hon. Member for Hornchurch
made. But if the purpose is to exclude from the home, I understand it
could be addressed by a domestic violence protection order against one
individual. I will check up and clarify these points for the hon.
Gentleman. The issue will not cause a great deal of difficulty.
Whatever the current status of new clause 28, I ask my hon. Friend the
Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South to let us reflect on the points he has
made. I hope that the Committee can endorse clause
21.</div>

It is not just direct threats of violence against children, which is
why I do not think that subsection (2)(a) covers all the
eventualities. My hon. Friend the Minister has clearly given careful
thought to this important issue. I, too, will consider what has been
said very carefully and perhaps look to tabling a revised new clause on
Report, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause at this

key issue that arises from the issuing of a domestic violence

<a name="10020998000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an application

said:</div><a name="10020998000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not see how a substantive hearing can take place within 48 hours. An
interim hearing might, but we do not talk about interim hearings here.
Frankly, most courts would want a little help and evidence when they
first come to hear the case.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 18
January 2010; Vol. 504, c.
80.]</div><a name="10020998000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
making those comments, my hon. Friend lit on an important issue: what
we mean when we state in the notice that a hearing will take place in
relation to the domestic violence protection order. It seems to me that
it would not be final or substantive. It may be, but it seems unlikely,
given the need to take into account evidence and facts, and the ability
to assess the import of the DVPN
properly.</div><a name="10020998000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10020998000334"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I
understand my hon. Friend&#146;s anxiety, but I wonder whether it is
met by this answer. Under  clause 24(8) one finds
that magistrates may adjourn the hearing of the application. In other
words, they can treat the first hearing, if they so choose, as an
interim hearing, because they have the power to
adjourn.</div><a name="10020998000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000335"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My right hon. and learned Friend is right to
highlight that point. It flags up a slightly different issue that I was
moving on to, which is that the notice implies that the authorisation
from the constable is limited to a 48-hour period. In fact, it is
likely to be much longer if there is an adjourned hearing. Obviously,
the DVPN may last for a much longer period, because it remains in
effect until the matter has been dealt with by the court. As I
understand it, at that stage the authorisation is by virtue of the
issuance of the DVPN.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div><a name="10020998000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is probing, to elicit and understand better the reasons for stating
matters on the notice, and whether further clarity should be applied,
to make it clear that although the initial hearing will be within 48
hours, that does not mean that the DVPN ends at that point. It can
continue until the domestic violence protection order has either been
granted or the application dismissed as having not been made out, on
the grounds set out in clause 21. The court may not have enough
evidence to decide whether a domestic violence protection order should
be granted. There may be other delays. The DVPN remains in effect until
the application has been determined. Specifying that in the notice
appears not to permit any flexibility on the part of the
court.</div>
<a name="10020998000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a question about how the notice interrelates with subsequent
provisions. For example, a notice may have been prescribed in the terms
set out under clause 21(8), on what may be contained in the
DVPN, such as provisions relating to entering or leaving premises. Once
the notice has been granted, on the authorisation of the constable, my
reading of its interrelationship with other provisions is that the
court cannot change the DVPN, even though, having regard to the way the
facts have been presented, it may be appropriate to do so. An initial
assessment of the facts may give a particular impression, but the fact
that in subsequent interviews, other evidence and information may come
to light does not appear to allow modification or adjustment to the
content of the DVPN once it has been granted. Is that the intention?
Perhaps, as we heard in the preceding debate, there may be confusion as
to who the chief protagonist is. Should there be flexibility for the
court, or the issuing officer, to modify the terms of the DVPN, should
additional information come to light that may make it
inappropriate?</div>
<a name="10020998000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="10020998000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, if P is already subject to other criminal
sanctions&#151;such as another order or bail conditions&#151;the
DVPN may conflict with the terms of the bail conditions or the other
order. It may, for example, prescribe that someone should be in
particular premises. The implications of the issue of a DVPN on other
orders and other issues that may be before the court may not be
immediately apparent. How could that be addressed and what flexibility
is there to deal with competing interests between existing conditions
and new conditions that may be set down in a
DVPN?</div><a name="10020998000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000336"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend has a point although I do not think
that it is quite addressed by the amendment. A bail condition may be
imposed on a person requiring that person to live in the matrimonial
home&#151;it will be a stated address&#151; rather than elsewhere,
and attaching a curfew to that person. That could well be a
term of a bail condition. Clearly the Government have to consider how
to reconcile the bail condition with the temporary order that is being
discussed now. That is a sound point, but I am not sure that it is
addressed by the
amendment.</div><a name="10020998000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000337"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> As I think I said at the outset, the
amendment is designed to provoke debate and to probe the provisions. It
strikes out some subsections, because I cannot see how they work in the
context of some other issues. Bail could be one of them. Although I
appreciate that the police have to take account of other issues and
other circumstances relating to P, which may not become apparent until
after the event, it may be felt that it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>necessary to make an order to protect the victim of domestic violence. I
understand that desire, but the clause does not appear to take account
of some of the knock-on implications, so it is a question of whether
further reflection on the drafting might be appropriate.</div>
<a name="10020998000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does anything
specific need to be provided and what mechanisms might need to be
adjusted in terms of the arrangements of the court? How flexible will
the court be in finding some means of disposing or resolving
potentially conflicting issues? Obviously we will come on to gang
injunctions, which are in a separate court, and we shall consider how
one might deal with a gang injunction in a civil court as compared with
a domestic violence protection order in the magistrates court and what
might need to be done to bridge the gap. Those examples throw up a
legitimate point in terms of how one should address potential conflicts
between the requirements of the notice and any other
provisions.</div><a name="10020998000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Justice
makes a separate point about rendering someone homeless, suggesting
that inquiries should be made by the police officer of the local
authority in terms of the requirements, for example, to prohibit P from
entering the premises. I understand the point that the Government are
making about savings on homelessness if the victim is forced to leave
the property. That point comes up clearly in the regulatory impact
assessment. What requirements are there for the police to have contact
with the local authority, given that when the notice is issued the
facts may not have been made out to address the potential homelessness
of the person in receipt of the notice? When it comes to analysis and
examination the order may not be granted because the facts do not
support it. Therefore the recipient of the notice would have been made
homeless for that period, which could be quite extended if court
hearings are delayed because further information or evidence had to be
put into
effect.</div><a name="10020998000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
role of the DVPN in relation to criminal sanctions is rightly
highlighted in the regulatory impact assessment. It
is interesting to develop the point on bail conditions. The regulatory
impact assessment states, on page
5:</div><a name="10020998000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Given
the high attrition rate from arresting for a domestic violence incident
to charging for a domestic violence related offence, it is proposed
that the key policy gap in protection is when a suspect is released
with a caution or No Further Action and where a suspected perpetrator
is charged early in their offending cycle which may not prompt a
decision to apply bail
conditions.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can understand that there is an intended interrelationship between a
DVPN and a case in relation to perhaps a criminal offence that the
police are examining. Bail conditions may apply, but at that stage they
do not require the person suspected of the offence to leave the
property.</div><a name="10020998000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may come down to training and guidance, but there needs to be a clear
understanding of how issuing a DVPN needs to relate to other criminal
proceedings. An antisocial behaviour order, for example, can be granted
either on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with other proceedings.
It is a question of being clear about that interrelationship. I assume
that the issuance of a DVPN is not, and should not be, intended to
prejudice, inhibit or restrict any other criminal proceedings that
might arise from the same facts.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div><a name="10020998000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
police have a reasonable suspicion, two routes can be adopted. A DVPN
can be issued to provide breathing space and address the protection of
the victim, such that more sufficient or appropriate non-molestation
orders can be put in place, but that should not prejudice any criminal
case that may flow from the self-same facts and circumstances. I wonder
whether it should be made abundantly apparent in a DVPN that the
recipient knows beyond all doubt that the notice is a means of
protecting the victim but that it does not suggest that criminal
sanctions or any further action will not be forthcoming in relation to
those self-same circumstances. The application of such provisions is
not
exhausted.</div><a name="10020998000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
issuing a notice, a judgment has to be made about protection of the
victim. As the regulatory impact assessment
notes:</div><a name="10020998000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
domestic violence victims, separation is a dangerous time and being
pursued after separation can be particularly dangerous...In the
immediate aftermath of reporting to the police, a victim may be
considering leaving the relationship and will need both protection and
time to consider their options for the
future.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that domestic violence is a spiral of violence. It is a
continuation of violence, seemingly without an end point. However, the
question is whether issuing a notice heightens the risk to the
suspected victim. What further consideration should be given to the
victim? The notice focuses on the recipient but does not talk to the
victim. Interestingly, the notice does not state whether a copy is to
be given to the victim at that point. A DVPN does not necessarily have
to be given within the home environment; it could be given to the
alleged perpetrator at their place of work or somewhere
else.</div><a name="10020998000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a DVPN could trigger a heightened sense of vulnerability and risk,
should there be a requirement for the notice also to be given, for
informational purposes, to the person whom it seeks to protect? It
could be done more informally, but given the potential risk, I am
concerned that notification is not to be given to the person seeking to
be protected at the same time as the notice is
issued.</div><a name="10020998000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is silent on the issue. It may be the case that notification
should happen by implication and practice, but given the heightened
state of vulnerability and the potential for a dangerous situation, the
order should allow the person to be notified. Equally, that person
should know the terms of the order. If it is intended to protect them,
surely they should know whether the recipient is prevented from going
to their home, or from going to a certain space around it and whether
the notice covers a certain period. If there are breaches, the person
intended to receive the benefit will then be able to report them to the
police. Action can then be taken in relation to breaches, and effective
consideration can be given. The notice would thus operate in the way in
which it was intended&#151;to protect the victim from any further
reprisals or actions  against
them.</div><a name="10020998000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
it probably falls outside the provisions of the clause, one would hope
that appropriate support services would be in place when the notice was
issued  to aid and protect the victim, and to prevent risk and
the dangers that the regulatory impact assessment has rightly
highlighted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000338"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there may be
circumstances when the victims might choose to leave the family home
when a DVPN has been issued, because they are worried about the
additional risk? If they do not know that a DVPN has been issued, or
its content, they may feel that they have been placed at greater risk
and that they have not been able to take a decision to leave the family
home.</div><a name="10020998000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000339"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The information point is important. If the
victim is fearful and a DVPN has been issued, they will want to know
that they have that protection. It is therefore important that there
should be a requirement to issue a copy of the notice to that person.
The interesting point that the hon. Gentleman does not raise is that
the DVPN and the notice&#146;s requirements take us back to clause
21(8) on the prohibitions. If the victim moves to different premises, I
assume that a separate DVPN may need to be issued to prevent any
molestation, or contact with the victim in their new premises. Is
clause 22 sufficiently widely drawn to  allow that to happen?
It is a question of allowing  or permitting modifications to
the DVPN to reflect changing
circumstances.</div><a name="10020998000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
notice&#146;s terms and expression are rigid. I am trying to be
helpful&#151;the Minister may not think so&#151;by looking at how
the provision would operate in practice. We should reflect upon whether
the drafting properly reflects the Minister&#146;s intentions to get
it right and ensure its operation in relation to the cooling-off
period.</div>
<a name="10020998000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="10020998000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
DVPN does not have a maximum period&#151;it is not limited to 48
hours. It can be extended further until either an order is granted or
the court is able to determine the application. That could be a long
time indeed in a complex case, if further interviews or evidence are
required or forensics have to be examined. I had understood that the
notice allowed a cooling-off period&#151;a relatively short time to
allow the victim to seek advice, assess their options and see what
other provisions, sanctions or protections might be available to them
by virtue of the law, or see whether mediation or other measures might
be appropriate to protect
them.</div><a name="10020998000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I read it clause 22, the operation period of the notice could be longer
than the period of the order itself. I question whether that was the
Government&#146;s intention. Obviously, a DVPO is intended to last
from 14 to 28 days, but, with court hearings and the need to obtain
evidence, it would be easy for a DVPN&#151;without the court&#146;s
overview and interpretation or an application&#151;to last much
longer than the protection order itself. It could take several months
to obtain all the information and assess the evidence to issue an order
that lasts 28 days. Judging by the language in the clause
and the RIA, I am sure that that is not the intention, so if we are
creating a cooling-off period, what is the intended maximum period?
Should the notice state a maximum period to provide clarity and ensure
that someone is not subject to a DVPN for a very long time, when it was
intended to provide a short cooling-off
period?</div><a name="10020998000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is easy to think of a complex case in which the children, as contrasted
with the partner, of the alleged perpetrator make different
allegations. How would those elements interrelate, particularly, as the
Minister said, in view of the fact that separate DVPN notices need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>be issued for each person they seek to protect? I am sure that the
Minister will reflect on this and the previous debate. I think he said
that there would effectively be a consolidated hearing, looking at all
facts and the circumstances of all of the alleged victims. We would not
want separate DVPO hearings for each individual&#151;that would not
be sensible or a good use of the court&#146;s time. Would it be
possible to dispose of a notice at one hearing because the facts did
not relate to that individual, but to extend the notice period under
another notice issued for a child, for example, to see whether any
abuse of that child had taken place? We could have one notice ending
and another continuing.</div>
<a name="10020998000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
relationship between the issuance of the notice and the setting out of
its contents. Could notices differ slightly, depending on the
circumstances of the victim? I am assuming that for one household with
multiple potential victims, the DVPN, as stated, should be the same,
with the same facts and circumstances, but that may not be the case as
there may be subtle differences. It would be useful to understand
whether that is the
intention.</div><a name="10020998000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should appreciate clarification on subsection (1)(e), which
says:</div><a name="10020998000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
DVPN must state...the provision that a magistrates&#146; court
may include in a domestic violence protection
order.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not understand what that language means. Can the Minister explain it
to me? It may be that I was looking at it late in the evening. From a
cold reading of it, I am not sure whether it seeks to impute provisions
that a magistrates court could apply on a non-molestation order, or if
it is making a separate point. I do not understand what the paragraph
is intended to provide for. It may be that there is some subtlety that
I do not understand, but I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response and clarification. It may apply some flexibility to dealing
with the issuance of other orders&#151;the fact that the perpetrator
could be on licence, tagged or something like that. I do not know. The
proposal may be trying to address some of the points I alluded to
earlier in this debate. I would be grateful if the Minister clarified
that
point.</div><a name="10020998000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
move on to the connected point of what is stated in the notice and the
service of the notice that crops up in relation to clause 22. The
subsequent parts of it fall slightly outside the ambit of the
amendment, but interrelate with it. It
says:</div><a name="10020998000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(2)
A DVPN must be in writing and must be served on P personally by a
constable.</div><a name="10020998000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">(3)
On serving P with a DVPN, the constable must ask P for an address for
the purposes of being given the notice of the hearing of the
application for the domestic violence protection
order.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will see later that the notice of the court hearing is appropriately
served if left at the person&#146;s address. I question
whether service should be personal&#151;at least in relation to the
first court hearing. If the hearing must take place, as is said in the
notice, within 48 hours of service, that implies that when the notice
is received, the time of the court hearing is not necessarily known.
There would then be a requirement for subsequent notification. Given
that the period is only 48 hours, surely that would need to be by
personal service. Personal service can mean leaving something at
someone&#146;s address or handing it to the person, to ensure that he
is then able to go to court to rebut or make representations. In that
way, a sense of justice is applied and P is able to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>represented at the hearing, rather than the hearing ending up being
adjourned simply because P is not there because he did not receive
notice of the hearing. That information would not be stated at the same
time as the DVPN is served, but perhaps it should be. One may already
have sought to obtain permission of the court to know,
contemporaneously or slightly before one has to apply for a DVPO, so
that the notice can be clear as to when the court hearing should take
place. That would certainly aid justice to take place and the relevant
facts to be presented at the earliest possible time for the
court.</div>
<a name="10020998000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">One final
point on the contents of the DVPN relates to the sanctions for breach.
The Minister made it clear in the evidence he provided that a breach of
an order would be treated as a contempt of court. I understand that, so
the relevant sanctions and provisions would apply as if it were a
contempt of court. However, at the stage a notice is given, the matter
has not come to court. The effects of the notice have not been
confirmed by virtue of the order. I therefore question what sanctions
would apply for breach of the notice. In other words, if the notice has
been issued and the first 48 hours have not yet elapsed&#151;or if
they have, the hearing has been adjourned and therefore the operative
part is the notice itself issued by the police&#151;what sanctions or
provisions would apply for breach of the notice?</div>
<a name="10020998000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I may be
wrong, but that does not strike me as being a contempt of court,
because the court has not approved the notice. The police officer has
not gone to court to obtain the notice: the officer has simply issued a
notice administratively against the person, with the appropriate
authorisation, based on that officer&#146;s assessment of the facts
and circumstances. There does not appear to be any statement in the
notice on what happens in the event of a breach. For the operation of
the notice to be effective, surely a statement of sanctions or
penalties that will apply if the notice is breached is important. The
recipients would then be clear that it was not only a piece of paper
that they had been given by the police telling them not to do certain
things, but that it had teeth that resulted in sanctions and penalties.
That should be stated expressly on the notice, as should how the
sanctions would operate and be incorporated within a contempt-type
application.</div><a name="10020998000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the notification and contents provisions are properly
drafted. I apologise to the Committee for going through such matters in
detail, but they relate to the effective operation of the whole system
if we are to rely on the notices to be preventive. I hope that the
Minister can respond favourably to my argument. If he cannot, will he
reflect and come back on Report to discuss those points that have
validity, so that we can ensure that the system operates as he intends
it to
operate?</div><a name="10020998000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000340"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I fancy the Minister feels that he has been well and
truly probed by my hon. Friend, so I can be relatively brief. I have a
lot of sympathy with the general approach, in that it is desirable to
use his amendment to question the contents of the notice. I am not with
him all the way; by removing some of the particulars from the notice,
he would be going further than I would wish.</div>
<a name="10020998000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">To start
with, it is important that, if there is to be a power of arrest, the
notice should say that the person can be arrested without a warrant.
The person in question 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>needs to know that. Secondly, if my amendment carries the day such that
the constable &#147;may&#148; rather than &#147;must&#148; make
an application for the order, clearly there has to be a modification of
clause 22(1)(c) because there would not necessarily be a hearing within
48 hours or, indeed, a hearing at all.</div>
<a name="10020998000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
drafting point, but much more substantive is the good point made by my
hon. Friend that the notice, under the provisions of clause 21(8), can
clearly restrict the ability of the person to live at a stated address,
probably the matrimonial home; however, there may be other legal orders
that require the person to live in that address, such as bail
conditions. A court will often require a person on bail to reside at a
particular address and, indeed comply with curfew restrictions on that
address; police bail can have the same effect. Also, have we considered
control orders, about which there has been huge discussion? They do
exactly the same. I believe that there are requirements
under immigration law, too, but I am not familiar with them and it does
not matter for these
purposes.</div><a name="10020998000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reinforce my hon. Friend&#146;s point that the Government must think
how the Bill will deal with a case where a notice is issued that is
incompatible with a previous order of legal effect. One theoretical
answer is that the person affected by the notice under clause 21
informs the constable or goes back to the court that issued the bail
requirements or the Home Secretary who issued the control order and
asks, &#147;What are you going to do about my difficulty?&#148;
However, that is not a practical answer. We must address the issue to
which my hon. Friend drew attention.</div>
<a name="10020998000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="10020998000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point on which I have much sympathy with my hon. Friend is that the
notice could run for a long time. He is right that it could exceed the
period of the order itself, which, under clause 25(10), is subject to a
cap of 28 days. Once one grasps the fact that a court may adjourn the
hearing of the application under clause 24(8), one realises at once
that one can get oneself a running notice, because under clause
22(1)(d), the notice will remain in effect until the application has
been determined. However, if a court uses the clause 24(8) powers to
continue to adjourn the hearing on the application, one then has a
running notice, which could well exceed the period of the cap. I accept
that it is probably necessary to impose a cap on the efficacy of the
notice, or, alternatively, to say that an order must be made within a
prescribed time, as in clause
25.</div><a name="10020998000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000341"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Will my right hon. and learned Friend confirm
my understanding that the court has no discretion to change the notice
once it has been granted? It does not appear that there is discretion
to change it&#151;the Bill simply states that the DVPN will remain in
place. That is not even a matter that the court needs to
consider.</div>
<a name="10020998000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000342"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> My hon. Friend is probably right. I have not asked
myself that question, so I hope he will forgive me if I do not give a
definitive answer. The Minister is probably better placed than I am to
answer that question immediately. If not, he will get advice from those
who  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>are scribbling him notes&#151;of course, we cannot see what goes on. I
do not know the answer to my hon. Friend&#146;s question, but I think
he is probably
right.</div><a name="10020998000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are the points that I want to make. The Minister has been well and
truly probed, and we look forward to seeing the
wounds.</div><a name="10020998000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000343"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Being probed is an occupational hazard in my job.
I have no objections to that&#151;it is a valid part of the
parliamentary process.</div>
<a name="10020998000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham and the hon.
Member for Hornchurch have raised many matters that the Home Secretary
and I discussed when originally approached by the Association of Chief
Police Officers about how to fill a gap in domestic violence protection
legislation. I hope that I can answer their
concerns.</div><a name="10020998000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise again that the legislative framework in the clauses allows
for a pilot to take place in two areas for six months after the
legislation is approved by Parliament. Brian Moore, the chief constable
of Wiltshire, who leads in ACPO on such matters, wishes to ensure that
those issues are dealt with via the pilot, so that we learn lessons
from its operation and, if need be, tweak the provisions. That does not
take away valid points that colleagues have mentioned
today.</div><a name="10020998000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman have covered
issues such as bail, duration, support, sanctions and conditions. I
will try to cover each of those in turn. First, on the valid point that
individuals may be subject to other orders, it will not be unheard of
for a court to come across an individual who already has an outstanding
bail requirement to live in a property, because domestic violence may
be an element of general behaviour that leads to that type of
requirement. I can envisage a circumstance in which someone is subject
to a control order, but given the number of control orders we have,
that is a very limited opportunity.</div>
<a name="10020998000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point
is that an individual may be subject to competing sanctions. One of the
reasons why we have given a superintendent or above the authorisation
to approve a domestic violence protection notice is that it would be
the culmination of a series of activities. The superintendent who
ultimately authorises it would, when doing so, ask the question,
&#147;Is the individual at that property on bail? Is the individual
on a control order? Is the individual subject to a court recall in the
next 48 hours?&#148; Those are questions that the person
authorising the domestic violence protection notice would legitimately
ask as part of that consideration. I hope that that will be tested
during the pilot. The hon. Member for Hornchurch has made a valid
point, which is on the record. I hope that my words will reinforce to
the chief constable of Wiltshire the fact that such matters will need
to be looked at as part of the training and support on authorising
orders.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000344"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point that a
superintendent will be aware of a bail requirement or control order,
but presumably he agrees that if there is a competing order of the kind
just mentioned, it is not then open to the superintendent to require
the person to live away from the matrimonial home until such time as
the previous order has been varied either by the court that issued the
bail or by the Home Secretary who made the control
order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div><a name="10020998000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000345"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman makes a very
reasonable point. My point is that in any breach of any order&#151;it
usually ends up as a breach before the penalties are put in
place&#151;the defendant will be allowed to explain why they breached
the order. For example, if the bail conditions are breached in
extenuating circumstances, they might have a reasonable excuse for not
living at the bail property. They may have been excluded because of
action taken under the activity that the clause authorises.</div>
<a name="10020998000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the issues need to be thought through. A legitimate defence for the
clause as it stands is to say that the superintendent should know or
would ask questions before agreeing to the order. Secondly, the
defendant may have a legitimate excuse for breaching an order to live
at a bail property because they are subject to a DVPN and therefore
cannot return to the property where they were bailed. I am sure both
courts would consider those matters appropriate. They are legitimate
points. I hope that that answers the points raised, and I remind the
Committee that, subject to the pilot, we can test those issues and
examine them further if need
be.</div><a name="10020998000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hornchurch asked about the police and time scales. The
police are confident that they can gather evidence in time. Magistrates
have confirmed that hearings could occur within 48 hours, excluding
Sundays and public holidays, ensuring that action is taken speedily.
Our aim is a flexible, speedy response to dramatic and challenging
circumstances in which individuals are at risk of injury or worse. A
speedy response is possible.</div>
<a name="10020998000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that the purpose of the order is to enable the police to
issue an emergency non-molestation and eviction notice, subject to the
superintendent&#146;s approval, on being called to an incident of
domestic violence. In the circumstances described today, a constable
will arrive at a property knowing that they had been there before. When
the phone call comes to go to the property, they know that they are
going to a domestic incident, because that is the nature of the call.
If they determine that the only way to resolve it is to remove one
party from the premises, they will get authorisation from
the superintendent, who will undoubtedly ask, &#147;Why are you
asking for this emergency power now?&#148; The constable will reply,
&#147;Because there is continuing domestic violence.&#148; The next
question will be, &#147;Who is the individual?&#148; They will say,
&#147;It is Mr. or Mrs. X.&#148; The
superintendent will ask, &#147;What is the background of the
individual?&#148; The constable will say, &#147;We know they are
already on bail for another activity at that property.&#148; Those
are legitimate points of the process; those valid points will be
considered by the senior officer and will ultimately be dealt with in a
speedy way in the courts. I hope that that satisfies both the right
hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman, but I am happy to
hear further from them in due
course.</div><a name="10020998000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Domestic
violence protection order adjournment was raised by the hon. Member for
Hornchurch. The Bill proposes no limit on the number or duration of
DVPO adjournments. The protection for perpetrators, if needed, lies in
article 6 of that well-known document, which many hon. Members love and
admire, the European convention on human rights. Article 6 ensures that
the hearing takes place within a reasonable time. A case being
adjourned beyond the 48-hour period would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>unlikely to provide grounds for a successful challenge under the
convention, but might in due course be possible in the event of
elongated
proceedings.</div><a name="10020998000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the seriousness of such a tool, which could exclude an
individual from what might be their family home or business. Such
issues weighed heavily on the Home Secretary and me when considering
the legislation. Rehousing women and their families in a refuge, in the
event of domestic violence, costs some &#163;4,000 a week. We are
removing those people&#151;who are, we must remember, the
victims&#151;from their homes to another place, creating uncertainty
for them and their families. The temporary homeless nature of an
individual, who might have to find a hotel or live with relatives for
the period, is an inconvenience and is difficult, but must be
considered when understanding why an individual has been involved in
domestic violence in the first place. That must be considered carefully
against the cost of rehousing a victim. Indeed, the police and courts,
in reaching their decision, will be required to examine all the
circumstances of the case, which might include whether the perpetrator
would be rendered
homeless.</div><a name="10020998000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may be old-fashioned in such matters, but I suspect that few
perpetrators barred from the family home would not have a friend or
relative to stay with or sufficient resource to afford a hotel bill for
the relevant period. On occasion that might be the case, and the
superintendent and others would need to consider the impact on the
individual. The impact would figure as part of the approval process.
They might not agree to the order because of what they might deem its
consequences: someone sleeping rough on the streets, potentially
drinking heavily and causing more police problems. Consideration of
what happens to the perpetrator would still be central. For
clarification, the issuance of the DVPN can run in tandem with any
other criminal proceedings, and would not be affected by one or by the
other.</div><a name="10020998000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of breach was mentioned, and the hon. Member for Woking
(Mr. Malins) also raised the issue on the Floor of the
Chamber. Clear standards are set for a breach and the DVPO will be
dealt with under the provisions of the Magistrates Court Act 1980 that
apply to any order of the court. The perpetrator&#151;depending on
the court outcome&#151;could be committed to prison for up to two
months or fined up to &#163;5,000 for breach of the
order.</div><a name="10020998000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000346"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister of State rightly highlights the
DVPO, but my point was subtly different: the breach could be of the
DVPN. In other words, in the first 48 hours, before getting to court,
the DVPN is breached. It is not an order of the court, but merely a
notice issued by a police officer. Would that be captured in the same
way under the provisions alluded to by the Minister? My point was
technical and trying to cover that
gap.</div><a name="10020998000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="10020998000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000347"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I was about to go on to that point. The DVPN will
state that there is power of arrest, and that the individual can be
arrested if they breach the notice. That is a serious point. If the
hon. Gentleman is not content, I shall happily take interventions to
try further to clarify the matter.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div><a name="10020998000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The DVPN would
also include a standard paragraph about the terms that the magistrates
court could include in the DVPO. In clause 25(6) the hon. Gentleman
will see that
the</div><a name="10020998000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;DVPO
must contain provision to prohibit P from molesting the person for
whose protection it is
made.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
clause 25(8) states that if P lives in the
premises,</div><a name="10020998000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
DVPO may also contain
provision&#151;</div><a name="10020998000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
to prohibit P from evicting or excluding from the premises the person
for whose protection the DVPO is
made,</div><a name="10020998000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) to
prohibit P from entering the
premises,</div><a name="10020998000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
to require P to leave the premises,
or</div><a name="10020998000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d) to
prohibit P from coming within such distance of the premises as may be
specified in the
DVPO.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
indicates that the standard paragraph that we propose to pilot would
certainly take those issues into
account.</div><a name="10020998000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has also made an important point about casework for the
victim, and victim support. I am happy to show that parliamentary
democracy works in a wonderful way by considering whether we need to
tweak that provision still further before Report stage. We might want
to make it more specific, or I might reflect on it and leave it for the
pilot. In guidance, we can certainly have a general message that the
DVPN should be given to the victim, so that its meaning is clear to
them. We can do that in guidance without legislation to back it up, and
that might satisfy the hon. Gentleman. It is important that the victim
knows what has happened and why, what the order means and how it
operates, and what his or her legal protections are. I am
acutely aware that it may be the first time that the individual has
experienced violence, but it will not be the first time that the police
or the courts will have dealt with such an issue. We need to ensure
that we have a victim-centred approach, and that victims know exactly
what the order means for them and their family and what a breach of the
order would signify. That is an extremely good point, and we can ensure
those things in
guidance.</div><a name="10020998000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have covered all the points that have been raised. To be
critical after my conciliatory remarks, I say to the hon. Member for
Hornchurch that amendment 153 would remove three of the five
prescribed contents of a DVPN and destroy the concept of the order. It
would remove the power of arrest and the hearing within 48 hours, and
would prevent the DVPN continuing until the DVPO had been determined.
If I agreed to the amendment, effectively we might as well rip up the
piece of paper and throw it away. I appreciate that the amendment is a
probing one, to tease out issues. I hope that, having been suitably
probed, I have responded in a way that helps the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10020998000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000348"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s relatively
constructive response, but I have two specific points to make. First,
on the power of arrest, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch is
entirely right that the power of arrest should not arise for a breach
of the notice unless the police officer has reasonable grounds to
believe that the notice has been served. It is not sufficient to leave
that to guidance, or to the pilot; it needs to be in the Bill. An
arrest power is important. It is obviously possible that the person
does not know of the notice or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>its contents, and in those circumstances an arrest would be unjust,
especially as I see from clause 23 that he must be kept in custody.
Proof of the service of the notice, or some other suitable wording,
should be in the
Bill.</div><a name="10020998000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly
and differently, my hon. Friend and I have spent some time considering
the issue that another order may require the person to live at a stated
address&#151;let us call it the matrimonial home. The Bill should
state that the superintendant should not issue a notice requiring the
person to exit the family home, if I may describe it in that shorthand
way, if there is an existing order of the court or some other lawful
authority requiring them to reside at that address. It is not
sufficient to leave these matters to pilots or to guidance because
powers of arrest and custody will follow for breach. We must address
this question in statutory
language.</div><a name="10020998000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000349"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> There is a disagreement between us on that point.
I think that these issues can be covered using the methods I have
discussed. The superintendant would know that there was another order
against the individual receiving the DVPN. If they did not, they would
not be doing their job properly. There is sufficient clarity in that
area and I am not minded to accept that criticism from the right hon.
and learned
Gentleman.</div><a name="10020998000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s first point, I refer him
to page 62 of the Bill. Clause 22(2)
states:</div><a name="10020998000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
DVPN must be in writing and must be served on P personally by a
constable.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope he will accept that it is fairly clear that an individual will be
served with a DVPN in writing by a constable and that it will be clear
to them that in the event of a breach, they will be arrested and held
in
custody.</div><a name="10020998000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000350"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I accept
that.</div><a name="10020998000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000351"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> With those comments, I will sit down and allow the
hon. Member for Hornchurch to debate. I do not know whether I am giving
way or letting him
speak.</div><a name="10020998000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000352"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> This debate has been helpful because it has
clarified some of the practical issues with the operation of notices
and orders. I respect what the Minister has said about wanting to
reflect on these points and am grateful to him. There is a point of
difference between us regarding his suggestion that this can be dealt
with simply through the pilots. It is clear from the debate that there
are issues that are recognised up front. If they are apparent now, they
should be addressed, and in certain cases need to be addressed, in the
Bill or in
guidance.</div><a name="10020998000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that speed might be a relevant factor. I understand the
intention behind the provisions of protecting the victim, and we should
not lose sight of that. I am trying to flag up the fact that we may
need a mechanism to address bail conditions or other provisions that
conflict with the DVPN. There does not appear to be such a mechanism,
but there could be an application to a court to get some form of DVPN
that overrides the issue. It could be assessed that there has been an
assault serious enough to justify a DVPN and the provision could be
used almost in a protective way to allow a cooling-off period to
prevent further violence. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>comes within our contemplation of this matter. We could reflect on
whether a further court adjustment could be obtained to put the
victim&#146;s interests first.</div>
<a name="10020998000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the Minister&#146;s point about the superintendant. If we elevate
things to such a level, we would expect the superintendant to make the
inquiries. However, if there is an element of speed&#151;of
necessity&#151;inquiries may not be complete when it is felt that a
DVPN should be issued. It may subsequently come to light that, as a
result of an omission or error, the DVPN does conflict with other
provisions. If I understand the Minister correctly, the onus is on the
superintendant to make the inquiries. The implication is that if that
does not happen, and there is an omission, the notice might be
defective. I hesitate at that, because it introduces some uncertainty,
and I want to get the provisions right to ensure that they operate
appropriately. As I said,  the court may have the right to
modify the terms of the notice in the 48-hour period to address some of
these issues.</div>
<a name="10020998000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000353"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope this is helpful. For the purpose of this
discussion, I am the superintendant who has to approve the order. The
first thing I will do is type the perpetrator&#146;s name into the
police national computer, and bail conditions or other issues would
then show up. Given the way in which I have described the process, it
is not impractical for the superintendant, even with a need for speed,
to say, &#147;Who&#146;s the individual? What&#146;s their form?
What&#146;s the impact if I sign the
order?&#148;</div><a name="10020998000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000354"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says, and it may be
true of the bail conditions, but would it apply equally to all terms of
antisocial behaviour orders or gang injunctions in civil court
proceedings? I agree with the requirement to make inquiries, and it is
absolutely right that it should be in place, but I genuinely hope that
the Minister is right.</div>
<a name="10020998000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000355"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> For the record, let me state that any conviction
of any individual would be logged on the police national computer. The
first thing the superintendant would do&#151;certainly following
today&#146;s debate&#151;would be to check the individual&#146;s
circumstances. I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
genuine&#151;I accept that it is genuine&#151;policy
concern.</div>
<a name="10020998000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000356"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister has said about
convictions. All that I would say is that other quasi-criminal civil
orders may not necessarily be apparent at the time. I ask him to
reflect on that to ensure that we do not undermine the intent and the
spirit of the clause. The Minister may not think so, but I am trying to
help him to get the provisions right. I would not like us to end up
with an article 6 ECHR application&#151;this brings us on to the
issue of there being no limit on the time period&#151;with the court
effectively undermining the whole operation of the clause or casting
doubt on it.</div>
<a name="10020998000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we debated
in relation to other issues in the Bill, if there are questions about
the time period and the notice is wrong, the recipient might be harmed
and might lose their liberty. I appreciate that we cannot prevent court
cases from arising, but I would not want us not to consider these
issues and end up with a problem down the track. The Minister&#146;s
approach is sensible and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>considered, and I hope that he will reflect on any questions that arise
at this point to satisfy himself and the Committee that this is not an
issue or that there are other ways of dealing with it. If not, I hope
that we can adjust the provisions in the Bill so that we do not
subsequently get into a debate about things not having been stated in
it because they were only matters of practice and so that the operation
of the provisions is not undermined by an ECHR-type
challenge.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000357"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. In theory,
the DVPN period could be longer than the DVPO period, but that is
unlikely. Ultimately, the length of time for all these measures is in
the hands of the court and the police. It is not in the interests of
either to have the issue dragged out over a longer period of
time.</div><a name="10020998000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
wish to duck the issue today, but, again, I am happy to put the matter
into the guidance, and we can consider how to tighten it up. When we
look at the pilot and the guidance, we can ensure that those issues are
addressed in a fair and effective
way.</div><a name="10020998000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000358"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that assurance, because it
is important that we get the matter
right.</div><a name="10020998000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
closing, I shall return to the issue of the sanctions that might apply
in relation to the DVPN. In the next clause, we will address the issue
of breach so I will not tread on that territory. I understand that
there is the power of arrest. The Minister of State was right to say in
response to the point made by my right hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham that there is a power of arrest
and that the DVPN must be served personally on P, but what happens
then? I am still not certain. I respect and understand the point that
the Minister of State has made about a breach of the order and that
that is a contempt of court, but I am still not certain what the
sanctions are for a breach of the notice. In other words, if the notice
that is issued by the police officer is breached, is that regarded as
contempt of court? I am not sure whether it is. It may be that I have
missed a point of detail, but it seems that breach is stated as
creating a power of
arrest.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000359"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> To wrap up the two points made by the right hon.
and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham and the hon. Member
for Hornchurch, subsection (2)
states:</div><a name="10020998000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
DVPN must be in writing and must be served on P personally by a
constable.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, P knows that he or she has a DVPN. Subsection (1)(b)
states that</div>
<a name="10020998000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a constable may
arrest P without warrant if the constable has reasonable grounds for
believing that P is in breach of the
DVPN.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that that covers those points. Perhaps I have misunderstood
something, but I presume that there is a sanction of arrest, if there
is a breach of the notice, for immediate custody during that 48-hour
period up to the endorsement by the court or
otherwise.</div><a name="10020998000145"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000361"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says. I do not know
whether my right hon. and learned Friend wishes to intervene on
me.</div><a name="10020998000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000362"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I remembered that the Minister was not making a
speech, which is why I sat down, but perhaps I can raise a matter with
him through my hon. Friend. I well understand how the
constable can arrest without a warrant somebody who is in breach of the
notice. The problem that then seems to arise is that the notice remains
in force until the order is made. If the order is made and the person
is in breach of it, there is clear provision for punishment. What is
the position if he is in continuing breach of the notice, which has
been extended for a period of time, before the making of an order? I do
not know the answer to that.</div>
<a name="10020998000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000363"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to my right hon. and learned
Friend for that analysis, because it is precisely my analysis. It does
not appear that the court, even at that first hearing, confirms the
notice. In effect, the notice just carries on. That is a technical
issue. I do not want to load the point, so I will give way to the
Minister and hear what he has to
say.</div><a name="10020998000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000364"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am trying to be helpful. I will, if you will
allow me, Sir Nicholas, refer to clause 23, which is entitled
&#147;Breach of a domestic violence protection notice&#148;.
Subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="10020998000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person arrested by virtue of section 22(1)(b) for a breach of a DVPN
must be held in custody and brought before the magistrates&#146;
court which will hear the application...under section
24&#148;.</div><a name="10020998000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circumstances are quite clear. P has a DVPN put in their hand
personally by a constable. If P breaches that order, the constable can
arrest P without a warrant. P is then taken immediately into custody
and brought to the magistrates court for the DVPO to be considered. If
that DVPO is agreed, P is potentially in breach of it under the other
regulations and faces imprisonment and a fine; if not, P will remain in
custody.</div><a name="10020998000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000365"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am sure the Minister will reflect on the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> report and if I have not made my point clearly, I
apologise to the Committee. If I understand the Minister, he is saying
that there is a power of arrest, and if the DVPN is breached, the
person is held in custody until the DVPO is disposed of. That is the
sole penalty that would apply in those circumstances, and some of the
other fines and sanctions that might apply to a breach of the order do
not apply; it is simply the retention of the person in custody. I am
genuinely grateful to the Minister for that explanation, because that
is not how I had interpreted the provision. Having the discussion has
helped, albeit that we will come on to the operation of the provisions
in the clause when we discuss clause 23.</div>
<a name="10020998000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000366"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> There is a rather worrying point. Clause
23(3) states:</div>
<a name="10020998000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the court adjourns the hearing of the
application&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020998000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
I have already referred
to&#151;</div><a name="10020998000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
court may remand the person.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020998000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the court
can remand the person in custody until the order is made. As the court
has very wide discretion to adjourn the hearing and, therefore, not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>make the order, P&#151;at least in theory&#151;can remain in custody
for an unlimited period. I do not suppose that is the intention, but
from what is in the Bill it certainly appears to be the
consequence.</div><a name="10020998000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000367"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Sir Nicholas, I fear that we are already
straying into clause 23 and to points I may wish to make on it. I have
heard what my right hon. and learned Friend said and I am sure that it
will be reflected in the next
debate.</div><a name="10020998000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate has been helpful and I am sure that we will all reflect on it.
The intention of my amendment was to probe, and to facilitate debate.
It has been detailed, but in light of the Minister&#146;s comments
and our debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000368"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have just had a very important and detailed
debate, but I note that it lasted nearly an hour and a quarter. We have
a lot of other important matters to consider. I hope that all
Members&#151;particularly Front Bench Members, as they are really the

self-discipline.</div><a name="10020998000013"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

of a domestic violence protection
notice</div><a name="10020998000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000369"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I beg to move amendment 154, in
clause 23, page 62, line 6, leave
out &#145;must&#146; and insert
&#145;may&#146;.</div><a name="10020998000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the need for clause 23 and given the seriousness of repeat
offending and the risk of violence, which we discussed in the previous
debate, I recognise that there may be justification for someone in
breach of the notice to be held in custody.</div>
<a name="10020998000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is a
technical one that the Minister may be able to address. The clause
presupposes that breach occurs before the initial hearing; it states
that if a breach has occurred, the court</div>
<a name="10020998000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will hear the
application for the DVPO under section
24&#148;,</div><a name="10020998000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that the application will need to be
heard</div><a name="10020998000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;before
the end of the period of 24 hours beginning with the time of the
arrest&#148;.</div><a name="10020998000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, if notice has been served and there has been a breach, the
person has to go to court within a 24-hour period. As my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has already
mentioned, that hearing can then be adjourned. If there is a
requirement that the person must be retained in custody, it would
continue without discretion until the domestic violence protection
order has been dealt
with.</div><a name="10020998000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause mentions the hearing for the DVPO. It may be that an interim
hearing is sufficient and that the requirement to remain in custody
does not necessarily continue beyond that. However, clarification on
that point would be of great assistance, for the reasons given by my
right hon. and learned Friend. I do not think that is the
clause&#146;s intention&#151;the drafting itself may indicate that
it is not what is meant&#151;but the purpose of my probing amendment
is to test that by questioning the distinction between
&#147;must&#148; and &#147;may&#148; be held in
custody.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div><a name="10020998000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
will work if the breach occurs on the service of the DVPN or just
after. What would happen, however, if the breach occurred after the
initial hearing? What happens if a domestic violence protection notice
has been served, there is an initial hearing within 48
hours, and breach of the notice occurs after that? At that stage, more
evidence and information would be obtained, because it would not be
felt that the matter could be disposed of. Does subsection (1)
contemplate that? It would not be a breach of the order at that stage,
because no order would have been given, but it would still be a breach
of the notice. If a breach of the domestic violence protection notice
immediately followed an initial hearing in which the court recognised
that it did not have sufficient evidence to dispose of the matter,
would the person have to attend court to have the domestic violence
protection order considered? At  that stage, the court might
have already recognised  that it was not in a position to
consider the order, because of the need for forensics and for other
evidence and information. It may adjourn with a return date  of
seven days. How would the provision work in such
circumstances?</div>
<a name="10020998000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court
would have already recognised that it was unable to deal with the DVPO
within the 24-hour period contemplated under the clause. The clause
therefore needs to be reflected upon not simply in relation to the
initial 48 hours, but in relation to what happens when there is a
breach of the notice following those 48 hours when an adjournment has
taken place, as contemplated by clause 24(8), which centres on the
adjournment of a hearing of an
application.</div><a name="10020998000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may be right and proper that, having been arrested for a breach of the
notice, the person subject to the notice should be brought before the
magistrates court within 24 hours for the court to decide what should
happen. However, that is a slightly different scenario from that
envisaged in the drafting of clause 23(1). Therefore, my probing
amendment is to test whether the language needs to be slightly tweaked
to deal with such a
situation.</div><a name="10020998000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. and learned Friend has tabled a similar amendment to clause
24. A person must currently be held in custody pending the court
hearing, and I understand that is intended to be for a limited period
to balance risk. A limited period without judicial oversight would not
be appropriate, therefore it is right that someone should come before
the court. We need some clarity from the Minister, however, on the
intentions behind clause 23. If there has been an arrest and a breach,
is the intention that the person should be held in custody throughout
the period in which the DVPO is being considered? At that stage, a
final determination will not have been made and the application will
not have been struck out. On the other hand, is it intended that the
matter should simply come before the magistrates court to determine
what may be appropriate in the circumstances? I would like to hear the
Minister&#146;s views. I tabled amendment 154 for that testing
purpose and to elicit understanding of the operation of the
clause.</div><a name="10020998000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="10020998000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000370"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I hope that I can explain the provisions, because
there is clarity in the Bill. Going back to clause 22, if an
individual is served a DVPN in writing by a constable and they breach
it within 48 hours, they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>are arrested and held in custody. That is straightforward and simple.
Under clause 23(2), if an individual is then brought before the court,
the court may remand the person. Under subsection
(3):</div><a name="10020998000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the court adjourns the hearing of the application by virtue of section
24(8), the court may remand the
person.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that would be based on the assessment of the risk posed by the
individual to the victim, the victim&#146;s children or family. The
court will remand the person if necessary to protect the victim. It
could also bear in mind that these are civil proceedings and it can
examine the issues in
detail.</div><a name="10020998000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
23(1) states that the court must remand on breach; again, that is for
the protection of the victim. Suppose that a DVPN is served at 8
o&#146;clock on a Monday evening; the perpetrator goes away, returns
the following day and tries to start another row, so there is a breach
and custody is necessary as there could be serious injury to the
victim. Remanding the perpetrator in custody is therefore valid. If
there has been a breach, it may be clear to the court that a DVPO is
necessary because of that breach. It may be a contributing factor in
deciding to issue a DVPO urgently because the fact that the breach has
occurred shows that there is a real risk to the
victim.</div><a name="10020998000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses
22 and 23 are phrased in that way to ensure that the victim has
immediate protection from the perpetrator, that the perpetrator is
immediately removed from the family property and that the perpetrator
is put into custody in the event of breach. In the event of the case
being adjourned, the court may examine the risk to the individual and
the seriousness of the breach; it may determine that there should be
further custody or regard that breach as grounds for immediate issue of
a DVPO, which carries further penalties for
breach.</div>
<a name="10020998000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000371"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the Minister says about the
breach, as he puts it, perhaps justifying the issuance of the DVPO at
that point, but that is not necessarily open to the court. The court
must be</div>
<a name="10020998000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;satisfied on
balance of probabilities that P has been violent towards, or has
threatened violence towards, an associated person.&#148;</div>
<a name="10020998000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply returning to the
home does not necessarily make out the first limb. The operative period
may elapse because the court is awaiting forensics and other
information to ensure that that first condition is
met.</div>
<a name="10020998000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000372"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> Again, under clause 22(2), the DVPN is served in
writing by a police officer to an individual. On Monday night at 8
o&#146;clock, the individual is served the DVPN. The police officer
says, &#147;I&#146;m serving you this notice, which has been
approved by a superintendent who has looked into the case and approved
the notice. It says that you mustn&#146;t return to this property
because of the threat of domestic violence. If you do, you will be held
in custody until the case is taken.&#148; If an individual goes back
to the property, even if only to collect a suit or some post, they are
in breach of the notice and need to know the consequences&#151;clause
22 says that there shall be custody as a
result.</div><a name="10020998000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the person comes before the court, it will consider whether it needs
further information, as the hon. Member for Hornchurch mentioned;
whether the case is based on fact and needs to be seen through; and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>whether there are grounds for a DVPO. In doing that, the court will
consider whether it needs to remand the person further if a breach has
occurred. If the breach consisted of going back to pick up some post,
it might not remand the individual. If, however, it was that the
individual went back to kick their partner who reported them to the
police, resulting in their spending the night in custody, that would be
an entirely different scenario for the court to consider. I have no
doubt that the court would make a responsible judgment under clause
23(3) in assessing the need for remand in the event of an adjournment.
If the breach is serious, that might be the reason for not adjourning
but, moving immediately to the issuance of a domestic violence
protection order. The seriousness of the breach might put the victim
under threat.</div>
<a name="10020998000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
are all predicated on protection of the victim; they are serious
provisions, which I do not expect to be used every day. They will be
used where there is a serious risk of domestic violence by repeat
offenders who usually are known to the police, and when the police have
confidence that the measures will protect the victim. They include the
power to give protection by way of custody in the initial 48 hours, and
afterwards in the event of an
adjournment.</div><a name="10020998000180"></a>

between the notice and the seeking of an order; and secondly, on the
right of the court to confirm or modify the DVPN. We touched on many
such points in previous debates.</div>
<a name="10020998000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
about the first point is what happens if it is subsequently discovered
that the grounds for the DVPN being issued were simply wrong. Under the
clause, the constable must apply for a DVPO, come what may, if a DVPN
has been sought and served on P. If it is found out that there has been
a breach of bail conditions, or whatever the case may be&#151;errors
occurred, the facts presented were not what had happened, or further
details have come to light&#151;meaning that it is inappropriate to
proceed to a DVPO, there appears to be no discretion for the constable
or the police to withdraw a DVPN. The Minister may say that that is
what will be analysed and examined through the pilot. I just
wonder whether there is sufficient flexibility to contemplate that sort
of situation.</div>
<a name="10020998000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000378"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I do not want the issuing of a DVPN to be a matter
of routine. It needs to be undertaken when a case of domestic violence
is so serious that high-level support from a chief officer is needed.
For the order to be issued, there must be sufficient grounds for the
concern to be reflected.</div>
<a name="10020998000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000379"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I entirely respect and endorse that aim of
ensuring that the measure is reserved for matters that have been
properly investigated and considered, given the status of the
application and the authorisation needed for a DVPN. However, as the
Minister will know, mistakes can happen. He may say that it would be
right and proper for the matter to proceed to a DVPO application,
because the court would then throw it out, having gone through the
formal process, just so that lessons are learnt by those who seek to
issue a DVPN, to ensure that there are proper steps, protocol and
investigations. If that is the intention, I understand it, and the
Minister has put on record that we would have to go through that
process and that a court hearing would have to take place. I just
question whether that is the intention and whether further discretion
should be
applied.</div><a name="10020998000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is a more subtle one, on the interrelationship between a
DVPO and a DVPN and, more generally, between the court process and the
criminal court process. Let us assume that processes could take place
in parallel&#151;that court proceedings could take place, with
criminal sanctions imposed and a DVPN issued to protect the
victim&#151;for the reasons mentioned, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div>such as the fact that charges may have been brought in at an early stage
or the bail conditions may not necessarily have reflected the context
or issues arising from the case, and therefore the police determine
that a DVPN is appropriate. What would happen then? We need to
understand, in the light of some serious cases, whether there is any
possibility that a breach of a DVPN may also constitute a breach of
bail conditions&#151;whether there is some overlap between the two.
We must also understand whether matters are to be dealt with in the
magistrates court in both circumstances, and whether there are other
offences that may be dealt with by the Crown court in parallel with the
consideration of the DVPN. Is there any parallel jurisdiction between a
magistrates court and the Crown court, because of certain more serious
offences that are being taken into
account?</div><a name="10020998000291"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="10020998000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
someone has breached their bail conditions, and they are now in custody
because of that, a DVPO would no longer be required. What would happen
to the DVPN in those circumstances? It may no longer be needed to
protect the victim because the alleged perpetrator is already in
custody for breach of bail conditions. Such an overlap of jurisdictions
may apply in those circumstances. I wish to understand better what
might happen. The regulatory impact assessment notes that</div>
<a name="10020998000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Though
a DVPN could be issued and a DVPO applied for in conjunction with
criminal proceedings, it is likely that&#151;if the police are able
to apply bail conditions they will not apply for a DVPN/DVPO as this
will potentially create further burden when bail conditions can achieve
similar aims in terms of
protection.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the Minister may deal with that point in guidance, making crystal clear
the sort of circumstances when that may apply.</div>
<a name="10020998000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that I wish to raise is about the caseworker, but if we are to
have a stand part debate it can be dealt with then. It probably falls
outside the ambit of the amendment.</div>
<a name="10020998000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000380"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am grateful for the points that have been
raised. I emphasise that the order, when piloted and if approved and
extended, would be an order of immediate resort, but really an order of
last resort. It is intended to deal with crisis situations, where the
perpetrators will usually have been known to the police for some time.
To prevent future incidents of domestic violence, the protection order
will be put in place within 48 hours so that the individual can be
removed from the family home.</div>
<a name="10020998000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circumstances described by the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham and the hon. Member for Hornchurch are
possible in the sense that there may be sufficient evidence to say that
an order should not have been issued. That is a perfectly
understandable position to take. However, I imagine that that will be
the case only in the smallest number of incidents; as I said, the DVPN
will be used as a last resort&#151;in an emergency, if there is a
history and if it is approved by a superintendent&#151;and that it
will be used in a way that protects the victim.</div>
<a name="10020998000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the event
of a miraculous piece of information emerging that there was no
domestic violence incident that would cause a threat to the victim, the
constable and the superintendent may not think it absolutely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>necessary to ensure the safety of the victim. If something did occur in
such circumstances, however, once the 48-hour period had expired the
court would not progress to a DVPO, and that would be the end of the
matter. Protection is given by putting a time-limited domestic violence
protection notice in place.</div>
<a name="10020998000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000381"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> Of course, that implies that there has to be a court
hearing, and the person concerned would probably feel under an
obligation to turn up. If the circumstances are such that the constable
does not think it worth going for an order, surely it is not necessary
to have a court hearing.</div>
<a name="10020998000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000382"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I dare say that it would not be the first time
that someone had to go to court to prove innocence, and not the first
time that the police did not press charges. It happens every day of the
week. Evidence in court does not always meet the original charge. In my
view, however, that does not make invalid the point that, if an
individual is under threat of domestic attack or even being killed, the
order can be used in extremis to ensure that protection is put in place
for 48 hours, while the court undertakes a slow-time consideration of
the alleged offences.</div>
<a name="10020998000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we accept
the amendments, we will end that discretion. We will effectively be
saying that the DVPN, which is designed to give emergency protection to
the victim, cannot be used in the way that we intended. Domestic
violence is rarely a one-off; it is a cycle of abuse that will have
been going on for years. The 48-hour duration of the DVPN will not give
most victims time to resolve the situation. That is why we have made it
mandatory for the police to apply for a DVPO. In the circumstances that
the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman have set
out, if in that period there does not prove to be sufficient evidence
to apply for the DVPO, the DVPO will not be agreed and the individuals
will return to their property. They will continue in whatever style of
life they wish to continue, and if the violence flares up again, the
same principles will apply.</div>
<a name="10020998000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that gives comfort to the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon.
Gentleman. The amendment is not necessary or helpful and it would take
away the main purpose of the measure, which I remind the Committee is
protection of the
victim.</div><a name="10020998000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000383"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10020998000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000384"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> A key part of the operation of the regime is
the role of the caseworker. The RIA
notes:</div><a name="10020998000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
the DVPO has been issued, a caseworker will make contact with the
victim to offer support and outline the options available, including
advice on applying for longer-term civil injunctions. The caseworker
support is an essential element of the policy if it is to increase the
victim&#146;s
safety.</div><a name="10020998000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">Caseworkers
will perform a role similar to that of
IDVA&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020998000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">an
independent domestic violence
adviser&#151;</div><a name="10020998000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(the
latter only being focused on high or very high risk victims of domestic
violence) and, in cases where there are high risk victims of domestic
violence and existing IDVA services, we anticipate that the IDVA will
perform the caseworker function.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div><a name="10020998000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to
ensure that the victim for whom the protection of a DVPO order is
sought is given the proper support, advice and guidance to assess what
other protections might be afforded to them and what other steps might
be taken to create a longer-lasting settlement of the problems. My
question is about how that relates with the application for a DVPO. The
Minister may say that it does not relate at all, but I would have
thought that the caseworker should be involved in the DVPN period, in
the run-up to consideration of the DVPO, because the advice of the
caseworker or the IDVA at that point might be able to resolve the
matter and other relief or appropriate provision might be available.
The IDVA or the caseworker may advise that it is not in the interests
of the person being protected for there to be a
DVPO.</div><a name="10020998000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the context of the application for and subsequent grant of the order,
to what extent would there be a role for the caseworker? To what extent
would they be able to consider and assist the police or other agencies
in the consideration of the application for a DVPO? What grounds would
they have to be able to assist the court in its judgment that the DVPO
is necessary? That is an important element in making the system work.
It would be helpful, in the context of the clause, to hear the
Minister&#146;s thoughts on the interrelationship. As I see it, what
I have described is an essential element in longer-term prevention,
protection and support for the victims of domestic violence. My
question is about how that interrelates within the operation of the
DVPN and DVPO
practicalities.</div><a name="10020998000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000385"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> I am repeating myself, but we are trying to get
legislative cover for a pilot and part of the pilot&#146;s purpose is
to ensure that we consider not only how the system operates in
practice, but some of the mechanisms that are not in the Bill that
provide support for victims and, indeed, action on perpetrators. The
purpose of the clause is to ensure that we have an application for a
domestic violence protection order. I have said to the hon. Gentleman
that I shall examine whether the Bill needs to make reference to the
caseworker, but as part of the police and other agencies&#146;
consideration when issuing a DVPN, contact with caseworkers and support
services at that time is crucial not only to removing the perpetrator,
but in supporting the alleged victim. We have based some of the
proposals in the Bill on models in other countries and, under the
Austrian model&#151;one of the key determinants&#151;the police
liaise with the caseworker when the DVPN is
issued.</div><a name="10020998000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
anticipate that, if the pilot is successful and we roll out the
provisions nationally, on a phased basis, there will be support for
trained caseworkers&#146; involvement at the time of the issuing of
the notice. It is important that that is so. As I said, I am happy to
look at the matter. Part of the pilot will be to examine how we
integrate support services to meet the needs of the victim at the time
of a notice being issued. That is our intention downstream, subject to
resources and the caveat that the notices and the support services
might be in the hands of agencies not under the control of the
Government. We want the pilot to take place so that we look at such
issues and their complexity during the phased rolling out of the DVPNs,
and that would be on the grounds that support mechanisms were in place
for the
victim.</div><a name="10020998000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000388"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I can be brief. The two substantive amendments are
designed to ensure that the principles of natural justice are complied
with. The first would add a provision whereby the court should hear
such representations as P wishes to make, assuming that P wishes to
make any and is alone. It is the duty of the court to listen to
representations. It will be said that article 6 of the
convention&#151;and this and that&#151;already implicitly makes
such a provision, but the truth is that legislation often states things
found in other legislation. It is helpful for legislation to make the
duties of a court or other duties absolutely plain. If it were the duty
of a court to listen to representations, there is no reason 
why the statute should not state that and every reason why it
should.</div><a name="10020998000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
those who would say that such policy is not usual, I would say that
they are not right. We discussed the Criminal Evidence (Witness
Anonymity) Act 2008 on the Floor of the House 18 months ago, when it
was taken as emergency measure, and I recollect that it provides the
court with a duty to hear representations if they are to be made. I can
doubtless find many other examples of that, so the Committee should
insist on such an obligation being mentioned in the
Bill.</div><a name="10020998000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other measure is not implicit under article 6, but it would enable a
court to vary or discharge the order on an application by P, if P
satisfies the court that there are good reasons for varying or
discharging it. It is true that an order has a fairly limited period.
It can run only up to 28 days, but within that time, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Hornchurch said, P can suffer considerable discomfort.
That person can be outside the matrimonial home and have no obvious
place in which to reside. We should not assume that P necessarily has
means to take up residence in a hotel or has some obliging
friends.</div><a name="10020998000292"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="10020998000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the court can be persuaded that the terms of the order should be
relaxed, the court should have power  to do that. That is the
effect of the second of the  two substantive amendments I am
placing before the Committee.</div>
<a name="10020998000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000389"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> On the lead amendment, the right hon. and learned
Gentleman has made a similar case to the one that he made in relation
to clause 21(3) and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div>domestic violence protection notice, namely, that representations should
be made before the notice is issued. That is fair and proper. Under
current legislation, if a DVPN is applied for, the perpetrator has the
right to be heard as part of his right to a fair trial under article 6
of the ECHR. That does not need to be put specifically in the Bill. The
individual automatically has the right to make representations under
that article, and the amendment would create unnecessary
duplication.</div>
<a name="10020998000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point is a valid one to consider. However, it is one that I cannot
accept for the simple reason, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman
himself has said, that the order has a maximum duration of 28 days.
There are two issues to be considered in my rejection of his amendment.
One is that the victim needs to have certainty. A malicious,
obstructive individual who wished to go back to the courts to seek a
variation of the order could do so, and the victim would not have
certainty during that period. The order might be overturned at any
time. This is all about protecting the victim from domestic violence,
and such uncertainty would be too much for the victim to
bear.</div>
<a name="10020998000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
suspect that such a provision would be open to malicious use, which
would put extra burdens on the court service, the police and the
support services. The amendment would cause uncertainty in relation to
an order with a maximum duration of 28 days. There might be cases in
which that order needed to be varied. I can accept that such
situations could arise. The downside of the variation if the amendment
were accepted would be too much to bear for the people we are trying to
protect.</div><a name="10020998000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000390"></a>Mr.
Hogg:</b> I am bound to say that I do not agree with the
Minister, but I recognise the doctrine of the big battalions, and on
that basis I am not going to press it to a vote. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw.</div><a name="10020998000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="10020998000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000391"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have a few general points about clause 25
and would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response. Subsection
(2) makes it clear that to satisfy the first condition&#151;that P
has been violent towards or has threatened violence towards an
associated person&#151;the standard of proof is on the balance of
probabilities. That might be regarded as the civil standard of proof.
The Minister may be aware of a line cases and one specific case, that
of R v. Manchester Crown Court ex parte McCann. That related to
antisocial behaviour orders, but also made some more general points
about the application of the civil standard of proof to quasi-criminal
orders, the question of the seriousness of the matters involved and
whether there should be a heightened civil standard.</div>
<a name="10020998000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) states that the court has to use the civil standard&#151;the
balance of probabilities. The interesting thing to note from the R v.
McCann judgment and its potential application to this type of order, is
highlighted by Lord Hope, who
said:</div><a name="10020998000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is now a substantial body of opinion that, if the case for an order
such as a banning order or a sex offender order is to be made out,
account should be taken of the seriousness of the matters to be proved
and the implications of proving them. It has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>also been recognised that if this is done the civil standard of proof
will for all practical purposes be indistinguishable from the criminal
standard.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case related to antisocial behaviour orders, but it has been
interpreted as applying more widely to quasi-criminal orders that step
between the two, in which facts must be proved, the issue is
quasi-criminal and there are sanctions for breach.</div>
<a name="10020998000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
might say that he has sought to be specific by using the term
&#147;balance of probabilities&#148;, but will that be
distinguished from the civil standard? Essentially, they are one and
the same. Will using that language clarify the issue? That route was
adopted in gang prevention orders, for example, which have also not yet
been tested on that specific point.</div>
<a name="10020998000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Hope
made the further point that such
orders</div><a name="10020998000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;do
not involve the bringing of a charge because the purpose of the
procedure is to impose a prohibition, not a penalty. But the domestic
answer to this question does not resolve the issue, because for the
purposes of the
Convention&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10020998000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is, the European convention on human
rights&#151;</div><a name="10020998000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
is necessary to look at the substance of what is involved and not the
form. Moreover the question cannot be answered according to what
Parliament is thought to have intended. In this context it is the
effect of what Parliament has done that has to be
examined.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I recognise that some attempt has been made to indicate whether the
McCann case would apply to the orders, it appears to be an issue of
substance over form. Has the Minister considered the application of the
orders, and what does he expect will be the effect on their usage,
given that the circumstances that cover a domestic violence protection
notice might equally involve criminal
issues?</div><a name="10020998000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point involves children in the context of the court&#146;s
considerations. Given the clear link to subsequent offending and
violence, should the court have any specific duty to examine the
position of children in deciding  the appropriateness of the
order? I am probing what clause 25 requires the court to take into
account.</div>
<a name="10020998000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
heard, domestic violence can have a significant impact on children. The
NSPCC has shown that 26 per cent. of 18 to 24-year-olds have lived with
violence between their parents and carers, and that 5 per
cent. say that it is frequent and ongoing. Children are affected
physically, socially, emotionally, psychologically, developmentally,
economically, educationally and sexually in complex and interwoven
ways. As we have heard in previous debates, domestic violence has a
significant impact on children.</div>
<a name="10020998000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4)(b) states that the opinion of any other associated person living in
the premises should be taken into account. Children may be unable to
express their feelings. In drafting the provision, did the Minister
take that into account and consider whether there should be a report by
children&#146;s social services or a child safeguarding board, given
the inter-relationship with such agencies, before domestic violence
protection notices are issued and DVPOs are
granted?</div><a name="10020998000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
the language of the clause wide enough? As we have heard, it is
required for orders and notices to be made separately. Subsection (6)
says:</div><a name="10020998000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
DVPO must contain provision to prohibit P from molesting the person for
whose protection it is made.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div><a name="10020998000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a specific order
relating to a specific individual, so other considerations may need to
be taken into account if children are
involved.</div><a name="10020998000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify how the time period of 14 to 28 days was arrived
at? Liberty says in its briefing note for this
Committee:</div><a name="10020998000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
seems little rationale for these figures other than the intention that
this will provide a cooling off period and allow next steps to be
considered by the suspected victim. Given the speed with which
non-molestation orders can be applied for and granted, we are again
unsure as to need for such an extended
period.&#148;</div><a name="10020998000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is Liberty&#146;s view. It has raised its concerns in relation to
these orders. I recognise the importance of what is being stated here.
Is there any science to the 28-day period? It may simply be a question
of the Minister&#146;s judgment as to the appropriate period to allow
alternative arrangements to be considered and for appropriate support
services to be put in place. Again, it might be helpful if the Minister
set that
out.</div><a name="10020998000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the clause does not restrict any further application for a domestic
violence protection order being made on the expiry of a previous order.
I can understand that, because circumstances can change. As the
Minister will understand, there may be some concerns about rolling
domestic violence protection orders being granted one after the other.
I do not believe that that is the intention, because the purpose of
these clauses is to provide a cooling-off period for a longer lasting
analysis and settlement of the arrangements. Is it buying time for
other remedies or does it become a remedy in its own right? My
understanding is that these provisions are intended to buy that window
of opportunity rather than to be a long-lasting remedy. If orders can
be granted one after another, will there be any limit on the number of
orders that can be granted? I assume that only one order can be
granted, but I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
clarification.</div><a name="10020998000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10020998000392"></a>Mr.
Hanson:</b> On the 14 to 28-day period, I am not sure on whose
behalf Liberty is raising these issues. I presume it is on
behalf of the perpetrator, as they are being kept away from their
family home for up to 28 days. Well, I am sorry, but if the
courts determine that an order is appropriate, it is because the victim
is at risk. I am on the side of the victim, not on the side of the
perpetrator. Let us put that one aside for the moment because it
reminds me why I do not subscribe to Liberty on these
issues.</div><a name="10020998000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 28-day
period provides a reasonable time for cooling off and a reasonable time
for individuals to have in place an alternative form of action to help
to prevent domestic violence, be it intervention on the perpetrator or
support to the victim. It is a judgment. It is not a long
period of time. It is less than a month in most circumstances and I do
not think, on reflection, that Liberty&#146;s representations cause
me too much worry because I am on the side of the victim in this
case.</div><a name="10020998000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hornchurch made some important points about the civil
standard of proof. DVPOs are civil orders and the civil standard of
proof is on the balance of probabilities, which is what we have put in
subsection (2). The courts have held that a heightened version of the
civil standard is appropriate where allegations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>of serious wrongdoing are made and there are serious consequences for
the person against whom the order is being sought. The McCann judgment
will ultimately be up to the court, but there is a major difference
between ASBOs and DVPOs.</div>
<a name="10020998000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to ASBOs, the courts have ruled that this heightened civil
standard is effectively indistinguishable from the criminal standard of
proof, which is beyond reasonable doubt. There are differences between
ASBOs and DVPOs in that ASBOs can be made for a significantly longer
period of time, can include a wide range of conditions and can carry
the risk of prosecution in the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 332</div>event of breach. Ultimately it will be for the court to determine
whether the balance of probability requires a heightened civil standard
of proof.</div>
<a name="10020998000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for there
being no provision for further DVPOs, I would expect that if a victim
wishes to put in a further request for protective measures such as
non-molestation orders, this will happen within the current time frame.
I hope that that helps to clarify the purpose of the clause.
I commend it to the
Committee.</div><a name="10020998000293"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1
