                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment requests that the Government produce an assessment of the
impact of the health in pregnancy grant on mental health and
educational outcomes, and of its cost to the taxpayer, before its
withdrawal under the Bill. I drafted it in response to the keen
interest in maternal physical and psychological health and well-being
shown by members of the Committee of all parties in the evidence
sessions. That anticipated the interest that was shown in this
morning’s sitting in a good evidence base for the decision on
whether to withdraw the grant. The amendment would allow time for that
evidence base properly to be prepared.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
agreement across the Committee on the importance of maternal health and
well-being to the birth of a healthy baby. Poor maternal health is
often the result of poor diet. Other adverse conditions during
pregnancy, such as poor housing, and other concerns about maternal
well-being lead to low birth weight, which, in turn, produces a range
of poor outcomes for babies in educational results, health and social
well-being down the
line.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000095">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are debating a philosophical understanding of the importance of family
income contributions to maternal well-being and, ultimately, the birth
of healthy babies. One of the important aspects of the health in
pregnancy grant is that, for obvious reasons, it is focused clearly on
mothers. It is paid to women. It has also been suggested that we see it
as a possible advance on child benefit, which is taken up substantially
by women. The analogy with advance child benefit is not quite right.
Our system does not recognise benefits for the unborn child, but it is
clear about paying benefits to meet particular needs or circumstances.
The health in pregnancy grant is very much focused on maternal
well-being and maternal health in the broadest
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the grant is paid to women. We have seen that many
other measures introduced by the coalition Government in the emergency
Budget and comprehensive spending review are already hitting women very
hard. In fact, they have been hit twice as hard as men as a result of
the spending decisions so far. In her evidence to us last week, Louise
Silverton from the Royal College of Midwives highlighted the importance
of the grant and its payment to women. She said that, particularly in
certain communities and within certain cultures, she could not
understate the importance of grants that were paid to women to give
them financial autonomy in the context of those
households.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
morning, we debated whether it was appropriate to pay a lump sum grant
or whether regular payments—weekly or monthly—might be
more important. Much of the evidence that we heard last week from
witnesses was that the lump sum was quite useful in meeting some lumpy
costs as mothers prepare for the arrival of a new baby, such as the
purchase of cots, clothing and so on. However, the point about the
grant being in a lump sum means that it frees up pressure on household
budgets and thus enables women to afford the day-to-day costs of eating
a healthy diet and meeting other health-related needs, for example,
keeping the home warm and
dry.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to recognise that although the Sure Start maternity grant
obviously helps in addition with some lumpy items of expenditure, it
will now be withdrawn from all but the first child, and that mothers
will continue to face particular financial pressures as they prepare
for the arrival of a new baby—expenses with which the grant can

said that, in essence, the debate was about the importance of adequate
incomes in the context of maternal well-being and healthy babies. An
unemployed woman in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance will
currently receive a benefit of £65.45 a week. If she is under
25, the sum is £51.85. That leaves a shortfall against the
relative poverty line, set at 60% of median income after housing costs,
of between £50 and £65—a substantial amount of
money,

research carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation into the
minimum income standard showed that the position is even worse, and
that the minimum income standard sets a minimum weekly budget for food
expenditure of £44. That is a standard set both by objective
evidence from nutritionists identifying what a healthy diet would cost
and look like, and objective external evidence from consultation with a
range of individuals—a focus group or panel—representing
society as a whole and who found £44 to be the necessary sum
needed weekly to afford a healthy
diet.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000101">&#160;</a>

objectives. It boosts family income and seeks to support women to live
healthily in the final weeks of pregnancy. It ensures that they are in
touch with health care professionals as they go through pregnancy, and,
as I will discuss later, it tries to influence and change behaviour in
the long term, something that my hon. Friends and I feel to be very

want to return for a moment to the incomes on which women on
jobseeker’s allowance and low incomes may be trying to afford a
healthy diet. There can be a substantial shortfall between
jobseeker’s allowance and the poverty line, leaving them
substantially short of money to afford the minimum food standard and
other necessities. That position will be worsened if jobseeker’s
allowance is uprated by the consumer prices index over time. That
forces mothers to rob Peter to pay Paul. If they are to afford a
healthy diet, they have to sacrifice spending on other necessities, and
the health in pregnancy grant seeks to help address
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000103">&#160;</a>

                           </div>and that applies right across the income spectrum. As she pointed out in
her evidence, that does not mean that they are unwanted pregnancies and
unwanted children, but it does mean that it is imperative to ensure
that all women of child-bearing age are protected so that they can
maintain a healthy diet, because so much conception is unplanned. Valid
arguments were made by Government members of the Committee earlier in
our proceedings about wanting to build good maternal health as early as
possible, well before the 25th week. I do not think that we
can lose a moment in doing everything we can, including using the
health in pregnancy grant, to boost the incomes of women of

was given last week that becoming pregnant can push somebody into
poverty in some cases? In this morning’s sitting, I referred to
the fact that women can lose their jobs as a result of becoming
pregnant, and they may not even realise that they can lose their job.
That is what pushes them into poverty. Therefore, the point made by the

anxiety in the latter weeks of pregnancy, making at least an indirect
contribution to women’s good mental health. We should therefore
see its contribution to health in the broadest possible sense of what
we mean by maternal health. Poor diet is one factor that the grant
seeks to address, as well as meeting other family bills. Its
contribution to a woman’s being able to prepare for childbirth
in a calm and confident frame of mind should not be
underestimated.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000109">&#160;</a>

welcome you to the Chair, Mr Howarth. There has rightly been
considerable discussion of whether the benefit is paid at the right
time, and about whether the 25th week is too late for it to be of use.
That valid concern was raised by the hon. Member for Devizes this
morning. Many of our witnesses suggested that we need both a lump-sum
payment towards the end of pregnancy and regular payments during
pregnancy. We heard this morning how difficult it can be to pitch the
payment during pregnancy at the right moment. The hon. Member for West
Worcestershire spoke eloquently about the distress that might be caused
if a benefit was paid early in pregnancy and then withdrawn because of
the woman losing the baby before full
term.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000110">&#160;</a>

suggests a period for reflection and consideration of the evidence. It
would provide an opportunity to consider whether there are design
issues in what is still a new grant—a relatively new baby, one
might say—in the range of financial support for pregnant women.
Rather than scrapping it, we should consider whether it can be improved

Michael Marmot’s report makes it clear that one of the most
important factors in reducing health inequalities is ensuring that we
secure adequate incomes for families. It states that the single most
important measure that can be taken to reduce health inequalities is to
continue to increase the national minimum wage. That clearly makes the
point that whatever other steps are taken by public health directors,
health professionals, social services and those who work with women as
they move towards motherhood, we cannot overstate the importance of
family income. That is the point that can be drawn from Sir Michael
Marmot’s report, to which the hon. Lady rightly

that it may be helpful to have an examination of whether the payment
would still do some good, albeit more limited, if it were targeted or
means-tested. None the less, I point to the evidence of Dr Katherine
Rake, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East alluded, that
women often become poor during pregnancy, as a result of pregnancy and
after childbirth. A universal payment does not try to anticipate
whether a woman might become poor, but it locks the stable door before
the horse is stolen and puts a protective and preventive mechanism in
the way.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000117">&#160;</a>

Louise Silverton was clear, however, that there is an appropriate level
of such support and that we do not need to be over-bureaucratic or

simply a short-term measure with immediate impacts on the diet and
maternal health of pregnant women, but that we should also consider its
longer-term behavioural consequences as family eating habits change. We
will need to take time to design the evaluation that could reveal and
unpick the evidence. It is fair to say that that was not properly
worked through when the grant was introduced. Clearly, however, as a

things in the report. First, we could simply lay out the evidence on
the connection between income, maternal well-being and long-term
outcomes for children. Given that the grant has only been in place
since last year, 30 June 2011 will be too early to tease that through
for the children of mothers who have received it. It would be helpful
research, however, to identify the parameters of that impact.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000124">&#160;</a>

proposed in my amendment, it would be well worth seeing a
worked-through model of the savings to the taxpayer that are made by
improving child outcomes by reducing the number of babies who are born
with low birth weight.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, I think it was the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley, who
is not in Committee, who asked us repeatedly what the evidence was that
supported the introduction of the health in pregnancy grant. There was
considerable evidence of the importance of good maternal health in
improving the birth weight of new babies and their long-term outcomes.
It has become clear, as we have heard evidence from witnesses and as we
have been in Committee over the past two weeks, that there is much more
evidence. It would be useful to understand that as a cost-benefit to
the taxpayer, a concern which the Minister rightly has. My amendment
seeks only a short delay, until next June, to gather and properly
analyse that evidence. I very much hope that it will be accepted by all
members of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000128">&#160;</a>

clear difference between the Government and the Opposition on
deficit-reduction plans. We have presented an alternative, which
extends the reduction over a longer period and does not cut as deep,
but which still halves the deficit within four years. He has made a
political choice to have a smaller state, and to put women and children
first under that political choice.

health or well-being. Abolishing it will save £40 million in
2010-11 and £150 million a year from 2011-12 onwards. The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston presents her amendment as a small
delay—only a few months—but it would cost taxpayers
£70 million, which is not money that we can afford.
As she acknowledged in her remarks, everyone on the Committee

outcomes, and there is no doubt about

                        <p>Therefore,
we know that, without having to go through expensive and time-consuming
research, the grant is not well targeted if we are trying to improve
the health of mothers. That is why other measures have been put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000138">&#160;</a>

take on board the point made by the hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston about the need for long-term behavioural changes, and the
Healthy Start vouchers, which start in the early months of pregnancy
and continue until the child is four, are a good way of giving such
support. Again, the Sure Start maternity grant gives targeted support
in the early stages of pregnancy to enable people on low incomes to
deal with lumpy one-off costs, which is very important. In a way, the
grant has been set up to fail, in that it will not pass the tests that
she has set, because of the way it has been designed. In earlier
discussions, she talked about ways in which support should be given to
pregnant mothers, but the grant does not really fit the
bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Bristol East made a point about the grant being an
early payment of child benefit. I want to pick up the hon. Member for
Stretford and Urmston for criticising that. The 2006 pre-Budget report
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“From

                        </p>
                        <p>Of
course, that is the precursor to the scheme. Without consultation, the
Government changed the design of the scheme. The 2006 pre-Budget report
continues,<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000141">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to pick up on a point that we mentioned this
morning, when the Minister discussed what consultation had taken place.
It is correct that, at the time of the PBR, the grant was presented as
advance child benefit. It was in response to representations from a
range of bodies—as I said to the Minister this morning, there
was a very lively discussion about its not being appropriate to tie a
benefit to an unborn child—that it became the health in
pregnancy grant when it was launched in
2008-09.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000143">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was trying to clarify why the hon. Member for
Bristol East made that point and phrased it in that way, because it
reflects how the initial announcement was made. I am in danger of
repeating the points that I made earlier and I do not wish to trespass
on the Committee’s patience. The report will not help. We know
how the scheme is designed and it will not achieve the objectives that
hon. Members ascribe to it. It is best that we make progress on
tackling the deficit, and I urge the hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000144">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be brief, because we have had a good debate
in Committee, particularly this morning when the issues were well
rehearsed by hon. Members of all parties. I will pick up on a couple of
points that the Minister raised in his remarks. He asked how we would
pay for the benefit and where the cuts would be made. Dr Katherine Rake
pointed out that all the cuts were being made to family budgets and
that the health in pregnancy grant was not being cut to pay for another
benefit for families. Families are being hit across the board. That is
why it is important that our deficit reduction plan is more measured,
slower and recognises that we do not need to go for full deficit
elimination as fast as the Government intend, because our families and
our children are paying the price.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am clear
that the amendment gives us time to answer properly the many incredibly
valid and important points that came up in the discussion in Committee
this morning. It is casual and irresponsible of the Government, when
presented with this reasonable amendment, not to take the opportunity
to carry out that analysis. If the Minister is confident that, when the
analysis is eventually presented, the amendment will be shown as doomed
to fail—I do not agree with that, but taking what he has said at
face value—he has nothing to fear from it. He should have
nothing to fear from carrying out the proper analysis that he
criticised us for not conducting before the grant was introduced. I
strongly urge hon. Members to support the amendment, not least because
of the strong signal that it will send about the importance that we all
attach to good maternal nutrition, good maternal health and the need
for income support for expectant mothers to ensure that we can secure
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000146">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On a point of order, Mr Howarth. I would like to
take the opportunity to thank you and your co-Chair, Mr Streeter, for
the way in which you have chaired the proceedings over the course of
not just the scrutiny sessions, but the evidence sessions. You have
ensured between you that we made good progress on the Bill. I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby and the hon. Member
for West Ham, who have developed a good working relationship
as the usual channels on the Bill. I also thank the Committee Clerks,
the <em>Hansard </em>reporters, who had to make sense of our speeches
over the past few days, the Doorkeepers and the
police.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
thank my hon. Friends for their contributions and advise them that,
given that before the election, Government Back Benchers were not
allowed to speak, they should realise how lucky they are to have that
freedom in the debates. I also thank the right hon. Member for Delyn 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 311<a class="bkMark" name="Column311">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and the hon. Member for Bristol East for leading the Opposition in their
scrutiny of the Bill. I think we had  a good debate. We have
kicked the tyres on the Bill at some length, and are none the worse for
doing so. I would also like to thank the Bill team for doing an
excellent job in putting it together and ensuring that I had good
material to use during the proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000216">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Further to that point of order, Mr
Howarth. May I also thank you and your co-Chair, Mr Streeter, and,
indeed, Mr Hollobone, for assisting with chairing the Committee? It is
particularly appropriate that we meet today in Committee Room 10, where
at the far end of the room is a picture of the unknown soldier being
buried in Westminster abbey. During the debate, it struck me on this
particular day what an important part of democracy it is to be in
opposition, and in government, and how people have fought for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
fulfilled our constitutional role, as the Prime Minister would say, in
relating the challenges of the Bill. I would like to thank the Clerks,
Mrs Davies and Dr Thatcher, and I thank <em>Hansard. Hansard </em>is
remarkable; some days, we have long discussions into the night, and the
reporters have done a very good job in putting our thoughts on paper. I
thank my colleagues in the police, the Doorkeepers and all the
officials who have helped with the Bill, including those from the
Treasury, who have had to prepare notes on the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000218">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">You will
notice, Mr Howarth, that sadly the Bill leaves the Committee in exactly
the same state as it entered, but I believe that some good arguments
have been made. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham and the
hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby for their discussions. The fact
that we have finished before our allotted time is due to negotiation,
not because we would not still feel passionately in the last hour and
three quarters about the issues in the Bill. I thank my hon. Friends
for their contributions, and other Back Benchers, who have all spoken,
with the exception of the two people whom I would not expect to
speak—the Whip and the Parliamentary Private
Secretary.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In passing, I
have noticed that during votes on the Bill, we were always ahead until
we reached the letter M when sadly, the latter half of the alphabet
came in to help the Government maintain their majority. If I learn one
thing from that, it is that hopefully in future Labour Members will
have better chances of winning.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I thank
everybody involved in the Bill, and I wish you well, Mr Howarth. We
will see the Minister a week on Monday when we revisit the arguments.
Just because we have lost the vote does not mean that we have lost the
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="10111180000221">&#160;</a>
