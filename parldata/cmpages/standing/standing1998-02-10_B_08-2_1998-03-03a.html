</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall be brief. I wish to raise a few questions with the Minister and I hope that he will answer my queries in his response.
<P>
Much of clause 21 is lifted from the 1996 Act, which refers to England and Wales. Subsection (1) reflects section 11(1) of the 1996 Act, and subsection (3)(a) is lifted from the 1996 Act. However, subsection (3)(b) has no equivalent in the England and Wales legislation. Again, one must ask why it is deemed necessary yet again to involve the Secretary of State, who, according to subsection (3)(b)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall . . . call upon the Chief Constable so to retire.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Authority has to accept what the Secretary of State directs and sack the Chief Constable. However, an equivalent power does not pertain to England and Wales. Yet again, everything from belt and braces is here and the Secretary of State looms large over everything. The question is why, for a population of 1&#183;5 million--the same size as that of East Anglia, including the three counties of Cambridge, Suffolk and Norfolk--do we have almost draconian legislation, under which nothing moves in relation to policing unless the imprimatur of the Secretary of State is on everything.
<P>
That is not good law. I cannot understand a Labour Minister's approving the Bill. The Government's consultation document is all lovey-dovey stuff, with lots of consultations and listening to the people, bringing in the grass roots and taking on board the feelings, nuances and desires of ordinary people, some of whom believe that the police force is not working in their interests. Yet everywhere we turn, the Secretary of State drives the whole thing. Why? Ministers are happy to quote the 1996 Act for England and Wales when it suits them. Yet here we have something additional yet again, over and above the England and Wales legislation. I fail to understand why it has been included. Who has written it? I doubt whether it came from the Minister. I doubt whether it came from a previous Minister. Has it come from the Northern Ireland Office? It must have done. If it did not come from the current or the previous Minister, who is writing this stuff?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The Second Reading debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not quite catch that sedentary intervention.
<P>
Subsection (3)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority--
<P>
(a) may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, call upon any senior officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Only those two considerations are mentioned--efficiency and effectiveness. The Committee on the Administration of Justice asked me, and no doubt the Minister, why it would not be grounds for sacking if a Chief Constable committed a fundamental breach of human rights or a dereliction of duty in that regard. Why should efficiency and effectiveness be the only considerations? Would there not be other grounds for sacking Chief Constables? I should have thought so, but they are not in the clause. The provision appears to be all about value for money. It is right to ask about all the other possible reasons for getting rid of a Chief Constable.
<P>
The questions that I am raising are small but important. As I pointed out earlier, the Police Authority seems to be in control, but cannot do anything without the Secretary of State's approval. Worse than that, if the Secretary of State says, ``Sack that Chief Constable,'' the authority must do so. It has no right of appeal, it just has to do it, so it is just a mouthpiece for the Secretary of State. If Ministers deem such powers necessary for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, why bother commencing the clause, ``The Police Authority shall''? Why not just use some such wording as, ``The Secretary of State, when he or she chooses, will ditch, sack or get rid of any Chief Constable on grounds of efficiency and effectiveness.'' Why are we trying to give an illusion than another body--in this case the Police Authority--has any right, power or say in the matter? People see through the illusion. The Police Authority does, and so do we. What is the point? Why is the provision so different from what is deemed acceptable, sensible and practical in England Wales?
<P>
We are considering policing for a population of 1&#183;5 million people. All the provisions--belt and braces, you name it--are provided for an area the size of East Anglia. My constituents in East Anglia would not put up with such a measure, and if I were in Northern Ireland I should not put up with it either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman did put up with it. The provision was lifted from the Police Act (Northen Ireland) 1970. It is simply consolidation. Clause 21(3)(b)--the provision about the requirement for the Police Authority to call on the Chief Constable to retire, if required to by the Secretary of State--is from the 1970 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I know that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman did not say that. He asked who had written it--whether it was this or that Minister, or someone else. If the hon. Gentleman knew that it was from the 1970 Act, why did he not say so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not have to say it. The similarity is clear from the documents. However, how much of the 1970 Act has been rewritten in the Bill? The Government just pick and choose what suits their purpose. They have fundamentally changed the 1970 Act. If it was so wonderful, why do we need the Bill? I am speechless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> That was a very strange intervention.
<P>
The 1970 legislation is reflected in clauses 21, 22 and 23. It has, largely, served Northern Ireland well for 28 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I would rather make progress.
<P>
It is difficult to sack or retire a Chief Constable in a tripartite structure. Therefore, safeguards must exist. The safeguards that the Bill contains have worked well in the past. Sometimes people may be dissatisfied with the Chief Constable's performance, but disposing of the Chief Constable should be done with the greatest precaution. We must avoid the suspicion that a Chief Constable is disciplined or removed for political reasons.
<P>
The phrase, ``efficiency and effectiveness'' appears throughout police legislation. When an inspection of a police force is carried out, it is declared to be efficient or inefficient. The phrase is used in HMI constabulary reports. The Committee on the Administration of Justice asked about a breach of human rights. A fundamental breach that occurred in, for example, the incarceration of prisoners, would be covered by the phrase ``efficiency and effectiveness''. It has served the police force well.
<P>
If a Chief Constable conducted the affairs of the police in the way that the CAJ hints at but does not spell out, such behaviour would be picked up. There is no need to alter legislation that has served us well. The language has been and remains appropriate. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire often refers to the Police Authority, but the Police Authority has not seriously challenged the clause. It seems satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> So what?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The hon. Gentleman has tried to criticise the Secretary of State's powers under the clause, but the Police Authority has not. The clause reflects legislation that has served us well. I note that no amendments have been tabled to it, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The words that the Under-Secretary used were, ``It has served Northern Ireland well.'' Clause 21(3)(b) is similar to section 7(2) of the 1970 Act. I have done my research. The Under-Secretary claims that the provision has served us well, but when has it been necessary for the Secretary of State to use the power for which the section provides? Can the Under-Secretary name one occasion on which that happened? If it has never been used, it cannot be said to have served us well. That is logical. Why has the provision served Northern Ireland so well? There must be examples of the use of section 7(2) of the 1970 Act. I am taking my time because I am hoping that the Under-Secretary will get some assistance from his advisors who are all scribbling away.
<P>
I return to another point. In England and Wales section 42 of the Police Act 1996 gives the Secretary of State a power. Section 42(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may require a police authority to exercise its power under section 11 to call upon the chief constable to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Section 11 deals with both the appointment and the removal of chief constables. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Without prejudice to any regulations under section 50 or under the Police Pensions Act 1976, the police authority, acting with the approval of the Secretary of State, may call upon the chief constable to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Police Authority, seeking the approval of the Secretary of State, can call upon the Chief Constable to retire. That is replicated in the Northern Ireland legislation in subsection (3)(a), but no power similar to that in subsection 3(b) is given to a Secretary of State. That is deemed unnecessary in England and Wales. The Minister still has not told us why it is in there. It is no good saying that it is in the 1970 Act because whole swathes of the 1970 Act have been removed and changed in the Bill. The Minister should tell us why, when and how effective the utilisation of that section has been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The clause is almost word for word the same as section 7 of the 1970 Act. As the hon. Member has just pointed out, that seems to be the justification for retaining it in the exact same form as it was in that Act. Yet, when one looks at clause 21(3)(b) in practice, one recalls a situation that I have mentioned before in the Committee, where a Chief Constable should at least have been called to account for the way in which he carried out his duties during his tenure of office. I suppose that Ministers will take some satisfaction from the fact that they were not in Government at the time. The Secretary of State, with some embarrassment, failed to have the Chief Constable called to account although I raised the matters on that occasion in parliamentary questions. The answers gave considerable concern to the Police Authority at that time.
<P>
Although we have not tabled an amendment in view of that experience, I would like the Minister to tell us where the responsibility of the Police Authority would lie if a Secretary of State was negligent and accepted an inefficent standard of behaviour from the Chief Constable. Nominally, the Police Authority appoints the Chief Constable with the approval of the Secretary of State. It is difficult to know how that will be affected by the Bill.
<P>
In days gone by the criteria were well defined and the Secretary of State was partly constrained in the instructions that he or she might give to the Police Authority. In the Bill, however, the powers of the Secretary of State already seem unrestrained. One wonders how that will impact on clause 21 vis-a-vis section 7 of the 1970 Act.
<P>
Judging the efficiency and effectiveness of the Chief Constable is important. If the Secretary of State--or a Minister in a different legislature on whom the same responsibility would fall--is inefficient, what recourse is open to the Police Authority which has the responsibility to make the Chief Constable accountable? At the very least we though that it had that responsibility.
<P>
The clause is no longer clear because it is set in a context entirely different from a similar section in the 1970 Act. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire raised a justifiable point: it is not enough for the Minister to tell us that the Act has served us well for 28 years and that the Government are going to keep it, when other provisions are cast aside as if they did not matter and had no relevance to policing in Northern Ireland today.
<P>
Regarding the Bill as a whole, it looks as if the Secretary of State has on one occasion got the Chief Constable by the right ear; on another occasion she has him by the left ear and can pull him both ways at the same time. She controls virtually everything that he does because he does not have the protection of the Police Authority, whose role is being reduced. It is bad enough to have him by both ears, but to have him by the back of the neck as well is not in the best interest of the Chief Constable, the Police Authority or the Secretary of State.
<P>
We need further assurances from the Minister. He cannot continue pretending, or trying to persuade us, that the Bill does not give the Secretary of State almost dictatorial powers. Those powers over-ride the interests of the Police Authority and of society at large. It is of grave concern that the future Chief Constables and Ministers--whether Secretaries of State or otherwise--will be able to act without accountability to the organisation that was created 28 years ago to try to satisfy some of the disquiet that existed at that time.
<P>
I want to make it clear that the present Chief Constable, who has held his appointment for a comparatively short time, enjoys the confidence of a great number of people within both traditions. During that short time, however, there have been occasions when certain groups, within one tradition or the other, have questioned whether the Chief Constable was delivering what they believed that he would deliver in their specific interests. Where is the safeguard against such criticism? The Chief Constable is at the top of the pile in the RUC. He is now being brought too close to the political authority to save him from the criticism of those who might be misguided, prejudiced or malicious.
<P>
It is in the Chief Constable's interests that he should be accountable to the Police Authority. If he were, he could not decide, for example, to be away from Northern Ireland for 123 out of 365 days in one year, without answering to someone for that irresponsibility. That has happened in the past. Perhaps it happened because section 7 of the 1970 Act--although by and large it was adequate for the situation--failed in respect of a Chief Constable who did not show deference to the people of Northern Ireland, whom he was bound to serve.
<P>
The Police Authority should have some responsibility over the dismissal of a Chief Constable, in consultation with the Secretary of State, because it is an extremely grave matter. A Chief Constable should not be dismissed merely because he, with the best of intentions and using his professional experience to the best of his ability, committed what, with hindsight, proved to be an error of judgement. I should like to believe that a situation requiring the resignation of the Chief Constable would never occur. I do not even ask that all powers be vested in the Police Authority. But it is iniquitous that the Police Authority, to which the Chief Constable is nominally and, one hopes, substantially and practically, accountable, is not able to decide, if necessary, that he is unfit for the job, due either to a disability or to perverseness in carrying out his responsibilities.
<P>
I leave the matter there, in the hope that the Minister will tell the Committee how he envisages the Police Authority exercising its responsibility of making the Chief Constable accountable without having any part in the ultimate sanction of dismissal or retirement.

<P>

<B>Mr.Worthington:</B> Again, I hope that I can give the assurances that have been sought.
<P>
I referred to this part of the law as having survived for nearly 30 years and having stood the test of time. It has not been used in that time, which is not to say that it is not a good law. The Bill has had a great deal of publicity but, amid these most contentious matters, there has been no clamour for change from the Police Federation, the Chief Constable, the Police Authority, the Secretary of State, the Opposition or the Ulster Unionists. No amendments have been proposed. [Interruption.] We will, as always, consider any amendments fully. No one has sought to change a difficult law. That is extremely important. We know how difficult it was to erect this tripartite structure and get a correct balance of power, as well as safeguarding the integrity and position of the Chief Constable, while at the same time allowing for the possibility of getting rid of a holder of that post. It was a tricky act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I will not give way at the moment; I may be able to give the hon. Gentleman more reassurances along the way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> But I should like to come in briefly on that point. I accept the Minister's claim that we have not tabled amendments to clause 21, but that was because we had to struggle with the problem of how this difficult part of the Bill could be redrafted in a way that would improve it. We tried to take other steps to curtail the dictatorial powers of the Secretary of State and make the role of the Police Authority more equitable, and thus better balanced.
<P>
Had we been successful in persuading the Minister to accept amendments, we would have had some reassurance, but there has been little generosity in allaying our anxieties, so it is important to raise the issue now. We reserve the right to raise the issue on Report if there is no progress in this respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> But I still have not seen a specific amendment. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone spoke about the Chief Constable's accountability to the Police Authority. I refer him to clause 21(3)(a), which states that the Police Authority,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, call upon any senior officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That explicitly raises the issue of the Police Authority's role in disciplinary proceedings concerning senior members of the RUC.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Including the Chief Constable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Indeed, that is what the clause states, and subsection (3)(b) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (a)''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which includes the Chief Constable--
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Oh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Well, paragraph (a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``call upon any senior officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thus there are two ways in which the Chief Constable can be dealt with: on the action of the Police Authority; and on the initiation of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of the Secretary of State being negligent in her duties. If the Secretary of State does not take the necessary disciplinary action against a Chief Constable or other senior officer, it is for the House to bring the Secretary of State to account. But there are also the powers vested in the Police Authority to initiate action, so it would not just be a matter, if I can paraphrase the hon. Gentleman, of the Secretary of State turning a blind eye in such circumstances, but of the Police Authority also turning a blind eye. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred earlier to belt and braces, and this is a good example of the hon. Gentleman's metaphor: it would be extremely difficult for a Chief Constable to evade the scrutiny of both the Secretary of State and the Policy Authority.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said that the powers of the Police Authority and the Secretary of State in the Bill were different from those in the legislation for England and Wales. My information is that they are not different. In Northern Ireland, the powers are in section 7(2) of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 whereas in the Bill they are in clause 21. In the 1996 Act for England and Wales, the Police Authority's power is in section 11 and the Secretary of State's power is in section 42.
<P>
I hope that I am responding to all the points raised by hon. Members. The unrestrained powers of the Secretary of State or the Police Authority were mentioned. The power in subsection (4) it is not and should not be unrestrained because when an officer wishes to appeal, the Secretary of State has to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appoint a person or persons to hold an inquiry and to report''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
back its findings. The Secretary of State will then
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consider any report so made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A senior figure will be responsible for such an inquiry, which represents another safeguard. I have now answered all the points that were raised.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 22 to 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regulations for RUC</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 13, line 4, leave out from `section' to end of line 5.
<P>
We are making progress are we not? That seems to have fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
It is a simple amendment. Clause 25 covers two pages. The amendment would take out the final phrase from subsection (8), which deals with paragraphs (j) (k) and (l). Subsection (2) spells out the key areas of RUC activity and organisation; paragraphs (a) to (l) are identical to those in the 1996 Act for England and Wales, save for paragraph (k) which deals with pensions and gratuities.
<P>
Subsection (8) is not mirrored in the 1996 Act, which places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to consult the Police Authority and the Police Association before making regulations. But why should that consultation be restricted by ruling out discussion relating to paragraphs (j), (k) and (l)?
<P>
Let us consider them in turn. Paragraph (j) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances of members of the Constabulary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In terms of employment, what could be more important to members of the police force? They are the most important issues with which the Police Association is involved. What is its role other than to oversee, take note and act on behalf of its members on those critical matters? Yet the provisions amount to a deletion of any discussion with the Police Association of the matters outlined in those paragraphs. That is more than puzzling, given that we now have a Labour Government and a Minister whose route has been from strong union representation. He presumably believes in discussion, consultation and the merits of a body such as the Police Association having an important say in matters relating to the appointment of police officers. Why is he putting his hand, and his mark, to a subsection which deletes all reference to such consultation?
<P>
Similarly, subsection (2)(k), which refers to pensions and gratuities, is also of considerable importance to the Police Association and the Police Authority.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One wonders whether consultation with the Police Association is a statutory right; perhaps the Minister will tell us where that right is given? If it is not given in the Bill but in earlier legislation, it would be helpful if he clarified where the Police Association can see enshrined in legislation its statutory right to be involved in consultation, discussion and perhaps even negotiation with the powers that be--the Secretary of State, the Police Authority or the Chief Constable--when dealing with important matters relating to employment, especially hours of duty, remuneration, allowances and pensions.
<P>
Subsection (2)(1) refers to the issue, use and return of equipment. The wording in the 1996 Act is a little different and refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the issue, use and return of police clothing, personal equipment and accoutrements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems nice wording, so why has the Northern Ireland Office deemed it necessary to change the wording in the Bill from that in the 1996 Act? I do not know the meaning of ``accoutrements'' and perhaps the Minister will enlighten me, but it is a pleasant-sounding, all-embracing word. Perhaps the police in the RUC do not have accoutrements; if so, we should know why. The police in England and Wales certainly have them because it is stated in the Bill that the police are required to have some influence over them.
<P>
Why does the 1996 Act refer to ``personal equipment'' when the Bill refers only to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the issue, use and return of equipment''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill makes no reference to personal equipment or police clothing. Why the change? Police clothing is presumably issued to members of the RUC, or is it deemed to come under ``equipment''. I expect the Minister to expand on that and to tell the Committee why there is a difference.
<P>
The Police Authority for Northern Ireland believes that it should still have to say in matters relating to police pay, conditions of service, pensions and gratuities. Such issues would become even more important, if there were to be radical proposals for restructuring and reform, or downsizing of the RUC. Members of the Police Authority feel strongly that they should be consulted about those matters--as they would be under English and Welsh legislation.
<P>
The amendment seeks only to delete the references to (2)(j), (k) and (l) in subsection (8). The subsection states that consultation between the Secretary of State, the Police Authority and the Police Association shall take place on all matters relating to regulations that the Secretary of State may make. I did not read them all, but they are all listed in the Bill and are similar to those in section 50 of the 1996 Act, apart from paragraph (k).
<P>
We ask only for the rights, powers and responsibilities which the Police Authority maintain were promised in earlier discussions. The bottom line was that the legislation would be the same as that for England and Wales. However, yet again, it is not the same. There are differences: sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle. One difference is that the Police Association and the Police Authority have virtually been told: ``You have no rights whatever. You have no influence. You have no jurisdiction. You have no input into any discussions that take place regarding hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances of RUC members, pensions and gratuities of members of the Constabulary, and the issue, use and return of equipment.''
<P>
I am flabbergasted that someone--not the Minister, I do not blame him; I am sure that when he read the clause he was as surprised as me--has decided that the Secretary of State cannot consult the Police Authority of the Police Association over these three regulations, dealing with critical issues, from that wonderful list of regulations that the Secretary of State can make.
<P>
Most of clause 25 has been lifted from the legislation for England and Wales. Apart from paragraph (k), the only difference is subsection (4), which might be related to earlier legislation--perhaps the 1970 Act. That subsection is unusual, if not unique. Will the Minister explain why subsection (4) is different from the 1996 Act and why someone has seen fit to take out any discussion about the regulations in subsection (2)(j), (k) and (l)?

<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Subsection (8) places a duty on the Secretary of State to consult the Police Association and the Police Authority before publishing any regulations, and includes a list of exceptions. If my interpretation is wrong, perhaps the Minister will put me right. We must be clear on what we are talking about.
<P>
A priori, will the Minister explain what is meant by the use of the word ``consult''? Does it imply much consultation, or is it that, for presentational reasons, an obligation is placed on one party to talk to another party? One party does not have to pay attention to the views of the other party. What does the Minister think about that?
<P>
Why is the Police Association being consulted? I appreciate the reasons for consulting the Police Authority, but why does subsection (8) grant the Police Association the same importance as the Police Authority? There may be endless reasons for that, but I would like the Minister to explain them. I do not want to repeat the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, but no similar provision exists in legislation for England and Wales. The relevant legislation is the Police Act 1996, as the Minister and the Under-Secretary are very fond of pointing out.
<P>
I am happy to be corrected, but section 34(2) of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970 contains a similar provision--but without the three exceptions that clause 25(8) contains. Could the Minister canter over the reasons for that in his reply?
<P>
The Minister does not give my views much credence. Why should he? But all that people like me can do--and I hope that I shall not be criticised for it--is consider the issues and present the representations that have been made to us, and try to obtain an answer from the Minister. We want to tease out of him his reaction to representations.
<P>
I have sat in Committee for most of the day, and I am disappointed by the Minister's reluctance to be forthcoming on several questions that I asked. I am lucky if he has answered five per cent. of the points that I made. The Minister will rant and rage, and become irritated with me yet again. I cannot help that. Representations have been made, and he must respond to them, even though it is tiresome for him.
<P>
I hate to mention the Committee on the Administration of Justice again, but it has made representations on clause 25, to which we have tabled the amendment that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire outlined in detail. He mentioned the submissions of the Committee on the Administration of Justice only tangentially, however. He said that he felt unable to back everything that the committee had said. I am unable to say whether or not I could, and it matters not whether my hon. Friend agrees. He and I are as one on the proposition that if bodies are concerned enough about legislative proposals to write to us, it is incumbent upon us to put their concerns on record.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have a feeling that we have made one heck of a breakthrough, because up to now I was not sure whether the Minister agreed with that. We have annoyed him a little and he is a bit fractious. He nodded his head, and is smiling, so we are getting somewhere. Perhaps at long last we might be able to have the sort of dialogue that is probably needed to clear up one or two concerns about the Bill. Let me assuage the Minister's worry. We have concerns about only some of the remaining clauses. The Minister appears sanguine about our responsibility to pick up these points and give him the opportunity to answer.
<P>
I do not necessarily agree with the CAJ, but I should like the Minister to respond to some of its comments. Our reaction will depend on his response. If, contrary to his response to our previous amendments and submissions, his response addresses each of our points, that will, to some extent, govern our response.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman please address the substance of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I shall, Miss Widdecome. Article 25 of the CAJ's submission states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Again, it is not clear to CAJ why the power to make regulations is held by the Secretary of State rather than the Police Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister may say that if the Police Authority had made that statement, it might be subject to doubt. Some people, including the Minister, might think that the authority had an axe to grind. Perhaps they are too close to events. I doubt that the CAJ is in that position. Its members are probably sufficiently removed from the issue to be more objective. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire agrees.
<P>
The CAJ, which has issued an important statement, is not clear about why the Secretary of State rather than the Police Authority holds the power to make regulations. The CAJ states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The power to make regulations is surely an important one.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is at the heart of many of our debates and certainly at the heart of a number of our amendments. It determines the relationship of the Chief Constable to the Police Authority. We keep returning to that issue, because it is pivotal to the Bill. I have already told the Minister--I say it again--that if he has not spoken to the Police Authority on the subject, he should. He should also speak to the Police Authority on the subject of the previous amendment.
<P>
The CAJ's view is that the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority is pivotal. A balance is needed between the two to give confidence to the community, and to assure those who may feel that the status quo ante did not particularly favour them that it would favour them at some point in the future. I hope that the Minister will take every opportunity to clarify those issues with the CAJ and the Police Authority.
<P>
The CAJ is also particularly surprised that the Police Authority and the Police Federation are treated on a par when it comes to consultation. If the Police Authority had made that point, we would be back to the question of whether the authority was rather too close to the matter. But the CAJ is not that close. I have already asked the Minister to say why the Police Association is treated in that equal fashion. The CAJ is now saying precisely the same. It would do much to facilitate the orderly passage of the Bill, which we want, if the Minister were to tell us in some detail why that is so.
<P>
I have every expectation that the Minister will give good reasons for the Government's proposition; I am not sure that I have come to grips with it. It probably does not matter to the Minister whether I have. However, it probably does matter that bodies that bother making representations should be satisfied with the Minister's answers.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not go for this, but the CAJ also drew attention to the fact a number of important exceptions are made even to that consultation. Again, I wonder whether the Minister will canter over that. He is probably asking himself what the CAJ means. The CAJ report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The exclusion of article 2l for example . . . might be understood to mean that the Secretary of State is explicitly excluded from consulting the Police Authority about the use of plastic bullets/CS gas or other such controversial equipment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> What is article 2l?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I could waste the Committee's time, but I wish to do no such thing. I want to get to the heart of the matter. It seems much more expeditious that the Minister should simply log the point--[Interruption.] If there is not an article 2l, perhaps the Minister should reread the CAJ's representations. He confessed this afternoon to having read them in some detail. He should be forearmed to deal with that subject and we all want to hear what the Minister has to say.
<P>
The Committee on the Administration of Justice takes the view that the Secretary of State should be replaced by the Police Authority under this and other consequential amendments. It is obvious that it feels strongly about the subject. In the calm of the evening I hope that the Minister will treat those representations in the serious way that they were made.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said--I do not want to canter over what he said in detail because we too want to make progress--the Police Authority is the focus of the amendment I want to hear the Minister tell me that he has talked to the Police Authority in detail about the subject. I want him to do what he told us we should do about a time lapse between the representations being made--
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> My hon. Friend means subsection (2)(l).
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> My hon. Friend is, as usual, extraordinarily industrious. He is master of the Bill's detail and has spotted the right provision. The Minister can now address himself in detail to clause 25(2)(l). That clears the matter up and the Minister can no longer plead ignorance, which is in nobody's interest. The point of the amendment must be answered and if the Minister replies in detail we can dispense with the matter and move on to other parts of the Bill.
<P>
The Police Authority believes that it should have a say in these matters, especially in the event of any radical proposals for restructuring, reform or downsizing of the RUC. I cannot say whether those matters are even being considered, but we must know the Government's intentions so that if problems arise in future, a legislative framework will be in place. The Police Authority does not understand what the Government have in mind here. Yet again the Government take a view different from the authority's.
<P>
It gives me no satisfaction to draw attention to what would appear to be a certain tension between the Government and the Police Authority, but that is a fact of life. Where there is such tension, I would infinitely prefer the Minister and his colleagues to go back and talk, but for reasons unbeknowst to me, that appears to be impossible. Before you become impatient with me again. Miss Widdecombe, the short answer is for the Minister to tell me why he disagrees with the authority on that matter.
<P>
That is important, because the authority makes it clear that there is considerable public interest in the use of certain police equipment, which makes it important that the authority be consulted about equipment regulations, no matter how mundane they may be in reality. I do not pretend to be an expert on the issues--I never have--but I can see an important point when it is put in front of me, and that is an important point. I hope that the Minister will take notice of it and give us a detailed answer. As I say, that will determine how the debate proceeds.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the view of the Police Authority, it would be anomalous to remove the requirement to consult the authority on these issues while at the same time it continues to exert influence over them through its seat at the police negotiation board. I appeal to the Minister. Real issues have been raised, not just by the Police Authority, but also by the CAJ. I suspect that if we were to scrape around further, we would find other bodies that are also concerned. The Minister has the opportunity to assuage the concerns of those bodies in a fairminded way. If they have preconceptions about what clause 25(8) means, he has the opportunity to cast light upon it. We might at long last reach the point where the Police Authority begins to agree with the Government; we desperately want that. If I exaggerate, my hon. Friends will tell me so, but we all want to avoid the Police Authority being alienated from what the Government are trying to do.
<P>
Lest you get restive again, Miss Widdecombe, I am just about to sit down. I said to the Minister in relation to earlier amendments that all he had to do was to talk to the Police Authority. He would then be able to return on Report and say with some authority that we had got it wrong. He has not made it clear to me why he is not prepared to do that. I regret that, and I appeal again to him, if he has any disagreement with the representations that the Police Authority has made to me, to go back to the authority and speak to the chairman, chief executive and other board members, who are clearly exceedingly concerned that the Bill should come out of the mincing machine--by which I mean the mechanisms of this place--in a form that all those concerned will like and can defend. They will not all get what they want, but after some discussion with the Government, I have an old-fashioned view that the agreement that we all want will come a little closer. I therefore sit down in immense expectation that the Minister will respond to all the points that we have raised.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr Maginnis:</B> Before I speak to the amendment, I want to make what may be a pedantic point about something that puzzles me. The Minister will no doubt give me a clue as to what is intended. Clause 25(8) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall consult both the Police Authority and the Police Association.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am puzzled by the term ``Police Association'' but perhaps I have missed some obscure reference to the body. It could be the Police Federation for Northern Ireland--the Police Superintendents Association or the Association of Chief Police Officers--
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Clause 32.
<P>
<B>Mr Maginnis:</B> Clause 32 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There shall . . . be a Police Association for Northern Ireland for the purpose of representing members of the police force in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take it that in the Bill, what I and others know as the Police Federation for Northern Ireland--the RUC Federation--is in fact the Police Association. Will the Minister tell me whether my assumpton is correct or whether the clause alludes to another body? The Minister does not appear to be clear about the matter, or perhaps he is just being unhelpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman represents the Police Federation of Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> No, I advise it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman should be aware that Police Association means the three sections: the federation, the Police Superintendents Association and the Association of Chief Police Officers. The details are set out in regulations. I do not know what sort of advice the hon. Gentleman is giving the Police Federation of Northern Ireland because clearly he is not aware of the existing regulations or of those in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In his usual jovial and benevolent manner, the Minister has confirmed what I suggested: that ``Police Association'' refers to three organisations Amazingly, he is absolutely right about one thing this evening--that I am not familiar with the composite term for the three representative organisations. It is nothing to do with any advice that I have had to give the federation. We are not dealing with matters pertaining to the name of representative bodies, either at constable, sergeant, inspector, superintendent or chief police officer rank. In so far as the Minister has clarified clause 25(8), he should take no comfort from that.
<P>
No doubt, if I am wrong, the Minister will tell me, and take some satisfaction from that, although he has had little to take satisfaction from so far, given his response to the many points that have been raised.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us whether the Police Federation will be consulted about regulations pertaining to hours of duty, pay and allowances and leave of members of the constabulary? I have always understood that the federation should be consulted and that consultation is a raison d'etre of the Police Federation and the Police Superintendents Association. I went so far as to think that the Secretary of State was statutorily obliged to consult on such matters and on pensions and gratuities.
<P>
Although the clause refers to the regular police service, the Minister will be aware that several problems have arisen with Reserve constables' pensions and gratuities. He knows that the Police Federation negotiates both on behalf of regular policemen and of members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Reserve. He will remember that, when the Reserve was set up in 1972, it was not envisaged that it would still be in existence 26 years later.
<P>
One of the difficulties was that those police who were engaged way back in those dim, distant and difficult days were still serving many years later, having had their three-year contracts renewed time and again. The Minster has talked about what we have learnt from the past; that experience, even if not directly relevant to the clause, none the less shows one of the difficulties that can arise when consultations on pensions or gratuities break down.
<P>
The Police Federation eventually had to take a case to court to establish that Reserve constables were entitled to pensions. If my memory is correct, pensions were awarded from 1988, which meant that for 16 years, Reserve constables served without receiving a pension. With better consultation, the difficulties could have been overcome sooner and more satisfactorily.
<P>
<H5>12 midnight</H5>
</P>
<P>
Other issues occasionally arise; one that is still causing difficulty is the abolition of the old housing allowance. Various arrangements--which I cannot remember in detail--existed to compensate policemen or to continue the scheme, but the important point is that the policemen and members of the RUC Reserve who were recruited shortly after the abolition of housing allowance were not informed of the new regulations. They believed that they were being recruited under the old housing allowance regulations. There was considerable negotiation on the matter but unfortunately--if my memory serves me correctly--the case in respect of full-time officers had to be taken to court, where it was successful. We hope that the same yardstick will be applied to constables. Only a few members of the constabulary are concerned, but it is an important matter which needs to be negotiated.
<P>
I hope that subsection 25(8) will not preclude the Police Federation's having an input in such matters as the constabulary's hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances, pensions and gratuities. What is the Minister's understanding of the function of the Police Federation and the Police Superintendents Association? They are not militant organisations, such as trade unions, but have worked most responsibly. Unfortunately, and at great cost to themselves, they have occasionally had to resort to legal means to achieve their rights. More often than not, they have been proved right. I hope that such problems will not be exacerbated by precluding the organisations in clause 25(8), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall consult . . . other than in relation to regulations made by virtue of subsection (2)(j), (k) and (l).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I look to the Minister for a clear indication that the integrity of what the Bill refers to as the Police Association, but what I know as the Police Federation, Police Superintendents Association and the Association of the Chief Police Officers, will be maintained and that it is not the purpose of the Bill to ensure that the Secretary of State is solely, completely and dictatorially responsible in those areas.
<P>
I said that I wanted to speak briefly. I do not know why we refer to the Police Association, using the definite article, when we are in fact alluding to three representative bodies. The Minister said that that was enshrined somewhere in legislation. If it is, so be it, but I hope that he will not promote in subsection (8) something that will lead to difficulties in terms of issues that are crucial to any body such as the Royal Ulster Constabulary. I do not understand why a Labour Government is being as restrictive in relation to pay and conditions as they seem to be--I am open to correction--in subsection (8).
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We have had a long discussion of the amendment and I shall try to cover all the points raised.
<P>
Hon. Gentlemen seem to be under a substantial misunderstanding of the way in which pay negotiations work. One of the reasons for affording the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire the opportunity to meet my officials to go through the Bill before the Committee sat was so that he would be better appraised of the detail of any matters that might concern him. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said that perhaps he should organise a seminar on how to oppose Bills. I was a Front-Bench Opposition spokesman before I entered the Government and I am only too aware of that role. It should not be performed simply by taking a document from someone, reading it out and saying that an answer is required. Hon. Members have a responsibility to provide balance and consideration in what they are trying to achieve and if there is no substance to the document or the point they are making, they should not waste the Committee's time. There are times when it is necessary to probe and I fully accept that that may be required, but it was clear that the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness had not read the documents in detail; he was simply speaking by rote. There was no balance or judgment in his consideration of the quality of the issue. That does not help.
<P>
I return to the issue of how pay negotiations are handled. The Government are already required to consult all police authorities in England and Wales and the Police Authority for Northern Ireland on the issues referred to in clause 25(2)(j), (k) and (l). The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire did not explain what he wanted his amendment to achieve. It would mean further consultation with the Police Authority following a meeting with the pay negotiating board. Representatives of the Police Authority raised that issue--and a range of others--with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State when she met them recently. She said that she would consider their suggestions--as indeed she did--and my officials have responded to them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness referred to a schism and a major difference of opinion, which he thinks exists between the Police Authority and the Government. I shall try yet again to put that myth to rest. The amendment was considered by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and an assessment of its effect was made. If the matter that was discussed with the PNB was brought back to the Police Authority and was then subject to further consultations, it would open up new negotiations within Northern Ireland and could undermine the efficacy, strength and importance of the agreements that were maintained within the PNB.
<P>
I accept that perhaps the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for Beverley and Holderness have no interest in trying to maintain national agreements. They may not recognise their importance, but I suggest that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who is a paid adviser to the Police Federation, should recognise at all times the importance of maintaining the integrity of national negotiations. Separating them out would create new avenues for differences in the different police forces within the United Kingdom. There seems to be pressure for that. I should be interested to know whether the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone is now signing up to that, if that is the view of the Police Federation in Northern Ireland. As an adviser to that body, does the hon. Gentleman think that there should be another layer of negotiations in Northern Ireland separate from those agreed with the PNB for the United Kingdom? The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone asked me questions, so I should be interested to hear his views.
<P>
There is another interesting aspect to the way in which the matter is handled by the Police Authority. The Secretary of State believes that members of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland should attend PNB negotiations in future--they do not do so at present. Currently, the Police Authority is represented by officials who have no power to sign up to agreements on behalf of the authority. Members of the Police Authority should attend so that they have a better understanding of what is being considered. It will not be relayed to them by the officials of the authority who report back; that will be real involvement by appointed members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Section 61 of the 1996 Police Act relates to the police negotiating board for the United Kingdom. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There shall continue to be a Police Negotiating Board for the United Kingdom for the consideration by persons representing the interests of--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the authorities who between them maintain the police forces in Great Britain and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It refers to persons representing the interests of the RUC. Does that preclude members of the Police Authority?
<P>
<H5>12.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> No, it does not preclude members of the authority. However, the point is that officials are sent to the board at present, not members. My advice is that the officials do not have the authority of the appointed or elected members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Does the Minister agree that, under the current legislation, they could go?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Yes, and I would like to see them go. The question is why they do not go. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire seems to have a close relationship with the Police Authority, perhaps he could take that message back. The Government would like the authority to send representatives, although I suspect that by doing so it might lose out over certain aspects. However, that is a matter for the authority; it would be wrong of the Government or the Secretary of State to tell the authority what to do.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness asked what was meant by the word ``consult'' in subsection (8). Draft copies of the regulations are sent to the bodies that are to be consulted. They have the opportunity to respond within a given time. Agreement is reached--hopefully. However, if agreement is not reached, the Government must make decisions; we cannot leave matters in a vacuum. The word ``consult'' has a specific meaning, but decisions have to be taken.
<P>
Opposition Members might want to let matters stay in a vacuum, so that no one has a clear view and there is no accountability. They seem to want to remove references to the Secretary of State from the Bill, so that the Secretary of State has no part to play in any matters relating to the conduct of policing in Northern Ireland. That was the tenor of some of the remarks made by Opposition Members.
<P>
The powers of the Secretary of State have been described as overbearing by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness. I cannot remember all the words that he used, but they were pejorative. The implication was that the Secretary of State should have no function in these matters. The tripartite structure, however, means that the Secretary of State has an important and constitutional role--inasmuch as that has meaning within our legislative framework--in terms of accountability to Parliament.
<P>
The hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness also asked why the Police Association and the Police Authority were both referred to in clause 25(8). The reason is that both bodies have a clear, legitimate interest in the issues discussed in that subsection. The Police Association has an important role to play in such matters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness referred to the representations--if that is the right word--made to him by the CAJ. I understand that he has received a letter from the committee, but he has probably not spoken to the CAJ to ask what it meant by various points--so he might be stretching the meaning of the word ``representation''. However, based on this information, he asked why the Police Authority could not make regulations. There is a simple reason. Regulations must be examined according to the way in which they are tabled. The Police Authority cannot table regulations in the House of Commons. It cannot debate regulations that are tabled in the House, hence the Secretary of State is responsible for tabling regulations and is accountable for their application.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said that he was as surprised as the CAJ that the Police Authority and the Police Association were treated on the same level. People must not be treated as being of different ranks in a consultation process. All bodies must be consulted on the same basis. One organisation should not be treated as being greater rank than the other. If bodies have a right in statute, as the Police Authority and Police Association do, they must automatically be treated equally throughout the process. The CAJ is wrong to want the organisations to be treated differently.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness referred also to equipment and to what could be regarded as controversial items. When we spoke about novel and contentious purchases, we discussed that at length and more discussion will take place in a few days' time at the meeting to be held between my officials and the CAJ.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness talked about the division between the Police Authority and the Government. I do not know whether he is trying to manufacture such a division, nor where he is getting his information from, but there is no evidence to show that there is a major barrier between the Police Authority and the Government. The opposite is the case. I have explained repeatedly the process by which we are dealing with the Bill. An implementation strategy has been established. On behalf of the Secretary of State, I chair a tripartite meeting of representatives of the Chief Constable and senior members of the Police Authority. There is a co-ordination committee of senior officials, and further down the line are working groups, members of which will consider the details of the Bill.
<P>
The reason the working groups have not yet met is not that the RUC representative is unwilling to involve himself with them or that the Secretary of State is unwilling to do so through me or his officials; it is that the Police Authority is not yet fully engaged. We wrote to the Police Authority on 4 November and suggested setting up working groups to consider particular aspects of the Bill, but that has not yet happened. Every attempt has been made by the Government to get the consultation process under way. If meetings do not take place because one part of the tripartite structure does not wish to meet round the table, that cannot be blamed on those who want to be involved in consultation; nor it is because, as the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness said, the Government are at loggerheads with the Police Authority.
<P>
The Police Authority have different views about various aspects of the Bill, but that does not mean that there are major divisions between us. In one sense, it is healthy that it is examining the Bill in detail, but we can wait for ever more for agreement to be reached. We must proceed with the Bill.
<P>
I have spoken twice to the chairman of the Police Authority within the past few days and we are trying to reconcile many of the differences that are more apparent than real. The way in which arguments have been advanced is creating an unnecessary division and not helping policing in Northern Ireland. I have tried to deal with all the points that have been raised in Committee and I hope that I have set out some of the general principles alluded to by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness. On that basis I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for making a reasonable stab at answering many of the questions. It is still not clear, however, where the responsibilities of the police negotiating committee finish and those of the regulations, and consultation on them, begin. Perhaps we can return to this a little later.
<P>
Section 34 is the relevant section in the Northern Ireland legislation, but that takes us back to section 62 of the 1996 Act and refers to amendments to it that incorporate some of the regulations under section 25.
<P>
To a non-lawyer the wording of clause 34 does not make clear what is happening. The Police Authority thought that it was being given powers under clause 34, which relates to the role of the police negotiating board for the United Kingdom, although the matters that it discussed at that level--it matters not whether members or representatives attend; it is hoped that there is proper reporting back to the authority--did not reveal where its responsibilities end and those involving consultations on regulations relating particularly to clause 25(2)(j), (k) and (l) begin.
<P>
There is another difference. Most of clause 25 is copied from section 50 of the 1996 Act. But the Act contains a provision for curtailment of the power of the Secretary of State that is not replicated in the Northern Ireland legislation. Section 50 relates to the Secretary of State's power to make regulations covering a host of issues relating to the administration and conditions of service of police forces. Section 50(8) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any statutory instrument containing regulations under this section shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So any proposal that the Secretary of State wishes to make, or any orders that are tabled, come before the House as statutory instruments, and there is at least an opportunity to scrutinise them.
<P>
There is no equivalent to this in clause 25. Can the Minister say why is there no opportunity for the Police Authority, Parliament and others interested in these matters to question some of the regulations, which, in the England and Wales legislation, are made by order? The stock answer may be that the position in Northern Ireland is different, and so on. But even though Orders in Council cannot be amended, at least they can be prayed against by negative resolution, and voted on by affirmative resolution. They can at least be debated. I cannot see in the Northern Ireland legislation anything that would give powers of scrutiny to Members or those who wish to use Members to raise in the House legitimate questions about possible regulations.
<P>
I shall comment on the equipment, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness spoke. The Minister attempted to respond to questions, and he referred to our earlier discussions about equipment. However, it is not sufficient to argue that earlier clauses cover the points that we made.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Police Authority has changed its mind since it wrote to us, but it previously supported consultation about the purchase of contentious equipment. subsection (2)(1) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the issue, use and return of equipment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are considering contentious equipment, about which the CAJ was specific in its submission. It mentioned, for example, plastic bullets.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps referring to plastic bullets when he means plastic baton rounds. There is a significant difference between those terms. I hope that he will use the proper terms for the equipment. Terms have a particular resonance, especially given that some people criticise the RUC for using PBRs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am happy to be corrected, but the Minister does not make a major point. We all know that we are considering contentious equipment, which is the cause of dispute between the traditions and communities in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister challenged my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness, who had just received a submission from the CAJ. I had a long conversation with Maggie Beirne the other day. We do not simply parrot submissions; we attempt to question people who make representations. The Minister made a cheap jibe, which was uncalled for. He should find out what sort of communication is taking place before he criticises Committee Members. I would be happy and relieved to receive confirmation of the Minister's contention that the relationship between his Department and the Police Authority was fine and dandy. He did not use those words, but he implied that there were no serious divisions between them.
<P>
I spoke to the chairman of the Police Authority recently and received a letter with enclosures yesterday. It did not give me the impression that the Minister, his Department and the Police Authority were singing from the same hymn sheet. However, if a meeting of minds has occurred, that is all to the good. Nothing could be worse than a division of opinion between the Police Authority and the Government on the Bill. We shall know by Thursday, or next week at the latest, how the relationship has developed.
<P>
I am delighted to learn that the Minister and his officials are listening carefully, and that they are prepared to make some concessions. Two, small amendments that the Police Authority asked us to table have been accepted. However, the fundamental amendments have been rejected. If the Police Authority is happy with a few crumbs from the Minister's table, so be it. The opposition that it conveyed to us earlier may collapse like a pack of cards on the basis of those crumbs. So be it. It does not mean that what they said and the quality of the amendments that the Police Authority asked us to table are any less important. If we consider them still to be important in the context of proper, workable legislation, we shall continue to press those ideas. It is up to the Police Authority what it does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I hoped that I would not have to speak again on the amendment, but I was disappointed that the Minister, apparently deliberately, did not respond to the matters that I raised. However, I am grateful to the Government Whip for drawing it to my attention that when speaking I should state, for the record, that I am an adviser to the Police Federation of Northern Ireland. I understood that my entry in the Register of Members' Interests was adequate. The hon. Gentleman helpfully informed me that it is adequate only if I am voting, but that I should reiterate my interest when speaking.
<P>
The Minister of State tried to denigrate the relationship by suggesting, first, that I was a representative of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland; in other words, that it was my job to speak on its behalf. It most certainly is not. I made it very clear from the outset that I cannot be a representative of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland. However, I am an adviser. I am not remunerated in my advisory role, but I receive a small amount of money that is used to pay a researcher. I make no financial gain from my relationship with the federation. It was neither necessary nor expedient for the Minister to suggest otherwise. I know that he is under pressure and that he is easily irked, but it is for him to decide whether he wants to create a deteriorating relationship or to be constructive. He is much better, from our point of view, when he tries to be constructive.
<P>
The Minister trailed the police negotiating board like a red herring across the debate a few moments ago and I wonder why, because I did not allude to pay negotiations--nor, I believe, did others, although I may have missed what was said. I alluded to regulations which pertain to such things as pay and allowances. I specifically mentioned areas in which difficulties had arisen, which certainly did not fall within the ambit of the PNB. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister would deal with the relationship, which it appears is now precluded under clause 25(8), between the Secretary of State and the Police Federation of Northern Ireland in respect of pensions and gratuities and the anomalies that have occurred.
<P>
In all seriousness, I hope that the Minister will try to respond to my arguments.
<P>
<H5>12.39 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>1.10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I must agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire that the Minister is now being more forthcoming. He certainly answered my question about the meaning of consultation. He also answered the question asked by the Committee on the Administration of Justice about the Secretary of State's powers to make regulations. It is right to put that on the record because CAJ representatives will certainly read our proceedings and note the Minister's reply. The CAJ posed another question about the apparently equally weighted consultation of the Police Authority and the Police Association. I pay tribute to the Minister for answering that question. We are now making progress.
<P>
Having said that, I am not satisfied with his answer to one or two of my questions, particularly on the relationship between the Government and the Police Authority. He spoke of a schism and attributed it to me, but the record will show that I used no such word. The Minister went on to attribute to me the phrase ``major loggerheads and divisions between the Government and the Police Authority''. Again the record will show that I said no such thing.
<P>
I spoke about the silence of the Minister in responding to a reasonable point of mine. I said that the Police Authority had put forward amendments, which we, in turn, tabled in Committee. I said that it was important for the Police Authority to understand the Government's thinking in order to avoid any misunderstandings and that the Government should go back to the PA as we would. At that stage the Minister did not say that he had any contact with the Police Authority. We must therefore get the record straight. Opposition Members did not use the words attributed to us. We are left with the feeling that relationships could be better.
<P>
It was a revelation--to such an extent that I wrote it down--to hear the Minister say that he had spoken to the Police Authority chairman twice in the past few days in an attempt to resolve any differences between the Government and the authority. That is the right course of action to take, but it is extraordinary that the Minister did not make it clear when we debated my previous set of amendments. I repeat that nothing could be better than the Minister being in close contact with the Police Authority chairman, ready to clear up any misunderstandings. The Minister should have told us that long ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It would have made no difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> It would have made a considerable difference. It was all that I wanted to hear. We can all come back on Report and compare notes in the Chamber about what we have respectively found out--who is right and who is wrong. It is important to set the record straight in that regard.
<P>
The Minister did not fully answer three of the questions that I posed; he may have tangentially, but not completely. I refer particularly to the police negotiating board. The Minister said that under his proposals, members and not officials would attend.
<P>
<H5>1.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I did not say that that was my aim, but the issue has to be addressed. An official represents the Police Authority. Members do not--it would be better if they did. I said that it would be wrong for me to impose such a decision on the Police Authority; it is a matter for the authority. The hon. Gentleman is implying that I am trying to impose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> No, I did not imply that. I wrote down what the Minister said; if I did so wrongly, I apologise. I understood him to say that members should attend the police negotiating board, a proposition with which I agree. However, we will leave the matter to the Police Authority. I am sorry that I raised the point. I thought that I was giving the Minister a plaudit.
<P>
The Minister did not give an answer--if he did, perhaps he would repeat it so that I can write it down again--to the point that I raised on behlaf of the Police Authority. The authority said that it would be anomalous to remove the requirement to consult it on issues relating to equipment and so on, while it continued to exert influence on those issues through having a seat on the police negotiating board. Would the Minister address the conundrum in which the Police Authority finds itself?
<P>
There were two other points that the Minister did not address; again, if he did, I am happy to be corrected. First, he made great play about my reference to the exclusion of article 21--I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire for pointing out that it is in fact article 21--but he did not answer the point. Secondly, the Police Authority said that it should have a say over police pay, conditions of service, pensions, gratuities and so on, especially in the event of radical proposals for restructuring or downsizing the RUC. Again, the Minister did not address that point. He may not want to answer points directly--so be it, we shall have to bring them up again.
<P>
The Minister made play of the issue of submissions. He said loftily that when he was an Opposition spokesman, he exercised enormous judgement over what he said and did. We do exactly the same. If the Minister thinks back to the Committee stage of the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill, which we processed rapidly through the House, he will remember that we received many submissions on the issue. We do not choose to air them in detail, because we use what the Minister said that the Opposition should use--a wee bit of judgment.
<P>
The Minister will need our co-operation again in such circumstances, and it will of course be freely given. We will in such circumstances be bombarded with a lot of information that we shall probably not use, for the reasons that he gave.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
