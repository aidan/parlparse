Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 77, in page 152, line 15, leave out `five' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`four'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

No. 79, in page 152, line 15, leave out `five' and insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> Before we adjourned, the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) asked me about the terms of appointment of the incumbent regulators.
<P>
Callum McCarthy, the gas and electricity regulator, was appointed as the Director General of Gas Supply on 1 November 1998 and as the Director General of Electricity Regulation on 1 January 1999. His job was advertised on the basis that the successful applicant would be appointed as chairman of the new authority when the relevant legislation was enacted, and that expectation was confirmed at the time of his appointment. His term of appointment runs until 31 October 2003—five years after the first of his two appointments.
<P>
The appointment of David Edmonds, the telecommunications regulator, will end on 31 March 2001. His terms of appointment allow for him to be reappointed. Assuming that the new Telecommunications Authority is established, we should expect him to continue in post as the first chairman. I cannot say what subsequent events may involve. We have already discussed the option of a wider-ranging White Paper on what the hon. Member for South Dorset would prefer to call communications, which is likely to be published in the autumn.
<P>
The term of office of Ian Byatt, the water regulator, will expire later this year. No decisions have been taken about his replacement.
<P>
It may be helpful to Committee members if I briefly summarise the situation. We understand why the amendments were tabled, but I hope that they will be withdrawn. We do not expect magic to be worked in five years, but that period should be sufficient for the regulators to become acquainted with the necessary detail that is associated with their post. There is no clamour to change the term of office of the regulators. To go for a significantly shorter period, as the amendments propose, such as a two-year period, would ensure that the regulators were not fully acquainted with all of the manifestations of their appointment when their term of office ended. Moreover, looking for reappointment after a two-year period might make a regulator overly anxious to err on the Government's side rather than to be as truly independent as we should wish.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) does not withdraw the amendment, I will ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): The Minister made a persuasive speech. When she said that a shorter period might make a regulator more vulnerable to Government influence, she was extremely persuasive. On that basis, I shall not press the amendments to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. You will know that the strange rules of the House mean that next Tuesday is a Thursday, at least in terms of the Chamber's hours of sitting. That will have a knock-on effect on the Committee, so we must move the appropriate order.
<P>
Ordered,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That on Tuesday 22 February, the Committee do meet at Ten o'clock and half-past Two o'clock.—[Mr. Pope.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. Is the approach of the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) in order? I believe that a similar order appears on the Order Paper today, but it has not yet been voted on, and it is premature to say that the matter has already been decided.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is entirely in order for the Committee to make its own decisions about the timing of its sittings next Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 10, in page 152, line 22, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 31, in page 152, line 35, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The approval of the Treasury shall be required for the making of a determination under this paragraph.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall be brief, because Government amendment No. 10 is minor and technical.
<P>
Schedule 1 is concerned with the members, staff, committees and functions of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and, by virtue of clause 84(3), the Telecommunications Authority. Paragraph 4 deals with the pay, travelling and other allowances of authority members. Under paragraph 4(1), the Secretary of State has discretion to determine the remuneration, travelling and other allowances paid to the chairman and other members of the authority. However, the authority makes those payments, not the Secretary of State. The amendment ensures that the authority is required to make such payments. It also brings sub-paragraph (1) in line with sub-paragraphs (2) and (3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I congratulate the Minister on Government amendment No. 10. It is the first of many such amendments, and I am pleased to see that they are being tabled already.
<P>
We agree that the amendment is purely a drafting amendment. It would be odd if the Bill used the word ``may'', because it is not thus used in the rest of the schedule, nor was it in previous Acts. The Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament the remuneration''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister confirmed that the amendment is a result of merely a drafting error rather than any change of policy.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 would require the Treasury specifically to approve any payment to members of the authority before it can be allowed. The Treasury is a much maligned Department, although I am sure that the Minister enjoyed her stint there. It is seen as the Scrooge of government, denying Departments what they perceive as their well-deserved funding. Under Conservative Governments, its key function was the protection of taxpayers—the vast, silent majority of people who struggle to make ends meet, are economical and thrifty with their money and would like the Government to be so with taxpayers' money. Clearly, that is not the Treasury's function under this Government, who have imposed huge numbers of stealth taxes on mortgage payers, married couples, pensions, non-tax-paying shareholders and home owners, through higher stamp duty—a total of £40.7 billion of extra stealth taxes, which equates to £1,500 per taxpayer.
<P>
Conservative Members are worried that, under the Bill, the regulatory authorities will expand, resulting in payments of large sums of money. It is important that the Treasury's approval should be required before such payments are made to members of the authority. Page 43 of the Green Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Regulatory procedures should be timely and not over-burdensome, consistent with delivering open and effective regulation. They should be provided at an acceptable cost for all those involved in and affected by regulatory decisions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues, on page 45:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The regulatory offices are directly financed by money voted by Parliament. They are subject to cash limits and running cost controls. Expenditure is recovered from licence fees paid by licensees.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Expenditure is covered by a vote in Parliament, but to add an extra safeguard on the level of expenditure, the Treasury should specifically approve any payments by the authorities to their members and staff. Those words of the Government's should be in the Bill.
<P>
However, there are some worrying signs in the Green Paper of profligacy and expansion of expenditure. Page 45 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Some commentators have questioned whether the resources of the regulators are adequate to engage effectively with well-resourced and advised utility companies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There are also concerns that the regulators do not have the operational flexibility to be able to pay the salaries required to attract sufficient specialised expertise from outside the ranks of the civil service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, the Trade and Industry Committee expressed concern about keeping staff adequately compensated. The Green Paper continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Adequate resourcing is important to ensure that regulators can benefit from the specialised external advice . . . needed to regulate their sectors effectively''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such signs indicate that costs will escalate. Proposal 7.2 of the response to the consultation document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that the level of resources available to the regulators, along with the flexibility that they have over how to deploy those resources is sufficient to enable them to regulate their sectors effectively''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another indication that resources will be used extensively, and another reason why an extra layer of caution is necessary.
<P>
The industry is concerned about the potential escalation of costs. PowerGen commented that the Bill has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the potential to increase significantly the costs and risks of businesses operating in or considering entry to these markets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why Ian Byatt, the water regulator, said that the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is likely to raise the costs but not the effectiveness of regulations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not just the extra costs of salaries and expenses that need to be kept under control, important though that is. All the extra staff who can be appointed under the schedule will find work to do, which will inevitably mean more management time and expense for utility companies, in order to fulfil the requirements dreamt up by the regulator's staff.
<P>
I am worried about the escalating costs of the regulatory authority. As the regulatory impact assessment states, those costs will be passed on to the consumer. The Treasury has played a useful role in previous Governments in protecting the taxpayer, and it should now protect electricity, gas, telephone and water bill payers from escalating costs, which seem likely.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman ranged widely on the costs of the regulator. If we make progress this afternoon, we shall have a full debate on that issue under subsequent clauses. I shall restrict myself to the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The Government cannot accept amendment No. 31. We consulted the Treasury about its involvement in such matters. It used to be standard policy to write requirements for Treasury approval into legislation. However, the previous Administration altered that process, and we are merely continuing those changes. The Treasury has made it clear that it is content to be consulted by the Secretary of State administratively. It is perfectly satisfied that sound administration will result in it being consulted on any determination of payments under paragraph 4. The comprehensive spending review, which occurs every three years, requires every Department and every part of Government to meet the Treasury's constraints on keeping public finances under sound control. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's achievements in that respect have been notable.
<P>
I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, unless we are to witness another U-turn from the Conservative Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989 are clear. Paragraph 2 of schedule 1 of the 1989 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Director may, with the approval of the Treasury as to numbers and terms and conditions of service, appoint such staff as he may determine.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The 1986 Act contains the same wording. That legislation was passed under the previous Government. It related to a regulatory system that was not intended to be as intrusive, and to regulatory authorities that did not have as many powers, as under this Bill. The Minister may be right about the change of policy under the previous Conservative Government. The regulatory systems that they established were not intended to be expansionary and interventionist; in fact, those systems were contracting as competition entered the various sectors. That is not the policy of this Government. Treasury approval is probably more important today than when the 1989 and 1986 Acts were passed.
<P>
In view of the Minister's comments on pursuing the debate as we proceed to other amendments, I shall not press the matter to a vote now, but I should be very interested to hear her comments on what I have just said and, in due course, on other amendments that deal with our concerns about potentially escalating costs.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32 in page 152, line 37, after `Civil Service', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the Treasury'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is similar to amendment No. 31 and would ensure that the authority keeps in check the number of staff whom it appoints. Amendment No. 31 related to the authority's members and their pay and conditions, rather than its staff. This amendment would ensure that appointments are approved not only by the Minister for the Civil Service but the Treasury.
<P>
I shall not try Committee members' patience by repeating my arguments for amendment No. 31, except to emphasise a key point that we will continue to emphasise during the passage of the Bill. The costs that the Government want to impose on the utilities sector will not be borne by the fat cats to whom they continually refer, or by the dreadful shareholders that they heartily condemn, but consumers. The regulatory impact assessment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``To the extent that additional costs are incurred, these will be passed on to licensees, and ultimately borne by consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The sums may seem relatively small to the Minister, but each regulation carries with it a set of costs, which accumulate. They are piled on to the consumer, together with the taxes that this Government are imposing. It is not right for Committee members to impose higher costs on the vast majority of people in this country who struggle to make ends meet.
<P>
In addition to the regulatory cost, the regulations themselves will impose huge burdens on the utilities sector. Again, those burdens and costs will ultimately be borne by the consumer.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I rise to resist the amendment, and I shall not tax your patience, Mrs. Roe, by reiterating arguments that I have already advanced. However, I should make it clear that the Treasury is satisfied that its being consulted on the pay scales and associated terms and conditions of the authority's staff will result in sound administration.
<P>
The cost to consumers of the consumer council will be 20p a year—less than the price of a stamp. The overall impact of all measures should lead to a 10 per cent. reduction in wholesale energy bills. Indeed, the proposals will result in much greater value for money and more economical operation of the regulator. Therefore, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment; if he will not, I shall ask Committee members to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My pensioner constituents in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will be spending a third of the rise in their pensions on what the Government admit is the cost of this regulation. I suspect that the extra costs to the consumer will be significantly higher than the figures set out in the regulatory impact assessment. The Minister claims that the new electricity trading arrangements will result in lower electricity prices, but those outside this House, including a number of academics, take a different view. The received wisdom in the utilities sector is that the combined effect of unlimited fines and other elements in the Bill will add to the regulatory risk, which in turn will increase the capital costs to the utilities sectors. Those sectors are very capital-intensive, so will have a large amount of debt, the interest on which will cost significantly more as a result of the Bill. Even the publication of the Bill will lead to higher capital costs for the sectors, which will have to be borne by someone. The reality is that they will be borne by the consumer, either through higher charges or, more likely, through charges that are not as low as they would have been.
<P>
This debate will continue throughout the Committee stage. As I am keen to make progress on this important Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 153, line 1, leave out `(including quorum)', and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but such procedures must include a minimum quorum of either 50 per cent. of its membership or 3, whichever is the greater.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is self-explanatory and helps to improve the Bill. Paragraph 7 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority may regulate its own procedure (including quorum).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is dangerous: the quorum at least should be laid down in statute.
<P>
It is hoped that at least two people will be appointed, with no maximum. However, the Government say in their document that it is likely to be three, although they have now disowned that document. We hope that experts in their industries will staff the authority and that experts in human affairs will staff the committees. It is a pity that the Government could not accept our amendment on Tuesday that would have required people with such expertise to be appointed to the authority. None the less, we live in hope that the Government will do the right thing and appoint people to the authority who are suitably qualified.
<P>
Given that the member will have acquired expertise in the relevant areas, it is unlikely that they will be expert in procedural matters—an honour that tends to reside in the House—so it makes sense for the quorum to be set in the Bill. The amendment provides for a quorum of 50 per cent. with a de minimis of three. Clearly that would be two, if only two members were appointed. That helps to avoid the danger of a small unrepresentative group on the authority making decisions, perhaps poor decisions, simply because a number of members were absent for some reason. That is the approach taken by most authorities and bodies, this Committee and the House of Commons, and I think that it is the right approach.
<P>
If the Government are serious about getting away from the personality of the regulator, a minimum quorum would help to ensure that the authority remains an authority and does not become the province of a dominant individual who holds committee meetings without giving sufficient notice and tries to get things through before the other members turn up.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall work on the assumption that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment in a positive frame of mind with a view to improving the Bill, but it does not meet his intention. I am amused that he believes that the new regulatory authority should adopt the procedures of the House. Those of us who are occasionally foxed by the procedures of the House sometimes find them a little bewildering in this electronic age. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman even managed to confuse whether I was a right hon. Lady or a right hon. Gentleman this morning, I have little hope that the amendment would help the regulatory authority.
<P>
The important issue here is flexibility. The procedures of the new authority must be tailored to its needs. There may be occasions when matters of some urgency have to be decided by the authority when some of the members are unavailable, perhaps because they are abroad.
<P>
If, for example, a major network operator were on the edge of insolvency, it would be wrong to tie the authority's hands. The procedure should be set by those who understand the demands that will be placed on the authority. Matters such as a quorum do not belong in an Act where they cannot be changed. We must place this provision in the context of the overall package of measures designed to improve the transparency and accountability of regulation.
<P>
As we discussed this morning, the members of the authority should be men and women of experience and standing. I would not expect them to agree to any procedures, including a quorum, that would enable them to be sidelined. I understand the objective behind the amendment, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept that, in practice, it would be unnecessary, and possibly undesirable, to incorporate into the Bill a measure restricting the flexibility of the regulatory authority.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to press the amendment to a vote, I regret that I will have to ask the Committee to oppose it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yet again, we hear the word ``flexibility'', the all-embracing term that seems to give authorities an excuse to expand and pay their staff infinite sums of money. The Government are not attempting to impose any controls, structure or limits on what the authorities will be able to do. They do not understand how important it is to ensure that the public bodies that they set up are not given free rein to expand and to incur further costs that must be born, by the consumer in this case—or, more usually, by the taxpayer.
<P>
However, in view of the debate that we have had on the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 153, line 5, at beginning insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) The application of the seal of the Authority to a statutory instrument shall be authenticated by the signature of the chairman or by some other person who has been authorised by the Authority to act for that purpose.
<P>
(2)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a minor, technical amendment to clear up something that could lead to a misunderstanding. There is a prohibition elsewhere in the Bill, in paragraph 9(2) of schedule 1, on the power of the authority to delegate the making of statutory instruments. Without the amendment, the prohibition might be taken to mean that the authority has no power to delegate the task of authenticating its seal. That is not the Government's intention, and the amendment clarifies that the seal of the authority should be authenticated by the signature of the chairman or by some other authorised person for the purposes of its application to a statutory instrument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I feel uncomfortable about giving the power to make statutory instruments to members of the authority who are not elected or accountable to an electorate. I know that the right hon. Lady will cite a number of precedents, but I still do not believe that it is right, and I hope that other hon. Members will agree. It is not necessarily an issue for debate now, as it will form part of our debate on clause 42, which gives the authority the power, with the consent of the Secretary of State and after consultation, to make regulations—that is, statutory instruments.
<P>
The problem with such legislative power is that there is no provision for affirmative or negative resolution in the House of Commons or in the other place. That is worse than a Secretary of State having the power to make statutory instruments, because at least he is accountable to the House of Commons. The regulator will not be directly accountable to the House. There will be no power to pray against the regulations. If the Minister is right that such powers exist in the 1986 and 1989 Acts, as well as in the Telecommunications Act 1984, will she tell us where in those Acts those powers reside? In my brief perusal of them, I was unable to find them, but I will defer to her if she will provide that information.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The amendment relates to the authentication of the seal. As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, we shall have a substantive opportunity to debate the issues when we discuss clause 42. Opposing a technical amendment such as this would allow a misunderstanding to persist in the Bill. I do not believe that that would be in the interest of the regulators, the courts or the general public.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The schedule sets out the detailed provisions for the appointment and terms and conditions of members of the new regulatory authorities for energy and telecoms. It also contains provisions relating to staff and procedural matters.
<P>
The schedule provides that each authority must consist of a chairman and at least two other members. The members of each authority are to be appointed by the Secretary of State on such terms and conditions, including remuneration, as he may determine.
<P>
During our discussions, we have repeatedly referred to flexibility and one of the reasons why it is necessary to amend the structure of gas, electricity and telecoms regulation is that in all those areas the pace of market change has been significant, not only through technology but with the liberalisation of markets and the opportunity to expand them for the benefit of consumers. In enshrining such flexibility in the legislation, we also want to ensure that the authority can change its shape in relation to the size of its membership so that as different sorts of expertise become necessary they can be found without having to revisit the detail of the legislation.
<P>
We already have interim arrangements and Mr. Callum McCarthy is in place as the Director General of Gas and Electricity Markets. He has put in place a non-statutory board structure to assist him with his regulatory functions. Apart from himself, the board consists of three executives who are employees of Ofgem and five non-executive directors who are known to be people of standing in the community: Lord Borrie, Lord Currie, Dr. Gill Owen, John Roques and Sir Nigel Rudd. The interim non-statutory board was appointed to advise Callum McCarthy. We want to ensure that the appointment of members of the new authority rests with the Secretary of State.
<P>
Different regulators may choose to configure the board differently and that is only understandable, not only in terms of how the work is to be conducted but in relation to changes in the industry. I referred to the way in which Callum McCarthy configured his non-statutory board. David Edmonds on the telecoms side chose an authority with four executive members, including himself, and a small number of non-executive members.
<P>
The shape of the authority must be whatever is right to do the job. Members of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and the Telecommunications Authority will be appointed to ensure that, collectively, the membership of the authority possesses a range of skills, experience and perspectives. It is highly likely that one member will have knowledge of consumer matters and others may have experience of technical matters. Decisions on particular appointments will not be made until the Bill has received Royal Assent, following the normal transparent procedures for searching for candidates of appropriate calibre. Existing members of Ofgem staff can be appointed members of GEMA and, likewise, members of Oftel staff can be appointed to the Telecommunications Authority. We want to ensure that high-calibre candidates are attracted and it would be foolish to ignore the enormous pool of expertise and skill among the current staff of the regulators' offices.
<P>
We have had a long debate on the terms of the authority's office and we have settled on a period of five years. Members may be removed from office on the grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour and they may be reappointed should the Secretary of State so choose. There is also a discretionary power to pay compensation for loss of office in the event of special circumstances. The authorities, like the individual regulators whom they will replace, will have to appoint staff and determine their terms and conditions. In order to do that, they must obtain the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service in the normal way.
<P>
Authorities are entitled to establish the necessary committees and sub-committees to regulate their procedures. Apart from the power to make statutory instruments, the authorities are permitted to delegate their functions to individual members, to committees of the authority and to employees.
<P>
In taking that first step, we may enshrine in statute a common-sense approach towards the establishment of regulatory authorities that are depersonalised and professional. Those authorities should put the rights of the consumer at the head of their list of priorities and take expertise and experience into account in a businesslike manner. That will secure certainty and transparency of regulation at an appropriately low cost.
<P>
The Committee has made good progress today, and I commend the schedule to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On Second Reading, Conservative Members voted for a reasoned amendment, but we abstained on the substantive question because we hoped that the Government would agree to many amendments that would allay our connections. This is, after all, largely a technical Bill.
<P>
One of our key concerns is that the Bill will result in an escalation of regulatory costs. That is not an hysterical or party political point but a concern that reflects the views of the industry and of many people outside the House. We tabled amendments in Committee that reasonably sought to limit the number of people who would be appointed to an authority and we sought to keep costs under control, but those amendments were rejected.
<P>
The Minister mentioned setting up committees and sub-committees. There is no limit on the number of committees that can be established. She rejected our proposal to limit the number of appointees to the authority, as well as our proposal that members who are appointed to an authority should be subject to approval, scrutiny or questioning by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry.
<P>
The Minister even rejected the reasonable amendment that would have required the Treasury to approve any determination that was made under the schedule relating to pay, conditions and expenses of members of the authority and staff who are employed by the authority, and to approve the number of people who will be appointed to that authority. We simply lifted that proposal from the 1986 and 1989 Acts.
<P>
The Minister rejected our reasonable proposal that an authority should have a quorum established in legislation. In our debate on clause 1, she also rejected an amendment that would have required the Secretary of State to set out the criteria specifying the sort of people who should be appointed to the authority. Such criteria could be amended or changed from time to time, and the Government would not incur any legislative burdens in that regard. The amendment would have set out in public the sort of people who should be appointed to the board.
<P>
When the Minister summed up, she said that the Bill would provide certainty and transparency and involve low costs. There will be no transparency because she refused to publish in the Bill the criteria relating to appointments and because she rejected our proposal to allow the Trade and Industry Committee to interview and vet people.
<P>
The Bill will not bring certainty because it will introduce a host of new regulatory powers that have not yet been published in draft form. There is massive uncertainty in the industry about the regulatory risk that the Bill will impose and about unlimited fines. There is also total uncertainty about the powers, directives and guidance that the Secretary of State will issue to industry.
<P>
What about low cost? I do not know how the Minister has the gall to use that term. She has rejected all our attempts during the debate on schedule 1 to limit or cap costs. I even asked her whether she would limit the number of appointees to the committee to 100, but she said that that would limit the flexibility of the authority to appoint members.
<P>
In order to prevent the escalation of costs and the expansion of the authority, and in an effort to limit the costs that will be borne by the consumer, I urge members of the Committee to vote against the schedule. The Government have been unreasonable in not listening to the Opposition's concerns. That may affect what we shall do on other occasions if the Government continue to take this approach to amendments that we table.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`NATIONAL'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall explain to the Committee the purpose of the amendments and what their effect would be. I want us to consider whether there is a need for yet another consumer body, or whether it would be more efficient if the powers that the Government want to give to the consumer body were to be exercised by the authority that we have just been discussing or by an existing body such as the National Consumer Council.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 93 and 94 apply to clause 2. Under amendment No. 93, matters would be run by the National Consumer Council rather than a separate council; under amendment No. 94 there would be no separate council at all and the powers would be vested in the authority. Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 were tabled in case the Government decide not to accept the other two amendments because of a clash between the purposes of the National Consumer Council and those of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and the Telecommunications Consumer Council. When the NCC was set up by the 1974 Labour Government it was supposed to cover all such matters. Under the amendments, there would be a flip-flop arrangement that would allow one body to have precedence over the other, so that there would be no argument, if both the NCC and a consumer council made proposals to the authority, which body the authority should listen to. That represents an alternative arrangement to that proposed in amendments Nos. 93 and 94.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 99 and 97 are amendments to clause 85. The Clerks have been kind enough to explain that they are being debated under clause 2 because they are effectively a mirror image of what we are seeking to achieve in respect of clause 2. Clause 99 would provide for no separate council, while amendment No. 97 would allow the NCC to act as the council. Amendment No. 98 is a technical amendment to change a heading. I hope that members of the Committee are with me so far.
<P>
Although I might argue with the powers in clause 2, the amendments would not change the powers that the Government want to give to the two consumer bodies—the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and the Telecommunications Consumer Council. They would transfer them either to the authority or to the National Consumer Council. The new chairman designate of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council has told us in easy words what she intends the council to do. She believes that the role of the council as described in the Bill—it is always useful to hear a summary—is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``obtain and keep under review information about consumer matters, and the views of consumers on those matters, and undertake this both in respect of national issues and those which concern consumers in the regions of England, Wales and Scotland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I contend that that is already the role of the authority and of the NCC. The chairman designate goes on to state that the new council should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``establish one or more committees in each of Wales and Scotland (and, optionally, in England)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although Wales and Scotland would not necessarily have committees, I again contend that they could set them up if they wished to do so. The document in which the chairman designate's views are set out goes on to list other aspects of the new council's role. It states that the council should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``maintain at least one office where consumers can apply for information in each of England, Wales and Scotland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The authorities could provide that information. The council should also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make proposals, and represent the interests of consumers, about consumer matters to public bodies, licensees etc.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those bodies already have that role and will need to fulfil it. Furthermore, the council will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provide information to consumers of gas and electricity, including data about the performance of licensees against standards of performance''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The authorities will again have to be on top of those matters. The document then states that the new council will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``investigate customer complaints which have not been resolved by the relevant licensees''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A complaints procedure is already in place in respect of the NCC. The final aspect of the new council's role is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``investigate `other' matters affecting consumers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Has the hon. Gentleman taken advice from the National Consumer Council on these matters? I have in mind some particular difficulties with the suggestions that he is making. He probably recollects that I worked for the gas consumers council for 17 years. I found that the councils' roles were complementary but different. An NCC briefing states that there should be sector-specific consumer bodies but that its role is to look across the sectors. In that respect, the NCC has a similar role to that of the Cabinet Office, which has to consider cross-cutting issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am awfully grateful to the hon. Lady, but I have that briefing and I am making a speech about it at this moment. If I advance a logical argument and deal with the issues in the correct order, we shall come to what the NCC has said. Of course, the NCC is part of the regulatory industry and I should not expect any part of that industry to suggest fewer regulators. I have quoted the views of the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, which sets out three objectives that are relevant to the Committee. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In summary, our vision for the new Council encompasses three key objectives:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>—a population of well-informed electricity and gas customers who are able to pursue effectively their own concerns and interests;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>—a new consumer body which is effective in influencing the policies and behaviour of electricity and gas companies;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>—customer complaints and enquiries being handled efficiently and to a standard satisfactory to customers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will Committee members put themselves in the role of somebody who has a complaint but who has to pursue it with what the Government believe is the current lack of consumer protection? Whether the complaint relates to gas, electricity or telecommunications, the person's first port of call should be to the supplier, who is licensed to provide the service. All of us know that the number of complaints that go further than the supplier is very small, which shows that the supplier will usually deal effectively with a customer who rings up with a complaint. The ``I'm the monopoly provider, you can go hang'' attitude has disappeared since privatisation. People know that they have options and that suppliers who do not—
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> If the hon. Lady will allow me, I shall make my speech. I do not want to undermine her pension rights, but that is the direction taken by suppliers. You are a very generous and fair-minded Chairman, Mrs. Roe. Once I have sat down, you will allow the hon. Lady to make her own speech, and I would be grateful to hear it and to gain from her knowledge of the gas consumers council.
<P>
The supplier is the first port of call. We would all agree that that is where the bulk of consumer complaints and issues are best sorted out. The supplier also has a market position. Complaints are often made about having to pay too much for supply and the market's ability to affect costs. The supplier and consumer are involved, but no other body. If consumers are unhappy with their treatment, there are the local authority trading standards departments. The Government have expanded the departments' role, although they have not given local authorities more money.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> We have given them more money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am told that they have, and am grateful for the Minister's indication. He clearly understands that the Government are already paying, on the taxpayer's behalf, for more trading standards officers to help with complaints.
<P>
The consumer may currently go to the relevant utility authority. Powers will be extended to include social measures, so the new authority will be beefed up. People can go to a competition authority. Additional ways to complain are included in the Competition Act. I am not sure whether the monopolies and mergers body is disappearing, but—
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It is now called the Competition Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I had a feeling that two bodies had been merged. I would not wish to mislead the Committee and am grateful to the Minister.
<P>
I shall consider the National Consumer Council in more detail because it is an outside independent body—it is not an authority and it is not wedded to a group of industries to be regulated. A consumer could use it to reach one of the groups independently. The Labour Government established it in 1974.
<P>
I should consider independent organisations. I have already told the Committee that I am a paid adviser to the Telecommunication Managers Association. I shall not speak on its behalf or say how good or bad that it is. More consumers could go to another organisation—the Independent Association of Telecommunications' Users Ltd. Many independent and single-issue groups get involved and are willing to take up complaints on people's behalf. People go to citizens advice bureaux, which can assist with getting help. Law centres and solicitors are also available.
<P>
All of us know that Members of Parliament have a role. How often do people write to us about utilities, state owned or otherwise? Any good Member of Parliament will offer to take a matter up and our letterhead is magic when it comes to sorting out a constituent's complaint. The Government have given us an extra level of representation with Members of the Scottish Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, Assembly Members, and local councillors. They can all deal with a complaint.
<P>
Many of us know that some of our more vociferous constituents would complain to all their representatives. When the Government say that they will help the consumer to get an answer, they must think about who, primarily, will be dealing with a new body. Allegations of the mis-selling of gas contracts would be highly contentious. All those people, if consumers approached them, would deal with the matter. Consumers can also approach the gas consumers council with gas complaints.
<P>
If we want to provide a national source to which everyone knows they can complain, we should consider the definition in the National Consumer Council's briefing. Under the heading,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``About the National Consumer Council'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The National Consumer Council . . . was set up by the government in 1975''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that new Labour will not repudiate everything that old Labour did—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to provide a vigorous, independent voice for consumers of goods and services of all kinds to central and local government, industry, public services and others. It has a special responsibility to represent the interest of disadvantaged consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is not a definition of sector-specific, I do not know what is. The National Consumer Council instantly noted that I named it as an organisation that could do the job if the Government decide to have a separate organisation. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) said that although it wanted to take on the role, there was also a case for sector-specific groups.
<P>
Consumer groups are rushing to come to the table. In effect, they are saying to the Government, ``Don't worry. If you don't accept the amendments, we will come and represent the consumer as well. Our role will duplicate what you are trying to do.'' The good old Government, the good old taxpayer and the good old consumer will pay many times over for different organisations to do the same job.
<P>
Another point that I wanted to make on the NCC is why a national body is better than sector-specific bodies. Complaints tend to a arrive in lumps. For example, the different contracts to sell gas have made consumers take notice. For 30 years, they have been buying gas from the same monopoly, but the new contracts have complicated matters, and if they go wrong there is a sudden rush of work for the consumer body. But it might not have to deal with substantial consumer complaints for another five years. The gas consumers council received 6,000 complaints last year. That means that only nine of my constituents complained to it. As I do not have many moaning constituents, I suspect that only five complained; the remaining complaints must have come from other constituencies.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The hon. Gentleman just does not need 77 of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Indeed; 77 unhappy people who could not get an answer would be a bad thing, because that is my majority.
<P>
If we want to put money into consumer protection, it is often better to give it to a body that can be properly represented throughout the United Kingdom and which can take a large number of phone calls at one time. Different sector-specific groups will occasionally ask it to sort out a problem. That is my second option.
<P>
My preferred option is not to have separate consumer bodies when a powerful authority is in charge of regulating the industries. The teeth of the Bill rest in the authority. A ridiculous situation could arise if, for example, a constituent wanted a problem sorted out. I might write to the authority saying, ``Come on, you should do something to sort this out, because you have the teeth,'' and the authority would reply, ``Hang on a minute, you have a good point. We would really like to help, but before we take action, we must pass the matter back to the consumer body, which will have to consult and then tell us what it thinks should happen.''
<P>
The amendments would not remove any of the council's powers. The powers would reside with the authority, and the authority would receive direct representations and be required to set up a consultative body for the whole country. However, the number of chairmen, committees and so on would be reduced. We would know where to go if we really needed action, to apply pressure or if the rules had to be changed. A Member of Parliament can easily get a body to sort out problems, but when it is not allowed to do something because of the rules and regulations, an authority is needed to change those rules and regulations or to put pressure on that body.
<P>
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux briefing outlined its concerns and stated what is needed by the consumers who complain to the bureaux. Although they could complain to a consumer bureau, and a consumer council could cite evidence that there was a problem, the authority would be needed to do something about a complaint to NACAB. It would be a win-win situation to give powers to the authority rather than to separate bodies, because it would reduce the cost and make things work better. The companies and the licensees would feel happier about it because they would know who to deal with; they would not have to satisfy two masters.
<P>
The authority should benefit the consumer; that is its raison d'etre. It should exist not only for the sake of licensees, but to deliver what the consumer needs. It has the teeth and the ability to do so. I want the Minister to appreciate that a powerful authority is better; it would reduce bureaucracy and waste and it should be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> I shall take a few moments to speak against the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Dorset, especially his proposal in amendments Nos. 93, 97 and 98 to give the National Consumer Council the function of consumer council for sector-specific areas. The hon. Gentleman's case was factually incorrect and rather muddled. I intervened to ask whether he had taken some advice from the National Consumer Council; had he done so he might have been a little clearer about why his proposals do not make sense.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to reducing costs and said what the companies and licensees preferred. He quoted an estimate of 6,000 complaints—I assume that it was an estimate because I do not know where he got the figure from. In my experience, before competition was introduced and vastly increased the number of complaints, the figure was much higher.
<P>
It is currently 50,000 to 60,000. If the hon. Gentleman is referring to the Library documentation, which is usually extremely reliable, I think that I am right in saying that it refers to the complaints received only by Ofgas, which deals with relatively few complaints compared with the gas consumers council.
<P>
There are good reasons for sector-specific consumer councils. I worked for 17 years for the gas consumers council, and it never ceased to amaze me that every day would bring a new complaint. I expected after only one week that the diet of complaints might become rather boring, but over the years I was surprised at how extensive the range of complaints could be. For instance, cross-meter reference numbers was a frequent source of complaint. I can see the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) nodding; he obviously recognises the symptom. It took quite a long time to get to the bottom of that problem when the industry was nationalised.
<P>
Since privatisation, contract law has come into play. Cross-meter reference numbers can result in one consumer receiving another's bill, which might be much higher than their use of gas or electricity warranted. That can go on for years. The legal position in such cases is exceedingly complex. Indeed, it has changed since privatisation; because different contract law and private law provisions are in force, it can take many hours to unravel.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset suggested that complaints came in lumps. They certainly came in lumps when competition was introduced in the south-west. We in Devon and Cornwall were the guinea pigs, and complaints rocketed eight-fold. We had a small and challenged staff to deal with the routine number of complaints, but not with a lump like that.
<P>
1 regret that many of the complaints that hon. Members hear about are often caused by the mis-selling, on the doorstep, of gas and electricity supplies. Those complaints have stayed at a much higher level than pre-competition. There was a time when I said to myself that if the level of complaints continued, I and my staff would be out of a job, but that certainly was not in the days immediately following the introduction of competition—nor since, as I hear from staff now working in sector-specific consumer councils.
<P>
I shall give credit where it is due; following privatisation, and when regulation was brought down to a fine art, complaints were reduced to a very low level. That was the only year out of 17 years when I thought that the recipe might be working for consumers. Because of the way in which the industry has been fragmented, interests of consumers can always fall between two stools. As I said, complaints are now running at between 50,000 and 60,000.
<P>
The briefing notes issues by the National Consumer Council clearly state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There should be independent consumer bodies which are sector-specific. They should act as consumer advocates within those areas''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Complaints often give rise to the council being able to make representations, get to the bottom of problems and to iron things out so that consumers do not experience those problems in future.
<P>
The markets with consumer councils are different. They need people with specialist expertise and knowledge. Telecoms is quite different from gas; and gas and electricity have different requirements. The National Consumer Council was good at pointing out when the gas consumers council or the electricity consumers council had failed in its duties. Its role is to ensure that the gas consumers council, the electricity consumers council and the telecoms council come up to scratch. If the National Consumer Council was to become involved in complaints, it would completely overwhelm it, but it has an important cross-cutting role. As I said, the Cabinet Office would ensure that issues capable of being tackled by joined-up government may sometimes be tackled by joined-up regulation, although not in every case. It should also bring together the sector-specific organisations so that they can learn from best practice.
<P>
Even the present level of 50,000 to 60,000 complaints only scratches the surface. When competition was introduced in the south-west just two or three years ago, useful research was carried out by the Devon trading standards department which suggested that those complaints were only the tip of the iceberg. If the hon. Member for South Dorset thinks that hon. Members' mailbags could cope with the added pressure of complaints, which continue to come in at a high level, he would be in for a shock. He would have been wise to have had discussions with the National Consumer Council to help him to understand a little more about the different but complementary roles of the two organisations; it certainly seems so from my knowledge of gas, electricity, water and telecoms.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Member for South Dorset for his thoughtful contribution. I share much of his deep suspicion about the creation of new quangos, whatever sector they are supposed to monitor. When he listed that bewildering number of advice centres and places where guidance can be obtained, he gave some indication of how confused the picture is. I put it to him that is why we are interested in reconfiguring the interface between consumer representation and the rapidly changing energy and telecommunications sectors.
<P>
I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton, who gave the Committee an account of consumer advice and regulation from the inside, drawing on her lengthy experience of working for the gas consumers council. That emphasised the need for such bodies to move on, as markets move on and consumer demand evolves.
<P>
I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 93, 97 and 98. The new consumer councils will have clearly defined statutory functions, which will include keeping themselves informed of consumer matters and the views of consumers throughout Great Britain—throughout the United Kingdom in the case of the Telecommunications Consumers Council. They will have to provide advice to regulatory authorities, Governments, companies and anyone else whose activities might affect consumer interests. They will be expected to try to resolve specific complaints from consumers, to provide information to consumers, to publish information and advice in the interests of consumers, and to carry out investigations into any matter that appears to relate to the interests of consumers. It is important to bear in mind that wide range of functions when considering whether other bodies would be in a position to take them on.
<P>
As the hon. Member for South Dorset argued, Amendments Nos. 93, 97 and 98 would substitute the National Consumer Council for the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and the Telecommunications Consumer Council. The National Consumer Council is a non-statutory non-departmental public body, which was set up to promote action for safeguarding the interests of consumers in general and to ensure that policy makers have before them an authoritative and balanced view of the interests of consumers. As such, it is primarily a policy research body. It does not have the breadth or depth of expertise on specific issues that the new consumer councils will have. For example, the process of complaints handling, which involves dealing with thousands of inquiries and requests for advice, is resource-intensive in terms of staff. It calls for different skills and types of experience from those required for the research currently undertaken by the National Consumer Council.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton pointed out, the National Consumer Council strongly supported the establishment of independent consumer councils throughout the consultation process. On the Bill's publication, the NCC said that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``particularly pleased that the establishment of independent consumer councils is among the key planks of this consumer friendly Bill''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
More recently, the NCC stated explicitly that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it would not . . . be appropriate for the NCC to carry out the specific functions of the consumer councils themselves''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 94 and 99. The Government do not believe that the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and the Telecommunications Authority are the appropriate bodies to handle the functions of the consumer councils. The authorities will operate in a statutory framework that will require them to balance the interests of consumers, companies and shareholders. That is different from the new consumer council's partisan role as consumer champion. The Government's view is that the council needs to be in a position to call the authority to account about its performance in protecting the interests of consumers. It may need to be critical of the authority at times, but a body that stands independent of the authority must undertake that role. It is a major deficiency of the current arrangements that the consumer bodies generally sit too close to the regulators, with appointments made to them by the regulators. The proposal for the new consumer councils will remedy that
<P>
Amendments Nos. 95 and 96 would provide that, in the event of a dispute between the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council and the National Consumer Council, one shall take precedence over the other. The hon. Member for South Dorset was concerned about that. Amendment No. 95 would give the NCC precedence over the GECC, and amendment No. 96 would put it the other way round. As I said, the NCC does not have a statutory role under the Bill. There is therefore no question of a dispute between the NCC and the GECC. No doubt the hon. Gentleman is attempting to probe the relationship. That is a proper thing to do, and he did it well.
<P>
I have set out in detail the respective roles of the two bodies, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not cover the same ground again. I reiterate that the Government do not believe that the NCC should substitute for the new consumer councils, which will be important bodies. The Government believe that, in the interests of utilities, consumers should be properly represented. That is not only for the benefit of consumers, but to make the utility companies better. They will be more competitive if there is a flow of information, which means their having access to an independent body that is adequately resourced and has a clear remit to promote and protect the interests of consumers. The new consumer councils will perform that task. The amendment would undermine those arrangements, so I urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was rather disappointed by the thrust of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South Dorset and the speech that he made in support of it. I hope that he will deal with the issue that emerged, which is that he is fundamentally opposed to a powerful and effective consumer interest that acts as a counterweight in the market. Does he not accept that we need consumer bodies that can act as advocates for consumers—on wider issues and not just those to do with prices and service—which are comprised of people who are independent of the regulatory authorities, and certainly of the industry? Such bodies also need specialist back-up and background to enable them to question and tackle the suppliers and the regulator when difficulties arise that cannot be resolved. Does not the Bill provide what is needed—a free-standing consumer voice with a statutory power and specialist attention? That is achieved by the creation of the two bodies. Does he not feel that the tendency towards the liberalisation of markets and the opening up of industries to competition leave the consumer very exposed and that the market cannot provide effective protection for them? The sharp practice at the moment of liberalisation and the attempt to sign consumers up to contracts of dubious, and sometimes nil, value are illustrations of the fact that leaving it to the market to decide consumer interest is not the way forward.
<P>
I hope that, having heard the speeches and thought through the issues, the hon. Gentleman will agree that the amendments do not strengthen the Bill or consumer interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I shall touch briefly on the contribution of the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, whose support the Government are often keen to have. What the hon. Gentleman said does not even remotely follow my remarks. I was trying not to alter the thrust of the Bill but to ensure that the authority dealing with those issues on behalf of consumers would have teeth.
<P>
I am grateful for the spirit in which the Minister responded and am glad that he too is sceptical about creating new quangos. I wonder whether, after our sitting, he will put a cold towel on his head—
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I could do with one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I say that not because the Minister is drinking water today, but because he should have a think in a darkened room about the implications of Government policy.
<P>
Every so often, plumbers do work in my home—I had better be careful what I say, or no plumber will come near me again—and it would be delightful if a plumber-specific body protected me over the price that I pay and whether plumbers turn up on time, and so on. In fact, the plumbers who have done work for me have been very good, but I suspect that many people would like a consumer council for them. I know that a lot of people will be saying, ``What about car repairs—let's get a consumer body for car repairs, or why not one for carpenters?'' and so on. Every industry could have such a consumer council. We must ask ourselves why the market has got this far with only the gas consumers council.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I will finish my speech, if the hon. Lady does not mind.
<P>
I discovered that I have a committee in my area of the little known Telecommunications Users Association. It first contacted me when it thought that various Governments were going to do away with it. When it came to me with several cases of people being charged for calls that they had not made, I discovered how difficult it found it to get any reply from the telecommunications company against which it was complaining. That demonstrates that a small under-resourced group that does not have any teeth can be ignored by people providing services, if that is what they want to do. We must ensure that the consumer is protected and that there is not simply a pile of talking shops throughout the country, although I know that that will appeal to the Liberal Democrats. It has certainly appealed to the Government, but we need effective action on behalf of consumers. It is rare that consumers need to approach such bodies on such a level, without their having gone to a company to sort out the problems on their behalf
<P>
I was grateful to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton for saying that when the market was working well and few changes were taking place, she felt that she may be out of a job. Frankly, we must reach the day when consumer councils are not necessary—not because we want to do down consumer interests, but because consumers feel that the marketplace is looking after them. I accept that the hon. Lady represents a constituency that may go back to the Conservative party at the next general election. I am making no boastful promises about that, but she should have declared an interest in case the job is still open for her. If she leaves this place, perhaps she could work for the authority that had the teeth to deal with such matters.
<P>
We have had a good run around on the amendment. I shall withdraw it not because I think that it is wrong, but because the Minister, after he has been to his darkened room with a wet towel over his head, may think what a good idea it is. Perhaps he could make his career and name in new Labour by reducing bureaucracy, giving back money to the Treasury and doing all those wonderful things to ensure that he continues and even accelerates his career, for which we all hope. So that the Government will not feel embarrassed when they table their own amendments, and that mine may have a better chance of being accepted on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 2.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment to clarify that the shorthand use of the term ``the 1986 Act'' to mean ``the Gas Act 1986'' applies only in part I of the Bill, which refers to gas and electricity.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 is another technical amendment to clarify that the shorthand use of the term ``the 1989 Act'' to mean ``the Electricity Act 1989'' applies only in part I of the Bill.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The meat of the subject of consumer councils will be dealt with under schedule 2. In retrospect, I wish that I had said during debate on the sittings motion that we should debate schedule 2 with clause 2. None the less, we can discuss the schedule when we reach the appropriate amendments. Suffice it to say that we are again concerned about the proliferation of costs and expenses. The interesting document that has been prepared by the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council task force refers to the tendency for the organisation to be expansionary.
<P>
Paragraph 11 includes the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to provide a comprehensive service for consumers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds good, but it then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We envisage that, as the role of the new Council develops, increasing weight will be given to it providing expert advice . . . To do this, the Council will need arrangements which enable effective communication with customers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That tends to suggest an expansionary role that will require additional resources.
<P>
Paragraph 11 also says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to ensure that staff in the Council have the appropriate support and infrastructure so that they can continue to provide a first class service. The new organisation will offer exciting personal career development opportunities for all its staff, particularly in the context of the larger management units envisaged for the new Council''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why we are concerned. Amendments have been tabled to schedule 2 that would cap any expansionary functions of the council. Of course, we support the merger of the councils into one body. It is important that a consumer council exists when such organisations move from state monopoly to full competition. We fully support the concept of consumer councils in such industries, but the concern is that we do not want such organisations to become expansionary and expensive. 
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the documents include two models, one of which involves setting up offices in Leeds, Birmingham and London, the other confining that to Birmingham. Let us hope that we can prevent such organisations from becoming expansionary. They must focus on assisting consumers, not becoming empires that they will end up paying for.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> These amendments deal with the relationship between the authority and the council. They relate to the energy industry and the telecommunications industry, which is dealt with under clause 85. Under amendment No. 41, the Secretary of State would have to approve the arrangements between the council and the authority. Under the clause, the authority and the consumer council will be required to draft a memorandum of understanding, which Parliament will have to approve. The memorandum of understanding is important to ensure that no disputes or conflicts arise between the bodies. Under the amendment, the Secretary of State would have to approve the memorandum because it is vital that no duplication or turf wars occur between those bodies and to ensure that they do not impose a huge and unnecessary burden and can sort out such matters before they start to impose requirements on the utilities.
<P>
Under amendment No. 42, we would add a third item to the list of matters on which that the council and the authority must agree. Under subsection (1)(a), the agreement must refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``co-operation and the exchange of information between''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the council and the authority. Subsection (1)(b) includes another requirement: the arrangements must secure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consistent treatment of matters that affect both of them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Both those requirements are welcome, but a major third item is missing: amendment No. 42—the key amendment in the group—states that the agreement should try to secure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``efficient and effective working arrangements between them in relation to matters in respect of which both of them are entitled to exercise functions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Where both organisations have the power to exercise functions, and the Bill contains many such examples, it is important that they agree which of them should take responsibility.
<P>
Under amendment No. 43, the consumer council and the authority should consult licence holders before changing any such agreement. That is fair enough; those agreements will affect the licence holders. The burden of the requirements to provide information can be costly, so the licence holders should be consulted on the agreement.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 would tidy up clause 6 and would require a copy of the agreement to be sent to the Secretary of State for approval. Amendment No. 46 is consequential to amendments Nos. 44 and 45. Amendment No. 47 would give the Secretary of State a reserve power to make regulations when the consumer council and the authority cannot agree. That is important because, if such a dispute cannot be resolved, the utilities should not suffer as a result. The reserve power should avoid such disputes and, if they do arise, permit the bodies to come to an agreement. Amendments Nos. 48 to 54 apply to clause 85 and are similar to amendments No. 41 to 47, only in relation to the telecommunications industry.
<P>
Our amendments would clarify and make accountable the arrangements for co-ordinating the activities of the consumer council and the authority, and would prevent duplication and overlap in their activities. That is the gist of our proposals. It is also the primary purpose of clauses 6 and 85 which, however, fail to deal with fundamental issues. They insist only that an agreement is drawn up and that the council and the authority deal with exchanges of information and secure consistent treatment. They fail to discuss the potential for duplication or areas of uncertainty that the authority and the council have a duty to investigate.
<P>
Given the overlap between the functions of the authority and the council, the industry believes that the proposals in clauses 6 and 85 are unlikely to ensure that the bodies will work together effectively. The amendments would extend the issues on which both bodies are entitled to exercise functions and on which they will be required to seek agreement. As I said, that includes investigatory duties and so on.
<P>
The amendments would require the authority and the council to consult licence holders and others when drawing up an agreement and, once they have done so, to obtain the Secretary of State's approval. They would also provide for a reserve power if such an agreement cannot be reached.
<P>
I am surprised that those matters are not in the Bill as the draft of the memorandum of understanding drawn up by Ofgem and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council acknowledges such issues. In its introduction, the memorandum lists six areas in which agreement is needed. By contrast, the Bill sets out only two: the exchange of information, which is dealt with in subsection (1)(a), and consistency, which is dealt with in subsection (1)(b).
<P>
Page 2 of the memorandum of understanding lists four additional objectives, the first of which is an agreement to provide
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a coherent and effective service to consumers of gas and electricity''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps that should be in the Bill. The second objective is to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``minimise duplication of effort by agreeing a division of tasks wherever appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That important element is missing from the Bill. Thirdly, the council and authority state that they aim to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``enhance each other's ability to fulfil our respective statutory functions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, they aim to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``foster mutual understanding and good relations generally between our two bodies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another sensible objective.
<P>
The Minister provided Committee members with the first draft of the memorandum of understanding, along with the waste and water industry memorandum of understanding. We have yet to see the draft of the telecoms agreement, so I should be grateful to know when we may have a copy.
<P>
Despite the success of Ofgem and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council in identifying joint objectives, the rest of the memorandum adds little to the sum of world knowledge. On page 3, the council and the authority state that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``agree to hold joint meetings from time to time''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Splendid—I hope that they do and that the meetings are useful. On page 4 it is said that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``agree to establish efficient and effective administration and communications''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Very good—I hope that they do; but the only concrete element in the draft so far can be found at the bottom of page 3:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We agree that the Council is the main agency for handling complaints where the consumer has approached the company and remains dissatisfied''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a useful feature—the only useful feature—in the memorandum of understanding, as currently drafted. It is useful because it deals with the potential conflict between the two bodies over who is to do the investigating, but it does not avoid some of the fundamental problems surrounding the exercise of investigatory powers.
<P>
When a consumer complaint is referred to the authority by the council after an investigation and remedial action is sought, does the complaint have to be referred back to the authority for reinvestigation or can the authority rely on the report already compiled by the council as a result of the consumer complaint, notwithstanding the fact that the council has a consumer advocacy role? In debating a previous clause, the Minister said that the council would have the partisan consumer champion role of the new consumer councils, which implies that it will be partisan. Thus a partisan organisation does an initial investigation into a complaint, and a report is forwarded to the authority for remedial action. Should the authority rely on the report, given that the consumer council is partisan, or should it reinvestigate, which means duplication? If the whole process has to be repeated, it will add considerable costs to the utilities and to the investigating bodies. What should we do? Perhaps the consumer council should not have a partisan role in its investigations. In that case, it would have to instigate natural justice procedures. However, we shall return to such issues later in the Bill.
<P>
The amendment would ensure that there is no overlap or duplication. It is essential to avoid a turf war between the two bodies. The consequence of their failure to agree will be that the combined bodies will incur higher costs, which will have to be recouped through the licence conditions that the utilities will have to pay, and they will be passed on, in turn, to consumers.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consider the amendments seriously and incorporate them into the Bill. As drafted, the Bill does not require consumer bodies and the authority to agree on the most fundamental structural problem of the arrangements—how to deal with duplication and overlap. I am surprised that subsections (1)(a) and (b) fail to refer to that problem. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to the amendments. If he is unable to accept the precise wording, I hope that he will agree to table further amendments on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Amendment No. 101 is similar in intent to amendment No. 43, though less specific. We are concerned not primarily with resolving conflict between the two organisations—the authority and the council—but with ensuring that the terms of reference of the council in its relationship with the authority are not just a cosy matter to be determined by the people who happen to be directing the process for the time being. It should be subject to outside consultation and be open to intervention, suggestion and good ideas from beyond that narrow, cosy circle.
<P>
Under subsection (2), once the deal is done, the memorandum will be prepared and that is it. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure a pause after that. Once the arrangements have been drawn up there should be consultation with other interested parties and individuals. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made the case for amendment No. 43 in relation to licence holders, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such other persons as they consider appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We use the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other interested parties and individuals''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The essence is to make sure that we have firm foundations on which those two bodies can work together but that are not so firm and cosy that legitimate external interests are disregarded or perhaps not even drawn into the discussion in the first place.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The primary purpose of amendment No. 101 is to ensure that there is a statutory requirement for consultation with other outside interests, which should take place before the drawing up of the memorandum and its submission to the Secretary of State. The Minister may say that the Government want to get on with this and avoid a long hiatus. He may argue that consultation is always time consuming and ask what we do if it is not resolved. The point is that these organisations should at least be given the opportunity to make an input and for their views to be taken into account in a formal sense by the Secretary of State, and before that by the authority and the council when they are drafting the final form of their memorandum.
<P>
I share the Government's view that we want a strong and solid consumer voice. I am concerned that under the Bill in its present form significant points of view and good ideas might be excluded or never formally presented in a way that the Secretary of State or the authority or the council are bound to consider. I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to amendments Nos. 43 and 101 and to make sure that we have that strong foundation for the consumer interest.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the amendments that he has so ably proposed. I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 100. How the two authorities—I have already argued that they should be a single authority—decide to balance their activities is important. Indeed, in some ways one is supportive of clause 6 in wanting them to balance those activities and to be open about how that is done. They should involve the licensees. That is the purpose of amendment No. 101. They should take advice and get their views. The only way for the licensees to make any money is by selling the product to customers, so they will want to be clear and to co-operate with the authorities and the consumer councils.
<P>
Clarity is important. The Chancellor made an amusing speech yesterday in which he referred to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the strong support that Oftel have from me and others in Government''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a wonderful thing for the Chancellor to say, particularly when we are abolishing Oftel in this Bill. Clearly it is inadequate for what needs to be done in this day and age. The Chancellor is not the responsible Minister to talk about what the telecommunications regulator should do. The regulator is supposed to be independent. The press should know that when the Chancellor suggests to Oftel that the costs of internet access should be halved, Oftel does not have the power to comply. It has the power to approve payment arrangements that have been proposed by the companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there has been a long campaign in the House for the breakthrough that the Chancellor called for yesterday. It has had support from the Opposition who have called for charges to be abolished as soon as possible. Oftel also proposed that, but with too long a time scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> If the hon. Gentleman or I had made that speech, we would have made it clear that what the Chancellor was calling for was already happening. Indeed, he made that point later in his speech.
<P>
The relevance to the amendment—I must be careful not to try your patience too much, Mrs. Roe, after getting that little clip in—is that people should understand who does what in these regulators. It is clear—I am grateful that in this at least the Government are being prescriptive—that the arrangements must be published and shown to the public and the licensees must be consulted. I hope that the Minister will say how he expects the authority and the council, together with licensees and bodies such as the Electricity Association, to ensure that the arrangements are sensible and that more than just the two authorities are fighting it out.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendments Nos. 41, 44 to 46, 48 and 51 to 53 would require the authority and the council to secure the Secretary of State's approval for the memorandum of understanding drawn up between them. They would effectively give the Secretary of State a veto.
<P>
I believe that that is unnecessary. The two bodies will need a satisfactory framework for co-operation to enable them to carry out their respective functions effectively. They are also both public sector bodies, ultimately answerable and accountable to Parliament. As somebody who sat for two and a half years on the Public Accounts Committee, where there are no rules of engagement, I know full well what those poor executives must feel as they face that Committee. There will be strong operational and other pressures on the council and the authority to agree a satisfactory memorandum of understanding.
<P>
The idea of a memorandum between two public sector bodies is not new. There is direct statutory precedent in section 4A of the Gas Act 1986, which requires the gas regulator, in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive, to agree a document
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for securing co-operation and the exchange of information between them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The document is laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State, but the contents are for the parties themselves to agree. There is no power for Ministers to intervene or to approve the document. The Bill takes that arm's-length approach to the question of the memorandum between the council and the regulatory authority. It has worked once, and there is every reason to expect it to work again.
<P>
In addition, it is worth noting that the gas consumers council and the regulator have agreed a non-statutory memorandum of understanding setting out arrangements for co-operation between them. The contents themselves do not necessarily provide a precedent for the new public bodies because the functions will be different. However, it is a demonstration that a utility regulator and a council are capable of drawing up a document setting out principles for co-operation without ministerial or other external involvement.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 42 and 49 relate to subsection (1), which sets out the overall purposes of the memorandum of understanding that the authority and the council have to draw up. Those are to put in place arrangements to secure co-operation and the exchange of information between them, as well as consistent treatment of matters affecting them both. Amendment No. 42 adds a further purpose. The Amendment is unobjectionable in substance, but is an unnecessary over-elaboration of the clause, which is sufficient to describe the purposes of the memorandum. It should be left to the parties to decide which issues need to be covered in the memorandum.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 43, 50, 100, 101 and 102 would require the authority and the councils to consult licensees and others before making or revising the memorandum. The memorandum is concerned with the detailed working relationship between the council and the authority. It must work for them. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove said, third parties have a legitimate interest in understanding what has been agreed. That is why the clause ensures that the memorandum, when agreed, is put on the public record. There is nothing to stop the council or the authority consulting anybody whom they care to consult while preparing the memorandum.
<P>
However, it is less clear whether third parties would necessarily have a useful contribution to make to the contents of a detailed operational document. There is nothing to prevent the council and the authority from consulting on the contents of the memorandum where they think that that would serve a useful purpose. Indeed, the energy regulator and the chair designate of the new Gas and Electricity Consumer Council have recently published a draft outline memorandum. The decision on whether public consultation would serve a useful purpose should be one for the parties involved.
<P>
I shall now turn to amendments Nos. 47 and 54, which would empower Ministers to make regulations to co-ordinate the performance and functions of the council and the authority, and to determine disputes about who should handle what. The amendments are unnecessarily heavy-handed. We are confident that two public sector bodies will be able to draw up a satisfactory memorandum covering such matters. That is more than mere optimistic speculation. Callum McCarthy and Ann Robinson recently published a draft memorandum for consultation. Ofwat and the water customer service committees have also produced a draft memorandum. I hope that all Committee members have copies of those documents.
<P>
The water document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Council and the Director reserve the right to the final choice of work each year. However, we will endeavour to ensure that our forward work programmes are co-ordinated in order to make the most effective use of our resources; to avoid duplication and significant omissions; and to minimise the burdens on the water companies''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The draft document also sets out procedures for dealing with consumer complaints, the publication of information and consultation on the exercise of other duties and powers. The procedures build on the basic statutory provisions where necessary.
<P>
The energy document sets out some overarching aims. Those include the establishment of a sound basis for providing a coherent and effective service to consumers and the intention to minimise duplication of effort by agreeing a division of tasks where appropriate.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset asked about the telecoms memorandum of understanding. There is no such memorandum. We do not yet have a telecoms body; it will be entirely new. A chairman designate has not been appointed, and no other appointments have been made. I do not intend to write the memorandum of understanding, nor do I think that Governments should. Such bodies will be fully capable of writing a memorandum of understanding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I thought that the Minister was about to offer me the job. Where should people apply?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If I had a majority of 77, I would be very tempted to apply. We would look sympathetically on the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
There are real dangers in giving Ministers an ability to step in. Such an ability might be counter-productive. If a difficult matter can be dealt with by someone else—this might sound folksy, but I believe it—there is a natural temptation to allow that person to sort it out. Responsibility for making the arrangements work should rest where it belongs—with the two public sector bodies concerned. That is what they will be paid for, and it is consistent with significantly liberated markets.
<P>
I shall deal with the important point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about the overlap of functions. I believe that such fears are misplaced, as far as the memorandum of understanding and the Bill are concerned. The Bill proposes a clear set of functions for the councils, distinct from the functions and duties of the authorities. The two types of body will not have concurrent functions.
<P>
Broadly, the authorities will have responsibilities in relation to issuing and modifying licences, and ensuring that licence conditions are complied with. They will also set standards of performance and will determine certain disputes between licence holders and their customers. They will operate within a balanced framework of duties. The functions of the councils will be different. They will have an advocacy role; a duty to seek to resolve, but not determine, customer complaints; a power to carry out investigations into consumer matters; and powers to publish information in the interests of consumers. They will also provide advice to customers.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The requirement of both parties to consult on their forward work programmes and to publish their estimate of overall expenses for the coming year will be an important tool for avoiding overlap and for boosting the confidence of third parties that work is being properly co-ordinated. I take the point made on that matter by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. That requirement will provide a formal framework within which the authority and the council can discuss their respective work. Furthermore, it will give third parties an important opportunity to comment on any areas of overlap and duplication before the programmes and budgets are finalised. Ministers will have the benefit of those comments before resources are agreed. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendments.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I detected a chink of light in the Minister's comments on amendment No. 42, when he said that the amendments were not necessarily objectionable. They are not objectionable, and would considerably enhance the Bill—amendment No. 42 in particular. We intend to press that amendment to a vote, although not the others.
<P>
The Minister said that there will not be disputes between the two bodies because their roles are sufficiently separate. However, that is not the view put in the draft memorandum of understanding between Ofgem and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council, which states that a key aim on which they need to agree is the minimising of duplication of effort by agreeing a division of tasks whenever appropriate. The only agreement that they have reached is that the council should be the main agency for handling complaints, in cases in which a consumer has approached the company but remains dissatisfied. The two bodies admit that there is scope for duplication in investigating consumer complaints.
<P>
The Minister said that one of the roles of the authority will be to deal with disputes between licence holders and their customers. He then talked about the council having a role in dealing with customer complaints. Customer complaints are effectively disputes between licence holders—the utilities—and their customers. There is, therefore, clearly scope in the Bill for duplication of effort and for overlap, notwithstanding the Minister's assurances. It is imperative that that should be dealt with. Fortunately, it seems to have been dealt with in that memorandum, but that will not always be the case. There will be huge implications, if the two bodies cannot agree on the issues of duplication. There will be instances in which they will investigate the same items separately, incurring costs for the authorities and the councils, and costs for the utilities, which will have to prepare briefs and obtain information from both sides. It will be irritating for those utilities, and extremely costly. Those costs will have to be borne by the consumer. I shall press amendment No. 42—but not amendment No. 41—to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I noted the sympathetic words of the Minister in relation to amendment No. 101. There are some issues that need to be followed up at a later stage, but I shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
