<P>
Question proposed [20 May], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. You may remember that last week we discussed the Government's proposed changes to widows bereavement payments. During that discussion, the Paymaster General made a number of points in which she allowed the Committee to believe that claimants would not be adversely affected. I have read the Hansard report, and after being questioned a number of times by myself and other Opposition Members, she stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'I can assure him that, as I said, no claimants will lose.'--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 20 May 1999; c.325.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reality is that claimants will lose. Perhaps the Paymaster General will apologise to you, Mr. Cook, for having misled the Committee last week.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has sufficient experience to know that that is not a point of order for the Chair. Furthermore, the Paymaster General is not in the Room. I am sure that, in due course, the matter will be resolved between the hon. Gentleman and the Paymaster General.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> Last Thursday, we had a robust debate on clause 42 and the tax relief that we propose to give when an employer lends computer equipment to an employee for use at home. The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) asked several questions about the purpose and effect of the tax relief, on which I hope to be able to satisfy him. It is a pity that the right hon. Gentleman is so reluctant to give the Government credit for the initiative, which has been warmly welcomed on the Government Benches.
<P>
Tax exemption, up to a reasonable limit, for private use of computers that are lent by employers to employees for use at home is an imaginative measure that will help to spread computer literacy within the United Kingdom. Swedish experience with similar tax relief bears out that belief.
<P>
We are not arguing that the tax exemption should necessarily be a permanent feature of the tax system. Computer-related technology is developing rapidly and we believe that it will be sensible to review the impact of this limited exemption in a few years to evaluate how far it has gone in meeting its objective--that is, the wider dissemination of computer literacy.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to encourage employers--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): The Minister made an interesting point when she said that the relief may not be available for ever and a day. Is she suggesting that the Government may, on Report, move an amendment to impose on the provision the requirement that, as with income tax, it must be approved each year?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I do not intend to return on Report with an amendment along those lines. However my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has already stated that we intend to review the impact of this relief after a couple of years to see how well it is meeting its objective, which is the wider dissemination of computer literacy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): Will the Minister define the yardsticks that the Chancellor will use in assessing whether the relief has been a success?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall deal in a minute with the anticipated cost of the relief. One yardstick that we shall use will be the extent of the take-up of the relief, and whether that meets or exceeds our estimates for the cost of the relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The burden of my argument in our earlier debate was that the estimate in the Government's press release is likely to be a massive underestimate, because they are creating a loophole. Is the Economic Secretary saying that the more successful employers are in pursuing this loophole, the more likely the Government are to withdraw the relief, or the more likely they are to deem it a success and therefore regard it as a permanent part of the tax system?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The two right hon. Gentlemen are making heavy weather of this non the less important proposal.
<P>
We shall observer how successful the relief has been in increasing the use of business computer equipment by employees at home. We shall also examine how far the relief has encouraged employers to make computer equipment available to employees who do not at present have computers at home.
<P>
It is interesting to observe the distribution of computers in the home. About 37 per cent. of homes in the United Kingdom currently have computers. However, examination of the spread of computers according to the economic status of the head of the household shows that nearly two thirds of professional have a home computer. About 50 per cent. of employers and managers have a home computer. In striking contrast, only about 30 per cent. of skilled manual and junior non-manual workers, and considerably smaller proportions of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, have their own computer at home.
<P>
We have successfully resisted the Opposition's amendments that would have allowed employers to confine the benefit to directors, and part of the intention of this new tax relief is to spread the use of computers in the home to people currently unlikely to have them. Of course, there will be no need for employers to lend business equipment to those who already have a home computer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Economic Secretary define what she means by a computer? A few moments ago, she referred to 'business computer equipment', but the clause refers to 'computer equipment'. Will she confirm that the average computer game, used by children of all social backgrounds, has more computing power than a mainframe computer would have had 20 years ago?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The enormous increase in computing power is not a matter of dispute between us, nor is it relevant to the clause. When I referred to business computer equipment, I was referring to computer equipment owned by a business and provided or lent by an employer to an employee for use at home. That is the subject of clause 42.
<P>
The clause refers to 'computer equipment' meaning computer equipment in the everyday sense of that term. We have deliberately not included a comprehensive definition of computer equipment, because any such definition is likely to be rendered obsolete very quickly in their fast moving sphere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am following the Economic Secretary's argument with great care. If we move into an era of interactive television, in which television sets and computer-chip driven technology become as one, would such equipment be covered by the clause?
<P>
Ms Hewitt: The clause is directed towards computer equipment loaned by employers to employees for home use. The clause's purpose is to spread computer literacy. In circumstances where employers provide employees with television sets for home use that were not generally used in the workplace, not to spread computer literacy but to give employees a tax-free benefit--[
Interruption.] I should like to finish my point. In such circumstances, it is inconceivable that the Inland Revenue would grant tax relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Economic Secretary has just described an interesting clause, but it does not resemble the one that we are debating. What part of the clause will confine the application of tax relief to computer equipment that may be useful to employers in the workplace? The clause states no such thing.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The clause deals with computer equipment that is loaned by employers. The chances of an employer wanting to loan television sets--interactive or otherwise--to employees for home use is very remote, but that is a matter with which the Inland Revenue, with its vast reserves of common sense, will be able to deal according to individual cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary made it clear that the purpose of the clause is to enable people to brush up on their computer skills and become more computer literate. In future, the type of equipment to which I referred a moment ago could be made available. For example, people could download educational programmes from the BBC Learning Zone to help them to brush up on those skills. Would such equipment be covered by the provision?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That will be a matter for employers and the Inland Revenue to judge according to the facts of individual cases. For the relief to be granted, the employer must lend the equipment to the employee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall give way, but I have been fairly generous in allowing interventions and I want to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This is an important point. The Economic Secretary repeatedly says that the Inland Revenue will use common sense. I do not doubt that, but its statutory obligation is to enforce the law. According to the clause, the lending of computer equipment to an employee will justify a tax-allowable benefit of £500 a year. In the clause, there is no hint of a suggestion that such equipment will be confined to that which might otherwise be used in an employer's workplace. What will prevent the tax relief from applying to computer games loaned by employers to employees for use by employees' children? According to my reading of the clause, such a circumstance will be explicitly included. I do not understand the public policy objective behind granting tax relief for that purpose.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has immense expertise and experience in this area, but the clause must be seen in the context of the entire tax system. The clause will grant tax relief on equipment loaned to employees where such equipment was initially purchased by employers. The purchase of huge quantities of Nintendo equipment and other appalling children's computer games for use by employees' children is hardly likely to qualify for the same business expenditure tax relief as the purchase of equipment for general use.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am normally favourably disposed to the cut and thrust of exchanges in Committee, but the fact that Committee members persist in making interventions suggests that it would be more appropriate for further contributions to be made in speeches rather than in disjointed exchanges.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Cook. The Inland Revenue will approach the provision with its normal common sense, as will employers. It is a pity that the contributions of some Committee members were somewhat lacking in common sense.
<P>
Last week the right hon. Member for Charnwood asked about the cost of the proposal. For the current tax year, we estimate a cost of £5 million. In the Red Book we said that we expected the cost to rise to £15 million next year and to £30 million the year after. Those costings are based on a projected take-up of 50,000 computers, worth on average £1,600, in the first year. We expect the number of computers to rise to 150,000 and then 300,000 over the following two years. If those figures prove to be underestimates, that will be a tribute to the proposal's popularity and success--it will show that it has turned out to be even more successful than we had hoped.
<P>
I hope that, on reflection, the right hon. Member for Charnwood will acknowledge that when he criticised the proposal he was being a little short-sighted. He may or may not be swayed by my arguments--I hope that he will be--but he should be influenced by the fact that the proposal was welcomed by other Opposition Members. Labour Members recognise the great value of the measure, and I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I thank that you were wise, Mr. Cook, to invite further speeches about the proposal. I wanted to intervene during the economic Secretary's speech to discuss her use of language. She said that companies would buy computers or associated equipment, which is defined in the clause. Many businesses want to know whether leasing will be covered by the clause, and I do, too. Many people acquire computers through leasing arrangements.
<P>
I accept that the Inland Revenue will--
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My right hon. Friend raised a matter that I too want to discuss. He asked whether leased computer equipment would benefit from the allowance. He should couple to that question an inquiry about whether vouchers provided by an employer for use in, for example, PC World, which is run by Sir Stanley Kalms--we discussed that company the other day--might be subject to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am delighted to have my right hon. Friend's question associated with mine. It returns us neatly to the start of our consideration of the Bill, when we discussed Pepper v Hart. People who seek clarification of the clause will read our deliberations.
<P>
I want to probe more thoroughly the provisions of proposed new section 156A (4) of the Taxes Act 1988, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'For the purposes of this section 'computer equipment' includes'--
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress the word 'includes', which suggests that the list is not definitive--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'printers, scanners, modems, discs and other peripheral devices designed to be used by being connected to or inserted in a computer.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
People who want to make equipment available as a perquisite could take advantage of the fact that many devices can be used in connection with a computer, including a television set.
<P>
For example, a company might want to make digital cameras, which appear to be covered by subsection (4), available as a perquisite. Novelty could creep into interpretations of the subsection, and companies might find low-cost ways of giving employees rewards that may be peripheral to their understanding of the workings of computers.
<P>
The Economic Secretary should clarify what that subsection means. When will the Inland Revenue publish a guidance note to assist people through what could be a minefield of definition if the subsection, subject to the will of the Committee and the House, passes into law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Economic Secretary expressed the hope that her response would persuade me to support the new allowance. Instead it reinforced my doubts, which I shall not delay the Committee by repeating. I shall focus on what public policy objective the allowance aims to achieve. It has been said that computer literacy and awareness of the potential of computer technology is inadequately developed in this country, but it is impossible to square that assertion with what has happened in the development of access to computer technology. We must consider whether by computers we mean conventional machines for handling information or the much broader range of machines including, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) said, intelligent cameras, intelligent televisions, intelligent telephones and the nexus of gizmos that the technology is opening up.
<P>
An increasing range of equipment is being installed by families in their homes--equipment that  is, or may become, definable as a computer. The Government are not creating a realistically targeted initiative to improve computer literacy.  We do not improve computer literacy by introducing a blunt tax relief. The Government are opening a loophole in the tax law that will cost the Revenue significant sums. I have already asked whether that would be regarded as a success or a failure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): Does my Right hon. Friend agree that there could be a hidden agenda? Are the Government keen to spread interactive televisions across the country so that they can undertake the type of democratic exercise that the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry used to talk about? Focus groups were asked to register their opinions on a range of political issues by pressing button A or B. Those responses were taken to be representative of the whole population. Will interactive television take over the role of the House of Commons?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That is an interesting speculation, which I suspect you will not allow me to pursue too far, Mr. Cook. However, the world that my hon. Friend describes looks suspiciously like a more sophisticated version of The Sun poll run  by the patron saint of new Labour, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, which invites the opinions of individuals on different matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My Right hon. Friend tempts me to ask whether he believes that The Sun will publish a list of 10 things that we ought to know about clause 42?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have not the slightest idea, but I do know that if the clause becomes law, The Sun will carry a wide range of advertisements drawing the attention of Mr. Murdoch's readers to the opportunities for tax relief. I have sufficient respect for Mr. Murdoch's entrepreneurial zeal to believe that he will participate in the party.
<P>
To return to the public policy objective, I do not believe that the Government have made the case that this is a computer illiterate nation. But even if they had, the clause is an absurdly blunt remedy for that failing. It is much more likely to provide a tax shelter for people to purchase what they would have purchased anyway than to change, at any perceptible level, the computer literacy of the population, whether the beneficiary is the typically computer-illiterate executive or the typically more computer-literate person further down the corporate organisation. The Economic Secretary has simply not made her case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Although the concept behind the clause is welcome, it is clear from my right hon. Friend's arguments--and the Economic Secretary's unsatisfactory response--that the clause will create more problems than it solves. As I said in my opening comments, there is no clear necessity for the clause, as, according to a parliamentary answer from the Economic Secretary, the Inland Revenue does not even enforce any benefit from the use of computers at home. Employers may use the clause to give tax-free income to their employees by means of a perk.
<P>
The Chancellor may have introduced the clause to produce good political headlines, but it is likely to lead to huge problems, and may cause a large haemorrhage of tax revenue. The Economic Secretary admitted today that the relief may not even survive more than one or two years on the statute book for that reason. She also said that a computer cannot be defined because of fast-changing technology. That is precisely the point--employers are likely to use the clause to give tax-free perquisites to their employees.
<P>
I urge the Committee to reject the clause, which the Government must revise to deal with the concerns that have been raised.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> There is the beginnings of a split among Conservative Members. the Front Bench spokesman said that the Opposition were in favour of the purpose of the clause, while the Back Bench--as represented by the right hon. Member for Charnwood--was against the purpose of the clause. They seem to have settled, however, on opposing the clause. They seem to have settled, however, on opposing the clause. That is extraordinary--they seem to have a luddite attitude towards modern technology.
<P>
The public policy purpose of the clause is clear--to increase computing skills and IT literacy among the broad population of the country. Any employer who buys or--to reassure the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack)--leases computer equipment may loan it to employees for use by themselves or their families at home. Tax relief will be provided up to the value of £500 on that equipment. That will ensure, as a similar provision in Sweden has ensured, that people who do not have access to computer equipment to use at home will have access to such equipment in the future. That will benefit such people, their families and their employers, as well as the broader economy.
<P>
The debate has ended at a surreal point. If in an earlier incarnation the Government had sought to introduce tax relief to enable employers to put the spinning jenny into employees' homes, the Opposition would presumably have opposed that on similar luddite grounds. As for the issue of computer equipment and the precise definition of computer games, I am sure that an astute designer will soon produce new computer games, such as 'Design your own Finance Bill Committee--see how many Opposition Members you can zap on the basis of one clause'. We will all look forward to that, but, in the meantime, I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I cannot let what the Economic Secretary said go without further comment. If it is now the Government's declared policy to introduce measures wherever they think that there is some learning or experience deficit in the home, or that some new skill needs to be acquired, following the logic of the clause, we can expect a series of further changes. For example, why has the Economic Secretary not said why health equipment is not included? If, for example, a similar provision applied to exercise machines, a healthy population might give a better return to the nation as a whole in terms of the economic value of the clause. One could develop that argument a long way, which shows why the proposal is absurd and why we disagree with it.

Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. There is sometimes slight confusion during a vote as to whether the name read out is my name or that of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr Touhig). I wonder whether we have to have all the names read out because I do not want to have to vote twice.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that the point has been registered. The simple truth is that, in addition to registering the voting, the Clerk is required to register those who have been absent throughout our proceedings, and he is able to take account of that during a vote.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>PRP and agricultural pay</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I will not delay the Committee unduly, although I believe that we said that in relation to the previous clause, I just want to raise a couple of queries.
<P>
The clause relates to those who receive agricultural wages and who receive also an element of profit-related pay. Under the clause, the profit-related pay will be included when assessing whether a person has received a minimum wage, whereas that element was previously excluded. That diminishes the value of profit-related pay, because although in a profitable year a proportion of the wage may be generated through profit-related pay, in an unprofitable year an employer might have to make up the basic wage package to reach the minimum wage. Therefore, the employee might notice little difference in the amount that he or she finally receives.
<P>
I should be interested to hear the Economic Secretary's comments on the clause, and to know whether she has received representations from the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association or any of the other bodies that represent those affected by the clause, and if so, what their views are.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> In the light of the previous debate, I wonder how long it will be before the House agrees that interactive electronic voting should be available both in Committees and in the Chamber.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr Whittingdale) rightly said, the clause removes the present rule that profit-related pay should not count towards the existing agricultural minimum wage. My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell), who is now Minister for Transport, explained the background to the clause in a written reply to a parliamentary question on 28 July 1998.
<P>
The reason for the change is that we accept the Low Pay Commission's recommendation that incentive payments covering payments of tax-relieved, profit-related pay should be included in the calculation of earnings for the national minimum wage. Therefore the clause ensures that employers and employees in the agricultural sector are subject to the same profit-related pay rules as employers and employees in other business sectors. It removes any unfairness that might be caused by treating a fairly small number of low-paid workers in profit-related pay schemes in the agricultural sector differently from workers in PRP schemes in other sectors.
<P>
Some businesses, including those in the agricultural sector, have expressed concern that if profit-related pay was not allowed to count towards the national minimum wage, that might lead them to abandon their profit-related pay schemes. I think that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that would be a pity, and the clause will prevent it from happening. That is in keeping with our desire that the national minimum wage should be simple and fair, as well as transparent to workers and easy for employers to comply with. I am not aware of any representations that have been made against the clause. I therefore commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Clause 43 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 44</center></H4>
<H4><center>Cars available for private use</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 23, line 43, leave out '15' and insert '13'.
<P>
The clause is the appetiser for next year when, we are told, a new system of company car taxation is to be introduced. Instead of being differentiated according to business mileage and other factors, it will be calculated on the basis of emissions, in order to contribute to the Government's environmental objectives. In principle we do not oppose the change, but it has led to some concern, especially as few details have so far been given about the new system.
<P>
When the Economic Secretary replies to the debate, as well as addressing the changes to be made this year, which I am about to talk about, will she say a little about the Government's overall strategy in the light of the change to be introduced next year? I draw her attention in particular to the concerns of the Confederation of British Industry, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'The details of the future tax treatment of company cars has yet to be determined'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was not yet clear, the CBI said, whether the charge would be based simply on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted or whether other toxic emissions would be taken into account as well.
<P>
The CBI went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'The lack of detail and of worked-through proposals to which business can respond is currently causing considerable concern about the likely impacts of reform.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Government want a proper consultation process before introducing changes in next year's Budget, so they have an opportunity now to say more about their intentions for future tax treatment, which would allow business to respond in greater detail during the consultation period.
<P>
One of the reasons why criticism has been levied at the existing system of company car taxation is that it creates perverse incentives to drive more miles. That is specifically mentioned in the explanatory notes on the clause:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'The existing business mileage discounts have been widely criticised as sending perverse environmental signals, as they give an incentive to drive additional, unnecessary business miles in order to reach the discount thresholds. There is evidence that the extra miles driven in company cars could be as much as 0.3 billion miles a year.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an extraordinarily large figure. I would not dispute the perverse incentives in the existing system, but I would be interested to know the origin of the figure.
<P>
If that is the main criticism of the existing system, it is worth pointing out that the clause will make no difference to it, because it preserves the existing banding system and will still encourage drivers to drive more, clock up additional business miles and reach a higher band in order to enjoy a lower rate of tax.
<P>
The Government's proposed system, whereby the level of tax is calculated purely on the basis of the environmental effect of the car, in terms of emissions, may help the Government to meet their environmental objectives, but it will do away entirely with the distinction between those who have company cars for their business--and clock up many business miles for genuine business purposes--and those who have company cars as a perk. Scrapping that distinction entirely is curious.
<P>
The Daily Telegraph cited the example of two drivers, Alan and Bill, who drive the same model of company car and paid the same money for it--£16,000:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Both drive around 20,000 miles a year but, whereas Alan's mileage is almost all business travel, Bill only does a handful of business miles. Alan's car is four years old, Bill's car is new',
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and they are both in the same tax bracket. At the moment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'both have a basic taxable benefit of £16,000 multiplied by 35 per cent. to give a total bill of £5,600. Alan gets a reduction to 15 per cent. rather than 35 per cent. because of his high business mileage, reduced by a quarter because of the age of his car, resulting in a tax bill of £720. Bill has...a tax bill of £2,240.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is sensible for Alan, who has a company car as a perk, to pay more than Bill, who has a company car and needs it for his business miles. However, as the article continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Under the new scheme, the basic benefit, will be within the 15 per cent. to 35 per cent. range but it will be based on the carbon dioxide emissions of the car. There will be no mileage discounts nor discounts for older cars. If we assume that the car concerned carries a 25 per cent. rating, both men end up with a tax bill of £1,600.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems a little odd that while the Government are proposing to move to a system which may have some merit on environmental grounds, they are throwing away the quite important distinction between genuine business use and a company car that is included as a perk in an overall salary package. I hope that the Minister will address that point when she says a little more about the Government's proposals for the overall reform of business car taxation.
<P>

</P>
<P>
The change proposed in the clause will be effective only this year. As it does not address the main criticism of the effect of the banding in creating perverse incentives, it is rather difficult to see why the Government suggest making that change, particularly as it will last for only a year before the whole system is scrapped and the new one introduced. The suspicion must be that the Government see it as another means of raising additional tax revenue from the hard pressed motorist. We are now familiar with the Government's view that the motorist is a cash cow--that they can levy more and more tax on motorists who have no choice but to stump up. The clause is another example of that attitude, and company car drivers will pay more.
<P>
The way in which the Government are increasing the charge is also curious. The general tax charge on a company car, calculated on basis of 35 per cent. of the list price, is not being changed. The increase affects the discount which applies to business use. Consequently, drivers who use their company cars for 2,500-18,000 miles each year, and who before the Budget paid 231/3 per cent. of the list price of the car, will now pay 25 per cent. of the list price. That represents an increase of 7.1 per cent. in their tax charge. But drivers who use their company cars for more than 18,000 miles and who before the Budget paid 11.67 per cent. of the list price, will now pay 15 per cent. of the list price. That represents an increase in the tax charge of 28 per cent.
<P>
Those who use their cars for more than 18,000 miles a year--the heavy business users--are being required to pay a far bigger increase than those who use their cars less. Clive Tulloch, a tax partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, has calculated the effect of these changes as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'The company car driver who does between 2,500 and 17,999 business miles a year, is a basic-rate taxpayer, and owns a new £15,000 car, will be about £57.50 worse off as a result of these changes. The same driver in the same tax bracket with the same kind of car who does more than 18,000 miles each year will be £115 worse off.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is considerably more. Mr. Tulloch continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'I doubt if the changes will kill off the company car, but it will become more expensive.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The disproportionate increase being levied on those who use their cars for more than 18,000 miles each tax year has led to considerable criticism from the professional bodies. The Chartered Institute of Taxation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Whilst acknowledging the policy of the reduction in the discounts given for business miles driven, we would suggest that the increase for those driving more than 18,000 miles in a tax year is unfair, given that those employees who use their cars for insubstantial business purposes will not incur an increase in assessable benefit.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Its response continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Those employees who drive more than 18,000 business miles are required to use their cars for the proper performance of their duties of employment, and the increase in their assessable benefit is likely to have an adverse impact on businesses.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants made a similar point. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'We are puzzled by this provision as it seems to penalise those who are obliged to travel extensively in the course of their work.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It cited the example of a farm or forestry manager in Scotland who might have to cover long distances regularly, and would have no alternative public transport option. Such a person would bear a disproportionate increase in tax.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the proportion of drivers whose mileage is over the 18,000 threshold is very small, and that the amount of tax, compared to the value of the petrol used by those who drive more than 18,000 miles, is minuscule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> No, I do not. The Economic Secretary, in a written answer last month, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Annual milage data are collected only for  drivers whose company cars are available for private use. According to the latest National Travel Survey, there were an estimated 925,000 company car drivers whose total milage was at least 18,500 miles per annum. This compares to 675,000 company car drivers whose total annual milage was less than 18,500 miles per annum.' [Official Report, 26 April 1999; Vol.330, C.55.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So exactly the reverse is true. More company car drivers use their cars for annual mileages of 18,500 or more than for lesser distances. I must say that 925,000 is a substantial number of drivers, and it is they who will pay considerably more because  of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the tax, when compared to the value of petrol used by people who drive more than 18,000 miles, does not make a significant difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Gentleman should stop digging. I have shown that the tax charge is quite considerable for a person driving more than 18,000 miles each year, and I repeat that many people do so. This is another example of how the Government are increasing tax by stealth for a significant part of the population.
<P>
Our amendment would make a comparatively minor change. It would change the tax charge for those driving more than 18,500 miles--which, following changes in the Budget, will increase from 11.67 per cent. to 15 per cent., an increase of 28 per cent--to 13 per cent. There would still be an increase, but it would come into line with the increase being applied to people who drive fewer than 18,000 miles, so the clause would no longer hit disproportionately people who require their cars for extensive business travel every year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I must declare an interest on two counts. First, I drive a company car. Secondly--this is a sort of interest--I am to some extent the author of the present tax system for company cars, because it was one of the matters on which we worked when I was Financial Secretary.
<P>
I should like to emphasise one or two of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. He made an important point about the Government's plan to issue a consultative document before they introduce their formal proposals next year. Former Ministers who go on about how they used to do things are fairly tedious, but that is how we did it the last time round.
<P>
It was worth doing because it led to significant changes in the details of the original proposals following the consultation. I hope that the Minister will undertake to issue a consultative document before the Chancellor announces the details of the proposed new regime next spring. That would reassure the Committee.
<P>
My second point is about the future of the mileage based banding. My hon. Friend the Member of Maldon and East Chelmsford was right to stress that even if the Government do not want to continue the banding system's present structure, it is right in equity that a distinction should be drawn between those people who have company cars purely as a perk, or a source of tax-efficient income, and those who use them on business. I did not realise until my hon. Friend pointed it out that 925,000 people--the majority of company car drivers, or certainly a larger number than those in the middle band--each drive 18,000 miles a year on business in addition to their private motoring.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Does the Right hon. Gentleman accept that people might be making journeys by car that could just as well be undertaken by public transport? Presumably, part of the reason for the change is to deal with the problem of road congestion. For example, Members of Parliament who represent constituencies up north could use the train rather than drive there. Mileage does not necessarily reflect the importance of the car to the job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I hear what the hon. Lady says, but she puts her finger on a difficulty for the Government. I am not inimical to the policy objective of mixing environmental considerations and tax equity in the same regime. However, the hon. Lady's intervention shows that the Government's new regime will mix two different policy objectives, which underlines the need for a consultative document before proceeding to a final scheme.
<P>
The hon. Lady was right that one of the Government's objectives in their proposed scheme for taxing company cars is to introduce tax incentives to an environmentally friendly policy, and I understand that. However, it does not alter the fact that it should remain a strong objective of policy that how income is taxed is equitable between one taxpayer and another.
<P>
Whatever the incentives on environmental grounds, it will remain true that some people will have company cars purely as a perk and others because they are an important tool in their working environment. The second group should be treated differently in the tax system from the first because if they are not, the Government will re-open a huge loophole which will encourage exactly what the hon. Lady would not like: paying people by giving them cars, because that is tax efficient. That is the world we were in until a few years ago. We have, rightly, progressively retreated from it, not least on environmental grounds. However, if the tax system does not draw the distinction between those for whom the car is purely a perk, and those for whom it is, in addition to being a private benefit, also an inescapable tool of the trade, we shall go straight back to the world we were in a few years ago.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the Right hon. Gentleman accept that the last time that he spoke about company cars in Committee, he said that the aim of tax relief was to encourage the British car industry, a policy that has singularly failed? Does he accept that it is right that the Government should shift the policy emphasis and therefore change the regime?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> When I mentioned company cars supporting the British car industry, I was referring to the world of 25 years ago. The previous Government sought, quite rightly, to withdraw blanket relief for company cars over a period of years. They did that with bipartisan support; this matter is not controversial in the party-political sense. Therefore, those who had cars as a form of remuneration paid tax on them as if they had received cash.
<P>
I hope that that tax principle will be retained when the Government introduce their proposals on company car taxation. Otherwise, we will go back to the world as it was 25 years ago, when employers had a huge incentive to provide cars for people who, even in their remotest dreams, did not need them for work. Employers provided those cars as a tax-efficient form of remuneration. Curiously, clause 42 uses exactly the same argument, but I shall not go into that again.
<P>
I shall build on the proposition that it is important to distinguish between the company car as perk and the company car as tool. I shall go on to make a point that is significant in the context of the banding regime that has existed until now. The Government may be able to think of a cleverer way of distinguishing between the perk, the marginal company car user and the major company car user; I wish them well in that.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not be attracted to the proposition that we should move to a smoother gradient. When I was in government, I was often told that the wide band between 2,500 miles and 18,000 miles was an anomaly of the system, resulting in people driving an extra 2,000 miles to get over one of those mileage hurdles. Consequently, people drew the  understandable conclusion that there should be lots of different gradients so as to define more accurately the extent to which each car was used for private and business purposes.
<P>
Perversely, building in lots of different smaller gradients would mean that the incentive to drive more to get further up the scale would apply to many more people than it would at the moment. Therefore, a degree of bluntness seems to be a necessary part of the system, unless Ministers have cleverly dreamt up something that those of us in the previous Government failed to dream up. If they have done that, I can scarcely wait to read the consultative document containing their proposals. 
<P>
We ought to be assured about the consultative document. In addition to having environmental objectives, we must continue to discourage the use of a company car as a tax-efficient form of pay. I trust that the Minister will not be attracted to going down the route of an increasingly graduated system, as that will undermine her policy objective.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been a fascinating, far-reaching debate, and I shall reply to the various points that have been raised.
<P>
I am surprised that the right hon. Member for Charnwood did not ask about the interaction of clause 44 with clause 42, in terms of provision for cars equipped with a computer, which may include mileage and route-finding devices. However, I shall not tempt the right hon. Gentleman down that track.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford spoke about the consultation for the new system that will be introduced in next year's Finance Bill, which is not directly a matter for the Committee. However, it may be helpful if I provide a little information on that system.
<P>
The consultation on the new company car scheme follows an earlier consultation round, the results of which were published in last November's pre-Budget report. We have given an unprecedented early warning of the broad shape of the fundamental reforms to company car taxation that we propose to implement in April 2002. The broad outline of the proposals appeared in a press release issued by the Inland Revenue on Budget day. That press release invited comments by the end of May.
<P>
The proposals build on the recent consultation document on a graduated emissions-based system of vehicle excise duty for cars. We thought that rather than repeating the substance in a consultation document covering company cars, it would be more useful to make the outline of our proposals directly available to those with a known interest in the matter. We have pursued the matter at ministerial and official level through a series of articles in the trade press, and Revenue officials are holding meetings with representative bodies and other interested parties, who warmly welcome the open way in which the consultation is being conducted.
<P>
In view of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford and the right hon. Member for Charnwood, I shall consider whether we can add to that process by publishing yet another consultation document. The central point that must be made is that we are consulting fully on the shape of the new scheme. We shall report on that in due course, and the results will be reflected in the decisions that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor makes when he draws up next year's Budget.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Could the Economic Secretary tell us to which Budget day press release she is referring?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> IR 4, which I am sure the right hon. Gentleman has to hand.
<P>
I now turn to the amendment, and the discounts for those who drive more business miles. There are more drivers who drive less than 18,000 business miles than those who drive more than 18,000 business miles: 1.15 million drivers drive less that 18,000 business miles and 500,000 drive more than 18,000 business miles. The parliamentary answers that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford mentioned covered total mileage--that is, business and private mileage. I hope that that clarifies the matter.
<P>
When moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked about the 300 million extra business miles that we estimate are driven by drivers seeking to take advantage of the reduced tax rates by crossing the threshold into the lower taxable band. The evidence for that came from the national travel survey conducted by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which showed bunching just above the thresholds of 2,500 and 18,000 business miles.
<P>
The existing discounts for business mileage have been widely and persistently criticised for sending adverse environmental signals. The hon. Gentleman accepted that they gave company car drivers a tax incentive to drive extra unnecessary business miles simply to reach the next discount threshold. We estimate on good evidence that 300 million additional business miles are being driven in response the the perverse incentives that we now discover were created by the right hon. Member for Charnwood when he was Financial Secretary and introduced the present system of company car taxation. Those extra business miles produce extra carbon dioxide, pollution and congestion. Discounts also encourage the misdeclaration of private miles as business miles, which leads to further tax leakage.
<P>
For those reasons, we propose to replace the current system of discounts for business miles with a completely new system based on the emissions produced by the car. We are consulting on the specific issue of whether the new charge should be levied simply on the basis of emission of CO2--the main greenhouse gas--or whether we should consider other emission as well. If we take account of other emissions or provide a discount for cars running on diesel, that will complicate the system further. That is why we are consulting. A balance has to be struck between the attractive simplicity of a company car tax regime focused purely on CO2 emissions and one that also addresses local air quality more widely. We will reflect on that when we receive the consultation responses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Is the Economic Secretary saying that the Government have set their face against any recognition of the distinction between a car that is a perk and a car that has mixed business and private use?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was going to answer that question in a few minutes, but as the right hon. Gentleman cannot wait, I shall deal with it now. He asked whether we had come up with a more ingenious system than the setting of thresholds at 2,500 and 18,000 miles. We will not try to introduce a new thresholds system, nor will we replace the thresholds system with a graduated discounts system, which would have the perverse effects that the right hon. Gentleman described. We will abolish the system of discounts for business mileage. We will get rid of the distinction between a company car provided because it is needed for extensive business mileage, and, at the other end of the spectrum, a company car provided purely as a perk, with no business mileage whatever.
<P>
The new system will tax all company car drivers on the benefits that they derive from having the car available for private use. It will graduate the tax charge according to the emissions produced by the car, and will therefore have a sound environmental basis. The benefit that should properly be charged to tax--if in a rather distorted fashion--is the benefit of having the car available for private use. The amount of business mileage is irrelevant to the benefit of having the car available for private mileage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Is the Economic Secretary telling the Committee that the director of Goldman Sachs, who gets a brand new Mercedes convertible with the latest catalytic converter and environmental improvements to its engine, will pay a lower rate of tax on his company car than the salesman who has an elderly Vauxhall Cavalier?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The Committee can be certain that the director of Goldman Sachs will be a higher rate taxpayer, while the struggling sales representative will probably be a standard rate taxpayer. The taxable benefit will be based on a proportion of the list price of the car, and graduated according to the emissions of the car. Whether a company car is a perk or for essential business use, all drivers of such cars will do roughly the same amount of private mileage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am familiar with the principles being espoused by the Economic Secretary. Will she confirm that the Inland Revenue press release to which she referred announced that the new system would be introduced in a revenue-neutral way? As she rightly said, it is reasonable to assume that the private benefit will be the same to all company car users. Will she therefore confirm that, if the policy is introduced in a revenue-neutral way, it will cut taxes on perks and raise taxes on tools?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The policy is part of our declared intention of modernising the tax system on the basis of environmental principles. Taxation must be shifted to reflect properly the environmental costs of want is being enjoyed. In this case, what we are taxing properly--and what was not properly taxed under the previous Government's system--is the availability of a company car for private use. Whether the company car is a perk, or whether it is provided because the individual has to drive extensive mileage in the course of his work, they all tend to do the same amount of private mileage--approximately 11,000 miles a year. That benefit will be charged to tax in a way that reflects the environmental cost of the benefit, because the list price will be discounted according to the emissions of the car.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am surprised at the hon. Lady's reticence on this question. She has just announced a great bonanza for some company car drivers. Will she confirm that every company car driver who currently drives fewer than 2,500 miles a year will receive a substantial tax cut in next year's Budget? Why could she not express that in a more populist way so that those who will benefit from the handout can understand her munificence?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The new scheme will be introduced in next year's Finance Bill and will come into effect in 2002 on a revenue-neutral basis. Thus the changes set out in this clause will last for the next three years. They are a step towards the new system, in which there will be no discounts for business mileage or for the age of a car, because that is environmentally perverse. Does the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) want me to give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am a little worried that the Economic Secretary is reading my mind. If she is, she will know the answer to my question straight away. If a company were to provide an employee with a pool car, and the employee drove 50,000 miles, would there be no charge to tax, as far as the taxpayer is concerned?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I have obviously failed to read the right hon. Gentleman's mind. Is he talking about private or business mileage driven in a pool car?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for seeking further clarification. I was referring to business mileage.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> If a car is used only for business mileage, and is not available for private use, there would be no taxable benefit and, therefore, no tax charge. I hope that that answers the right hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
Before the changes proposed in the clause, a two thirds discount on the taxable benefit from the list price was given when 18,000 or more business miles were driven. That was an effective charge on 11.67 per cent. of the price of the car. We propose to increase that to 15 per cent. A one third discount was given when between 2,500 and 18,000 business miles were driven. That was an effective charge of 23.33 per cent., which is now being increased to 25 per cent. No changes are proposed for those driving fewer than 2,500 business miles, who will continue to be taxed on the full charge of 35 per cent. of the car's price.
<P>
The proper rationale for the taxation of company cars is to tax the benefit of having the car available for private use and, therefore, not to vary that tax charge because of the irrelevant factor of the extent of the car's business mileage use. It does not make sense to give the drivers of company cars a continuing tax incentive to drive additional business miles.
<P>
This year's proposals are consistent with--and a step towards--the large, strategic reform that will take place in April 2002. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford has queried the extent of the increase in the tax charge that will arise for the highest business users. Even after the increases, those who drive 18,000 business miles or more a year will continue to enjoy a substantial discount from the full charge on 35 per cent. of the car's price. Instead of the two thirds discount, they will benefit from a four sevenths discount and will still be charged on only three sevenths of the full charge. That is twice the discount that will be received by people who drive between 2,500 and 18,000 business miles a year and who will qualify for a two sevenths discount on the full charge.
<P>
The net result of the clause is to reduce slightly the incentive to drive unnecessary extra business miles. That will help, in a modest way, to ease urban congestion, reduce pollution and, above all, pave the way for radical reform in 2002. The increase to 15 per cent. lessens the tax incentive for the highest business mileage drivers to drive extra unnecessary business miles. Limiting the increase to 13 per cent. as proposed in the amendment would, albeit marginally, increase the incentive and eliminate the environmental benefit.
<P>
Against that broad background, I hope that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will withdraw his amendment. If not, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I should at least thank the Economic Secretary for conceding that it might be desirable to provide more detail on the Government's replacement for the system, and for undertaking to consider whether to issue that in a consultation paper. However, my welcome extends that far and no further.
<P>
The debate revealed the extraordinary consequences of the Governments intentions. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood clearly set out, there is a good reason for the tax system to recognise those people who receive a company car because they are required to travel a large number of business miles rather that those who get a car as a perk of what is often a large salary. For the Government to change the tax system so that people who get BMWs, Porsches and Mercedes as part of their salary pay less and the poor old travelling salesmen and others who have to use their cars for business purposes pay more, is perverse. It flies in the face of everything that we were led to believe the Government supported. That is curious.
<P>
The amendment would make a minor change. It would reduce in a small part the large increase that is being levied on those who use their cars to travel more than 18,000 miles for business reasons. It seems to us and, indeed, to the professional bodies that I mentioned earlier, unfair that people who need their cars most should pay the greater part of the increase. I am sorry to disappoint the Economic Secretary, but I an unconvinced by her response.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Jack:</B> A query about the clause is running around my mind. The clause deals with the use of motor vehicles for business and pleasure purposes, but it omits to reflect the Government's previous policy towards the use of ministerial cars. When the Government were in opposition, they voted against tax proposals that dealt favourably with that matter. Why have not they chosen the clause as a suitable vehicle to enact the policy that they espoused when they were in opposition?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. Gentleman made it clear that the matter has nothing whatever to do with the clause. I enjoy the benefit of being driven in a ministerial car, but it is not provided for my private use. No taxable benefit therefore arises, and the matter is wholly outside the scope of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Economic Secretary confirm that her ministerial car takes her from her place of abode to her place of work? Under Inland Revenue rules, that is normally regarded as a private benefit.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As far as I can see--I have discussed the matter with Treasury officials--the real reason for providing a car to drive me from my home to my place of work is to transport not me but the red boxes, which I am not allowed to carry on public transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> This is the right moment to discuss this matter, which I raised because the Economic Secretary talked about measures in the tax system that seek to reduce unnecessary mileage.
<P>
In his laser-like, incisive way, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, went to the heart of the matter. When the Economic Secretary was in opposition, she sought, as a point of principle, to amend the Conservative Government's tax policies, and the then opposition voted solidly against our proposals. If this matter was a point of principle, why has she not put principle into practice and reversed the tax proposals relating to the use of ministerial cars? It was her party's policy to disagree with the Conservative Government's stand on the matter.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes it clear that the Opposition expect to be out of office for a very long time. I shall take the precaution of studying the debate to which he referred in Hansard.
<P>
I reiterate the point that, in the eyes of the Inland Revenue, a Minister is merely an appendage to the red box, and the purpose of the journey in the ministerial car is to carry it. Left to my own devices, I would travel by bus from my London home to the Treasury, but given that the red box travels by car, it is more sensible to travel with it. None the less, I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to that point.
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will have observed that, unlike the carbon monoxide, my patience has not been exhausted, but we should draw this boxing match to a conclusion.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 44 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 45</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision and support of bus services</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 24, line 21, leave out 'large'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 133, in page 24, line 24, leave out ' 'large' '.
<P>
No. 93, in page 24, line 25, leave out '17' and insert '9'.
<P>
No. 134, in page 24, line 25, leave out '17' and insert '12'.
<P>
No. 160, in page 24, line 25, leave out '17' and insert '8'.
<P>
No. 161, in page 24, line 25, leave out '17' and insert '10'.
<P>
No. 94, in page 25 line 20, leave out '17' and insert '9'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am pleased to speak to amendments Nos. 132, 133 and 134, and I hope that it will be convenient also to discuss amendment No. 135.
<P>
The clause could prove a wise fiscal and environmental measure, but its conditions are excessively burdensome and unnecessary. That opinion is shared by, among others, the Law Society, the Confederation of British Industry, the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Directors.
<P>
Our amendments are a sincere attempt to help the Government to make the most of the clause. The requirement for a bus to have at least 17 seats is far too stringent. Some members of the Committee represent rural constituencies in which, often, there is no public transport but which contain a number of small businesses that employ far fewer than 17 people. Amendments Nos. 132, 133 and 134 would ensure that, to qualify for exemption, a vehicle need not be a 'large' bus but could be a road passenger vehicle with a seating capacity of 12 or more. Therefore, a minibus would qualify but virtually all private vehicles would not. The Inland Revenue is concerned that company directors might abuse the relief by transporting themselves to and from work with few or no employees on board. The amendment would ensure that any such abuse would, at worst, be trivial.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendments as a sincere endeavour to make the clause and the exemption workable and sensible.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) expressed a wish to discuss amendment No. 135. He will note from the selection list that it is included in the next group of amendments, and I shall ensure that he may speak to it at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mr. Cook.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I tabled my amendments to explore the logic in clause 45. Why have the Government decided that the provision should relate, in definitional terms, to buses described as 'large'? The definition of a large bus is 17 seats, but I can find no reason why that number has been chosen. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would assist me in the matter.
<P>
In more general terms, one can understand why, in certain circumstances, especially in a rural environment, the provision of a bus paid for by an employer to assist employees to get to work could be beneficial. However, in the context of a rural environment, a bus that can be described to the common observer as large might be an inappropriate vehicle to conduct the journeys in question. Equally, by delineating the size of bus as one with 17 seats or more, the Government might rule out a whole category of potential passengers who might want to take advantage of the tax benefit.
<P>
When we debate the clause--should you allow a clause stand part debate, Mr. Cook--there may be an opportunity to debate the policy that underlies the proposal. I am anxious that we should not deny people in rural environments the opportunity to have a subsidised bus service but, by using the word, 'large' and specifying 17 seats, we risk doing that.
<P>
I am sure that the Economic Secretary is aware that the Government have embarked on a consultation exercise on their rural policy. The Government say that they have spent some £50 million on improving rural bus services. It would therefore be odd if, as a result of this proposal, they delivered a slap in the face to the benevolent employer in a rural environment who wishes to provide a subsidised bus service for his employees. As a result of the proposal, such an employer will find that, because of the artificiality of the delineation of size as a bus with 17 seats and the word, 'large', he can effectively rule out the possibility of a concession.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would say, first, how the Government decided on that number and, secondly, whether any consideration was given to the economic impact of the proposal, especially in the rural situation and on small employers. I believe that the majority of companies employ about 20 employees, so the microbusiness that the Government seek to encourage might be adversely affected by the measure.
<P>
I recognise that the Government have to stop people using private cars to gain some sort of concession. That is accepted, even in this day and age of the stretch limo. In addition, I can understand why some distinction must be drawn between a bus and a car. However, a minibus and a driver providing the type of service that I have outlined would come within the definition of a public service vehicle. Under the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981, a motor vehicle adapted to carry more than eight passengers and a driver is defined as a bus. I cannot understand why that definition could not have been used. My amendments include a range of numbers, so that the Government might consider at leisure a revision of the clause, in order to rule out cars but to rule in the examples that I have given.

<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I have similar concerns to those that have already been expressed by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon was perhaps being a little charitable to the Government because I believe that the way in which the relief has been qualified arouses the suspicion that it is a gimmick and a piece of propaganda, which is typical of the Government. The measure is so severely limited that it will be of no practical benefit. As the CBI said, it is a welcome relief, but it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'has been made subject to excessively burdensome and unnecessary condition.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Government are serious about granting relief for benefits of this kind, they should look carefully not only at this group of amendments but at the next two groups, to which we shall come shortly.
<P>
This group of amendments addresses the concern caused by the Government's decision to limit the relief to buses with more than 17 seats. As both the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon and my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde said, it seems extraordinary that the Government have chosen that figure, which will exclude a large number of buses that are genuinely provided, for instance, by small businesses to transport their employees.
<P>
Whether the figure that will substitute for 17 should be 12, as the Liberal Democrats propose, eight or 10--my Right hon. Friend has offered both alternatives--or nine, as we suggest, is a matter for debate. The Law Society has suggested 12 because it would mirror the provision in group 8 of schedule 8 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994, as has the Institute of Directors. However, our proposal to replace 17 with the figure nine is supported by the CBI, which points out that nine persons is the public service vehicle licensing threshold. The Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'We believe that a more sensible limit is nine people, which we believe is the level beyond which a Public Service Vehicle licence is needed.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation makes the same point and also supports our suggestion of nine.
<P>
We need not spend a great deal of time discussing whether nine or 12 is the right figure, or indeed eight or 10. The one thing the Opposition Members agree on is that 17 is the wrong figure, because it will limit the relief to very few beneficiaries. As the Government have offered no explanation for the figure of 17, Opposition Members are profoundly suspicious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I do not like to upset my hon. Friend's clear enunciation of his argument, but is he aware that there is a little cloud on the horizon that might upset his point? As I understand it, consultation on a European bus and coach directive is likely to define a small bus as one that seats fewer than 23 passengers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> From any other body I would say that that was extraordinary, but, coming from Europe, it is no surprise. However, I am extremely grateful to my Right hon. Friend for pointing it out. Perhaps he is suggesting that we should be grateful that the Government are not following the European example and defining a bus as one with 23 seats rather than 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I raised that point because we are debating the figure of 17. The question that the Economic Secretary may like to ponder is whether the provision in the Bill could be made redundant if the European directive came into force.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> That is another interesting point and I look forward to hearing the Economic Secretary's answer. It will not be the first time that the Government have been implementing one provision in a Finance Bill at the same time as the European Union has been discussing something that entirely contradicts it. We might even come to that  later today, although, in view of the progress that we are making at the moment, I am not sure that we shall.
<P>
I do not wish to prolong the debate. It is clear that all Opposition Members believe that 17 is not the right figure. I hope that the Economic Secretary will genuinely consider our helpful suggestion that it should be replaced either by nine, as we would prefer, or by any of the figures suggested by Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been an interesting, brief debate, and I hope that I shall be able to give the Committee some help.
<P>
The clause exempts employees from tax on the benefit of a free or cheap, employer-provided works bus or of a subsidy that employers pay to a bus operator for their employees' commuting journey. The clause uses the definition of a 'large' bus--the ability to carry 17 or more seated passengers--in the Transport Act 1985.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The reason for a high seating test is to prevent the exemption being siphoned off, notably to family companies where husband and wife directors--there are many thousands of such companies--provide themselves with a large family vehicle via the company to take the two of them to and from work. An ordinary car made available by the employer to the employee for private use would remain within the company car tax charge, which this clause does not affect. However, some vehicles such as large people movers, might fall outside the company car tax charge if they are not 'commonly used' as private cars. Thus a much lower seating test could enable the vehicle both to qualify as a bus for this exemption and to escape the company car tax charge. I am sure that Opposition Members share our desire to avoid that.
<P>
The Committee may be interested in some figures. The annual taxable benefit of a perk company car costing £25,000, which is available for private use, would be £8,750, which if the directors are higher-rate payers, would result in a tax of £3,500 a year. The incentive for avoidance is quite high.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Fylde and others mentioned, several representations have been received, suggesting that the 17-seat test is too high and that the risk of tax leakage is small, particularly in view of the public bus service exemption. Therefore, I can readily promise the Committee that we will reflect further before Report to establish whether some relaxation can be made. I happily undertake to examine whether we need any minimum seating requirement for public bus service subsidy. At this stage, I cannot say for sure that it will be possible to bring down the works bus seating minimum to as low as nine seats, which could involve people mover vehicles and the avoidance danger to which I referred, but I will certainly examine the matter in more detail.
<P>
It has been suggested that reducing the seating minimum to nine seats is perfectly safe because a passenger carrying vehicle licence is always required for anyone driving a vehicle with nine or more passenger seats. I have inquired about that and I understand that that is not the case and that a private individual not operating a bus service could own and drive a nine-seat vehicle without a special licence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary makes an important point. In her further reflections, would she consider including in the exemption the type of vehicle that she describes, so long as it is operated for hire or reward?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That seems a helpful suggestion and I will reflect further on it.
<P>
As I said, between now and Report, I shall look further into what relaxations may be feasible in the seating tests and, in particular, into whether it has any relevance to the subsidised public bus exemption.
<P>
I should also like to deal with an issue brought to my attention by my hon. Friend and the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), who, unfortunately, cannot be with us this morning because of his duties on a Select Committee. He asked whether the subsidy could be provided by employers other than directly to the transport company--to the passenger transport executive, which could then broker the necessary arrangements with one or more transport companies. I shall also reflect further on that and decide whether an amendment can be made later.
<P>
On that basis, I ask the Member for Torridge and West Devon to withdraw the amendment. If he presses it to a Division, I must ask my hon. Friends to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I welcome what the Economic Secretary said. This clause is a step in the right direction and we support the thrust of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I was worried to hear about the Economic Secretary's desire to travel to the Treasury by bus. Will the clause give the Government the opportunity to have a ministerial minibus that is large enough to carry Ministers and their red boxes? They could use it to make a contribution and to reflect the environmental aspects of taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Economic Secretary's remarks were helpful. She has listened to my views and has studied the representations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Malden and East Chelmsford. Therefore, I do not intend to press my amendments to a vote. I look forward to the Economic Secretary's further observations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I rise with renewed enthusiasm after the extraordinary success we had on the previous group of amendments. Let us hope that the Economic Secretary continues to be open minded. 
<P>
The amendments drew attention to a ludicrous restriction on the relief that we believe the Government cannot intend. Subsection (1) will add a new section 197AA to the Taxes Act 1988. Subsection (3) of that defines a qualifying journey as one made between the home and the workplace or between one workplace and another. It is strange that the Government intend that employees will benefit from the relief only if the bus taking them to work should draw up outside their front door. They will have to travel the whole distance by bus, rather than, as is more likely, go to a specific stopping-off point.
<P>
It is unlikely that a bus would go round to everyone's house if the employees live in rural areas. It is much more likely that employees would catch it at a specific point. They would then travel to the workplace. The purpose of the amendment is simple. It would allow such a journey to qualify for the relief.
<P>
To support the amendment, I cite the Confederation of British Industry. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'The definition of 'qualifying journey'... would disqualify relief for an employee who makes part of his journey from home to work by train and the rest of that journey by works bus. We suggest that that result is not intended and that the restriction should be removed or amended so that a 'qualifying journey' includes part as well as the whole of the journey between home and work.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It adds that the amendment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'would cover the situation where an employee spent a night away from home and caught the works bus from a place other than his home.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This minor amendment is intended to make the relief apply to more realistic conditions than the narrow interpretation in the clause. I hope that the Economic Secretary will again be persuaded by our arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 135, which is self-explanatory. I hope that the Economic Secretary will agree that it is as sensible as its precursors. 
<P>
When two or more employees are taken to their workplace from a collection point, the amendment would ensure that relief from the benefits-in-kind legislation is provided. 
<P>
As I said, it is eminently sensible; it would reduce journeys and thus help to save the environment from pollution. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment or give us some comfort in that respect as they did in the previous debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I want to address some of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, and by my amendment. What worries me is the practicability of the proposals which are subject to what the Bill calls 'substantial compliance'. Those words might send a tremor through the potential providers of the relief.
<P>
I am concerned about the impact of the proposals on the rural environment. Is the benevolent employer likely to be reluctant to provide the service if he thinks that, on the odd occasion, a wife, child or some other person might jump on the bus and therefore corrupt its purity as a means of taking people from their home to their place of work? The Government claim that one of their objectives is to encourage and improve rural bus services. If an employer were prepared to make available such vehicles as may later be defined as a bus service, more flexible rules should be established. It should not be the reverse; a complex and inflexible set of rules.
<P>
It is disappointing that the concession is so tightly defined, and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I am worried about it.  There may be sense in having a collective point at which a group of employees get on the bus and go to their place of work, having left their cars in a town centre car park, for example. However under the proposal as drafted, the bus would have to tramp round picking up people on a long and circuitous journey. People might thus be put off providing the concession because it is impractical to do so. If the Economic Secretary is in reflective mode, she might think more carefully about the practical implications of the provision of a subsidised bus service.
<P>
Another thing that worries me about the proposal is that although on one hand the Government want to take cars off the road by providing services that meet people's requirements, on the other hand they are adding an inducement to an employer to provide the service in the first place, possibly at the expense of people using more environmentally friendly rail transport. One of the problems about the proposal is that we do not have an environmental cost-compliance assessment of the total impact of the proposal--as defined in clause 45 (3)--especially on the urban environment. There is real value in employer-subsidised rural bus services, but the definition in the proposal is so inflexible. That is why I tabled my amendment and why I support my hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
In the urban context, the proposal may have the undesired result of seducing companies to provide a perquisite in the form of a bus service, while taking people away from more environmentally friendly rail services. I should be grateful for the Economic Secretary's comments on the points that I have raised.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall try to keep the Committee happy in respect of these amendments--[Hon. Members: 'Hear, hear.'] when right hon. and hon. Members make commonsensical points I am always happy to consider them.
<P>
I appreciate the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford about an individual who takes the works bus service for only part of his commuting journey. I am glad to say that this point is already met in the clause, and that the amendment is unnecessary. The provision applies to a qualifying journey that is defined as a journey between the employee's home and his work place. I am advised that this already covers any element of the journey between these two qualifying destinations. There is no question of the Inland Revenue interpreting a provision, if a bus picks up an employee from somewhere other than directly from his doorstep--for example, the common car park, as the right hon. Member for Fylde suggested--or if it deposits an employee some little way from the work premises to deny relief. I hope that hon. Members accept my assurance that, on that point, the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
In amendment No. 162, the right hon. Member for Fylde suggests that the condition that the service must be substantially used for commuting journeys only may be unnecessarily rigorous in relation to the exemption for employer subsidies to public transport services. The amendment as drafted would go somewhat further: it would remove also the definition of 'employment' and 'workplace' and the provision setting out the starting date for this relief, so it is technically defective.
<P>
However, given that under the exemption in the clause, an employee would pay the same fare as a member of the public, I accept that there is no need to be concerned about the number of occasions, in addition to the ordinary commuting journey, that the employee also uses the service. I can certainly assure the Committee that there is no question of employers being expected to keep tabs on the number of times employees use the service for private journeys. I will of course consider between now and Report whether we can dispense with the compliance test in this leg of the exemption for buses. I hope therefore that the right hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw this amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 144 and 145 would extend the exemption to any journey by employees in a works bus which starts at the workplace and ends at a place where there are public shopping facilities. The hon. Gentleman for Maldon and East Chelmsford did not specifically discuss public shopping facilities, but I assume that the intention is to extend tax relief to local shopping trips. The amendment would be unlikely to achieve its aim because the condition that the journey would have to be in connection with the performance of the employment would still apply. However, the other difficulty is that it would go much further than the purpose of the tax relief that we are introducing for green transport plans. There is no case whatever for allowing relief for the benefit of a coach trip that takes employees on holiday in the United Kingdom simply because the destination has a shopping centre; there is even less justification for giving tax relief where the works bus is used for a holiday abroad to a place which has a shopping centre. However, that would the amendment's effect because if incorporates no geographical limit.
<P>
The substantially ordinary commuting test--the compliance test in the clause--would already allow occasional employees' journeys for non-qualifying purposes in the works bus. If, for example, an employee wanted to allow employees to take the works bus on a day off to go to the shops, that would not be a problem; the exemption would not be lost.  However we would not wish to go much further. I could not accept the board extension of relief that the amendments propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Can the Economic Secretary--given the little note of flexibility that was reflected in those final comments--tell me whether the facility of the subsidised bus would apply also in terms of clause 45 if occasionally people other than employees got on the bus to go from A to B because it was sensible to do so?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Yes, it would. In light of those assurances and explanations, I hope that the Right hon. Gentleman and hon. Gentleman will withdraw their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for that response.
<P>
We are not alone in our concern that the phrasing of the clause would allow the Inland Revenue to interpret it literally to mean that a qualifying journey would have to start at the front door of the employee's home.  However, I am encouraged by the Economic Secretary's explanation that that is not the case. Undoubtedly, Inland Revenue officials will hear about that and, applying the famous Pepper v. Hart doctrine, will start cursing as their plans will have  been thwarted by the Economic Secretary.
<P>
I do not wish to be churlish, as I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for clarifying the position. I am less happy with her response to our suggestion that the provision should extend to shopping trips. However, I accept her point, and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am going for a hat trick.
<P>
This group of amendments is intended to address the concern that the clause is narrowly drawn, suggesting that tax relief will be available only if employees use a bus to undertake a journey between their home and place of work. A number of those who made representations said that that is far too restrictive. I draw the Committee's attention to the CBI's representation, in which it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'The use of the word 'only'...is too restrictive and impossible to police on any practical basis... why should the use of a works bus be denied to employees on the the basis that the employees would not be the 'only' persons using the service if, for instance, children of the workforce are allowed to be carried? Multi-occupancy would meet green objectives and in the cast of workforce children would be entirely consistent with good employer practice and the Government's broader aims of encouraging work by, for instance, provision of workplace creches.'
<P>

<P>
Other organisations expressed concern about the restriction. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said that there will be a substantial compliance test, and it also used the example of a bus being used to transport children to a workplace nursery, saying that relief would no longer be available under the clause. The IOCA gave other examples, such as sub-contractors using the bus to travel to their premises.
<P>
I do not want to go through examples quoted by professional bodies, as I am sure that the Economic Secretary and her officials will have studied them already. However, our amendments are sensible and would ensure that the clause reflects what the Government intend to achieve, rather than the much narrower restriction that appears to be there at the moment.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We are making such good progress on clause 45 that I am reminded of that famous song that every parent on the Committee will remember lovingly, 'The wheels on the bus go round and round.' The wheels on this Committee are going round and round very fast. [Interruption.] Hon. Members are not required to sing the song.
<P>
It is not entirely clear to me that either amendment is necessary. There may have been some misunderstanding among hon. Members and outside the House about the significance of the word 'only', which must be read in connection with the substantial compliance test that is also in the clause. The intention of the clause is that essentially, the service that attracts the new green tax relief should be used by employees for commuting journeys, but the exemption from tax will not be withdrawn where some non-qualifying journeys are also undertaken.
<P>
Of course it would make good sense to allow parents to bring their children with them for part or the whole of the journey, if that is convenient, where a work bus or a subsidised journey is provided. I readily undertake, as I have in relation to other parts of the clause, to look again at the wording before Report to see whether it has the effect that all members of the Committee intend or whether some clarification might assist. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for her response. The Opposition have done rather well this morning. Let us hope that we can continue in this spirit. I welcome the Government's undertaking to look at the matter and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I shall not spend much time on the clause, as it involves an incredibly narrow point. It exempts employees from tax on the benefit of employer-provided parking facilities for cycles and motor cycles. I am slightly surprised that employees were ever taxed on what must be an incredibly minor perk. If an Inland Revenue official was pursuing employees to that extent, he could surely have found better ways of spending his time. I should be interested to know how much the measure will cost and whether large numbers of employees really have to fill in tax returns listing the benefit of a parking facility for a motor cycle or bicycle.
<P>
The other point that I shall raise has been raised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The Minister will have seen it, and it deserves an answer. The institute points out that as a general rule it believes that tax legislation should be self-contained, and that cross-references to completely unrelated Acts should be avoided. It expresses disappointment that the definitions of motor cycle and cycle can be found only by in a completely different Act, and says that they should have been set out in full in the clause.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The clause is a tidying-up measure that we have taken the opportunity provided by green transport tax relief to introduce. At present the cost to an employer of providing work-place parking for employees' motor cycles or cycles is, strictly speaking, a taxable employee benefit. In practice it is extremely unlikely that any tax charge is ever taken, but green transport representatives and some employers have asked for confirmation that no tax charge would arise. I am happy that the clause puts that beyond doubt for the future and that more employees can be encouraged to cycle to work with the clear assurance that they will face no tax charge for bicycle parking facilities provided by their employers at or near their place of work.
<P>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point about legislating on a self-contained basis. That is not always possible, but the meaning, intention and effect of the clause are clear, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I wonder whether the Economic Secretary can help me. The clause refers to car parking spaces. I may be wrong, and I apologise in advance if I am, but I thought that we had not reached the situation in which companies providing car parking spaces were subject to tax. If I am right, can the Economic Secretary state whether the clause is the precursor to more unpalatable medicine in future, when the beneficiaries of car parking spaces will be subject to tax?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The wheels on the bike do not seem to go round as fast as the wheels on the bus. Clause 46 (1) states that car parking spaces are exempt from tax. For the avoidance of doubt, we are simply specifying that parking spaces for motor bikes and bicycles are also exempt from tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> For the sake of clarity of definition, will the Economic Secretary tell me how long, car parking spaces will remain exempt from tax?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I think that the right hon. Gentleman has in mind the proposals that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is introducing as part of the integrated transport package. Clause 46 and the equivalent provisions for car parking spaces to which it refers deal with charges that might arise to income tax on a taxable benefit to employees. The provision is clearly spelt out in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Economic Secretary confirm that the Deputy Prime Minister does not have plans to tax car parking spaces? Her previous comments could be interpreted as meaning that he does.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is entirely a matter for the Deputy Prime Minister, and has nothing to do with the Finance Bill or the clause. However, to help the Committee on a matter that properly belongs elsewhere, the integrated transport White Paper which the Deputy Prime Minister published provides for local authorities to be given the power to levy a charge on workplace parking facilities. That would be part of the integrated transport package in a specific local area, designed to reduce congestion and increase the use of public transport. It has nothing to do with the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Cycles and cyclist's safety equipment</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 26, leave out lines 39 to 42.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 137, in page 27, leave out lines 1 to 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> This is the last of a small group of clauses illustrating the Government's environmental credentials. As previously, the conditions attaching to it are enormously restricted and will reduce considerably the real benefit. According to the Inland Revenue press release, the clause will encourage employers to establish green transport plans and help employees to travel to work without using their cars. We are told that employers will also benefit from the reduced paperwork.
<P>
However, as with workplace parking spaces for bicycles, the amount saved will be incredibly small; one estimate is that the maximum saving will be £24 a year. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would say a little more about the extent to which the present tax system results in people paying as a consequence of the benefit, and what the proposed measure will cost.
<P>
The clause is drawn in such a restricted way that it is impractical. The bicycle can only be used for qualifying journeys between the home and the workplace or between one workplace and another, and no private mileage is envisaged. A compliance test is attached, and it seems that the employer and the employee will have to keep a record of total mileage, and how much of it is for business use. That raises the question or whether the burden of complying with the restrictions on the benefit may outweigh the worth of the benefit itself.
<P>
I also doubt whether employers will provide bicycles, which cost between £200 and £300, if, as we understand, the clause requires them to be made available to all employees. Some employees will not wish to benefit from a bicycle. Perhaps a bicycle would be of little value to them. As we said earlier, some of those employees may enjoy the benefit of a company car. The amendment would delete the subsection that requires the benefit to be offered generally to employees, which is unduly restrictive. Allowing employers to offer bicycles to employees who would benefit, and for whom bicycle use would be most sensible, would be helpful. I hope that the Economic Secretary will accept the Opposition's suggestion, which is made in the spirit of trying to improve the clause.

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> We support the aims of the clause, which exempts bicycles provided by employers for employees from the benefits in kind legislation. It also provides for employees who travel to and from work on their own bicycles to claim capital allowances on the cost of bicycles that they purchased themselves. I hope that the Economic Secretary, will agree that amendment No. 137 is sensible. I also sympathise with the intentions behind amendment No. 143.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 would omit subsection (4), which is a preposterous provision. Who is supposed to supervise and ensure compliance, and how are they supposed to do it? That is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<P>
Will the Economic Secretary confirm that a bicycle is a long-life asset for the purposes of capital allowances, and that capital allowances will be available to employers on the purchase of bicycles to be lent to their employees.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I hope that I can assure hon. Gentlemen that their amendments are not necessary, or that they might have undesirable consequences. The purpose of clause 47 is simple. It ensures that no tax will be charged where an employer provides cycling or related equipment for employees to use to commute to work. That is part of the green commuting plans. There is no intention to withdraw the relief if the employee also uses the bike or other equipment for private or leisure use. That will not happen. The main test should be that the bike is used for commuting, and the exemption will remain so long as that condition is met. Employers will not be expected to check up on their employees' other cycling journeys.
<P>
The main intention behind the exemption is to encourage green commuting, and it is important to signal that clearly in the conditions for relief. If we did not do that--if proposed new subsection (4) were deleted, as the amendments propose--tax relief might be given for the provision of a bicycle, although the relevant employee continued to commute to work by private car. No green transport commuting benefit would result, in which case there is no reason why the tax relief should be available.
<P>
Our discussion about cycling equipment is a recap of our debate about computer equipment, when we discussed whether it should be possible for the directors of a company to introduce a discriminatory scheme of which they were the sole or main beneficiaries. In relation to the clause, it might help if I referred to section 197G of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which deals with employee benefits. That section provides an exemption for sporting and recreational facilities that are made available to employees if those facilities are generally available. In practice, that means that they should be open to employees generally on a non-discriminatory basis; it does not mean that every employee should be able to use the facilities at the same time.
<P>
A similar arrangement applies to the bicycle exemption. Of course we shall not require an employer who wants to provide a bike for an employee to provide one for every employee. That would be absurd. An employer can decide for himself to what extent he can provide bicycles for his staff, and they will decide to what extent they want to take up that offer. We do not want tax relief to be available for schemes that are deliberately discriminatory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Economic Secretary may be aware that some rail companies propose to offer bicycles for hire in London stations. People who do not want to take their bike on the train but want to cycle from the station to work will be able to do so. Would that service be discriminatory between different employees, and would it not, therefore, be subject to tax relief?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It is always a pleasure to hear from the Conservative Whip, from whom we have not heard this morning. He raises an intriguing point. I shall check on the position and answer him later. I believe that bicycles will count as plant and machinery, and that the normal capital allowances will be available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her reply. I omitted to ask her to confirm that safety equipment will qualify, along with bicycles.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Yes, I understand that that is the case.
<P>
I hope that Opposition Members are assured that the amendments are not necessary. The clause will have the desired effect of extending tax relief and it will put at rest the minds of employers and employees who fear that if cycling equipment were made available by employers, it would not under the present system, attract tax relief. There is no estimate of the current yield from the present tax system, but I suspect that it is negligible. We should ensure that the situation relating to tax exemption for the provision of bikes and cycling equipment is completely clear. The clause does that, and I hope that the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The Economic Secretary admitted that the proposal is a gimmick--she said that the tax raised will be negligible. On our calculation, on a bicycle costing £300, assuming 50 per cent. business use and 50 per cent. private use, the tax saving would be about £15 a year for a higher-rate taxpayer or £7 for a 20 per cent. taxpayer. One professional accountant told us that the reliefs are 'embarrassing'. 
<P>
However, I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for her comments on our arguments, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
