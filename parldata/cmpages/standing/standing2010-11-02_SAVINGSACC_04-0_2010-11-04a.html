                           </span> Welcome to another of our
witness sessions. We are nearing the end now, but I hope that you can
contribute to our discussion in a fruitful way. I would like to start
by asking about the objectives of the child trust fund and whether you
think that they have been met. The first objective was to encourage a
general saving culture, particularly for those on lower incomes. The
second objective was to put in place an asset for all children at the
age of 18. May we start with Sian from Toynbee Hall? Is the child trust
fund meeting those objectives?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000015">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On putting in place assets for young
people, absolutely. It is a given programme—you cannot opt out
of it. So, even though there has been some research to show that
take-up rates by parents, in terms of active involvement, are not as
high as we might have hoped for—although the figures are quite
high compared to other savings programmes—because it is a given
programme, you are automatically enrolled. So, from the very beginning
we know that every child benefits in some way. In terms of
contributions from parents and family members, obviously there is a
broad range. Early activity in the programme showed that 18% of
low-income families were contributing in some way to the child trust
fund. While that fluctuated over the programme itself, we do know that
having match funding and a process where people could see
something—a physical asset—rather than just having some
tax relief or something that they could not quite get their heads
around, was a really important step in changing people’s
understanding of saving. It moved people away from thinking that
savings

                           </div>were out of their domain and that contributing to savings was an
impossible dream. It actually helped people move on to a place where
they could see that something tangible was being formed and they could
put that aside for their children. In terms of behavioural economics,
it was a very important programme. While I would say that not every
family contributed and not every child’s trust fund was being
built up on an equal basis, every child was
benefiting.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000016">&#160;</a>

real concern around the removal of the child trust fund is not across
the whole population; it is for the lowest income groups. We really
believe that, for that particular income group, from 16 to 18 years was
a really important time to have no assets to fall back on. That really
puts people in a difficult position. It reduces their opportunities,
and we think the child trust fund was really effective in tackling
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000017">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Certainly not. I would agree, but I have a
couple of points. First, we have to remember that the child trust fund
is still in its infancy. The oldest accounts have been open for only
eight years and one eighth of all accounts have been open for less than
a year. Looking at the aggregate numbers of people who have saved into
them could be misleading at this stage, because many of these accounts
have not been open for very long. If the programme had been allowed to
build up to its full course, we probably would have found a greater
proportion of parents saving into those
accounts.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
although we can never know for sure, there is certainly evidence from
some of the providers that some of the savings that are going into
these accounts—around one in four does get extra
savings—are new and additional savings that have been generated
by the existence of child trust funds. If we compare child trust funds
with something like the individual savings accounts, certainly the
evidence is that most ISA savings are, in fact, just savings that would
have been made anyway and are put into ISAs for the tax relief. With
the child trust fund, it seems that we are, in some cases, generating
additional
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000020">&#160;</a>

extent. I agree with Tony that these things have had quite a short
lifespan, so we cannot say that things would not have improved, but
child trust funds disproportionately favour the middle classes or, in
other words, people who are usually more financially
literate—not always,
obviously.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000022">&#160;</a>

opened 75% of vouchers issued and, of those, 99% have not received the
maximum funding available. Therefore, it is not those on the lowest

Yes, a quarter of accounts have received additional deposits, but that
means that three quarters have failed to receive additional deposits. I
think a lot of people say, “Thank you very much.” but I
do not agree that it is necessarily changing behaviour where it matters
most, which is where people have fewer assets to look forward to when
the child is

fact that, at the end of the day, it is a transfer of money, which is
not necessarily the best way to tackle poverty. The approach of
tackling poverty by transferring money seemed to be the characteristic
of the previous Government. Frankly, we need to tackle the root causes
of poverty and make sure that the people know how to use money that is
redistributed—I do not to want say “wisely,”
because that is terribly patronising. We are talking about young people
at age 18 living on rough estates where there is addiction, educational
failure and serious personal debt. I would be much more inclined to go
with programmes that are really well targeted financial initiatives,

are concerned that if they would like to be able to study or go into
some kind of training, they will not have any money to support
themselves, or their family will need them to get a low-paid

giving them an asset with which they can do something when they reach
18. It may be some extra education or training, or something as simple
as being able to afford driving lessons, which will give them a better
chance in the job market. Even the double amount of the child trust
fund—£500 at birth, £500 at age seven—is
not enough to lift them out of poverty, but it may be enough to give
them an extra chance. Not every child will be inclined to take that
extra chance, but some may, and that is the beauty of the

assess a family situation and say that they need to decide between
feeding their children properly, creating a safe environment for them
to live in that is damp-free, mould-free and free from fear of gas

problem. It is about much more than whether we need a child
trust fund. I really agree with your comments, Dr Callan, that there we
are looking at adequate income levels and poverty. I do not think that
most families are making a choice between feeding their children and
creating a savings base. The child trust fund is not taking money from
feeding children; it is creating an opportunity for parents and other
family members to lock some assets away.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000045">&#160;</a>

provide a living wage. For some families they will; for others they
will not. Each family is in an individual situation—I apologise
for my croaky voice—and it is about providing families not only
with the skills and the knowledge but the tools to make those choices.
We work with lots of low-income families who are incredibly careful and
incredibly capable with their money, and some of them are able to
save—not necessarily for the long term, but they make very good
short-term saving options. However, we also need to make sure that
people have access to other services, such as affordable credit, so
that they can smooth consumption and continue to save on the side. For
example, giving people access to credit union facilities would be
excellent. I am not saying that we should lose the child trust fund,
but if we do, I would like to see some real thought given to
alternatives and making them
available.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000047">&#160;</a>

that the child trust fund is designed to run for 18 years. We should
not assume that families will be able to save into the child trust fund
every year, but we would hope that every family would, at some point
during those 18 years, be in a position to save, because they were in
work, had a windfall or had a reason to save some money. They are not
forced to save, and they are certainly not forced to save every year.

encourage them to put away some money in a good

I absolutely agree with you about the importance of financial education
and the range of policies that we are deploying to support people in
low-income households in particular. It was suggested to us in an
earlier evidence session that one way of engaging young people with
financial education was to do it when they had a lump of money that was
theirs. That would enable them to think about their savings and
spending habits in a way that had some reality for them. To what extent
do all the witnesses think that giving a young person aged 18 a lump of
money will support their engagement in financial education,
particularly in their teen
years?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000049">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We work with young people in further
education, and we work a lot with young people who are opening their
very first bank account and getting their educational allowance, and
who have some real money to work with. If you put the child trust fund
to one side and look at a young person who has their hands on some
money that has come their way, you will see that they are so focused on
asking: “How do I make that money go as far as possible? What
can it do for
me?”<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
our programme, which we run across London, started out just teaching
financial education in the classic sense of saving, borrowing and so
on. We are redesigning the programme, though, because so many people
come back to us and say, “Brilliant, you taught me how to make
this money go as far as possible, but now I want you to teach me how I
can use this money to leverage, to create more income opportunities. I
want to do better, and having this money gives me an opportunity

			Column number: 107<a class="bkMark" name="Column107">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to do that.” I absolutely agree with you that the moment when you
really engage people is when they come to you and say, “I have
this financial concern”, or this asset, debt or
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000051">&#160;</a>

I also believe that we should have financial education in schools as
part of the national curriculum. The Consumer Financial Education Body,
which aims to educate every adult, is one way of doing it, but a much
better, cheaper and more effective alternative is to educate every
child about the issues. That would not rule out the need to work with
young people, because I think you learn at different stages and in
different ways. Our experience with young people with the educational
allowance shows us that it would be extremely effective if you worked
on money with young people as they take it out of the child trust fund,
because then it is real and means
something.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000052">&#160;</a>

they are getting is basically a handout. If we are trying to tackle
dependency culture through welfare reform, I would prefer it if we
helped parents to help their children by saying, “You’ve
got a job,” rather than just giving them a handout. For so many
children, their babysitting money or whatever is just discretionary
income. If parents are giving pocket money, they could reduce it as
their children earn a bit of money. Teaching those kinds of things
creates a real sense of achievement for having earned their own income.

the inequality in asset holding, which feeds through to inequality in
opportunity for young people at age 18? With all its imperfections,
delivering a lump sum to young people at age 18—and a larger
lump sum, in terms of the Government’s contribution for the
poorest young people—partly addresses that. If you leave it to
the will and wish of parents and financial education alone, you will
continue to see a significantly uneven playing field when young people
reach age
18.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000054">&#160;</a>

is assumed that the family will not train them in these skills. We need
children to learn good financial skills. We often need to help parents
from every part of the income spectrum, who can often struggle with
good financial management. You cannot make people do it. As for debt
counselling, we have the My Home Finance scheme set up by the

that help to try to ensure that children have a good start in life. I
want to ask the witnesses whether they would put the child trust fund
ahead of these other choices: protecting the NHS budget; increasing the
number of health visitors; free prescriptions for pregnant women; the
Healthy Start programme, which gives vouchers for milk and fruit to
certain categories of people; the £500 Sure Start maternity
grant for the first child; extending nursery education for

things—£500 million-worth—that could be cut. When
the Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced this policy, said that
his reason for getting rid of child trust funds was because it was
wrong to borrow to give an asset to a child. He was not actually
comparing this with any other item of spending at all. He was taking
the opposite view and saying, “This is money we are borrowing to
give to children.” I disagree with that as well, because he is
hypothecating borrowing to a certain line of spending, and that is
something that we have never done in this country either. I just think
it is wrong. There is £500 million-worth of other

of the matter. It is recognising that, over the lifetime of a child
trust fund account for an individual family, they can make
contributions as and when they can, and that builds up opportunity in
the form of a cash account for a child to make some serious choices
about their future when they reach 16 to 18. It is about empowerment
and recognising that while we can try to tackle long-term unemployment,
and long-term issues around inequalities in income, health and
education opportunity, we could create an opportunity for a child to
have a wider range of choices, and the family could contribute to that;
it does not all have to come from the state, but the state can support
that choice. That is a long-term strategy. Are we now saying that we
cannot afford to invest in the future?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000067">&#160;</a>

me, the nub of this matter is lower-income families, children at risk
and those who do not have strong family support mechanisms. I am not
going to argue in this economic climate that we need to protect the
child trust fund in its entirety, but I am concerned that in five or 10
years’ time, we will have done nothing to tackle the
inequalities that already exist and are worsening. We know that they
will get worse. If you look back at every recession, we see that
inequalities widen. If you look at the reports from King’s
college, London, you will see that that matters to everybody, not just
the poorest people but also the most well-off in society. This is part
of a long-term solution.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000068">&#160;</a>

was said, but I would add that when looking at savings
policy—this applies to pensions, the child trust fund and any
savings—evidence suggests that stability is to be welcomed. One
of the many things that put people off saving is the continual chopping
and changing of the rules. We are drifting slightly off the point, but
any survey of why people do not save enough for their pensions will
tell you that there is no trust that the rules will not change between
now and when someone retires, and that the savings might not be
worthless. Changing things like the child trust fund, and chopping and
changing the rules, affects the behaviour of people who are saving for
their children, and it will also affect the behaviour of people saving
for their pensions.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000069">&#160;</a>

Graham Allen looked at early intervention in Nottingham, and there was
a kind of circle of interventions at different points over
someone’s life course. You do not just do stuff in the first one
and a half to three years, because there are all the children who have
already come through that phase. All the interventions that Graham is
working on in Nottingham are about helping young people to prepare for
parenthood, if they are at a later stage in their life

we want to send. People are getting a lump-sum, gratis payment, but we

The child trust funds cost us £500 million a year. Some
witnesses have given the view that, despite its being a universal
benefit, much of the money, potentially millions of pounds, goes to
young people who already have a nest egg, but that is a price worth
paying, so children from low-income families receive what you called a
“handout” at 18, although they may have had no engagement
with the process on the way. Do you think that that is a price worth
paying, or should we be looking to invest the money differently, or at
least invest what money we have, bearing in mind our financial
constraints?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000076">&#160;</a>

understand that the child trust fund provides an asset, but, equally,
it is supposed to get engagement with financial institutions. We have
heard that a lot of parents do not engage with financial

the child engage with financial institutions at the age of 18, the
child trust fund will put them in a better position than their parents
are because they will lose their fear of financial
institutions?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000079">&#160;</a>

Ask me again in 12 years’ time and I might be able to give you
an answer on whether they have achieved that aspiration. I have always
been more sceptical of the financial education and engagement arguments
for child trust funds, albeit, as you will have gathered, I am a strong
supporter of them for other reasons. On financial education, yes, the
child having a fund that you can point to as an example will help with
savings and interest rates, but financial education is about a lot more
than savings and interest rates. It is about debt,

some fantastic programmes, our own and other people’s, which

and money management. For young people in Britain in 2010 and 2011, you
would be better off with a computer game or a game at school, or a My
Money week or MyBnk going into schools—those things that the

know that many letters landing on the doorsteps of saving gateway
clients look as though they come from the taxman, and no one willingly
opens a letter from the taxman. We did a lot of work around the saving
gateway and the child trust fund to try to explain to providers that if
they want to engage people in financial services and financial issues,
they need to do it in a way that means something, and is not
off-putting. With the child trust fund, I do not think that in itself,
it is an effective way of tackling the lack of engagement with
financial planning and financial services with young people and adults

at the end of my EMA I can move to earning my own income now that I am
engaging with money in a proactive way? I agree that we do not want to

matching assets. There is a lot of evidence from those studies—I
cannot quote off the top of my head, chapter and verse—that
shows that people who have built up an asset through savings in such
accounts are more likely in later life to own a business, to own their
own home, and to have gone through some training or other education
that gives them higher potential earnings. There is a lot of evidence
from the US that this works, but that evidence is in the case of
younger adults rather than children and, as I said, no one else has
tried child trust funds before.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000092">&#160;</a>

                           </em> If you are already on even the
bottom rung of the ladder, having an asset can help you claim, albeit
soft and slowly. However, we are particularly concerned about people
who are not on the ladder at all, and who have low capacities. We
talked a lot before the election about broken lives. I am concerned
that for people with broken lives—who have addicted parents,
have addictions themselves, or have educational
failure—maximising the benefit of an asset must feel like
climbing Everest. As I say, if you are on that bottom rung, being from
a poor background, but without those other disadvantages, perhaps you
can maximise the benefit of it, but is it necessarily helping those who
are most vulnerable? I am not
convinced.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000093">&#160;</a>

Williams:</strong>
                           </em> The potential is that the saving gateway,
as a concept around tempting people away from believing that there is
no way to save or to find money to do things, actually has a real
impact and a real benefit. It means that making a small sacrifice by
finding something from my budget to save brings me something greater
back. There is potential in that, but there are also some serious
potential flaws in the programme. We severely underestimate resistance
in every part of the population to changing our financial behaviour.
The education programme that was going to be linked to the saving
gateway savings mechanism was extremely important. I hoped
that, through the saving gateway, we would be engaging families in
discussions of their choices about money for today and for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
saw the saving gateway as having two outcomes. Although I have just
said that, in my opinion, the child trust fund played no role in
educating young children about money, I believe that the saving gateway
would have played a role in creating a specific opportunity for
conversations with low-income families around choices on what they
spend today and what they save today. The other outcome that I was
looking for was that, through this scheme, low-income families would be
significantly encouraged to save. For me, the crucial factor is not
only building up a savings base, but providing an alternative to
high-cost credit.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
run the illegal money lending team for London. I see the
damage from people having to access high-cost credit to live so as to
compensate for some blip, which might be the loss of a job, the loss of
casual earnings, a problem caused by the overpayment of benefits being
clawed back, illness in the family, the cooker blowing up or anything.
With even a small pot of money, a family could choose to go to that
first, or could use that to take to a credit union to access low-cost,
or lower-cost, credit rather than being forced to use high-cost credit.
That, for me, had a significant potential to change the long-term flow
of money within a family. That was really important to me. There is an
asset base, there is education, but there is also giving people choices
around where they get their money to pay for things today. They would
have this little asset built up that they could use, because they could
take money out of the saving gateway pot and put it back in. That was
the great thing about it—the money was not locked in, the system
was
flexible.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000109">&#160;</a>

perfect. I would change many things about it. I am in favour of the
fundamental concept of working with people to build up a savings pot to
change people’s behaviour. One of the things that we see on
financial exclusion—this applies not only to the saving gateway
but to so many aspects of accessing, using and managing money in this
country—is that, despite the common goal, too many people are
excluded from good financial services. If you are going to make a
scheme such as the saving gateway relevant and accessible, you have to
have as many access points as possible. I absolutely agree with

have the potential to save and we have been working to find out what

where they would like to have their savings. There is a very clear
generation gap around the age of 40. If you ask anyone over the age of

people—irrespective of income—you have got to see a
significant benefit to change your behaviour. Just knowing something
factually is not enough. Behavioural economics comes into this with
real power. All our experience is that that matching element really
helps drag people out of thinking “I can’t save.
I’m not a saver. I’m not the kind of person that any
financial institution would have as a client,” to “You
know what, that money really makes it worth altering the way I
think.” It will not work for everybody, but it will work for a
significant number of people. Given that we do not advocate that any
one policy will tackle poverty or financial exclusion, it is a useful
element of a toolkit. If you start to move below that level of the
matched funding—the 50p in the £1—you will see a
tailing off of its impacts. You will still reach some people with a
level of 25p in the £1, but you will not affect as many people.

high, other savings products were uncompetitive in comparison. There
was not much continuity to move on to other products. Some 98% of those
opening a saving gateway account already had an existing form of
account. There were three things that they were looking for in the
pilot. Did it get people to start saving? Did it get people to start
formalising their savings, instead of it just being under the mattress?
Did it increase financial education? When you look at the saving

was that the range of people who were allowed to take part in the
saving gateway 2 pilot was quite wide. It included not only people who
were eligible through being in receipt of certain benefits, but people
who received quite high incomes. It included individuals who earned up
to £25,000 and families who earned up to £50,000. I can
see how the potential shift that you described might happen, with
people saying, “I won’t put the money in the Post Office
or the bank. I’ll put it in the saving gateway because that is
giving me a better rate of interest.” However, my understanding
was that the saving gateway rollout would apply only to people on
benefits, who do not have those sorts of
choices.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000118">&#160;</a>

buy an Amazon Kindle. One person

to spend my pregnancy grant on a trip to a spa so that I could have a
baby bump massage, a manicure and a pedicure and just relax for a bit,
but everyone else is saving their money for the baby.” In other
words, she felt guilty because she was spending the money on something
that was somewhat to do with health in pregnancy, but many other people
were holding on to it for when the baby came along. I am just trying to
give a flavour of how incredibly badly targeted it was. One woman said,
“I bought some really nice shoes—and I’m not
talking booties—to treat myself.” Some said, “I
pay my taxes so I should jolly well get it,” whereas others
said, “I didn’t claim mine because I just couldn’t

frankly. If there is a problem with nutrition in pregnancy, it will not
be just about money. Often it is about not knowing how to cook
nutritiously. I am not saying that all poor people are rubbish
housekeepers, but quite the opposite—some of them would put us
all to shame. Some of the schemes that help the most disadvantaged
families teach them cooking and about all sitting down together to have
a meal. It might sound a bit paternalistic but, again, it is about the
early intervention. It is about what we do to help parents give their
children the best start in life. A lot of them will not have done
cooking in school. A lot of them will not have learnt from their mums
or dads how to cook. There is so much more we could do to make sure

frankly, because they want to buy their own brand new pram. Rather than
it being about the Government giving people money so that they can be
philanthropic—although I do not think it is particularly
philanthropic to do an NCT second-hand stall, but we tend to constantly
think that the Government must provide—why not have a big
society perspective that says, “Well, how about communities
contributing far more to enable people to afford stuff for their

healthy diet. As I say, I feel that the grant is not particularly
helpfully named, but what we also heard this morning was that by
delivering an extra lump of money to families, it supported
particularly low income families to spend their income in other ways,
including on the essentials of diet, heating the home and that kind of
thing. Given that I think Sian has said that perhaps some of these
benefits could have been more targeted, do you see a place for extra
financial support in the late stages of pregnancy that enables families
to meet the outgoings that are associated with being a
mum-to-be?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000133">&#160;</a>

despite all the laws is that pregnant mothers are most at risk of
losing employment. Anything that boosts a pregnant mother’s
income at a time when she has increased expenditure can only be
helpful. On the other hand, I also believe that it needs to be targeted
on those who need it. One of the difficulties about all of the three
programmes that we are discussing today is that they receive bad press
because they are not well targeted. That really matters to people in
today’s climate, because people feel every pound that is being
taken away from them. It does not matter whether it is being taken from
them through heavier taxes on a well-paid income—or a low-paid
income—or being taken from their benefits. So targeting is very
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000134">&#160;</a>

options available to that family. Are they living in good
accommodation? Is it well ventilated? Are they living in damp? Can they
turn the heating on? I support anything that supports those basic
needs, which include good nutrition, but I do not realistically expect
that young mother to go and spend all of that money on food. She is not
going to do that. The grant means that she will increase the money that
she spends on food by a percentage, but she will also be able to turn
up the heating, or take the bus to the health centre, rather than
having to
walk.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000135">&#160;</a>

just Mumsnet, which, you are right, is quite a middle-class
website—some people are spending their health in pregnancy grant
on a doula, which is somebody who is just a friend while you are giving
birth and during the first few weeks. In other words, they were saying
that it is not food, but support that they need. Maybe they are on
their own, or their partner or husband is not being very supportive, or
whatever, but those women actually wanted to spend the money on getting
something much richer, having a friend around. I think that it is very
valid to spend money on such community initiatives and other things

grant or low-cost loan, for young people who are making life choices at
16 to 18, and longer if possible. We have just seen the loss of the EMA

Although we are not a socialist country, we are a country that believes
in equal opportunities, and those opportunities are becoming ever more
unequal. So I feel passionately that, although we may lose the child
trust funds, we should at least give some consideration to how we
address that

                        <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
I would like to look at improving access to affordable credit. When
low-income families need to dip into credit, there should be a low-cost
system that does not lead to either the threat of having their legs
broken or being abducted by a loan shark, which we deal with on a daily
basis, or the less serious, but still long term, implications of
repaying interest over such a long period that they never get out of
debt. Looking at, for example, improving credit union access and
affordable credit access is key to tackling some of the inequalities
that will be worsened by the removal of the
programmes.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000142">&#160;</a>

the savings gateway, and we have just had a very interesting session on

We hope to introduce the junior ISA next autumn, but eligibility will
start from the moment the child trust fund terminates. So, there will
be a savings vehicle available for children as soon the CTF is turned
off. That is something that we are very keen to ensure, and it was one
of the factors that drove me when thinking about the policy design. It
was certainly a concern that was raised with me when I met stakeholders
earlier this year to discuss the replacement of the child trust
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000151">&#160;</a>

in the manifesto, what has not arisen in evidence is a question about
whether the model of the child trust fund without funding from the

trust fund model is locked in and the ISA model is an extension of ISA.

intention that the junior ISA will have a lock in until the age of 18.
It replicates that feature of the child trust fund. If you kept the
child trust fund system going as it is as the moment, you would end up
issuing a unique reference number for no discernable purpose to every
child who is born. You need to maintain those records over 18 years. I
think you would find that you ended up keeping a system going that
costs about £5 million a year. If I compare that with moving to
a voluntary system where no one is required to contribute to the costs
we anticipate for our scheme, I do not think that that represents good
value for money for taxpayers.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000177">&#160;</a>

very poor evidence base for that. It has not been established
sufficiently long to determine what the effect is on tackling
inequality. But we need to bear in mind that, out of the CTFs opened by
low-income families, only 13% received contributions from their parents
or from others, whereas for better-off families that figure is 30%. In
itself, it is hard to say whether the CTF will actually reduce
inequality.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000183">&#160;</a>

decisions. If we chose not to scrap the child trust fund, we would have
to find another £500 million a year, by cutting spending
somewhere else, raising taxes or encouraging borrowing. Given the scale
of the deficit and of the challenge we face, we must take difficult
decisions now to tackle them. We cannot put problems off until
tomorrow. If we delay resolving some of those issues, the people who

which is on the saving gateway. With regard to promoting savings,
especially among people on low incomes, who traditionally do not save,
we have heard a lot of evidence about the importance of access to the
places where they save. We have found universally that they need a
local and trusted organisation that offers value-for-money products.
Given the coalition Government’s commitment to the post office
network, which is welcome, what discussions have you had with
colleagues about developing low-cost financial services through that

State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend the hon.
Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr Davey). You make an absolutely key
point about access points. One of the problems with the saving gateway
account was the number of access points at which it would be delivered,
which was one reason for our decision to scrap it. We found that no
building societies would sign up to deliver it and that only the Royal
Bank of Scotland and Lloyds would offer it. The Post Office wanted
subsidy from the taxpayer for offering it, and only credit unions that
did not have national coverage were prepared to go down that route. We
did not feel that there were not enough access points available to
enable it to reach out to as many people as it should have done. That
is one reason why we chose not to proceed with it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000188">&#160;</a>

long-term policies designed to encourage people on low incomes to save
and facilitate them to do so. Rather than just saying that because many
providers were not prepared at the outset to come in on it, did you
give any consideration to allowing it to get started so that you could
build up a network? You mentioned one or two potential changes, such as
the credit unions’ discussions with post offices. Rather than

It is interesting to note that the previous Government made the pledge
in their 2001 election manifesto, so clearly they had some time before
the Bill was introduced and there were concerns about how effective it
would be. Carl Emmerson suggested on Tuesday that it would not

                        <p class="tabbed">There are
serious question marks about whether it would be effective in
increasing saving. We recognise the need to increase saving among
families on low incomes. That is one of the reasons why we support the
annual financial health check to give families more advice about
managing their money. That is something that the industry will fund by
CFEB, so there are other initiatives that we have in place that will
encourage people to save. There are other measures coming further down
the track, such as auto enrolment, a net that will encourage people on
lower incomes to get access to pension savings for the first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000193">&#160;</a>

                           </div>merits of a saving gateway, particularly in relation to credit unions,
was the incentive to save. The ability of credit unions to build up
their savings and thereby improve access for people in some
communities, which do have credit unions—admittedly, not all
have yet—to cheap forms of credit is one of the things that can
make a huge difference not just to people’s income, but their
not getting into debt and not having to borrow at times of crisis. Do
you not agree that to enable that to happen is particularly important
if we want people to be able not to fall into a cycle of
debt?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000194">&#160;</a>

struck me when talking to credit unions is the number of people who
have their benefit paid into a credit union account and actually leave
some behind for a saving to actually provide a cushion against
unexpected changes in their income. It does play back to a point that

                           </strong> What has come across to us from several witnesses
is that financial education, particularly for young people, is patchy.
I wondered whether your work on this Bill has led you to consider how
we could improve on that in light of the fact that the financial
savings education element, say of the child trust fund, is going. It
has also been pointed out that only three out of four young
people’s families engage with the savings education element of
that, so we have one out of four young people potentially receiving no
benefit at all bar what one witness called a handout at 18, which
perhaps does not inspire savings at all—but rather the opposite.
Have you considered how we can improve our service to young people to
give them the best start in life in terms of financial
management?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000197">&#160;</a>

Hoban:</strong>
                           </em> This is something that I feel passionately
about. I have seen a number of programmes delivered in schools that
improve financial literacy. PFEG does a very good job. It is funded by
the consumer financial education body to help its work. A lot of
businesses support financial education projects in both primary and
secondary schools. We cannot afford to wait until today’s
five-year-olds are in their 60s to say that the job has been done on
financial education. That is why we were very supportive of the
consumer financial education body, when it was in the Financial
Services Bill last year. We were very keen to see that set up. We were
the first party that advocated the national roll-out of financial
advice to tackle some of these problems, and to help people face them
now. Education and school have an important role. There are plenty of
people there to provide support, but it is a multi-generational issue
that we need to
tackle.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000198">&#160;</a>

money most. Was that under consideration at any point when you looked
at introducing the Bill? You are obviously going down the road of
means-testing child benefit to an extent. Many people see the health in
pregnancy grant as an advance on child benefit before the child is
born. Was the possibility of using that money more wisely under
consideration, rather than axing the whole thing
entirely?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000199">&#160;</a>

looking at these three measures is to recognise that you cannot look at
them in isolation. For example, with health and pregnancy, there are
other sources of funding available to those on low income who are
pregnant. So we need to not just look at one measure in isolation, but
take into account the broader ranges of financial support.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000200">&#160;</a>

There is a voucher programme for food that starts at a relatively early
point in pregnancy and, I think, carries on until the child is four
years old, so there is other support. This is untargeted. It was not
piloted. It was just introduced in the 2009 Budget. There is no link
between receipt and what it is used for, and that was very well
established in the last session. One of the advantages of the voucher
programme is that it is clearly linked to

hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East and I intend to introduce a
fruitful discussion with these amendments, which are designed to be
helpful to the Government. It is always my intention to be
helpful; I was as a Minister, and hope that I shall be as an
Opposition spokesman. For the avoidance of doubt, I state that the
Opposition have extremely strong views on the Bill. If our amendments
to clause 1 are not agreed, we will vote against the clause, because we
believe the child trust fund to be a valuable asset. We 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 129<a class="bkMark" name="Column129">&#160;</a>
                           </div>want it to be maintained, even in its slimmed-down form following its
emasculation by the statutory instrument that was made in July. Having
said that, I am pragmatic and will give the Minister and the Government
the opportunity to reflect on our suggestions in this group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would do one of three things. The lead amendment would give
the Minister the opportunity to delay the implementation of the clause
by order. There are also amendments that would delay the ending of
eligibility for the child trust fund until either 2014 or
2016.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first date of 2014 would allow for greater assessment of the economic
situation and of how the deficit reduction plan was working before
eligibility was ended. I will return to that point later. The second
date of 2016 is after the final date for the next general election;
helpfully, the Government have stated that it will be on 6 May 2015.
That would allow Conservative Members—not Liberal Democrat
Members, whom I exempt from this charge—to seek a proper mandate
for the abolition of the child trust fund, given their manifesto
commitment on the subject. The last election was on 6 May 2010; that is
not that long ago, but they have already ditched the manifesto
commitment as part of this Bill. The second date gives Conservative
Members an opportunity to reflect on upholding what they were elected
to do. I will also return to that point
later.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
start by discussing amendment 26, which would amend the Bill so that
eligibility for the child trust fund was not cut off on 3 January 2011.
It would give the Minister the flexibility to meet his objective of
ending the scheme—an objective that we oppose—at a date
that he sets, by means of regulations made by the Secretary of State.
There are two reasons for the amendment. First, it gives the Minister
the opportunity to reflect on the evidence sessions and on the value of
the child trust fund for many sectors of our society. Secondly, it is
important that he reflects on the representations we have received on
the gap that will occur between the ending of eligibility for the child
trust fund and the introduction of the replacement ISA, which, on
Second Reading, the Minister proposed introducing at some date before
October 2011. He could fill that gap in several ways, and I want to
reflect on those in our discussion. He has announced a new child ISA,
and when he responds, I hope that he will give more detail and outline
the nuts and bolts of that proposed ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
effective ways of filling that gap at the moment, and amendment 26
gives the Minister the opportunity to consider some of them. He could
effectively keep the lower payments of £50 in place for children
born after 3 January 2011, until the product is replaced in due course
with the child ISA. He could end Government contributions but maintain
the facility for parents to establish a child trust fund for children
born after 3 January.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The rationale that appears to have been given for
the abolition of the child trust fund is the need to reduce the
deficit. We have heard a great deal from the Government about how, in
their view, their plans will reduce the deficit within a five-year
period— 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 130<a class="bkMark" name="Column130">&#160;</a>
                           </div>although I am not sure that I agree. On that basis, however, given that
we are talking about a long-term programme, would it not be
advantageous to be able to reinstate it in due course, when the deficit
is reduced?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000255">&#160;</a>

Hanson:<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000648">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. All three
sub-groups of amendments could give the opportunity to do that.
Amendment 26 allows the Minister, by regulation, to end the child trust
fund at a later date, which provides an opportunity for him to reflect
on the alternative. The date of 2014 gives a three-year gap before the
implementation of the measures in the Bill. I accept that that has a
cost, but in theory, it could allow for some reflection on the economic
circumstances over the next three years. The date of 2016 gives the
opportunity for a total of five years before implementation. The
Minister, rather than using the proposals to hit children’s
future assets as part of the deficit reduction plan, could look at how
that plan as a whole impacts on the economy and the Budget. That way,
he would not necessarily have to use dogma to end the child trust fund
scheme because he did not agree with it. All three options give the
Minister the opportunity to reflect on the current role of the deficit,
the progress in lessening the deficit, the replacement for the child
trust fund and indeed, the commitments made in his
manifesto.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000256">&#160;</a>

                           <em>]</em> The hon. Gentleman asks a good
question. If it meant that the Labour Opposition had amendments
accepted that put in place a stop-gap for the next nine months, I would
reflect on whether to vote for the clause. At the moment, we have
nothing; the child trust fund will be abolished. If it meant that we

clause, in the hope that the economic situation would improve and there

first comment to the Committee was that we oppose clause 1 of the Bill.
I also said—as the hon. Gentleman will see if he wants to look
at <em>Hansard </em>tomorrow—that I am pragmatic in these matters.
I want to see something of the child trust fund salvaged from this
train crash. I believe, as the evidence sessions have shown,
that the fund is a valuable asset, helps develop assets for people at
the age of 18—particularly the poorest in our
community—and has been valued by those who have used it. It has
also helped to develop a savings culture as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000259">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On the evidence sessions, obviously it is not
surprising that those who make a living out of providing child trust
funds are enthusiastic about them continuing. What I did not
hear—I wonder whether the shadow Minister did—is any
evidence that they were getting a good return, beyond the charges
levied on it, or any evidence that people were saving any more than
they would have done otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000260">&#160;</a>

31%. We had this discussion when the original order was before

in savings, including among people on lower

solution. There is a potential argument for people spending their money
on day-to-day living, but, equally, the child trust fund, as he will
know, is not something to which individuals have to contribute. The
Government have been contributing to encourage savings, and people can,
if they have resources in their pocket, put some in for their children.
Some do, and some do not. They can also put nothing in at all and leave
that initial Government contribution to mature when the child reaches
18. They can opt in or opt out at different times in their financial
cycle. It is a matter of choice. Individuals can choose when to put
money into their children’s futures. What is uncontroversial
from today’s discussions is that the scheme generates greater
saving across the board than there had been before it came into
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000263">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed. The scheme has been operational for a
relatively small number of years. The children who have child trust
funds are relatively young because of when the scheme commenced. I
should perhaps have declared an interest, Mr Howarth, because I have
four children, three of whom are older, but the fourth is aged 7 and is
in receipt of a child trust fund—I had them all with the same
wife, but that is another story. The key point is that there are
individuals who have generated savings that would not have been made
before the child trust fund came into place. There are people on lower
incomes who are saving whatever they can, whenever they can. That money
is not lost to society; it is put away for the 18th year, when

Gentleman; we have heard a lot of evidence stating that people do save

families save, but the point that has not been proved at all is whether
additional savings are being made. I have heard no evidence that there
is any additionality in the savings numbers, or that such savings would
not have otherwise been made. We took evidence from a variety of
experienced witnesses, but there are numerous comments on the Netmums

saving into a bank account. People have commented that they would be
saving anyway and that the child trust fund was nice to have, but not
essential. Has the right hon. Gentleman seen

I have already said that empirical evidence suggests that savings have
risen, in the cohort, from 18 to 31% over the period. There is no
definitive evidence as yet as regards the breakdown between the poor
and more affluent members of society, but there are certainly poorer
people who are saving, who were not saving before. That is an advantage
for the scheme as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, for example, some £2 billion in assets is under
control of the scheme, and £22 million a month in regular
contributions is going into child trust fund accounts. We could argue
all day about whether that has moved from building societies, from
banks or from shares to child trust funds, but everybody who has given
evidence to the Committee has said that there has been success in
raising the level of savings into child trust funds, and that that has
had a material benefit in encouraging people, particularly those on the
poorest incomes, to consider saving, when they can afford to, for their
children’s
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 26, I want to ask about the implementation date of the
scheme. It is quite clear from what we heard during the evidence
sessions that nobody, including the Minister, expects the replacement
scheme to be in place by 4 January 2011. In a press release issued on
26 October 2010—for the sake of accuracy, at 17.55—the
Minister
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        </p>
                        <p>One
of the key issues on which the Minister needs to reflect is the speed
of the abolition of the child trust fund and the replacement product
that he is putting in place in 2011. Amendment 26 would not stop the
Minister abolishing the child trust fund or eligibility for the child
trust fund, nor would it close down the scheme. It would not stop the
Minister establishing the new scheme in autumn 2011. It would simply
allow him to continue the child trust fund scheme between 3 January
2011 and whatever date he chooses to introduce the new scheme proposed
in the press release.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000270">&#160;</a>

I intervened on about delaying the abolition of the scheme, I refer him
to column 58 of the <em>Hansard </em>report of the Committee’s
proceedings on Tuesday 2 November; sadly, I was unable to attend. Marc
Bush, who spoke on behalf of Scope, referred to his concern that people
were losing benefits as a consequence of saving money in the child
trust fund. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that that is a bad
situation? Is it not sensible to take a break and sort matters out, so
that such situations do not
occur?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000271">&#160;</a>

and no definitive scheme will emerge until perhaps autumn 2010. The

fund contributions, eligibility and mechanisms to occur on the date on

                           </strong> My reading of the Bill is that children born
before 3 July would be entitled to the provision, as long as an
application is made within the next three months. Accounts are still
going to be opened. However, there is no massive urgency for the
replacement. Children will continue to be born, and they can apply
retrospectively for a new account. If people are losing benefits as a
result of the fund, the previous Government clearly made major mistakes
in its implementation.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000283">&#160;</a>

the scheme that he is bringing forward is in place? I cannot see the

are differences in the product. The Minister will not confirm, because
he is still consulting, what product will replace the child trust fund
while asking the Committee to abolish the child trust fund under clause
1. Amendment 26, whatever its technical faults and the
political principle behind it, simply says that if the Minister is
going to abolish it, he should do so from the date when the new scheme
comes into operation. That would avoid all the confusion of two schemes
being run at once and people not knowing what the final scheme is. It
avoids the problem of backdating contributions from the commencement of
the new scheme to 3 January 2011. I cannot understand why
the Minister will not reflect on that. I am throwing him a ball to help
him achieve his objective of abolishing the child trust fund, even
though we oppose that
abolition.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000297">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. I will
provide the Minister with some statistics behind the figures.
Currently, about 70,000 children are born every month. If the scheme is
abolished on 3 January 2011, it means that in January, February, March,
April, May, June, July, August, September, possibly even October and
November, approximately 70,000 children will be born each month who are
not eligible for the child trust fund. They will have to learn from
their parents, retrospectively, about the new product, even though
their parents may have different levels of educational attainment and
different information sources. They will have to learn from the
Government, retrospectively, about how they then put money into the
fund under the Minister’s new ISA proposals. They may have not
realised that they can put money aside before those periods of time. I
contend that as many as 500,000 children could be disadvantaged,
because they will not have been in the child trust fund and they will
not necessarily have taken up the child ISA, because we do not yet know
what the child ISA
is.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment simply gives the Minister a chance to say, “On 1
October, this contribution”—much as I do not want it to
happen—“will end, and the new scheme will come into place
on 1 October.” I will even give him a commitment that I will not
oppose the regulation’s passage through the House next June or
July, so that he can agree to the date of 1 October and end the hiatus.
What is the problem with that? I am compromising dramatically my
beliefs and those of my hon. Friends in offering the Minister that
opportunity, because it will ensure that children born from 3 January
through to whatever date he issues his ISA will have a child trust fund
contribution of £50. They will be able to establish that and
maintain the continuity that, sadly, the Minister wishes to throw up in
the air and lose. I cannot see the argument against

part debate, I want the Minister to talk about how the abolition of the

provided the fund in good faith, in line with Government policy. The

                           </strong> There has to be an element of financing for the
operation of the scheme. That is understood. That has to be the case.
By my estimates—I may be a few hundred thousand pounds out
either side—we are talking about a possible cost of around
£31.5 million until October, plus the costs of maintaining the
existing child trust fund. In deficit reduction terms, that is not a
great deal of money. It would ensure that the hiatus did not happen and
the Minister could introduce his scheme at the right time without
damaging the child trust fund from 3 January. It would ensure that
another 500,000 children had some contribution towards their child
trust fund, and that many people, as mentioned by the hon. Member for
Truro and Falmouth, could contribute to the fund over that period of
time. I hope that the Minister will reflect on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
1 states that we should leave out 3 January 2011 and insert
3 January 2014. Again, the Minister will know, because Government
Members have indicated it, that the next general election will be in
2015. It is quite possible for him, therefore, to accept the amendment;
to examine the continuance of the child trust fund with lower
contributions of around £31 million or £32
million a year—£50 for each person; to encourage that
savings culture over the next three years, and to consider how the
economy develops in that period.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000307">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
wants—and believes that they will—the general deficit
reduction measures, employment measures and reductions in public
spending to benefit the economy as a whole. We think that those
measures might cause 500,000 jobs to be lost in the public and private
sectors, but he presumably believes that the economy will get better
because of the medicine that the Government are giving it over the next
three years.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000308">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why
is the Minister punishing future generations of children by abolishing
the scheme in that three-year period when he could allow a much lower
contribution? The amendment gives him the opportunity to abolish the
higher rate and would allow for a contribution rate over the
next three years of £50 per child for the 70,000 children who
are born each month. That would save a considerable amount of public
resource, which is important, as the hon. Members for Congleton, for
West Worcestershire, and for Devizes mentioned. He would save a
considerable resource without abolishing the scheme. If, therefore, the
economy picked up, he could either maintain the scheme beyond 2014, or
consider returning to a higher rate of contribution to help alleviate
poverty, and help asset-poor individuals at the age of 18. The scheme
could be maintained for a three-year
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000309">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that the proposal involves a cost of £31.5
million to £32 million a year. However, over the three-year
period, that might be £100 million or £120 million,
rather than the £500 million that the Minister is considering
saving. It would help him to save—I am throwing this ball to
him, so I hope that he picks it up and runs with it—a
considerable amount of public resource, but still give him the
flexibility to ensure that we have the benefits of the savings culture
about which we heard in the evidence sessions. It would ensure that the
mechanism and infrastructure are still in place so that we can continue
to contribute. If the economy picks up—and we will fight an
election on that in four years’
time—<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000310">&#160;</a>

can reflect on the abolition of the child trust fund. If he does not
accept the amendment, I will presume—and far be it from me to
presume, because the Minister can speak for himself—that he is
against the fund on the basis of dogma, not of deficit. He is against
the fund because it is a Government contribution to help partnership
with parents to secure assets for people who are asset poor at the age
of 18 and will remain so unless he does something about it. If it is
not dogma, he can save a large amount of public money by accepting the
lower rate, running it for three years until 2014, and maintaining the
infrastructure of the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000312">&#160;</a>

Minister did that, he would not have to start his new ISA. He could
stop developing that, stop the hiatus with the new product, and
maintain the existing child trust fund at a lower rate of contribution.
The Government would not have to go through the mechanisms of Treasury
officials developing a new ISA, talking to the market, throwing all the
cards in the air and seeing how they land. He could maintain the
current product for a much lower rate without abolishing the trust
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000313">&#160;</a>

Government an opportunity to reflect on the fact that they do not have
to abolish the scheme to save money. The Minister could take a payment
holiday for that three-year period. I do not necessarily think that
that is a great idea, but he could do that. He could maintain the
structure of the child trust fund and wait to see how the economy
develops. What is wrong with that? What is the problem with taking a
payment holiday and having a reduced figure while maintaining the
structure of the child trust fund? Or does the Minister not believe in
the concept of a child trust fund? If that is the case, he should tell
us so. If the Bill is about deficit reduction, I am offering him
£350 million to £400 million of deficit
reduction by maintaining the scheme for the next three

take a three-year payment holiday in payments to those groups, then
look at the economy, and still go back to the electorate in 2015 and
say that he had maintained payments to the poorest third and to those
in receipt of disability living allowance. He would have to admit that
he took a payment holiday, because he had difficulties with finances,

                           </strong> I am trying to make my points. I believe that the
Minister has an opportunity to reflect on the amendments and not to
abandon his principle regarding the abolition of the child trust fund.
Under amendment 26, he would abandon that principle for the
next eight months until he has a replacement or, under
amendment 1, he would abandon that principle until 2014, at
relatively low cost, and then see whether the economy picks up. Both
approaches would maintain the child trust fund infrastructure and both
would represent an opportunity at least to avoid the disturbance that
we have today.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are in
danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. We have an
incredibly successful scheme in which millions of families are saving
that could be maintained at a relatively low cost. Indeed, hon. Members
should not listen only to me. We have received evidence in the past 24
hours from Save Child Savings, which comprises the Daycare Trust, the
director of ResPublica, the IPPR, the London School of Economics, the

proposes that we should replace the 2011 date with 2016. I have touched
upon that already, but it is important that the Minister responds to
the amendment. I tabled it because it would help Conservative Members
to return to their electorates in 2015 having fulfilled their general
election manifesto commitments. I would not want the Minister to return
to Fareham, or the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby to return to
his constituency, and say, “Not only have we not fulfilled our

said we would

in our deliberations, but I am trying to ensure that the Minister and
his esteemed colleagues, for whom I have the greatest respect, look at
the issue and undertake to postpone the decision on the complete
abolition of the scheme until 2016. If they accept amendments 26 or 10,
they will be able to bring into effect a scheme that allows the poorest
third of families and families with disabled children to maintain a
child trust fund at a future date. The Minister would also be able to
introduce a tax-free ISA scheme for people who are not in those

Government and that the coalition agreement therefore supersedes the
manifestos of both parties? If the negotiations between my party and
his had succeeded and a different coalition was in place, would he have
thought it reasonable if a Conservative shadow Minister, which is what
my hon. Friend the Minister would have been, had put the same point to

members, 25 Conservative members and three Liberal Democrats. Every
time we had a discussion, we had to look to the three Liberal Democrats
to determine what the local authority’s final policy would be.
One Liberal Democrat always wanted to vote with the Tories, another
wanted to vote with us, and the other could not make up their mind. I
pay tribute to the two Liberal Democrat members of the Committee,
because their position is totally consistent, but I disagree with them.
The Liberal Democrats returned fewer Members at this election than they
had in the previous Parliament. However, they have the

saying that we should not put women and children first on the Titanic
of our financial situation, so be it, but I do not believe that that
should happen. The key point is that the amendments would allow us to
keep the child trust funds so that the Government could honour the

was attracted by the idea put forward by Save Child Savings and others
of just keeping the infrastructure going. In practice, however, we
already know that we will not stop opening accounts on 3 January,
because accounts will be opened over the next three months. Clearly,
the issue to be resolved is the practicality of how to handle
children’s savings without the £500 or £250 from
the Government, which makes a difference to running those
accounts.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are entirely right to have a consultation process, because
nobody will lose out from having a period of consideration before the
new system is brought in. That new system might be the same as the old
one, in the sense of the infrastructure and the computer systems, or
there might even be two different alternatives, with one feeding into
the ISA mechanisms and the other into the child trust fund mechanisms.
The reality is that the investment for putting in place all the
computer systems has already been made by organisations such as the
Children’s Mutual, which should be recognised. The Revenue has
its links to such systems, as it does to those of the ISA providers.
All that is in place, so there is no problem in switching it back on to
allow people to open
accounts.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
good thing about the route of the child trust fund is that people are
given a chitty—a piece of paper with which they can open an
account. Therefore, there are none of the money-laundering problems
that arise with opening other accounts. It is an easy process, but
there is absolutely nothing that means that everything has to be kept
going. The current system opens up a default account, without any
money. A lot of accounts will have to be managed without money in them,
and there will also be a requirement to send a document on
children’s birthdays to say that they have no money. That is not
a good use of funds whoever is paying for them—whether a private
provider or the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Much
as I was persuaded by the people citing evidence that it would be a
good idea just to keep the process going as it is, having thought about
it at more length and remembering that this is one of the things in
which I have been involved for many years, it is far better to have a
period of consideration during which we work out whether to use the
infrastructure without the default opening of a bank account, because
that is a bit silly. We cannot just continue the process as it is,
because that would just cause a massive problem without any funds from
the Government. Do we have both options, one based on the ISA and one
based on the infrastructure of child trust funds? The amendments set
out the idea that we should just keep things ticking
over.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000356">&#160;</a>

I might resolve the hon. Lady’s concern. Let me deal with the
first ball that the right hon. Gentleman threw me, amendment 26. It is
one of the three pragmatic options and suggests that we defer the date
for implementation until the final details of a replacement of the
junior ISA are pinned down. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Yardley made a good point about the cost of simply keeping open,
re-opening and opening accounts. We need to draw a line on such
matters. It is the case that we have had initial discussions with
providers. We issued a further consultation document on the day of
Second Reading, but I wish to clarify some issues that have been
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000366">&#160;</a>

whether providers would be interested in a junior ISA. It was clear
from those to whom I spoke when meeting stakeholders in July this year

appetite that there is in the savings industry, it is clear that people
are interested in providing the product. The hon. Member for

that people on low incomes do not understand ISAs. She might be
interested to know that 12 million people with incomes of less than
£20,000 a year have ISAs. It is clear that the ISA is a product.
It is a well-recognised brand. People understand exactly what it does

low-income families.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000368">&#160;</a>

seem to understand them. For families there is a choice: there is a

merits of saving. It is not appropriate to argue that that is a

saving

them—they will advertise them. We do not have to go very far
through a newspaper’s money supplements on a Saturday or Sunday
to find great adverts for ISAs. That shows to me that people who want
to promote them will advertise them or make them known. There are other
mechanisms we can use, perhaps through the Consumer Financial Education
Body and the work that it does with expectant mothers, to remind them
about the opportunity to open children’s ISAs, so there is not a
shortage of ways to make this known to individuals. I do not believe
that there will be a hiatus. There will be the opportunity to continue

£50 contribution, it would not be economically viable for many

that the right hon. Gentleman tabled would make the accounts
economically unviable for providers. I therefore think that we are

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an important point. That is
something we need to think about when designing the scheme. I am clear
that it should be as socially inclusive as possible. We must take into

huge
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000384">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
brings me to the next batch of amendments, the first of which is
amendment 1. These amendments encapsulate Labour party policy, which
is, “Let’s just put it off. Let’s just wait for
another day. Let’s just wait and see what turns up.” That
is a Micawberish approach to economic policy. We recognise that we need
to make progress now. That is why we started to reduce the
contributions with the statutory instrument in July. The Bill completes
that process. This is the right thing to do. We do not want to put off
tackling the deficit because, as the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy
and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) said, the cost of doing so would be borne by
the poorest in society. We need to make progress now. There has been no
suggestion from the Opposition about what the alternative might be. If
we prolonged the process, the money would have to be found from
somewhere—perhaps through a reduction in the pupil premium,
through increased borrowing or through increased taxation. I will not
dwell on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000386">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
decision must be confronted. My hon. Friends in the coalition are very
supportive of taking difficult measures now. I therefore do not think
that deferring this measure until 2014 would be helpful. That proposal
suffers from the same defect as the last: that for the next three
years, CTF providers would find it economically unviable to service
accounts. It would be wrong for those providers. The third batch of
amendments, the first of which is amendment 10, compounds that
argument. We need to take tough action to tackle the
deficit.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000387">&#160;</a>

his wide-ranging opening speech, the right hon. Member for Delyn forgot
to mention amendment 19. The Committee ought to consider it. He is an
experienced Member of this House and, as he acknowledged earlier, he
used to be a Minister. If the Committee passed amendment 19, it would
require something that is medically impossible: it would require babies
to be born twice. The Bill would state that a child has to be born
“before 3rd January 2011” and “after 3 January
2012”. The purpose of the amendment is not clear to me. I will
try to be helpful and pass him the ball, as it were, to rescue him from
this problem. I think that he might be trying to realise the suggestion
of the hon. Members for Stretford and Urmston, for Makerfield and for
Bristol East—his fellow shadow Minister—of having a
payment holiday, rather than deferring the end date for the CTF. I
think that is why the amendment suggests a year’s gap in
payments, but perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would like to clarify
its
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000388">&#160;</a>

The purpose of that amendment was to delay the abolition for a further
12 months, which could have allowed the Minister to have a payments
holiday. If it is technically incorrect, the principle is still there.

introduced the child trust fund. We are not doing this because we feel
there is an ideological need to scrap child trust funds. We are doing

the principle of child trust funds or it is simply because of the
financial situation that he wants to abolish them. Some of his hon.
Friends indicated in the evidence-taking sittings that ideally they
would wish to keep them. On that basis would it not be better to keep
the mechanism in place so that when and if the economy recovers in the
way that he clearly expects it will, it will be possible to restore
this provision, which, apparently, his party considers to be a good
thing?<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000395">&#160;</a>

that we should keep it going for a while but it means that we will have
to force providers to open accounts that will not be economic. It means
that we will have to keep the system going in HMRC. We have a much
better alternative, which is cheaper for the taxpayer, and reflects
some of the design features of the CTF that we approve of such as
locking up savings until someone is 18 and allowing a range of people
to contribute to that product. Those are important matters. It would
cost probably about £2 million a year simply to keep the CTF
ticking over. I can think of much better ways to spend £2
million in HMRC, such as trying to tackle tax evasion and things like
that. I am sure that the hon. Lady would agree with me on that

voted against it and they had a view about where that money would be
better spent. We are making that decision now. We are recognising that,
given the financial situation that we inherited, better ways exist of
spending that money, and that it is better to try to tackle the deficit
than simply to lock up money until children are 18. It is better to be
able to spend the money in ways that will help families now than to
wait until their children are 18. That is the challenge that we must
acknowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000398">&#160;</a>

to the evidence, in 2008-09, 13% of low-income families contributed to
a child trust fund, and 30% of better-off families did so. The average
contribution of £23 was across all child trust funds held by
low-income families, but only 13% of those accounts received any
additional contributions. We must take on board the point that my hon.

better ways to spend the money, which will tackle inequality and

                           </strong> There is an incoherence in what is being said. On
the one hand, the purpose is said to be saving money and paying down
the deficit quickly, relying on the fact that that will turn the
economy around. On the other hand, there is the question of whether
this is a good mechanism for helping poorer families, for asset
transfer, and for helping young people to make decisions in their lives
at important times.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000404">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Either it is
a good policy or it is not, and I am hearing very mixed messages. At
times, the message is that it would be a good thing to do if we could
afford it, but that we cannot afford it at present. At other times the
scheme is criticised because it locks money away and makes it
unavailable, and it would be better for poorer people if money were
available. That would make sense if the Bill stopped the child trust
fund and gave an equivalent sum of money to such families now, but that
is not the choice before us. The choice before us is to abolish the
child trust fund, with effect from January, without putting anything
similar in its place. The money will not be spent on poorer families,
because the only alternative that is suggested—it is not in the
Bill at all, but we have devoted a great deal of time to it—is
setting up something called junior ISAs. Junior ISAs are of no
assistance in providing an incentive to save to families who do not pay
tax. The attraction of ISAs for most people, including those on low pay
who appear in the tax bracket, is the tax relief available. For others,
there is little attraction other than putting the money into a Post
Office account, or any other form of saving. The ISA works for those
who pay tax. Some people under 25 undoubtedly pay tax, but many people
pay no tax at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000405">&#160;</a>

do not qualify for tax relief will use ISAs for saving. I suspect they
will be few in number. In my experience, ISAs are attractive because
tax relief is available, and I think that is the case with the vast

people.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000407">&#160;</a>

Minister that we need more information? If he is to rely on the fact
that one in five people on low incomes take out ISAs, we need to know
what sort of people they are. Are they former taxpayers who worked, but
who are now on lower incomes? Are they older people? Do they have
families? If we look at that, we might have an idea of what sort of
people will take up junior ISAs. I suspect that it will be people who
have used up their £10,600 or so adult ISA and who will see a
junior ISA as another way of saving
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000408">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is an interesting point. People in those
categories will find the ISA the most attractive way of saving. The
purpose of the child trust funds was not just to provide an attractive
form of saving to people who already could save, but to enable a step

                           </div>change in relation to asset transfer. A number of people gave evidence
to us on that. The scheme is part of the long-term thinking for
reducing inequality and improving the future of children, particularly
those from the least well-off backgrounds. It needs to be given time to
work. The stop-start, turn-the-tap-on, turn-the-tap-off approach to
dealing with problems has been particularly harmful to this
country’s social policy—all Governments can be criticised
for that—and, as a result, we rarely give social programmes time
to work to their conclusion. On child trust funds, we would have to
wait some considerable time, but there would be merit in enabling us to
return to the issue and put more money into them in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000409">&#160;</a>

am confident that the economy will recover, but there is an issue about
exactly when that will happen, given the drastic deficit-reducing
measures, which will, in my opinion, increase, not reduce the deficit.
Leaving that aside, we all expect that a time will come when the
economy will improve. We would then be able to pay money back into

is interesting to hear people making other proposals for what that
money might or might not be used, but that is not what we are being
asked to address today. We are not even being asked to address whether
the money should go into the pupil premium, as suggested by the Liberal
party manifesto. Indeed, I have heard many people suggest that the
pupil premium will be financed by reductions in other parts of the
education budget rather than the budget that we are considering. We are
looking at whether we should retain child trust funds at all, or at
least some form of mechanism that would allow them to be reopened,
rather than having to reinvent a completely new mechanism at some
future

of us are—confused by the plethora of initiatives to help the

They were initiatives that, given an unlimited supply of money, which
the previous Government believed that they
had—<em>[Interruption.] </em>It is interesting that Labour Members
tend to groan whenever the notion of the deficit is introduced,
indicating that, while in opposition, they continue to think that the
deficit is something that came out of the swamp, rather than something
that they created, but let us put that to one side as it is not
relevant to the

an ideal world, the political ambition of throwing lots of money at a
wall called “child poverty” and hoping that some of it
sticks is a laudable one, which is a nice thing to have to justify in
one’s constituency—unlike the current situation that we
have inherited. However, when times are tough, all Members should be
looking for the highest value-added things that we can possibly do with
every scarce tax pact. On both sides of the House, we are committed to
early interventions and to helping the most disadvantaged families in
society. Even in leafy, rural Devizes, we have our fair share of
poverty,

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is simply a question of what works best. Yesterday, we heard quite
interesting evidence, from, for example, the gentleman representing the
credit unions, stating that what we need is a step change in lending
and financial support for the poorest families. That has not been
delivered, despite the best intentions, but we have had some creative
thinking about using post offices as a potential channel, which could
be extremely helpful in rural
constituencies.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
where we are—none of us came into politics to be in this
situation—all Members should be thinking creatively about which
pound delivers the most value for our most disadvantaged children and
families, rather than putting up a blanket smokescreen of opposition to
reducing everything. We had conversations with some of our witnesses
whereby we tried to ask them what, if we cannot have everything, the
most valuable interventions are. Is it giving our poorest families a
nest egg of £50? Even when amortised at today’s
relatively low interest rates, that is, frankly, not a huge amount. We
should ensure that our poorest families have stable family structures,
access to excellent health care early in their lives and a pupil
premium that means that they are attracted to schools and that schools
will actually want to invest in supporting those families.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We should
also ensure that our poorest families have an annual financial health
check, because we have heard compelling evidence that it is not simply
a question of families not taking up their allocation for their child
trust funds because they do not know about it, or it is difficult. In
many cases, they are chaotic families for whom the whole concept of
saving and investment is completely
alien.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000417">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
does not solve those problems by throwing money against the wall and
hoping that some of it sticks. One solves it by tackling the issues,
getting involved, ensuring that those families have far higher levels
of support than they have received before and that they are helped into
sustainable employment, for example.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000418">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
other compelling things that we heard from our trio of representatives
was on single parenthood and women struggling to bring up
families—one of the biggest issues around child poverty. Those
are not women who will be accessing such financial products, no matter
how much money we throw at them. They can be helped so much more
effectively in so many other
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000419">&#160;</a>

will be happy to vote against the amendments. They are not a
particularly effective use of the taxpayer’s pounds. Our
coalition agreement has set out far more important ways of effectively
tackling child poverty earlier in life. I urge all Members who care
about child poverty and about our poorest families to vote against the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000420">&#160;</a>

confused. The child trust fund money, because it is a voucher that is
put into the account, is somehow, as Graeme McAusland said, seen as
real money, whereas tax relief on ISAs is also money provided by the
Government. I would like to see some examination of how much tax relief
on the ISAs would be given to families as well.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000421">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Child trust
funds are also an encouragement for people to save. I have a lot of
experience with low-income families, and financial products are
difficult for them to access. The understanding is not there. Banks are
seen as an enemy in quite a lot of places; they are somewhere that you
put a suit on to go to. The child trust fund has encouraged people to
take up a financial product. As I said, 74% of people take it up. I
appreciate that that means 26% do not take it up, but 74% means it is a
much more successful financial product than any other on the market,
including
ISAs.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000422">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Anne
Longfield gave evidence that the poorest people are contributing a
higher percentage of their income as a top-up to the child trust fund
than the richer families, and that percentage means a lot. We are
ingraining a habit. We all accept that people at different times of
their lives can save different amounts of money. That percentage means
something. Being able to put £2 a week away means a lot more to
some families than putting £200 a week away. Delaying this
measure in order to look at what we can do for the low-income families
would have great value.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the end of
its term, the child trust fund provides an asset. The most compelling
argument I heard today was in the evidence from the United States that
assets give choices. Having an asset can change behaviour. It gives
people choices that they would not otherwise have, and we will be
depriving children of choices. Perhaps I should declare an interest as
my first grandchild is due in May, and she or he will be one of those
lost children who will not be there at the right time for the ISAs and
who will lose the child trust fund. Also, the fund means engaging with
financial institutions and seeing who can provide savings. We heard the
credit unions say that they no longer trust the Government’s
processes, because things are removed at short notice, as has happened
with the child trust fund. I urge delay. For the families that I see, I
do not think that a financial health check would help, frankly. They
know that they do not have enough; they know that they are in
debt.<a class="bkMark" name="10110445000424">&#160;</a>
