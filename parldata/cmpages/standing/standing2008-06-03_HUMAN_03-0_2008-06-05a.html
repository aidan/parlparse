<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000180"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The amendment was tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and it is supported by my hon. Friend
the Member for Southport, who gives his apologies to the Committee
today that he is detained on a constituency matter. They have asked me
to speak to these three amendments, which I am happy to
do.</div><a name="08060585000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee should understand&#151;hon. Members might already be aware
from press coverage&#151;that the amendments relate to a case in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham, who has taken
an active interest in it. They also raise general issues, however,
which is why I am happy to introduce them so that we can receive an
indication of the Government&#146;s position on these difficult but
interesting matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="08060585000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
case&#151;I am not going to dwell on it at length, because it is the
law that we want to discuss today&#151;relates to a lady, aged 42,
whose husband died suddenly in June last year. He was 30 at the time,
and the cause of his death was unclear, despite a post mortem. They
already had one child, but there were some questions about the
woman&#146;s fertility and they wished to have a further child. They
went to see a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist to discuss
whether the particular problem that she had might affect her natural
conception. Unfortunately, and tragically, the husband died the week
following
that.</div><a name="08060585000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sperm
was then taken from the man posthumously and stored. The legality of
that act was confirmed at the first stage, before it was carried out,
by an urgent out-of-hours court hearing in the High Court by telephone
conference. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority was not
represented, which might be relevant to what happened
subsequently.</div><a name="08060585000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal then was for the sperm to be used in treatment, either in this
country or abroad. There are difficulties with the existing law, as set
out by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, and I do not
think that the problems that this woman is encountering under that Act
will be made any easier under the proposals in the Bill. The Government
are pretty clear that they take the issue of consent very seriously.
The term used is &#147;effective consent&#148;, and there are
certain criteria for that. I do not think that anyone could generally
describe the proposals in the Bill as a watering down of what existed
in
1990.</div><a name="08060585000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Diane Blood case, which is the only legal precedent for this, sperm
was taken from Mr. Blood, albeit not posthumously, but while
he was in a coma. I happen to think that that case raises greater
issues around the removal of sperm, because there is a potential for
assault in such a case, when someone is not dead. It is not possible to
assault a dead body, even though there are obvious sensitivities
surrounding that.</div>
<a name="08060585000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Diane
Blood case, the sperm was taken and stored, as I understand it, without
a court hearing, and then the question was whether that could be used
for treatment without the effective consent. Under the 1990 Act,
effective consent for the storage of sperm requires it to be in
writing. Effective consent for the use of the sperm in treatment is
also required in writing. It must be extant and not withdrawn prior to
use. That clearly did not apply in the case of Diane Blood, although
she asserted strongly that she and her late husband had had a
discussion and that had said that he would have wanted her to have a
child after his death. There was certainly no doubt that they wanted to
have children
together.</div><a name="08060585000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that case, the HFEA would not allow the sperm to be used in treatment
in this country and would not allow export, although I understand that
it has the discretion to do so. Following a court hearing, the court
directed the HFEA to reconsider its decision, taking into account
European law. The HFEA, whether or not it did so, decided in the end to
allow Diane Blood to export the sperm to a European country&#151;I
believe that it was Belgium&#151;although I understand that that was
because it had run out of money to fight the case and had been given a
steer from the Government, whether appropriately or inappropriately,
not to pursue the matter much further.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div><a name="08060585000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
everyone recognises the immense campaigning effort that Diane Blood
went through to get to where she was then and, indeed, where she is
now: she has children and has helped to effect a change in the law to
allow posthumous fathers to be listed on birth certificates when the
consent is effective. I remember discussing&#151;I think that it was
in this very room&#151;the need for effective consent, so I find
myself in the curious position of speaking to this amendment when
previously in Committee I felt very strongly that there must be
effective consent for posthumous
paternity.</div><a name="08060585000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us deal with the legalities. The Minister is probably aware of this,
but for the benefit of the Committee, let me point out that the storage
and use of sperm in the UK is governed by the 1990 Act. It is an
offence to store or use gametes for treatment except in pursuance of a
licence, as we know. Every licence granted under the Act must have as a
condition that the provisions of schedule 3 to the Act are complied
with, and that requires effective consent. Unless a person has given
effective consent, their gametes must not be used in the provision of
treatment services to another; used to bring about the creation or
subsequent implantation of an embryo; or kept in storage. Effective
consent means that it must be in writing, that it must not be
withdrawn, and that it must specify what is to happen if the donor dies
or loses capacity. As I understand it, the Bill provides for similar
provisions, but also for the effective consent to be in writing and
signed by the
donor.</div><a name="08060585000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
HFEA can give a direction authorising the licence holder to arrange for
the transfer of gametes overseas under section 24(4) of the 1990 Act.
It can also modify the applicability of the requirements of sections 12
to 14 of the Act in respect of that
direction.</div><a name="08060585000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for
Twickenham, there was no effective consent but leaving aside the
question of whether the court was right to allow the sperm to be taken
and stored for the time being, we must ask whether the HFEA could use
its discretion. The authority is currently unwilling to use its
discretion, and setting out Parliament&#146;s intention in this
respect might be
useful.</div><a name="08060585000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are clearly strong personal factors in this case. There is no doubt, as
testified by the consultant, that the couple were seeking to have a
child. That is why amendment No. 11
states:</div><a name="08060585000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
consent under this Schedule by a deceased person from whom gametes have
been retrieved posthumously may be deemed to have been given and not
withdrawn if the consultant from whom the couple together were
receiving advice or treatment confirms in writing that the deceased
was, at the date of death, either receiving treatment or receiving
advice in respect of a clear and settled intention to have a child with
his
partner.&#148;</div><a name="08060585000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt that that would apply in this
case.</div><a name="08060585000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister was willing to consider the amendment, that would help the
lady, as long as she can continue to store the sperm. Otherwise, the
further provision that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham has
proposed would enable a court to intervene to give a second
view&#151;I guess that that is the best way of putting it. The
question is how rigidly we would like the law to specify that effective
consent must be written and thus given in advance, or whether the
circumstances in a case could give rise to a reasonable
belief&#151;recognised by the law, or a discretionary power&#151;to
give flexibility so that a woman widowed in such circumstances would be
permitted, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>even if they could not use the sperm here, to export the sperm and use
it in another country. I think that the question for the Government is
whether they will provide a discretionary arrangement in such cases, or
look to consider wording similar to that in amendment No. 11, which
would enable there to be some testimony as to the intentions and
wishes, and thus essentially the consent, of the
father.</div><a name="08060585000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
there is a problem about whether a person&#146;s intention to have a
child with someone when they were alive can be reasonably extended to
including the intention for their partner to raise a child on their own
in that person&#146;s absence, due to their death. It is very hard to
speculate about that. Some people would argue&#151;and I can see the
strength of this case&#151;that it is best to err on the side of
having the child because there is clearly a committed parent there. I
am on record as arguing that children can be brought up very
effectively by solo parents, whether widows or single women intending
to have a child through in vitro fertilisation. I think that the
argument and vote on that matter were won very clearly on the Floor of
the
House.</div><a name="08060585000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
find it quite strange that some newspapers that campaign actively
against the removal of the duty on the clinic to consider the need for
a father also campaigned actively for the creation of fatherless
families in the case of Diane Blood. My position is consistent,
assuming the issue of consent can be dealt with. I hope that the
Minister will understand that I have not gone into the details of the
case as there might well be further hearings. We are discussing
legislation, and I wanted to put this as generally as possible while
describing the example.</div>
<a name="08060585000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister has seen a letter and briefing that my hon. Friend the
Member for Twickenham wrote to the Secretary of State because
she replied on 13 March 2008. I will leave her to state the comments
that she made in that letter, rather than pre-empting her. I hope that
the Minister will understand the point of this proposal and look kindly
upon
it.</div><a name="08060585000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060585000181"></a><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con): I will just make a
couple of points about these intriguing amendments to which the hon.
Gentleman has spoken. He is absolutely right, and I feel very strongly
that there must be effective consent, certainly in writing, for
posthumous paternity. It would be very dangerous if we did not stick
whenever possible with consent as the cornerstone for the legislation
while, at the same time, being extremely sympathetic to individual
cases such as that highlighted by the hon. Gentleman. We would be led
into the difficult area of property rights and ownership of gametes, of
which there is a significant amount of case law in the United States
and Australia, but very minimal case law here in the
UK.</div><a name="08060585000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify two issues? First, how quickly do the gametes
deteriorate after death&#151;how quickly would they have to be
removed? Obviously, it would be very stressful and difficult for the
wife or partner of the deceased individual to have to make a rapid
decision, as I suspect that it would have to be.</div>
<a name="08060585000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, is
there any difference between the consent for the removal of gametes
posthumously and the consent for the removal of organs posthumously, or
do the same criteria and consent have to
apply?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000182"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon for
speaking to the amendments so clearly. I absolutely understand his
views on this, which are on record. However, the amendments raise a
series of important points, and as we start this debate around consent,
they go to absolutely the key points.</div>
<a name="08060585000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
principle of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 was that
gametes, including gametes used to create an embryo, should be stored
or used only in accordance with the wishes of the man or woman who
provided them. To remove any question of doubt concerning those wishes,
the Act requires that consent to storage and use of the gametes and
embryos must be given in writing. That is what the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to in terms of &#147;effective
consent&#148;, and that requirement is brought forward in schedule 3
to the
Bill.</div><a name="08060585000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08060585000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness touched lightly on United States
case law. The principle of control by consent, rather than ownership,
was taken from the recommendations of the Warnock committee, and I
believe that that remains valid today. That is why we have continued
with
it.</div><a name="08060585000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 12 would allow consent to be given for posthumous storage and use
by a man&#146;s surviving wife or partner, if a clinician who was
giving the couple treatment or advice on infertility at the time of the
man&#146;s death testified to the couple&#146;s wish to have a
child together. With the greatest respect, it cannot be automatically
assumed that the deceased would have been willing for his gametes to be
recovered, stored and then used by his partner after his death. That
raises quite different issues, and is a very different situation from a
couple seeking advice and treatment to have a child together in the
expectation that they would raise that child
together.</div><a name="08060585000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
difficulty is that, even if it were known that the deceased would have
had concerns about the use of his sperm to conceive a child after his
death, the amendment would render those concerns valueless. In such
incredibly difficult circumstances, that cannot be allowed. The right
to decide whether to pass on one&#146;s biological heritage is a
fundamental and it should not be taken away or superseded by the wishes
of another person, even those of a surviving partner. The Government
are firmly of the view that, in this context, the protection of an
individual&#146;s autonomy cannot be allowed to lapse, except in the
very specific and narrowly defined circumstances set out in schedule
3.</div><a name="08060585000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise, as I am sure every member of the Committee and of the House
would, that becoming a parent is the most rewarding and probably the
most overwhelming thing we can ever do. It is not difficult to
understand how the loss of the chance to have a family that has been
planned together can intensify the pain and grief felt at the sudden
death of a loving partner. But it is surely right that if a child is
conceived after the death of one of their parents, using that
parent&#146;s gametes, there must be no doubt whatever that it was
the wish of the deceased that the child should be born. The decision to
rest on written consent then becomes
crucial.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div><a name="08060585000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060585000183"></a><b class="B">Robert
Key</b> (Salisbury) (Con): Perhaps the Minister might mention
what consideration will be given to the child who is born in these
circumstances, because she has not done so. I feel very
strongly&#151;on religious, moral and ethical grounds&#151;that the
child&#146;s interests should come first in any consideration of
these matters. It is one thing to satisfy someone who has suffered the
tragic loss of her partner, but we simply should not ignore the fact
that a child will be brought into the world who will never have a
father.</div>
<a name="08060585000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000184"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point
about how we, as individuals, view that. Although we all recognise that
this is about the quality of parenting and how the parent relates to
the children, such decisions will raise issues for the parent, and I am
sure that those concerned will have thought carefully about
that.</div><a name="08060585000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but we are
looking at whether there is a legal right and what consent means in
this difficult area, where there is doubt because written consent has
not been provided. I entirely understand the complexities of the debate
about explaining the issues involved to a child and the issues that
that raises about the child&#146;s right to know. Inevitably, such
things would need to be addressed, and I acknowledge that. I was not
moving on to make that point, because I was concentrating
specifically&#151;particularly given that there is a live legal
case&#151;on what the requirements in the Act are, and why they are
phrased and presented in the way that they are.</div>
<a name="08060585000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
11 is intended to allow a court to make a decision on the use of
gametes when the HFEA has decided to defer a decision. As the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, the amendment relates only
to gametes that fall within the circumstances that he
outlined&#151;that is, those that have had consent deemed for storage
and use after
death.</div><a name="08060585000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
HFEA has an obligation to consider any licensing issues put before it,
including whether the use of gametes is lawful and whether export
abroad would be permissible. The HFEA defers making such decisions only
where there is a need for more information. In the case of the
constituent of the hon. Member for Twickenham, to which the hon. Member
for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred, the outcome is still the
subject of ongoing legal action. It is not reasonable to expect the
court to make a decision if all the facts pertinent to the case are not
known. I will not refer specifically to that ongoing case, but export
is a
consideration.</div><a name="08060585000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are satisfied&#151;I think we all would be&#151;that the
HFEA remains the appropriate authority to decide on the use of gametes
and embryos for treatment purposes. As we debate the schedule further,
we will probe the issue further, looking specifically at what consent
means and at the strict circumstances regarding whether there should be
any exceptions.</div>
<a name="08060585000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness asked me two
questions.</div><a name="08060585000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000185"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The Minister may not be able to answer this
question immediately and I do not think that she was about to cover the
issue, but before she moves on, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>does she agree that the HFEA, in such circumstances, has the ability and
discretion to authorise the export of
gametes?</div><a name="08060585000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
amendments made by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Deceased
Fathers) Act 2003, which was known as Tony Clarke&#146;s Bill, a
man</div><a name="08060585000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
be registered as the father of the child resulting from assisted
conception treatment undertaken after the man&#146;s death.
However...the man must have consented in writing to the use of his
sperm after his death and to being treated as the father of any
resulting child.&#148;</div>
<a name="08060585000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that imply that
Parliament contemplated the fact that there may be circumstances, even
after the passage of that Bill, which amended the Act, in which sperm
from a donor might be used after his death without written consent, but
not necessarily qualifying for registration as the
father?</div><a name="08060585000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000186"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman takes me into a difficult
area, because that question is being considered in a case. He asks the
direct question whether the HFEA has the power to license export. The
simple answer is yes, but we need to see the outcome of the court
action before we can be clear with regard to further points. At the
moment, the legislation is clear that consent is written consent, as it
would have to be in the case to which he
referred.</div><a name="08060585000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked two questions. First, how
quickly would the gametes need to be removed? I am told that it is
normally within hours of death, up to a maximum of six hours. Secondly,
what is the difference between the law governing gametes and the law
governing organs? I am not qualified in the law, so if he will forgive
me I would rather not go into the vagaries of the matter, but gametes,
including their posthumous removal, are governed by common law. The use
of gametes to create an embryo is tightly regulated by the 1990 Act,
which requires effective consent, so there are two different steps to
govern the process. The removal of organs after death is governed by
the Human Tissue Act 2004.</div>
<a name="08060585000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
the Human Tissue Act and common law requirements are likely to be
similar. Ultimately, it would be for the courts to decide to regulate
the removal of gametes and to determine its lawfulness. Removal is
under common law; use is set down in the 1990 Act. I hope that that is
clear. For people, like me, who are not legally qualified, and even for
some who are, the common law raises lots of complex
issues.</div><a name="08060585000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have explained to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon why the Government continue to resist the proposals in the
amendments. Having put our view on record, and bearing in mind the
outstanding legal case, I hope that he and his colleague, the hon.
Member for Twickenham, are satisfied that the Committee has discussed
the matter properly and that he will not press the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="08060585000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000187"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to hon. Members for their
contributions to the debate, but especially to the Minister for her
considered response. There are difficulties when one is seeking to
legislate and there is a live case, and I understand that the question
of export may come back to court in the near future. However, she has
confirmed what I think is indeed beyond doubt&#151;under the Act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>and the Bill, the HFEA has the discretion to license exports, even if it
is not possible to use sperm in this country because the effective
consent requirements have not been met. We must await the outcome of
the court
case.</div><a name="08060585000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08060585000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked an interesting question: he
wants to know whether there is a difference between taking organs
posthumously and the posthumous taking of gametes. Of course, there is.
The taking of organs is covered by the Human Tissue Act. Organs can be
taken under that Act, but clearly not with the same degree of effective
consent that applies in this case. The Human Tissue Act is about the
necessary processes and consents, but it certainly does not impose the
same degree of consent that is required here, because gametes are
special. We are talking about creating new life, and whatever the range
of opinion is on the matter there is no disputing the fact that gametes
should be treated differently from organs. The consent requirements
must therefore be greater.</div>
<a name="08060585000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to
the point made by the hon. Member for Salisbury, I have never disagreed
with him on any matter in the Bill&#151;except this one. I therefore
speak with due caution. I do not think it right to argue that there are
welfare considerations for the child. Even if this was allowed, a child
would be born who otherwise would not be born, and it would be a wanted
child&#151;a child that was
loved.</div><a name="08060585000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no evidence that children do not grow up well adjusted and happy
when brought up in the home by a widow or widower. That is despite the
drawbacks and disadvantages of losing a parent. Research in this area
has tried to track such families, and that has been shown to be the
case. I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a different view&#151;he
put it well on the Floor of the House. However, the prospect of
bringing a child into the world that never had a living father is not a
fair consideration in the absence of evidence of harm to the
child&#151;real evidence of significant harm&#151;in such
circumstances. None the less, I understand the sincerity of his views
and the clarity with which he brought them to the
fore.</div><a name="08060585000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have probably gone as far as we can with the amendments, and I am
grateful to the Minister for expressing her views. My hon. Friend the
Member for Twickenham, who has worked as tenaciously in this case, as
he always does, will be satisfied that we have discussed the matter. He
will obviously be disappointed that the Minister does not look
favourably on the amendments, but I understand her position. I am sure
that we all hope, at least on the personal matter, that the
consideration of the case by the court or by the HFEA produces an
outcome that brings satisfaction to the lady concerned.</div>
<a name="08060585000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to ask

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000190"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall be brief. The amendments are technical
and are the result of further scrutiny of the Bill. Amendment No. 64
replaces the phrase &#147;the incapacitated person&#148; with the
phrase &#147;person unable to sign&#148; to distinguish those who
are incapacitated due to illness, injury or physical disability from
those who lack the capacity to consent, which is relevant in the
context of later amendments to the
schedule.</div><a name="08060585000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the other place, a query was raised about the phrase &#147;child
donor&#148; in proposed new paragraph 9 of schedule 3 to the 1990 Act
if it refers to a child patient. To prevent confusion, minor technical
amendments have been
made.</div><a name="08060585000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060585000191"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tom Clarke</b> (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (Lab): I
understand what the Minister says about taking on board discussions in
another place. We have moved on from using the words &#147;child
donor&#148; to using &#147;C&#148;. However, that appears
elsewhere in the Bill, and I wonder whether it might create further
loopholes. Has the Minister considered using other words&#151;for
example, &#147;child patient&#148;&#151;rather than simply
adhering to
&#147;C&#148;?</div><a name="08060585000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000192"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am grateful for my right hon. Friend&#146;s
intervention. On his first point, I do not think that there will be any
confusion in substituting the letter &#147;C&#148; to replace the
words &#147;child donor&#148;. We are clearly talking in the
context of a child. Similarly, I do not see that there is inconsistency
in replacing the word &#147;patient&#148; with the letter
&#147;P&#148;. As we have discussed, in the exceptions in schedule
3, it is important to have consistency. After the discussions and
queries that arose in another place, I was advised that those changes
give greater clarity than the current wording and raise no further
difficulties in
interpretation.</div><a name="08060585000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000193"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The Minister has partially answered my point. I
understand that the amendments are about clarity and consistency. In
the original Bill, in some cases the child donor is referred to as
&#147;C&#148; and in others as the &#147;child donor&#148;. The
amendment provides consistency throughout the Bill and I have no
problem with it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000194"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. Clearly, in areas as complex as this and the 1990 Act, it
is important to have consistency and clarity throughout the
legislation. I assure my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill that the measure delivers that clarity and
consistency and therefore prevents any further misunderstanding or

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000196"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 29, in schedule 3, page 60,
line 36,after &#145;storage&#146;, insert
&#145;, embryo
testing&#146;.</div><a name="08060585000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000197"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Under the 1990 Act, consent must, quite
correctly, specify the purposes for which any gametes or embryos are
used. The Bill enhances that provision so that in addition to being
able to consent to the use of embryos for treatment or research, a
person may also specify that an embryo can be used in the training of
embryologists. Again, that is quite correct and I welcome it. It is
right that those undergoing treatment are able to choose what, if
anything, extra embryos are used for. Some people who donate embryos
may prefer them to be used for the treatment of other infertile
couples, while others may not like the prospect of their embryos being
used by other people and would prefer them to be used for research or
training.</div>
<a name="08060585000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Training is
essential and vital, and these challenging procedures must be completed
accurately. Without scientists who are well trained in research and IVF
techniques, success rates for IVF will inevitably be lower and research
could become less
fruitful.</div><a name="08060585000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would put embryo testing, which is not in the Bill, on the
list of embryological techniques. It would be helpful if the Minister
clarified why embryo testing is omitted, although other categories are
included. This is particularly important in pre-implementation genetic
diagnosis, or PGD, which is set to increase as more illnesses and
diseases are found to have a gene marker. Skills and experiences of
embryo testing will become even more important. The amendment would put
that in the Bill, so that that people who may choose to use their extra
embryos and give consent would understand the full range of techniques
covered by the phrase &#147;embryological techniques&#148;.
Amendment No. 29 is a consequential
amendment.</div>
<a name="08060585000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000198"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am pleased to speak to the amendment, because it
relates to a provision that was not originally included, but which I
and many other people had felt for a long time should have been. The
history is that there was always a feeling that there was an omission
in the original legislation, because it did not provide for consent to
the use of embryos for training
purposes.</div><a name="08060585000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was always difficult for clinics to know how new people could learn
embryological techniques, because although training is an integral part
of what any scientific laboratory or clinic does, it cannot always be
said to be a necessary part of treatment or an integral or necessary
part of research. There was always a fudge, and clinics and
laboratories were always concerned that they might be found to be
acting outside the law, and that it would be difficult to find enough
people trained in difficult techniques.</div>
<a name="08060585000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">My noble
Friend Baroness Tonge proposed a form of words like that which has now
been adopted, but unfortunately a peer, or peers, intervened to assert
that it was not necessary, and some momentum developed around that
idea. The Minister, whom I thought was about to accept the amendment in
principle, said that she would reflect on it. However, everything was
put right on Report and the Government returned with the provision that
is now paragraph 4(2) of schedule 3.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div><a name="08060585000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness making the case that some people who
give consent for embryos to be used might agree specifically to their
use in training people for general IVF work, but not for PGD, because
of the sensitivities about that? I think he is making that case, and
arguing that therefore the consent needs to specify it. I would be
interested to hear whether the Minister thinks that it is a matter for
primary legislation, because merely separating out embryo testing in
paragraph 4(2) does not provide that the consent form will be that
detailed.</div><a name="08060585000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key question, regardless of the fate of the amendment, is what the
detail of the consent forms will be, and whether the Government intend
to tell the HFEA that its code of practice must make it clear that
consent forms must in turn make it clear, in terms, that PGD requires
specific
consent.</div><a name="08060585000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not see a problem with that, because I recognise that there may be
those who have concerns about training people to do something that they
think is unethical on personal grounds, even though they accept the
destruction of embryos. That would not be a problem, because I think
that the consent form is already relatively detailed. I would be
grateful if the Minister confirmed that the issue may well be dealt
with just in terms of how the consent is obtained, rather than by
making detailed specifications in primary legislation, although our
debate and the point that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness is
making will certainly draw the attention of the HFEA to the
issue.</div><a name="08060585000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000199"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Schedule 2 introduces the provisions that allow
embryos to be used for the purposes of training persons in
embryological techniques, including embryo biopsy and embryo storage.
There are consequential provisions in schedule 3, relating to consent
to the use of embryos for this purpose. We might, I think, come on to a
discussion of that, so perhaps it is sensible to answer one of the
questions that has been posed in that
context.</div><a name="08060585000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
provision to allow training is necessary because it is appropriate for
embryologists to practise certain techniques before carrying them out
in treatment&#151;for example, embryo biopsy, in which cells are
removed from the embryo to be tested for genes that result in serious
medical conditions. There is no specific provision to allow
embryologists to train in that technique. The Bill will rectify that to
allow training for embryo
biopsy.</div><a name="08060585000175"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08060585000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
discussion in another place, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon said, the training provision was widened to include not only
embryo biopsy, but techniques involved in embryo storage, such as
vitrification and other embryological techniques. The Bill states that
training purposes can include</div>
<a name="08060585000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;embryo biopsy,
embryo storage or other embryological
techniques&#148;.</div><a name="08060585000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 27 and 29 would amend the consent provisions in relation to
training of embryologists to list embryo testing specifically as one of
the purposes for which consent can be given in relation to embryos
being used in
training.</div><a name="08060585000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
embryological technique primarily associated with embryo testing is
embryo biopsy. The Bill already allows for other embryo testing
techniques, including some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>that are not embryo biopsy. The amendment&#146;s only effect would be
to specify other techniques associated with embryo testing in the list
of purposes before the catch-all purpose of &#147;other embryological
techniques&#148;.</div><a name="08060585000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the two specific techniques listed are the only examples and there is
another catch-all purpose, which will allow other embryo testing
techniques, I do not feel that amendment would add anything to the
provisions. Perhaps the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness can tell us
exactly what is missing. The two specific techniques and the catch-all
purpose cover all the techniques that he wishes to identify, so I take
it that he has tabled the amendments to probe and to satisfy himself on
this important issue. I therefore hope that he will not press them to a
Division.</div><a name="08060585000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000200"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> If the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness does
not mind my intervening again, I interpret the point of his amendment
to be identifying whether people will have an opportunity to consent to
the specific purpose of training for PGD. He may be reassured by
schedule 3(2) of the 1990 Act, which says that a
consent</div><a name="08060585000165"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
specify conditions subject to which the embryo may be so
used&#148;.</div><a name="08060585000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
allows the HFEA, for example, to tell clinics in its guidance or code
of practice that patients should be given the opportunity to specify
conditions. I have not seen the consent form for that area and, as
training has been specifically identified, new consent forms will have
to be arranged, but the hon. Gentleman may wish to probe the Minister
further on her understanding of the
question.</div><a name="08060585000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is &#147;may&#148; specify, not &#147;must&#148;,
which I think is appropriate, but I urge those considering such matters
to listen to the concerns raised by the hon. Gentleman, which I share.
There must be the ability for consents to be specific in this area,
even though only a very small proportion of people giving consent will
want to volunteer a specific exclusion. However, they must have that
right; it is only right and proper that  they
do.</div><a name="08060585000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that those remarks are helpful to the hon. Gentleman, and that the
Minister might consider coming back on the particular issue of the
consent form at a later
date.</div><a name="08060585000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000201"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution
on the amendments, which has been helpful and, as always,
detailed.</div><a name="08060585000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of tabling the amendments was to raise the importance of these
issues with the HFEA, particularly with regard to the point about the
specificity of consent, which the hon. Gentleman re-emphasised. The
Minister has, as always, been very clear, yet she seemed to be arguing
on the one hand that embryo testing is a separate area, while on the
other arguing that it is a subset of other areas in the
Bill.</div><a name="08060585000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
this is a probing amendment and the importance of the issue has been
put on the record by me and by the hon. Gentleman. The HFEA needs to
clarify the fact that it will be possible to be
specific.</div><a name="08060585000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000202"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to correct a point that I made early
in my remarks: there are consequential provisions to schedule 3
relating to consent for the use 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>of embryos for this purpose. I need to expand on that: in relation to
the point raised by the hon. Gentleman, it means absolutely that the
person has to consent. That clearly raises issues around it being made
absolutely clear and consent being given for each process. When we get
on to other amendments, he will see how that is reinforced and
continues to be underlined. Written consent is
necessary.</div><a name="08060585000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000203"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b><b class="B"> </b>I understand that. The Minister&#146;s
intervention has helped to clarify the fact that the consent form can
specify, in detail, subsets of consent that are not in the
Bill&#151;if I have correctly understood what she said. Someone will
therefore be able to consent for their gametes or embryos to be used
just for embryo testing. If that is the case, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08060585000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000204"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in
schedule 3, page 59, leave out lines 36 to
40.</div><a name="08060585000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment. I fully support the consent that must be at the
heart of the Bill, and it is right that people should know and
understand what they are consenting to and the purposes for which their
gametes are used. We must ensure, however, that this necessary
cornerstone of the Bill is not over-bureaucratic, hindering potential
research. Not only may it be difficult to keep track of what each
individual has consented to, but there could be a problem if a cell
line has been developed from a person&#146;s gametes and is ready for
use in clinical trials but the donor has not consented to that
particular use. This could result in the work being wasted and having
to be
repeated.</div><a name="08060585000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
researchers start a project, they may specify the terms of reference to
which donors consent, but, as we all know, science and research
develop. Will consent have to be regained for research outside the
original terms of the consent, and will researchers have to go back to
the original donor for additional consent as science moves
on?</div><a name="08060585000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000205"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The Bill requires consent from any person whose
cells or gametes are used to create a human admixed embryo. Consent is
also required for the subsequent use of any embryos
created.</div><a name="08060585000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would remove the provision that requires the consent to be
linked to a research project and that enables a person to specify
conditions subject to which their embryo can be used. The purpose of
that provision is to mirror the consent provisions for human embryos,
which enable a donor to place limits on how any embryo created using
their genetic material can be
used.</div><a name="08060585000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions also allow a person to place conditions on the consent, such
as specifying that their cells may be used only for projects of a
specific nature&#151;for example, research on motor neurone
disease.</div><a name="08060585000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accepting
the amendment would mean that each person could give only a general
written consent before the cells or gametes may be used for any
research project involving admixed embryos, without the individual
necessarily being fully informed. I say to the hon. Member for Boston
and Skegness that the intention&#151;I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>think it is his as well&#151;is that admixed embryos should reflect
the same consent provisions as for human embryos and the use of genetic
material.</div><a name="08060585000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not the intention that we create a broad general consent, and it
should not be possible for that to happen. We are quite clear about
what we are doing. If the hon. Gentleman feels that we are being
unnecessarily restrictive&#151;we do not think that we are&#151;I
am happy to hear further points on the matter. I would certainly want
to satisfy myself that there is a mirror here, and I would go away and
ensure in discussions with parliamentary counsel that that is clear. We
are not seeking to put different bureaucratic arrangements in place; we
are seeking to ensure that the procedures are the same as for embryos.
I hope that that clarifies the point for
him.</div><a name="08060585000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000206"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I wanted to wait until the Minister explained the
point of this subsection before making a contribution. The treatment of
human admixed embryos seems to be different from that of general
embryos. In respect of the use of embryos generally, the illustrative
text
says:</div><a name="08060585000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
consent... must specify one... of the following
purposes&#151;...</div><a name="08060585000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
use for the purposes of any project of
research,</div><a name="08060585000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">and
may specify conditions subject to which the embryo may be so
used.&#148;</div><a name="08060585000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case of an admixed embryo, it states that the
consent</div><a name="08060585000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
specify use for the purposes of a
project&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08060585000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
&#147;any&#148; project of research&#151;and then goes on to
say</div><a name="08060585000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
specify
conditions&#148;.</div><a name="08060585000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a difference, and if the Minister is saying that she will look to
see whether it is right that there is a reason for that, I welcome it.
I am not sure that I can see
that.</div><a name="08060585000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000207"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Yes, that is precisely my point. We want the
same as we have elsewhere. We want a person to be able to give broad
consent if they choose, but if they want to specify a
condition&#151;to go back to our previous debate&#151;that should
also be open to
them.</div><a name="08060585000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a question of the drafting of the Bill, rather than of the
Government&#146;s intention. In my view, the Government&#146;s
intention is to continue to hold the position as we do for
embryos&#151;that a person can give broad consent if they choose, or
specify conditions if they choose. That is what this measure is
supposed to
provide.</div><a name="08060585000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand absolutely the point that the hon. Member for Oxford, West
and Abingdon is rightly making, which is that we need to ensure that
&#147;a&#148; project has the same meaning, so that the wording
does not put in more. I have told the Committee that my officials are
having discussions with parliamentary counsel to ensure that that is
what the wording delivers. I assure hon. Members that that is the
intention, but if for some reason the wording does not do that, we will
need to come back to the Committee. However, that is the clear
intention and our
understanding.</div><a name="08060585000176"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000211"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale. This is a
complex and important series of amendments on the issue of consent. As
I go through them and explain their purpose, I will also reflect on the
way in which hon. Members&#146; amendments interact with them,
because some do approximately the same thing. As you rightly said,
there are amendments to Government amendment No. 102, so it seems
appropriate to explain how the measures interact.</div>
<a name="08060585000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed, consent forms one of the cornerstones of the 1990 Act. A
person&#146;s gametes cannot be used to create embryos without their
express consent. Schedule 3 replaces the consent provisions in the 1990
Act, bringing them up to date to reflect new techniques for creating
embryos by, for example, requiring consent for the use of cells to
create embryos.</div>
<a name="08060585000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government listened carefully to concerns raised in another place about
the framework for consent in relation to the use of stored cells and
cells from children with serious diseases, but we also made it clear
that any exceptions to the requirement for consent would need to be
compatible with convention rights. The Government amendments in this
group provide for certain exceptions, while providing safeguards in
recognition of those
rights.</div><a name="08060585000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 7, 9 and 10, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West
and Abingdon, provide for similar exemptions to the need for consent,
although they do not cover&#151;I do not mean to imply
criticism&#151;all the eventualities covered by the Government
amendments, such as the right of a child who becomes competent to
consent and situations regarding adults who lack capacity. I hope that
that will become clear when I outline the Government
amendments.</div><a name="08060585000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000212"></a>Dr.

<a name="08060585000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000213"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I have not actually said very much yet, but I
will give way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="08060585000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000214"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> As the author of amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10, I
should say that I fully accept that amendments Nos. 9 and 10 do not
deal with adults without capacity or with some of the conditions and
provisions that the Government amendments do. Perhaps it will save the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>Minister some time if I say that she does not need to explain why that
is the case. I accept that her amendments&#151;certainly once she has
explained them, or accepted my amendments to them&#151;are better
than amendments Nos. 9 and 10.</div>
<a name="08060585000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000215"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am grateful for that. I had intended to do
what the hon. Gentleman said. He is very knowledgeable about these
issues and he will want to make his own representations to the
Committee&#151;I would not dream of doing that for him.</div>
<a name="08060585000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
exemptions for consent requirements for the use of stored tissue. With
regard to stored cells, the Government amendments apply only to cells
taken and stored before the commencement of the Bill&#146;s
provisions. The exception applies only if the HFEA is satisfied that
the cells are anonymous and that the donor cannot be identified, or
that the licence holder cannot reasonably trace the
donor.</div><a name="08060585000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the researcher can identify and trace the donor, unless the donor
consents themselves, the cells cannot be used. If the person identifies
the donor, and they are found to be deceased, consent would be required
from a person such as a close relative, as set out in the hierarchy
model found in the Human Tissue Act 2004. Before the cells can be used,
the HFEA must be satisfied that scientific research would be adversely
affected to a significant extent if the only cells that could be used
were cells for which consent had been obtained.</div>
<a name="08060585000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments reflect the fact that rare or well-researched samples are a
valuable asset for better understanding and treating serious diseases.
We have weighed the burden of being unable to use those cells against
the rights of the person who originally donated them, and we believe
that we have struck the right balance with the amendments.</div>
<a name="08060585000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">On consent
for the use of cells from children, the amendments apply when those
children would never be able to give their consent because of age or
lack of capacity. This is the case with children affected by certain
aggressive forms of diseases such as muscular dystrophy, Batten disease
and spinal muscular atrophy. To that end, the amendments propose that
children with such conditions who are too young to consent, or who lack
capacity, should be excluded from the requirement for effective
consent, if a person with parental responsibility gives consent. This
exception is subject to strict safeguards that ensure that a
child&#146;s cells cannot be used unless the HFEA is satisfied that
the child suffers from a serious medical condition, that the research
is intended to increase knowledge about the condition or its treatment,
and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that research of
comparable effectiveness could not be carried out using the cells of a
person who could give their own consent.</div>
<a name="08060585000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
consent for the use of cells from adults who lack capacity. Following
further consideration of the exception relating to cells from children,
it became clear that it was also desirable to make provision to enable
the use of cells from an adult who lacked capacity in very limited
circumstances. That would be to address situations when, for example,
rare genetic conditions led to the sudden onset of lifelong incapacity.
Following the precedent of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Government
amendments propose that in such cases, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>the researcher would need to approach the carer of the individual and
consult them about the views or the wishes of the person
involved.</div><a name="08060585000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
this exception is subject to a number of stringent safeguards. The HFEA
must be satisfied&#151;at the time the adult lacks capacity and is
unlikely to have capacity again&#151;that the adult suffers from a
serious medical condition, that the proposed research is intended to
increase knowledge about the condition or its treatment, that there is
no evidence that the adult would have refused to participate and, most
importantly, that there are reasonable grounds for believing that
research of comparable effectiveness could not be carried out using the
cells of a person who could have given their own consent.</div>
<a name="08060585000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all cases,
it will be for the researcher to provide evidence that satisfies the
HFEA that all conditions have been met before a licence to undertake
the research may be given. The exemptions are rooted in exceptional
circumstances. The potential for benefits to the sufferers of serious
conditions must be too great to overlook, and any research that can be
undertaken in the hope of better treating or curing those conditions
must be allowed to
continue.</div><a name="08060585000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall pass over amendment No. 8 and deal with amendment No. 32, which
was tabled by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness. One of the
conditions is that the gametes were removed from the child lawfully
before they turned 18, and another is that the child is not competent
to consent. If a child were able to consent, it would not be
appropriate to store their gametes without consent. The child must be
about to undergo medical treatment that is likely to impair their
fertility, and the storage of gametes must be in the child&#146;s
best interest. In addition, if the child becomes competent, they can
decide what to do with their stored
gametes.</div><a name="08060585000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the age at which the gametes of a child could be
stored without their consent. Under the amendment, the gametes must
have been taken from the child before they reached the age of 16,
otherwise, they could not be stored without their consent. That would
mean that if a 17 or 18-year-old lacked competence to consent and was
about to undergo medical treatment that was likely to impair their
fertility, their gametes could not be stored because they would not
have been taken before they reached the age of 16. I concede that it
would be unusual for a 16 or 17-year-old not to be competent to
consent, but that is not in itself a reason not to offer them the same
protection as others in the exceptional circumstances in which they are
not
competent.</div><a name="08060585000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me deal with the amendments to Government amendment No.
102.</div><a name="08060585000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000216"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> To clarify the situation, I would be grateful if
the Minister dealt with amendment No. 8, which is not reflected in her
own amendments. It deals with a different
matter:</div><a name="08060585000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Cases
where consent not required for use in research to preserve
fertility&#148;.</div><a name="08060585000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000217"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am sorry. I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman;
I thought that he was satisfied on all his amendments. Amendment No. 8
would extend provision to allow the use of gametes from children for
research 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>into the preservation of their fertility without their consent. In some
cases, that would be tissue from the testes or ovary that could be
matured into gametes in vitro but, in the case of some boys who had
reached puberty but were not competent to consent, the measure would
facilitate storage of a sperm
sample.</div><a name="08060585000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government see several problems with the amendment, and our primary
concern relates to the importance of consent. Provisions in the 1990
Act and the Bill are based on the fundamental principle of consent that
we have been considering all morning. Consent is particularly important
in the context of creating embryos from a person&#146;s gametes.
Equally, using a person&#146;s gametes without consent should happen
only with very strong
justification.</div><a name="08060585000177"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="08060585000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Successfully
treated children whose gametes were stored without consent would, in
the majority of cases, gain competence. It would be appropriate at that
stage for them to make a decision about the use of their own gametes,
including whether they wanted research to be carried out on
them.</div><a name="08060585000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
gametes are not being used to create embryos, research on them is not
in the remit of the HFEA. That means that an HFEA licence is not needed
to carry out the research and the requirement for consent is governed
by common law. Any research carried out in such circumstances might be
possible with parental consent and if the research could be
demonstrated to be in the best interests of the child, but that would
ultimately be for a court to
decide.</div><a name="08060585000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government feel that the requirement for consent is very important and
that it should be deviated from only in very exceptional circumstances,
such as when there are no other options. In the circumstances that the
amendment addresses, it could be possible to obtain consent from the
person prior to any research. Additionally, there would be scope for
research through other means. We do not think that the circumstances
proposed warrant an exception to the general principle of consent,
especially in the light of alternative options. I thus ask the hon.
Gentleman not to press the amendment to a Division, although I am sure
he will want to make a contribution, to which I would be happy to
respond.</div><a name="08060585000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I finally deal with amendments (a) and (b) to Government amendment No.
102, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon? The Government amendment will ensure that, among other
safeguards, the HFEA must be satisfied that scientific research will be
adversely affected to a &#147;significant extent&#148; before
research may be undertaken using cells stored before commencement of
the Act where effective consent to the use in embryo research is not in
place.</div><a name="08060585000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(a) would remove the words &#147;significant extent&#148;, thus
meaning that scientific research need be adversely affected by only a
small degree before such cells could be used without effective consent
being in place. As I have already stated, we have weighed the
scientific burden of being unable to use existing cells against the
rights of the person who originally donated them. To strike the right
balance, we have taken the view that science must be affected to a
significant extent. This delicate balance takes account of scientific
need  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>while protecting the rights of the donor. If I may be a little more
specific, the research must be adversely affected as opposed to
temporarily inconvenienced, or having extra checks caused that could be
completed in a short time. The Government used such wording in the
amendment to ensure that the effect would be significant and
adverse.</div><a name="08060585000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
(b) relates to the efforts that a licence holder must have made to have
satisfied the HFEA that a person is not able to be contacted. The
Government amendments require the licence holder to satisfy the HFEA
either that the person is unable to be contacted, or, if they are dead,
that consent has been obtained from a relative or close friend. This
means that if a licence holder is unable to contact an
individual&#151;because the samples that they have are anonymous, or
they do not have enough information to make contact&#151;the cells
may be used, subject to the other safeguards. If a researcher has
reason to believe that the individual is dead&#151;for example if
their age when they made the donation and the period for which the
cells have been stored indicate that the person would be aged 130,
which would be unlikely&#151;it is reasonable to take the appropriate
steps. They must therefore contact a close relation or other person in
accordance with the hierarchy in the Human Tissue Act and obtain their
consent.</div><a name="08060585000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require the researcher to know that the individual was
deceased, rather than to have reason to believe it. It would not have a
large impact on the provisions, but it could cause confusion. If a
researcher possesses information suggesting that a person is deceased,
they should take steps to obtain consent. Requiring the researcher to
know that a donor is dead would not be clear because it would not be
apparent what information the researcher would need to know for certain
and what steps they would need to take to obtain that. We would not
expect licence holders to close their mind to facts in their possession
that suggested a person was dead before going to the relatives. The
Government amendments require licence holders to act reasonably, which
is as it should be. If the concern is about anonymous tissue that is so
old that it is clear that the donor would be deceased, that is not a
problem. If the cells are anonymised, they can be used without consent
even if it is likely that the donor is dead.</div>
<a name="08060585000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
this will be quite a substantial debate. I have introduced the broad
thrust of the Government amendments, so I will be happy to listen
carefully, as always, to what other Members say about the matter and
then respond.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000218"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The arcane aspects of scheduling and formally
putting motions are not always understood, even by Committee members,
so let me explain the process. For the moment, only Government
amendment No. 65 has been moved. The rest are being debated but have
not been moved. In due course, and at the appropriate time, I propose
to call Government amendments up to No. 102 en bloc. If any hon.
Members who have tabled amendments wish to move them&#151;I think
that that relates to amendments Nos. 32, 8 and 7, in addition to
amendments (a) and (b) to Government amendment No. 102&#151;they must
indicate that they wish to do so, and I will call them at the
appropriate time. I hope that that is clear.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060585000219"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> This is a critical debate. The Minister&#146;s
exposition clarified to a certain extent the changes proposed after a
very significant debate in the other place. The Government amendments
and the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon and myself demonstrate that there is unanimity across the
political parties about the necessity to change the original measures
dealing with the complex matters of consent and exceptions to
consent.</div>
<a name="08060585000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Minister for her clarification of my amendment No. 32, which has put my
mind at rest. I shall address my initial remarks to amendment No.
7.  I confirm that amendment No. 102 supersedes amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>No. 7. I think that we all accept that the valuable work on pre-existing
cell lines would have been lost if the amendments had not been tabled.
I accept the potential for increased costs, in both money and time, of
replacing the valuable cell lines in place at the moment. I support
Government amendment No. 102, but I have some specific questions for
the Minister to address in her response.</div>
