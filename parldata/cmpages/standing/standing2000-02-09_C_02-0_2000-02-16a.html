<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Withdrawing or withholding</center></H4>
of medical treatment
<P>
<B>Mr. Joe Ashton </B>(Bassetlaw): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 5, after `person' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`directly'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment that would insert ``directly'' after ``person'' in the clause, which reads
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It shall be unlawful for any person responsible for the care of a patient''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The net is spread wide—everyone in a hospital could be said to have that responsibility. It would be nonsense to introduce a law that could prosecute 15 or 20 people involved in a patient's death in the way in which the Bill specifies.
<P>
The Tony Bland case has been referred to many times, and I would have liked to have talked at length about it on the Floor of the House. When 95 football fans died at the Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989, I was an eye-witness standing not much further from the incident than the distance between me and the end of the Room. I saw those unfortunate fans crushed to death, and saw the police standing still with rigid iron discipline. The person who should have instructed them to open the gates to let the youngsters run on to the pitch had frozen in shock or fear and did not give the order. The crushing took place for 20 or 25 minutes, and many of the fans were literally crushed to death.
<P>
Three or four fans survived and came round after a few weeks, but Tony Bland, who was 18, was starved of oxygen when he was crushed against the barriers for a considerable time. He was later diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state and cared for at the Airedale general hospital in Keighley, where he lived. After eight months, the neurologist, Mr. Jim Howe, was informed by the medical defence unit of the district coroner that disconnecting the feeding tube that kept Tony Bland alive could leave him open to a charge of murder or manslaughter. That test case is what the Bill is all about.
<P>
A plea was made to the Home Office by the Airedale national health service trust and the then Conservative Member of Parliament for Keighley, Gary Waller. I think that he was a supporter of the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton), but a lot of people were involved and it is difficult to remember. That plea did not result in a change in the law. Mr. Waller was a member of the organisation concerned with such matters, ALERT—Against Legalised Euthanasia, Research and Teaching. John Patten, then a Conservative Home Office Minister, said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there were no plans for a change in the law to allow artificial treatment to be withdrawn from Tony Bland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He referred to the Criminal Law Revision Committee, which covered the subject in 1980 and recommended that no changes be made.
<P>
Tony Bland's parents were in deep distress. His doctor decided to apply to the High Court. The case was backed on British Medical Association advice that artificial feeding was medical treatment and therefore could be withdrawn. Lawyers acting not for the parents but for the NHS trust submitted an affidavit to the family division of the High Court, which held a two-day hearing. Tony Bland's father gave evidence, and the Official Solicitor's counsel argued that it would constitute murder to cease treatment. The health authority was represented. The president of the family division, Sir Stephen Brown, later ruled that doctors may lawfully discontinue all life-sustaining treatment and medical support measures. The Official Solicitor announced that there would be an appeal in the House of Lords.
<P>
The appeal dragged on until 30 November 1992, when the judges were asked to give a definitive ruling. The Master of the Rolls and Lord Justice Butler-Sloss said that they were likely to dismiss the appeal, but they gave the Official Solicitor leave to appeal to the House of Lords. The position of Tony Bland was analysed by the most eminent legal brains in the country. The full Appeal Court judgment was made that the withdrawal of medical care, including the removal of artificial feeding procedures, was not unlawful when the patient was in a persistent vegetative state from which he would never recover and when it was known that, after such withdrawal, the patient would die.
<P>
However, in such cases application can be made to the court for the proposal to be sanctioned. In December 1992, the Law Lords reserved judgment until the new year. On 4 February 1993, the Law Lords ruled unanimously that artificial feeding should be withdrawn from Tony Bland and called on Parliament to legislate on when the doctors could stop such futile medical treatment. I presume that the Bill is a result of that terrible accident. The Law Lords expressed unease at having to rule in such a difficult area, without legislative backup for their decision. Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord Lowry, Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Mustill stressed that there was a crucial difference between withdrawing treatment and actively tending life. The ruling was backed by the BMA.
<P>
The Bill will overturn the rulings of those Law Lords, the evidence that was submitted and the legal arguments that went on for three or four years. It is trying to say that a handful of Members of Parliament know better.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton </B>(Congleton): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the BMA's advice was limited to a paper that was drawn up by a mere handful of doctors, without consultation with its membership? It had not been adopted as official BMA policy at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Nevertheless, the Law Lords took each of those points into consideration. I wish that we could have had this sort of debate on the Floor of the Houses, but many of us were not called.
<P>
When the Law Lords made their decision, a Catholic priest, Father James Morrow, threatened Tony Bland's parents, the doctors and Airedale national health service trust with a private prosecution for murder if they allowed Tony Bland to die. In other words, anyone connected with the situation would have had to face a murder charge. In effect, that is what is meant by the words ``any person responsible''. Father Morrow was refused access to the Airedale hospital. Three weeks later, treatment was withdrawn from Tony Bland. On 3 March 1993 at 9.15 pm, he died aged 22, nine days after the treatment was withdrawn.
<P>
I shall refer later to evidence given by experts on comas, who say that no one has ever come out of a coma after 12 months. Yet that poor lad had been in a coma since April 1989. Some people in comas have stayed alive for as long as 30 years. Under the Bill, people in a persistent vegetative state—1,500 or 2,000 people a year, perhaps even more, many of whom will have sustained head injuries from road accidents, such as young people on motorbikes—may be kept alive for 30 years or more, irrespective of whether their parents have begged and pleaded for the poor patient to be put out of not, perhaps, torment but a vegetative state, a phrase that sums up the condition well.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the BMA does not differentiate between decisions for patients in PVS, to which he refers, and decisions for patients with other serious conditions, such as severe stroke or dementia? He must be aware that the Bland case exposed a legal loophole, which the BMA has extended to cover other groups. It will not stop there, but will go on and on. Is he happy about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I am happy that doctors should make the decisions. They know a lot more than politicians. I appreciate the hon. Lady's motives, but she is trying to introduce religious dogma into health service decisions. I do not want to start a doctrinaire row. The hon. Lady is fully entitled to her view, as are all hon. Members. If they or their relatives do not want the treatment, that is up to them, but hon. Members are not entitled to impose their dogma on members of the public who do not believe in it. A humanist case could be made that we are in charge of our own bodies. I do not want to argue about the doctrinaire side of the matter, because we could argue about that for ever. Politics based on doctrinaire issues, as we have witnessed in Northern Ireland, ends up in wrangles and rows and does not encourage proper judgments.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): The hon. Gentleman keeps introducing emotional arguments. Does he accept that the problem in Northern Ireland is not religious dogma but political dogma? Does he further accept that humanist dogma is possible, too?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go too far down that road, I would prefer hon. Members to debate the Bill rather than the albeit serious problems of Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brian Iddon </B>(Bolton, South-East): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. One hon. Member at a time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I shall return to the amendment. I did not want to start a row. I am merely trying to distinguish between health service decisions and theories or doctrinaire decisions.
<P>
Mr. Bland died nine days after the treatment was withdrawn, aged 22. Again, Father James Morrow tried to bring a private prosecution for murder against Mr. Jim Howe, the neurologist in charge. The magistrates refused to allow him to do so. An inquest six months later ruled that Tony Bland died as a result of the crush at the Hillsborough football stadium, not as a result of the doctors' decisions. There was a further inquest. The case was presented to the highest Law Lords in the country. The legal aspect of the case took almost two years. All the time, his parents and family experienced stress and trauma, and continued paying him visits. They suffered tremendous nervous exhaustion. They wanted their son to live, but he could not. Let us imagine that torment. Many members of the Committee have children. They would want their children to live in that state, after a terrible accident that has been shown on television, has involved much trauma and many inquiries and has been discussed both in the House and elsewhere. Let us imagine the horrendous feeling that such parents must have. Yet the Committee is saying that Tony Bland should be alive today, continuing to be fed, and that the torment of his parents should continue indefinitely.
<P>
The inquest held four and a half years after the poor lad was crushed ruled that he died as a result of the crush at Hillsborough. Father James Morrow, who attended the inquest, was not allowed to question witnesses and a verdict of accidental death was recorded. My amendment provides that ``directly'' must be inserted into the clause—otherwise Father James Morrow could accuse parents of murder and anyone could be dragged into such a situation, which could happen again. The fact that the Hillsborough disaster got so much publicity does not mean that there might not be— today, even—a road accident in which someone is squashed and goes into a coma that drags on and on.
<P>
If the Bill is passed, situations like those that the poor parents of Tony Bland suffered will be repeated ad nauseum throughout the country, with people having to go to the High Court, health service trusts getting involved and all the paraphernalia that drags on for years, with a tremendous traumatic impact. I understand that the hon. Member for Congleton and her supporters want to save life; I support that, but when a coma has gone on for years there has to come a time when the medical people are allowed to make judgments.

<P>

<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I appreciate the motivation behind the amendment. I am not a lawyer, but am slightly worried that inserting the word ``directly'' may imply that those people who are not directly involved with the care of a patient have no status in the decision-making in regard to that patient. In the Tony Bland case, it was absolutely right that a team rather than an individual clinician made a considered decision. However, the Bill goes much further than considering tragic circumstances such as persistent vegetative states. It implies that treatment must be instituted or cannot be withheld in all sorts of other circumstances, which with your permission, Mr. Gale, I shall touch on during the stand part debate.
<P>
If the Bill dealt with the future care only of people in persistent vegetative states, the amendment would be helpful, but as the Bill ranges so much wider, it is not. I would not like individual GPs looking after someone at home or in a nursing home to be required to seek several other opinions before they could make a decision on whether to institute a particular course of treatment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> I should like to comment briefly on the speech made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton). Everyone in the Room and outside of it will of course have the deepest sympathy for and understanding of the situation in which the Bland family found themselves. Their much-loved son went off to a football match, suffered that appalling accident, never expressed any view on what should happen to him should he ever become vegetative, the process of law was undertaken—
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Is the hon. Lady suggesting that advance directives should be taken into account and that if Tony Bland had made such an advance directive, that would have been a material contribution to the decision-making process?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I am suggesting nothing of the sort—I said that Tony Bland did not express to his family or anyone else his wishes on the subject. What 18-year-old would have done? At that age, one thinks that one is invincible. I was saying merely that he had not expressed a view and that, as the hon. Member for Bassetlaw described, the process of the courts was undertaken.
<P>
Although the inquest's verdict was accidental death, Tony Bland actually died from the withdrawal of hydration and nutrition—food and fluids—and there is no getting round that. Legal people can say what they like, but what I said happens to be the truth. The verdict was upheld, but the fact that three out of the five Law Lords came to that decision does not mean that, ethically, it was correct.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bassetlaw said that he would prefer to leave such decisions to doctors. However, leaving everything to doctors is as dangerous as leaving everything to politicians. The relationship between doctor and patient is well established in law and there is no doubt that the doctor is responsible for, and owes a duty of care to, the patient. That relationship is primarily covered by the concept of responsibility in clause 1. However, if for the purpose of hastening or causing the death of a patient, a nurse or other individual were responsible for a decision to withdraw—and the action of withdrawing—treatment, the Bill would, rightly, cover that situation. Was the hon. Gentleman arguing that nurses or others should be allowed to kill patients? I do not think that anyone could argue that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am trying to follow the debate closely. The hon. Lady clearly does not agree with the conclusion at the inquest that Tony Bland died of the injuries that he had originally received. Is she suggesting that the doctors' purpose was to cause death, or does she agree that the doctors' purpose was to cease treatment, allowing death to occur, following a dreadful accident?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> My answer is the obvious one, which has been repeated many times. If food and fluids are withdrawn, death is inevitable. If medical treatment is withdrawn, death is not inevitable Therefore, the doctors' purpose in that case was to bring to an end the life of that patient in PVS by the withdrawal of food and fluids. I hope that that answers the question asked by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand). I know that he does not agree with me, but that is the simple principle laid down in the Bill.
<P>
Both the United Nations declaration and the European convention on human rights enshrine the right to life. I think that this country has signed both; perhaps the Minister can confirm that later. The concept that we own our own bodies is not accepted in international law. A person cannot, for example, sell a body part such as a kidney, or sell himself in to slavery, because of the principle that although one person might be free to make such a voluntary decision about his own person, others would not. They would be vulnerable to pressure to sell a body part, or sell themselves into slavery and they are therefore not allowed to do so. There are some inalienable rights that one person cannot ignore, because of the likely impact on others. That has a bearing on our discussion of the amendment.
<P>
The amendment would restrict the definition of ``any person responsible'' to any person ``directly'' responsible for the care of a patient. That is illogical and should be resisted. No one should do anything with the purpose of killing anybody else. Moreover, it is not possible to withdraw or withhold something, unless one is responsible in a way that might be called direct, so the insertion of the word ``direct'' is unnecessary and would simply confuse people by raising an irrelevant question. Above all, we should keep the essential plot uncluttered. The Bill restates the age-old principle that no one should make decisions with the purpose of hastening or causing death. I hope that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed and before I ask the hon. Member for Bassetlaw whether he wishes to press his amendment, I should say that it is inevitable during debates on relatively short clauses and amendments that illustrations will be used, and that the whole gamut of the clause will be covered while debating an amendment. That is perfectly satisfactory to me. However, that colours the Chairman's judgment on allowing a stand part debate. I mention that so that all hon. Members may contribute now rather than discovering that they do not have an opportunity to take part later, because the Chairman may capriciously say that the matter has been sufficiently discussed.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Yvette Cooper):</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for that clarification. I had intended to speak in the stand part debate, but because of the wide-ranging discussion on the amendment, I will speak now.
<P>
Clause 1 goes to the heart of the Government's concerns about the Bill. I made it clear on Second Reading that our greatest concern was with the use of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``purpose or one of his purposes''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in relation to the doctor or the carer. For a start, the phrase switches the focus of the law from the patient's best interests to the purpose or one of the purposes of the doctor. Secondly, the hon. Member for Congleton said that she wanted to use the Bill to make a link with the law on murder, but the criminal laws on murder and manslaughter use the concept of primary intention, not the concept of purpose. As a result, it is unclear how the word ``purpose'' would be interpreted in practice. Interpretation would have to come from the courts, and there is much scope for wide interpretation. Someone's intention can include everything he or she knows about the likely consequences. I understand that the hon. Member for Congleton used the word ``purpose'' to avoid the problems with intention; however, the Bill does not get round those problems, because it talks about the purpose or one of the purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Trend </B>(Windsor): We have had a broad debate and the explanatory memorandum is clear, so why does the Minister have a problem with the attempt to define ``purpose'' clearly? What my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton seeks to do and not to do seems quite straightforward to me. Why is the intention inadequately clear?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> The problem is that the Bill talks about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``his purpose or one of his purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are practical difficulties in working out quite what someone's purpose might be. For example, a doctor's main purpose might be to ease a patient's pain, but it is open to argument that one of his purposes might be held to be to hasten death. That is why the Government fear that the clause will make it harder for doctors to respect patients' wishes to refuse treatment. Respecting patients' decisions might be the main purpose, but another purpose could be held to be to hasten death. Equally, the wording may make it difficult for doctors to respect the legally binding status of valid advance refusals of treatment. Patients might have to be given burdensome treatment that was not in their best interests if the withdrawal of treatment might also hasten death.
<P>
The issue that may raise most concern in the House is that the clause could damage effective palliative care, by affecting the provision of proper pain relief. Although the main purpose could be to provide effective palliative care, another purpose, assuming that the doctor knew the consequences of providing that form of palliative care, could be interpreted to be the hastening of death.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Claire Curtis-Thomas </B>(Crosby): I am concerned to hear the reference to palliative care and the suggestion that the administering of drugs, while relieving pain, may also hasten death. Does the Minister agree that insufficient expert opinion is available on pain-relieving drugs to allow a doctor to administer palliative care without the fear that that might lead to death.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> The principle of double effect has been much discussed. As I understand it, palliative care is administered in the best interests of the patient. If that care might also hasten a patient's death, for whatever reason, and if a doctor or team responsible for the care of that patient were aware that that was one of the likely consequences of administering such care, albeit in the patient's interest, the clause would render the decisions of the doctor or of the team of carers contrary to the law.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> The debate about purpose or intention is, basically, legalistic, and does not stand up to much scrutiny. I will go into that later. In a case involving palliative care such as the Minister described, what is the doctor's purpose?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> That is partly the point; it would be up to the courts to decide. The doctor's main purpose might be to administer proper palliative care to ease the patient's pain, but the courts would have to decide whether one of his or her purposes was to hasten the death of the patient. If the doctor knew that death might be the result of administering such palliative care, it would be for the courts to decide whether that could be interpreted as being one of the purposes. The Bill refers not only to the doctor's main purpose, but to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``his purpose or one of his purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I have been doing some research and have collected evidence from the medical profession and the Forensic Science Service. I have details from the Shipman inquiry on the levels of diamorphine found in the bodies of the deceased by the forensic service. My research is not complete, but to date, my conclusion is that there are no clear guidelines on the administration of diamorphine within the national health service. I have asked about toxic levels and about the guidelines given to the medical profession by the Department of Health. Does the Minister think that there has been enough discussion, in Parliament especially, about the principle of the double effect, and that the guidelines for the national health service are adequate?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> That is a separate point. I would be happy to pursue further the guidelines on the administration of different drugs, but that is not the point at issue. We are discussing how the clause would be interpreted legally, if it were brought into force as it stands. That is the problem. There is grave concern in respect of this Bill about the principle of double effect and the consequences of putting constraints on the decisions that can be made by doctors, teams of carers and relatives in relation to the provision of pain-relieving drugs or appropriate palliative care. There are various documents on good practice in palliative care, including those produced by the National Council for Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Services, which are available in the Library and to which I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> Does the Minister accept that double effect is a well established medical and legal concept and that the Bill would have no effect whatever on it?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> No. I do not share the hon. Lady's confidence that the Bill would have no impact on the concept of double effect. That is at the heart of the Government's concern about the Bill. I appreciate that that is the hon. Lady's intention—she made that clear on Second Reading—but the clause, with its reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``his purpose or one of his purposes''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
brings into question the entire principle of double effect. I am aware that the amendments necessary to correct the drafting problems would be complex and extensive, but as a result of the lack of clarity and the potential impact of this phrase in particular and the clause as a whole in terms of palliative care and burdensome treatment—
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Would the Minister consider the bizarre situation we would have if the Bill could be clarified to allow for the double effect of active intervention when people are in pain or have a terminal illness? One would still be able to administer large doses of opiates and be covered by double effect, but one could not withhold treatment of bronchopneumonia or other treatments, because the Bill specifically does not allow for double effect in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> According to current case law, anything that the doctor does not do in terms of providing beneficial treatment to a patient to whom that doctor owes a duty of care can be just as culpable or as unlawful as a positive attempt to kill that patient using a toxic drug. That is the case under the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Trend:</B> The Minister has explained that the Government have difficulties with the clause because it will have knock-on effects in other areas. Can I try and tease out her view on the intention of the promoter of the Bill to put an end to the circumstances that have arisen since the Bland judgment? Do the Government have a view as to whether people should be starved to death, or whether nutrition or hydration should be viewed as treatment? Taking the narrow view that the measure is trying to close the Bland loophole, do the Government have a view on that case, irrespective of the drafting of the clause?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> That is an issue that we will discuss under clause 2, but the Government have accepted the Bland decision in case law that artificial nutrition and hydration fall within the definition of medical treatment and care. The Government also accept the current case law, which says that a doctor does not have a duty to provide treatment that is not in the best interests of the patient, and that where it is not, it can be withdrawn.
<P>
In view of the Government's concern about the drafting of the clause and its possible consequences—in particular, the way it would be interpreted in the courts—and despite the stated intentions of the hon. Member for Congleton on Second Reading and today, the Government cannot support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Curtis-Thomas:</B> I rise to speak in favour of clause 1. I, too, was precluded from speaking on the Floor of the House, much to my frustration, and I welcome the opportunity to speak now.
<P>
This morning, we have heard about the Tony Bland case, and I am concerned that it is being used as a precedent to decide all other such cases. As my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton said, such action and the decision on Tony Bland have extended to people who were not originally considered to be suitable recipients the treatment that we are discussing—people who have, for one reason or another, found themselves in a profoundly incapable physical state.
<P>
On that point, I would like to discuss my mother's condition. I am sorry to have to use such a personal example but, as we have seen, those examples can lead to precedents. My mother's case is important, in that it is probably representative of many cases throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>
My mother succumbed to a truly debilitating stroke in 1987, which rendered her completely paralysed, without speech or movement. She was unable to eat and doubly incontinent, and most of us would regard her as having been in the most awful state imaginable. I think that Alzheimer's is the other nightmare scenario that most of us dread.
<P>
The doctors told me that evening that she would be dead by the morning and that her condition was so bad that she could not possibly recover. She was not dead in the morning and in fact a fortnight later she walked out of the hospital. As we know with stroke conditions, if the individual makes a quick recovery sometimes he or she goes on to make a very good recovery in the longer term.
<P>
My mother had another excellent five years after that. She was fully capable and fully fit. During that time, she told me that should she find herself in a similar condition, under no circumstances would she want to be kept alive. She had found it such a horrific experience to be locked into a stroke unable to speak, see, feel, touch or relate to anything that it was too horrible a prospect to contemplate again. As a loving daughter, I would have done anything that she wanted me to do on her behalf. My friends and colleagues can imagine my concern when five years later I was telephoned at home to be told that my mother had had yet another stroke.
<P>
My mother was admitted again to hospital and this time there was no life support machine. Even to me, her condition was significantly worse. She lay in a bed for some days and I told the doctor that it was my mother's wish that should she find herself in those circumstances we should do all that we could to hasten her death. The doctor replied that he understood that and would consider it. At the end of that first week, my mother was still alive. She was being drip-fed with water and nothing else. At the end of three weeks, she was still alive. At that point, it was considered appropriate to move her somewhere else. I was told to expect her death at any time. She was still surviving on water. Many people are very naïve about these things and I did not realise that she was simply being hydrated and that the small bag did not contain food too. She showed no signs of waking up and a permanently vegetative state was confirmed.
<P>
About three months later she was still in this permanently vegetative state and still on the drip. I was convinced that she was living in a land of semi-consciousness, but was told that it was totally impossible and that even if she was semi-conscious it was simply an aberration of the condition. I was not convinced. I persisted in visiting her daily and eventually I determined that she was in fact in a conscious state, but that her disability was so profound that it prevented her from having any meaningful relationship with me.
<P>
Some weeks later, my mother still had not died. I determined that her only ability was to blink to some form of command. It took me quite some time to convince myself that she understood what I said to her. She communicated her views by blinking one haltering, long blink for yes and two haltering blinks for no. At the end of six months I was quite convinced that my mother understood exactly what was going on. At this point I went to the doctors and they were extremely sceptical that there was any life whatever. I insisted that they came and talked to her.
<P>
The doctors carried out a series of rather crude mathematical tests. My mother was required to carry out complicated sums in her head and then she had to look at the answers, which were written on cards. She passed that test. She passed any test that anyone put in front of her. My mother, who had been diagnosed as being in a permanently vegetative state, had lost every physical capacity, but had retained all her intellect. It was deemed that she was suffering from locked-in syndrome.
<P>
Only the fact that she was grossly overweight prevented my mother from dying at this time. Had she not been overweight when she had a stroke, she would have died much earlier. At that point, the doctor came to me and said, ``As your mother is still here, we must consider whether we should feed her.'' That was the first time that I realised that she had not been fed. Hon. Members may feel that that is extraordinary.
<P>
Please bear in mind the advance directive that I had been given—that I was not to encourage anyone to keep my mother alive. I went to her and said, ``This is it. You have a choice now. Do you want to live or die? If you are not fed shortly, you will die of starvation. There will be no improvement in the quality of your life. You will not regain any of your functions. How do you feel about that?'' I told her that I would return in the morning for her decision.
<P>
The following morning, my mother told me in no uncertain terms that she wanted to live. She was prepared to accept the limitations before her and implored us to accept her as she was. She was worried that we might be revolted by her—and she was indeed quite revolting. She was so disgusting that people from the Stroke Association refused to visit her. It is so easy to look at people and judge them only on their appearance, but there is much more to an individual than a body: there is a spirit, an essence of being that we cannot ignore. That was vital to my mother and it justified her desire to continue her existence.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We asked the doctor to give my mother food and she was given a gastrostomy. Under BMA guidance, my mother would never have had that option. Doctors, with all their knowledge, would effectively have committed her to a death that was not of her wanting.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am obviously impressed by the hon. Lady's devotion to her mother and by her mother's bravery. However, with a communicating patient and a caring family, BMA guidelines would insist that her mother be supported and receive nutrition. My concern is that, under the Bill, the mother of the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas) would not have had the opportunity to receive the initial supportive care that she received on her first stroke. Doctors might be tempted to say, ``We will be faced with a terrible dilemma further down the road, so let us not rush into treatment.'' The Bill might make it more difficult for the hon. Lady's story about her mother ever to take place and there is nothing in the guidelines to cover it. Doctors would be culpable if they did not support a patient who could communicate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Curtis-Thomas:</B> I firmly believe that without my intervention, no one would have taken the time and trouble to ascertain whether my mother could articulate her needs. She had been left without food for six months. People were waiting for time to take its course. Doctors were also considering removing hydration because there were literally no parts of my mother's body that had not been attacked by some form of device to provide hydration. The hon. Gentleman's argument does not bear test when people are in such a state.
<P>
BMA criteria for withholding water and food are too limited. They are essentially concerned with individuals' ability to express themselves and interact with others in such a way as satisfies those others. That amounts to our criteria for what counts as successful. There is a presumption that few who are incapable by our normal definitions have a quality of life that is worthy of life. My experience leads me to disagree profoundly with this minimalist approach. We have a moral duty to embrace and support life, however expressed.
<P>
I reiterate that, had I not been present, my mother—an intelligent, capable person—would have been allowed to starve to death. I do not know how one could adequately explain that to anyone. So many assumptions were made about her state of knowing and quality of life, but all were unfounded and would have denied her right to life.
<P>
It would have been so much easier for all concerned if she had done the understandable thing and slipped away. She was offered that chance and, knowing all she did about what the future held, she refused. Her living will had applied to another time, when my mother had no experience of her new state. She had changed her mind about it; why should she now want to die? People change their minds. Advance directives, or whatever we may call them, made when one is fit and healthy cannot possibly be based on the circumstances in which one might one day find oneself. We all face such circumstances differently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsha Singh </B>(Bradford, West): We are all moved by my hon. Friend's very personal story—it must be terribly difficult to recount your emotions and feelings from that time. This may be a difficult question, but in the circumstances, your mother was able to make a conscious choice about the past and present; if she had been unable to make that choice, what would your choice and views have been?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Curtis-Thomas:</B> I am happy to answer that. I think that it would have been the same reaction as that of any ordinary loving family—to try to follow her wishes. That is what all of us who love and care for our families would choose to do. But had I not been present, those decisions would have been made on her behalf because the extent of her physical disability precluded any conversation that any of us could understand.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that a frightening thought follows from the intervention of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, which is that a patient's right to life should be in question if it is dependent on the ability to communicate? Your mother could not communicate. Surely that goes to the heart of the problem. Decisions would have been made about her, and yet she had locked-in intelligence.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Curtis-Thomas rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. One moment. We all acknowledge that we are dealing with a sensitive and emotional subject. However, we have two problems. First, the acoustics in this Room are not too good and I must ask hon. Members to try to speak, however reverentially, nevertheless audibly. I understand that hon. Members on the other side of the Room are having difficulty in hearing what is being said.
<P>
Again, while I understand the sensitivities of the matters under discussion, I must remind the hon. Member for Congleton—I am choosing to pick on her because she has been in the House long enough to know this, but perhaps by reminding her of it, I will also remind other hon. Members—that all remarks must be made through the Chair. The words ``you'' and ``your'' are not appropriate, as the Chairman has no part to play in this other than in managing the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Curtis-Thomas:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton. Significant liberties are taken with individuals who are incapable of expressing themselves for one reason or another. We do those individuals and ourselves a great disservice.
<P>
I suggest that curtailing life that depends solely on our administering food and water denies us collectively the opportunity to develop our humanity and tolerance of others. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw referred to the Christian argument and other dogmas, but I do not believe that they are any more significant than the humanist arguments. We have a fundamental duty to accommodate life however we may find it. It is a challenge to us personally, but we cannot deny ourselves that challenge if we wish to extend our humanity.
<P>
No one, whatever their condition, should feel that a physical state is so challenging that it cannot be accommodated by others. Are we the stewards or the caretakers of human life or are we the creators or arbiters of human life? That question colours our whole approach to living wills and voluntary and involuntary euthanasia.
<P>
My mother died last May. Her dying was a profoundly different state to her living. Food and water were insufficient to sustain her life. I have a friend living with cancer. However, the vast majority of people to whom I speak say that he is dying of cancer. I asked him whether he thought that he was dying and he said, ``No, I am not. I am living with a condition.''
<P>
People live with conditions that ravage them so that eventually they succumb. All of us who have been with people who succumb to a condition know that the days just before that event is the dying phase. They cease to be sustained by food and water and pass into a dying phase. That lasts a period of days and then they leave us. I regret having to refer to my mother as an example, but hope that hon. Members will consider it relevant.
<P>
Turning from personal experience to matters of universal principle, our starting point is surely the twin provisions in the Human Rights Act 1998 of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to inhuman, degrading treatment. That does not mean that life must be prolonged in all circumstances for as long as possible, as that would be far too degrading and a waste of scarce resource. However, withholding and withdrawing food and water from patients is inhuman and a violation of a fundamental right.
<P>
In conclusion, I support the Bill absolutely. Had I been in the House 10 years ago, I would probably have been in the position of the hon. Member for Bassetlaw, speaking vehemently in favour of advance directives and voluntary euthanasia. However, my profoundly personal experience has caused me to reconsider aspects that most people never want to contemplate. It is extremely difficult living and working with people who find themselves in a state that precludes active involvement in life as we know it. However, we have a profound obligation to those individuals because we do not know everything. While we do not know everything, we must give those people an opportunity to enjoy the right to life, which we take for granted until, perhaps, we succumb.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Mr. Gale, I would value your guidance, as we are having a wide-ranging debate on clause 1, rather than only on amendment No. 1. Given your earlier remarks, is this an opportune moment to test whether clause 1 involves patients' choice, quality of life and burdensome treatment? I would have expected to discuss those matters in our clause stand part debate, rather than in relation to amendment No. 1.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thought that I had made it plain, but let me clarify the position. The Bill is exceptional in that it is mostly encapsulated in one clause. There is one amendment to that clause, which, as the hon. Member for Isle of Wight said, is a relatively modest and probing one. It would be perfectly possible and in order for the Chairman to restrict debate to that amendment. However, in such a position, it is appropriate to allow hon. Members sufficient leeway to develop their arguments. Ordinarily, that would result in hon. Members being out of order.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> One moment, please.
<P>
To accommodate that eventuality, I am prepared to allow a wider debate on clause 1. There cannot be two clause stand part debates. The debate must be either now or at the end of the debate on the amendment. It is for the Chairman to decide when the discussion appears to have run its course, and whether matters arising from the clause have been fully and satisfactorily debated. Given that hon. Members still want to speak, I cannot judge that to be the case.
<P>
I hope that that clarifies the position, and I am noting those hon. Members seeking to catch my eye.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am happy to defer to the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, I call Dr. Iddon.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I would like to respond to some of the points that have been made, especially those made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw. It has been implied that the debate is driven by religious fervour, especially Roman Catholic beliefs. I do not approach the debate from any religious standpoint, although some members of the Committee do. I do not practise any religion at all. I come to the debate purely with a moral argument.
<P>
I have been offended, especially by the BMA, as I shall explain. I have been telephoned by several people in Wales and other parts of the country who have extreme religious commitments, and have seen their relatives taken away by the medical profession through various artificial means. They have been most offended by the way in which the medical profession has dealt with their relatives, usually in hospitals. People with strong religious points of view have a right to see their relatives die naturally, whether the situation is extreme, as in the case of Tony Bland, which has been referred to a lot in our debate, or not.
<P>
The Bland case is key to the debate, and raises a difficult issue. Especially at this level, politicians like to sweep such matters under the carpet. I do not think that we have substantially debated difficult moral issues in this Parliament. As everyone knows, I am interested in the subject of illicit drug use, but no one wants to debate it because it is such a difficult topic. The subject of euthanasia and involuntary euthanasia has also been swept under the carpet and has not been widely debated in Parliament, yet it is important among the public. I have become interested in the subject since I came to Parliament in 1997.
<P>
I said on Second Reading that I could go along with the Bland judgment. I accept some of what the hon. Member for Bassetlaw has said, but it is dangerous to extrapolate the law from one judgment so that it affects all our constituents.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> If the Government accept the Bland judgment, why have they persistently said that they do not intend to incorporate it into statute?
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> That is a good point. The Government have openly said that they are against euthanasia and do not want the Bland judgment enshrined in law, and I think that they are right. It was an extreme case that raised and still raises a lot of emotion, and it is dangerous to extrapolate from a single case.
<P>
Some of us, at least, are trying to tell our constituents that we are not prepared to accept that the Bland judgment should have wide application. So I was extremely offended when in June 1999 the British Medical Association—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman does not expect every High Court judgment to be interpreted into statute law—the House would have to sit 24 hours a day if we had to do that. The recent decision on General Pinochet was an example of that. Should we have a law just for him? We cannot do that—but precedents have to be set for other cases. The present situation is fluid and is left to medical judgment. There are 300,000 terminally ill people in this country, with about 8,000 hospice beds. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Crosby, who gave a moving account of her mother's death, has left the Room. It is not possible to legislate for each of those people. That is why the position is not set down in statute.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend that we could not consider every judgment. Most judgments that are taken at a high level in the courts system do not evoke the emotion of the one that we are discussing. That is why the hon. Member for Congleton has introduced the Bill and why we are discussing it now. Every hon. Member must have received at least one letter on the subject. When a court judgment arouses emotions, it is right and proper that Parliament, and we as the representatives of the people, should debate it. That is our job as parliamentarians.
<P>
I strongly disagree with the view of the BMA and the Government that food and drink should now be regarded as medical treatment. The BMA did a grave disservice to medicine when in June 1999 it published its guidelines, to which we have often referred, especially in the Second Reading debate. In that debate, I criticised the way in which the BMA carried out the consultation. It received 2,000 responses, not all from its own members. Not all doctors are members of the BMA and many of the responses came from members of the general public and organisations representing the general public. Since I made those remarks on Second Reading, a number of doctors have written to me to say that they were not consulted by any organisation representing the BMA. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) tried to convince us that the BMA carried out the consultation very honourably and that all doctors would have been aware of the debate. I reject that. Doctors who have telephoned me or written to me, and doctors to whom I have spoken, say that they did not know what was going on.
<P>
I am concerned that the BMA has drawn up devastating guidelines, which are now being implemented throughout the hospital system, to which practising doctors have not contributed. If the BMA has decided that food and drink are medical treatment and should be regarded as such by its members, the issue is so serious that the association should go back and consult with every single practising doctor in general or hospital practice. It must establish whether the vast majority agrees with that position. In my view, about 75 per cent. of the membership would need to support the position to justify implementing the practice throughout the national health service.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw also said that we should leave the matter to the doctors. In some cases, one doctor has determined whether a person lives or dies. I am told that the best practice involves teamwork and that one doctor—man or woman—makes the decision alone, but consults with at least one other colleague. That is right and proper. I hope that that other colleague is independent of the medical team taking determined decisions for the patient on that ward.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth </B>(Belfast, South): I agree that someone outside that team should be involved, but is there not enough evidence from the Bristol case to suggest that strong-willed consultants do not listen to anyone else?
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I agree with that point. The British Medical Association should ask doctors to consider best practice. I regret that best practice is not used throughout the national health service. I hope that a doctor who has responsibility for a given patient's care would consult someone outside the medical team. However, that consultation should go wider than asking another doctor: before turning off a patient's life support machine, the doctor should also discuss it with nurses, because they might have to sit through the death of the patient.
<P>
It has often been said that Tony Bland died a peaceful death when his treatment was withdrawn. Indeed, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said so on Second Reading. My evidence is anecdotal and second or third-hand, but the medical team that dealt with Tony Bland has said that his death was not peaceful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that everyone should be consulted, but says nothing about consulting the patient. What if the patient wants to die? What if the patient has been suffering from Parkinson's disease, has been bedridden for six or seven years, has shrivelled to four stone, can hardly eat or drink and cannot speak, communicate or even turn over in bed? That is how my mother died. She kept telling me that she would be glad when her time came. What if patients want to terminate their lives because they have had enough of living in that state? He has not mentioned that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I acknowledge my hon. Friend's point. Recently, I have dealt with the deaths of three or four close friends or relatives. At least one of them, a 96-year-old man, made similar comments to the effect that he wanted to die. If patients are fully aware—if they have their full mental capacities—the Bill will not prevent them from taking decisions about themselves. The Bill deals with second and third parties taking decisions about life. Patients have the right to refuse treatments, and they often do so. Hundreds, probably thousands, of examples can be cited of people with cancer or other debilitating diseases who have decided that they have had enough: they do not want to take drugs or undergo operations; they do not want an amputation; they are happy to let gangrene run riot and kill them. That is the patient's choice and, provided they are fully mentally alert, they should be able to take such decisions. The Bill does not prevent that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the situation described by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw would come under the Suicide Act 1961? It is illegal for a doctor to assist a patient to commit suicide.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for making that point.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> If acts of omission are to be treated in the same way as acts of commission under the Bill, doctors could not omit to perform treatments when patients refuse them, because the Bill does not state that patients have a choice in such matters.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> It is established practice that patients have a choice. That is commonly accepted by members of the medical profession, including those present here today, but perhaps not by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> If the Bill's supporters are now saying that the Bill does not override accepted medical practice, then we are in a bit of a fix. All sorts of medical practice are objected to within the terms of the Bill and the motivation behind it. There must be a system to make it clear what accepted practice is acceptable under the Bill, and what is not.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> The Bill tries to give the medical profession guidance about what is acceptable, and what is not, so I disagree with the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<P>
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw would insert the word ``directly'' into clause 1, which could create immense difficulties. We can debate the meaning of the word ``directly'' in this context. A doctor is responsible for the medical team looking after a patient—there has to be a responsible person. If, after consulting a colleague, the nursing team and, we hope, close relatives, whom I omitted to mention earlier, the person responsible for the medical team-the doctor-decides or indicates that some form of treatment, food and drink or ventilation should be withdrawn but does not actually perform the clinical task, who is ``directly'' responsible? Is it the doctor who made the decision to withdraw treatment, or the poor nurse who was instructed by a senior member of the team actually to do it? I see that as a difficulty if the word ``directly'' is inserted in clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> The whole point of tabling the amendment was to determine who would be responsible. On Second Reading, when I said that the Bill did not include penalties, the hon. Member for Congleton said, in effect, that there would be the same penalty as for murder. Therefore, many people who may or may not be significantly responsible could have the threat of a murder charge hanging over them. The Minister said on the Floor of the House that the Bill is amendable, yet we cannot decide what it means, and the hon. Gentleman says that he cannot decide either.
<P>
<B>Dr. Iddon:</B> I have tried to explain my view that it should be a team responsibility to decide whether to remove treatment when it becomes burdensome. I emphasise that: when treatment becomes burdensome the team should make the decision, as a team, to withdraw it. If enacted, the Bill would not criminalise anyone in those circumstances. That is best practice as far as I am concerned. I emphasise the principle of teamwork. I do not think that there is enough of it in the NHS. This is why I object to the insertion of the word ``directly''.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> If our consideration of the Bill were restricted to a debate, or the Bill confined itself to legislating on the question of hydration and nutrition, my stance towards it might be significantly different. There is a difficulty with relying on a definition of hydration and nutrition as medical treatment when attempting to determine what is or is not appropriate medical treatment. The medical profession has been put in a difficult position because there is uncertainty, despite the existence of case law and professional guidelines.
<P>
I genuinely believe that the people who have to make decisions about hydration and nutrition are owed guidelines that are owned by the community at large rather than by a professional group, no matter how they have been drawn up. The fact that the BMA guidelines were approved by its annual representative meeting and endorsed by the Royal College of Nursing does not necessarily make them any more valid in the population's eyes.
<P>
We must get away from the idea that doctors should set all the guidelines on how doctors should behave. I take the point about teamwork, involving the relatives and so on.
<P>
If anything comes of this valuable debate, I hope it is that the Government consult widely about guidelines. In that way, when nutrition or hydration is withdrawn—it never needs to be an emergency decision—we can be confident that there has been reasonable consultation and that other clinicians outside the team directly involved in the treatment and, in some cases, the courts, have been involved. That would be the appropriate action to take.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> Surely the problem arises from the Bland judgment, which authorises or gives legal precedent for the withdrawal of hydration and nutrition. The hon. Gentleman says that, if the Bill dealt only with nutrition and hydration, he would support it, and he speaks of withdrawing such treatment after consultation; yet he said previously that withdrawal was not the right action to take. Is that not a contradiction?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I said that my attitude to the Bill would be different in such circumstances; I did not say that I would support it. We would be having a more constructive debate if we were discussing the issue of hydration and nutrition, given that it concerns members of the Committee most in the context of current medical practice. As I said, I share some of that concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> In what circumstances does the hon. Gentleman envisage the withdrawal of hydration and nutrition? Does he consider them to be medical treatments?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I do not differentiate between care and medical treatment: ``care'' covers a wide variety of actions. As I said on Second Reading, it is as therapeutic for a patient for a ward orderly to hold his hand as it is to have someone in a white coat undertaking probably useless actions in respect of that patient. I am saddened that the Tony Bland judgment was thought through not as an ethical problem; the judgment was a legalistic solution that relied on the definition of what constituted medical treatment and care. I do not believe that that judgment was helpful.
<P>
As a society, we must address our ability to maintain bodies in a live, but non-sentient state. The hon. Member for Crosby cited a telling example that clearly demonstrated that sometimes doctors get it wrong. There is a need for guidelines—not BMA guidelines, but Government guidelines—on how to define what constitutes brain death, for example; that is important in the context of transplant surgery. We should extend that argument to people who have been maintained in persistent vegetative states, although my concerns in respect of the Bill do not centre primarily on that group of patients.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> May I revert to the issue of care and medical treatment? The hon. Gentleman says that they are one and the same. Is he aware that the BMA guidelines differentiate between care and medical treatment? Is he further aware that the BMA annual representative meeting had no opportunity to debate the guidelines?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Although I continue to pay my fees and am a member of the BMA, I have not attended one of its annual meetings for 20 years, nor am I a spokesman for it. I am here as a Member of Parliament with some experience in medicine, having been faced with some of the difficult decisions that we are discussing. It is not for me to interpret the BMA guidelines and assess how good they are. I am uneasy about them for two reasons: first, I am not sure whether the BMA has got them right, and, secondly and most important, such guidelines should not come from the BMA but should be owned by the general community.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> That might explain why, having been asked to appear on BBC Northern Ireland after the debate, my appearance was cancelled, because no one from the BMA Northern Ireland was prepared to appear. I suspect that they disagree with the so-called BMA guidelines.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I should like to move on from hon. Members' opinion of the BMA to discuss my wider anxieties about the Bill. Despite the assurances of the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon), the Bill contains no recognition of the decisions that doctors must sometimes make about what intervention is designed to achieve. Some examples might be helpful.
<P>
Let us start at the beginning of life. If a foetus is born anacephalic—without a brain—with good paediatric intensive care, that neonate could be kept alive for quite a long time, albeit probably to no purpose. We would all accept that life forms without a brain should be cared for, but should we intervene? Should people be obliged to take medical action to avoid death or the hastening of death?
<H4><center>[MR. JOE BENTON in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
When the hon. Member for Congleton tried to define purpose, ultimately she said, in effect, that purpose relates to whether or not a doctor knows that death is likely to follow from a certain action; however, that is not the purpose but the end result foreseen. In the case of a severely malformed neonate, the purpose of withholding treatment is to allow the child to die. That is a stark example, but would such a case be caught by the Bill's requirement that doctors should provide treatment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> I have discussed such examples with experienced doctors who work in the field. We are discussing the legalistic interpretation of the Bill. When doctors face such cases, they ask whether treatment would be futile or whether it would be beneficial or burdensome to the patient. If treatment is futile and would not improve the patient's life, doctors would be able to withdraw treatment because the purpose involved would not be to end life. If such matters are discussed by the team and are transparent and not hidden—that is, apparently, what happens at present—the Bill allows that practice to continue.
<H4><center>[MR. ROGER GALE in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am extremely confused by that answer, because allowance is not made in the Bill for a value judgment to be made about what is a reasonable life form and what is not. Whether a clinical team will be challenged under the Bill remains in doubt. It is a serious Bill—it led me into being investigated by the Hampshire police for describing current medical practice. Technically, under the Bill, someone could say that the life form of the neonate had value and that an intervention would have positive purpose.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall cite a slightly different example of a neonate of 25 or 27 weeks who has breathing difficulties, but who is otherwise a healthy baby. Clearly, a responsible paediatrician should be at the delivery; the child would be intubated and cared for and, hopefully, would make progress toward achieving a quality of life. Let us suppose that the child, after being on life support for, say, two weeks, developed brain atrophy—shrinking of the brain—which, unfortunately, is not uncommon. The quality of life for that child would be almost nil. Would it be appropriate to continue treatment, knowing that the end result would be a severely handicapped and damaged human life form, probably not sentient. In those circumstances, should not someone say, ``Perhaps we should stop ventilating the child and see how it does.''?
<P>
I should value the observations of the hon. Member for Congleton on whether that is an appropriate decision to make and whether it would put the clinicians at the risk of prosecution if the Bill became law.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> If it were the purpose of the doctors to bring the life of the child to an end, such action would fall foul of the Bill. Incidentally, ``purpose'', unlike ``intent'' does not include the concept of ``foresight''. If it were the purpose of the doctors to withdraw treatment, they would not know whether the withdrawal of such treatment meant that the child would die. As the explanatory notes state, the doctors would have to decide whether the treatment would be burdensome to the child. However, doctors do not have to discuss whether, in their opinion, the quality of life of the baby, should it live, is a matter that they can decide. I am referring to the purpose behind the doctors' acting in the way in which I describe.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> My second example of the neonate with brain atrophy is no different from my first example of the neonate born without a brain. A clinical judgment is made that there is no future for that particular child. Doctors are not totally stupid: when they withdraw treatment to a neonate of 24 or 25 weeks, they know that there is a strong likelihood—probably a certainty—that the child will die. Under the Bill, the purpose of discontinuing the treatment is therefore to allow the death of that patient.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Lady shakes her head, but one of the problems with the explanatory memorandum is that it makes assumptions about provisions that do not exist within the Bill. I have difficulty in accepting her reassurances that, in the first example, the doctors are acting properly because, in her judgment, that life form is not sustainable. That example gives rise to a quality of life argument. In the second example, she judges that human life should be maintained, irrespective of other considerations.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> The Bill is clear and focused, despite what the hon. Gentleman says. It relates to only one aim and would do nothing except prohibit a doctor from pursuing the purpose of killing or hastening death by withdrawing or withholding treatment. That is simple and straightforward.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The withdrawal of treatment will hasten and probably cause the death of the patient in my two examples.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> But is not that the purpose.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> What is purpose? Only the Almighty can look inside our heads and decide what is our purpose. Purpose and motivation can be a bit tricky where the law is concerned. We must consider outcome. The purpose of a clinician in switching off a life-support machine in the circumstances of the two examples I gave is fairly irrelevant, because the result is not changed by the purpose. That is as irrelevant as someone who has stolen food saying that his purpose is not to eat it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Trend:</B> I think that I can see the distinction. If a doctor knows that ceasing to treat a profoundly ill patient or withdrawing food or drink will result in death, he knows that the patient will die. That knowledge is implicit in the decision that he makes. He has a purpose.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am not sure whether that is a helpful intervention, as I was not talking about the withdrawal of food and drink, but about a situation in which nature is not given an option as to how long life will last. There is a stark choice: the respirator is either turned off or left on.
<P>
I return to a point made on Second Reading to which the hon. Member for Congleton had no opportunity to respond. Patients clearly have an ability to exercise choice, but I cannot see provision for that in the Bill; I would like to know whether the Minister's legal advisers perceive such provision. It has been made clear during the debate that patient choice is still allowable under the Bill, but I would need a stronger legal opinion than that of the drafter of the Bill, who obviously has a certain mindset, to be reassured. My legal advice is quite different from that set out in the explanatory memorandum. Let us consider an hypothetical patient with renal failure.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Curtis-Thomas:</B> Item 10.3 of the BMA guidance entitled ``Withholding and Withdrawing Life-prolonging Medical Treatment'' says, on advance directives:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A valid advance refusal of treatment has the same legal authority as a contemporaneous refusal and legal action could be taken against a doctor who provides treatment in the face of a valid refusal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although there is currently no statute on advance directives, a number of legal cases have clearly established their legal status. Any health professional who knowingly provides treatment in the face of a valid advance refusal may be liable to legal action for battery or assault. Those close to the patient may be under the mistaken impression that they have the power to override an advance directive and health professionals complying with a valid advance directive should explain to the relatives their reasons for doing so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman aware of that?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I was coming to the question of advance directives. I disagree with the BMA on that point. I have said in all my contributions that advance directives should be taken into consideration, as should the patient's wishes and circumstances, but, at the end of the day, the duty of the clinical team is to act in the interests of the patient and to exercise its duty of care for the patient.
<P>
In some cases, an advance directive may have been signed 20 or 30 years previously. A large number of my patients have sent me advance directives and I have said, ``I will file it in your notes and I will take it into consideration, should that situation arise''. However, I am not terribly worried about being sued for assault if I treat someone in spite of an advance directive. One would have the defence—I hope—of saying that one had acted in the best interests of the patient, within the context of one's clinical judgment and the decision made by the wider team.
<P>
On Second Reading, it was made clear that people can refuse treatment for renal failure. I do not believe that the Bill allows for that, but I will accept it as a hypothesis. What happens when somebody says on Monday, ``I do not want to be treated,'' and slips into a uraemic coma on Wednesday? Should the advance directive given on Monday be binding on the doctor on Wednesday; or should the doctor make the best judgment possible; or is the doctor bound by the terms of the Bill, which says that treatment should not be withheld if the purpose is the death or to hasten the death of the patient?
<P>
I assure hon. Members that a person in the circumstances I have described who is not treated will die. Whether or not that is the purpose, it is a fact. If the bill is passed, what will be the position of a clinician if treatment is not given-knowingly not given in an awareness that that will cause the death of the patient? Would not the doctor be at risk of being prosecuted under the terms of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Singh:</B> The hon. Gentleman is labouring that point somewhat. It is clear that if a patient refuses medical treatment that patient may press medical practice on that point. For example, if a Jehovah's Witness refuses a blood transfusion—I understand that that is their religious belief and practice—the patient has refused medical treatment; within the confines of the Bill the doctor in not treating does not have the purpose of hastening that patient's death.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful for that example. Like many doctors, I have several patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses and they all send me advance directives, some of which are 30 or 40 years old, saying that in no circumstances are they to receive blood. However, what if they have changed their mind in the past few days? There is no definition: advance directives and the will of the patient are not mentioned in the Bill. How is one to judge what is a valid advance directive and what is not? I take issue with the BMA because it does not define advance directives either. They have a value in that they help the making of difficult decisions, but I do not believe that they should be binding.
<P>
To return to my question to the supporters of the Bill, if a patient is not conscious at the time the decision has to be made on whether or not to continue or institute treatment, how is the clinician to judge whether a patient wants that treatment? The presumption in the Bill is that treatment should therefore always be given. That takes us back to the real difficulty: is a verbal indication given two days ago binding but something in writing dated one, five or ten years previously is not? I would value the hon. Lady's view on whether I am unduly anxious about the effects of the Bill in such circumstances.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is arguing against legally binding advance directives. The most recent guidance of the Official Solicitor that advance directives should be taken into account. If the doctor in the hon. Gentleman's example followed a clearly applicable advance directive, he would be doing nothing wrong under the Bill, which does not alter the status of advance directives. If a patient is mentally competent and has given a contemporaneous instruction to the doctor, the doctor has discussed the case with the team and the relatives, the situation is transparent and all concerned know where they stand, it is obvious that, in such a case, the doctor is right to follow the patient's wishes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is a valuable contribution. I am assured that because a body of medical professionals accepts that advance directives are of value—contemporaneous advance directives are probably mandatory—and because that is backed up by case law, the Bill will not override current good practice. Why does the hon. Lady make an exception for advance directives and patient consent but not for the practice that grew up following the Tony Bland case? One cannot cherry-pick case law.
<P>
If we had statute law on the matter we would know where we stand, but we do not. We do not have statute law on advance directives or on the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration for people in persistent vegetative states. I cannot see any mention in the Bill, except in the explanatory memorandum—which is highly selective about what it does and does not protect—of patient consent, advance directives, or the input of relatives and the wider caring team.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right: the Bill makes no mention of advance directives. As was said on Second Reading, that is beyond its scope. The answers to his questions must therefore be sought elsewhere. The Bill does not resolve the dilemma that everyone faces of whether advance directives are legally binding or valid. It remains neutral on that question.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am sorry, but I do not think that the Bill is neutral on that matter. It states clearly that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It shall be unlawful for any person responsible for the care of a patient to withdraw or withhold from the patient medical treatment or sustenance if his purpose or one of his purposes in doing so is to hasten or otherwise cause the death of the patient.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is nowhere qualified by the notion that it is unlawful to withdraw it ``unless the patient does not wish such treatment or sustenance''. It does not say that. I shall go on to another of my main concerns, because I think we cannot go further in debating the issue if the Bill's promoter cops out and says that it does not deal with advance directives. Of course it does, and the fact that the hon. Lady does not want to discuss the matter is rather sad.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman not say that the Government have copped out by not making advance directives clear and establishing them in statute? Would he not say that society and, indeed, the medical profession have copped out?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am always happy to criticise the Government; I do not need the hon. Lady's encouragement to do so. I started my remarks by criticising the Government for not having taken the burden away from the BMA and issuing their own guidelines. That would be a preferable way forward. However, I still have not received an answer from the hon. Lady on the issue of patient consent, which is ignored in the Bill.
<P>
I realise that I am taking up a lot of the Committee's time, but these are important issues. Nothing in clause 1 or, indeed, anywhere else in the Bill excuses treatment because it is burdensome. Some forms of intervention remain highly unpleasant or distressing for patients or their carers, especially when patients have lost most of or all their reasoning powers. People with advanced senile dementia who have passed the aggressive, disturbed state and have withdrawn inside themselves may respond only to painful stimuli—which they experience rarely, if, as I hope, they are well cared for. It can be extraordinarily disturbing for such people to receive the simplest treatment.
<P>
In such circumstances, although they might not know the patient's wishes, most doctors, having consulted the care team and the patient's relatives, would accept that it is appropriate not to treat an acute chest infection or renal failure because the treatment involved would be extraordinarily burdensome to the patient. Not treating will certainly hasten, and often cause, death, and the purpose of not treating is, in part, to allow that death to occur.
<P>
I and the people and organisations that have contacted me are worried about the Bill's technical effect. In such circumstances, the Bill would deny doctors and the clinical team the discretion to allow someone gently to slip away. It would impose a duty, not of care, but of medical intervention. How does the hon. Lady respond to that point?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I would respond by asking what the doctor's purpose is. Is his primary purpose to avoid giving treatment that would be futile or burdensome to the patient, or is the purpose of withdrawing treatment to end the patient's life? That distinction is established in medical and ethical practice, and is understandable.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The Bill will overturn established medical and ethical practice in some circumstances. I return to a comment that the hon. Lady made about purpose. The Minister expressed doubt about the meaning of ``purpose''. The hon. Member for Congleton clearly referred to the doctor knowing that an action could cause the death or hasten the death of the patient. In the circumstances I described, relating to the severely demented patient, treatment would allow that patient to continue to live—
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ann Winterton:</B> Not necessarily.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Nobody knows whether any treatment helps. I can treat a chest infection and the patient can die of a coronary the next day. These things cannot be known. However, one can assume that someone with a simple chest infection who is given an antibiotic will normally get better, whether severely demented or not.
<P>
One of the problems with that end of the age range is that Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia used to be considered terminal, because people seldom lived more than a year once they had advanced senile dementia. That is no longer so: it is a tremendous compliment to the care that many of those people receive in our nursing and residential homes that they can go on for many years. Is the hon. Lady suggesting that it is important that we should allow those people to continue to live for many years by intervening when a particular illness strikes a particular patient?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I believe that this answers the Alzheimer's point and it is very important indeed. If the state allowed, by the withdrawal of hydration and nutrition, the killing of patients who were in a state of senile dementia or had Alzheimer's, I could not go along with that. However, that is happening by the back door and I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman, as a doctor, would realise the consequences.
<P>
Sixty-five per cent. of the funds that go into medical research in this country are contributed by the pharmaceutical industry. If the state kills off all those patients who are inconvenient and expensive to the national health service, does he believe that the causes of and cures for Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia will ever be discovered? He and I do not currently suffer from dementia, but does he not realise that, in 20 years' time, we might be deprived of medicines and pharmaceutical products that will prevent us from developing senile dementia and Alzheimer's?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The last sentence of that contribution is the relevant one. I reiterate that I am talking about active medical intervention in the way of antibiotics, treatment of heart failure, or support after a severe stroke; I am not talking about hydration and nutrition. The Bill makes no distinction between the kind of care that we all expect but which, sadly, is not always delivered because of the pressure on resources, and acute interventions interfering with a fatal process.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> The hon. Gentleman can use the ``burdensome and futile'' test, which is absolutely clear. Is he saying that he believes that food and fluids should be withdrawn from patients with dementia in order to kill them because their quality of life, in his view, is not good?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> No. We started talking about the burdensomeness of the treatment of the patient. If in some circumstances, nutrition and hydration become extraordinarily burdensome—some people pull out their gastrostomies and drips—there is the possibility of sedating them so flat that one probably causes their death through secondary effect, which appears to be acceptable. However, one cannot allow them not to receive ministration but still care for them. It is right still to look after their pressure areas, ensure that their lips are comfortable and offer them sips of water. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's line of attack.
<P>
Of course we are hoping that the pharmaceutical industry will make a treatment for Alzheimer's disease that will help people who are developing the illness. Interestingly, the Secretary of State for Health said in answer to a question asked in the House that the pharmaceutical industry will not produce a cure for people who have advanced plaques in their brains or who are suffering from severe senile dementia because of multiple cerebral infarct, which is not amenable to pharmaceutical or genetic manipulation. We are talking about prevention.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am not talking about people with dementia who have some quality of life and who are aware of their surroundings and can contribute to them. Some of my friends are demented, and it is right that people who suffer from senile dementia are cared for. However, such care can become burdensome to people who do not want it, but who are not competent to say ``I refuse.'' The Bill does not allow for such circumstances.
<P>
I have tried to express my difficulties with the Bill, which relate in particular to the restrictions that it will impose on clinicians' abilities not to treat a disease and to the fact that it does not allow for patient choice or for assessments of quality of life. This has been a curious debate. The hon. Member for Congleton accepted that quality of life can be used to justify the withholding of treatment in some instances, such as that of an anacephalic child, but not in others. The Bill does, however, allow for the burdensomeness of the treatment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Trend:</B> If the clause reflected some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns about patient choice and burdensomeness and targeted the withdrawal of food and drink as a means of death, would he be content for it to prohibit through a closer definition the killing of patients through the removal of food a drink, which many of us regard as a basic right that is separate to medical treatment?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is a valuable contribution. I had hoped that the Bill would attempt to do just that. As I said on Second Reading, I have a difficulty with its title, which should be changed to ``Medical Treatment and Care (Prevention of Neglect)''. We should discuss the title—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating clause 1. We shall consider an amendment that would change the title of the Bill later. That amendment may facilitate the debate that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. I am happy to resume my seat.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I am interested that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has not yet tabled an amendment to allow the Bill to deal with that matter. I imagine that his arguments are based on his objections to the Bill's principles. To some extent, I can understand that, because the law already allows a fair bit of ambiguity. A patient can say that they do not want to receive certain treatment, but some in the medical profession override that wish, which can lead to subsequent court action.
<P>
I noticed in the press recently that a doctor was so thrilled with his work that he decide to engrave his initials upon his lady patient. We know that patients must consent to treatment but, for reasons best known to themselves, some members of the medical profession override that consent. The hon. Gentleman's argument does not stand.
<P>
By the grace of God, and with care over the years from medical people, I am still alive today. I therefore do not argue against good medical practice. Indeed, my daughter is a GP. On the other hand, although people say that we can trust doctors and rely on them, I believe that doctors, like politicians, can make mistakes. I suggest that we sometimes make far too many mistakes and that we try to cover them up. An old friend of mine was a minister and his wife was a doctor. She used to say that her husband tried to make the people good but that she made them better, to which he responded, ``And I cover up her mistakes.''
<P>
I am aware that I have used the illustration on several occasions, but I remember that, as a young woman, my mother had to attend one of the finest hospitals in the United Kingdom for an appendix operation. The specialist was preparing her for the operation. She asked, ``Is that the right side?'' With picturesque language, he replied, ``Are you trying to teach me my job?'' At that point, with the diffidence that most people show to the medical profession, she said, ``No, but I always thought that the appendix was on the other side of the body.'' In even more colourful language, he responded, ``I thought that I was doing another operation.''
<P>
We cannot always leave it to the medical profession. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) spoke about team choice, which reminded me of the old regime of medical training, under which the consultant was the leader of the team, which regularly played together, even though many of them ended up in general practice or working in other hospitals.
<P>
When the hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to brain death and the nurse turning off the life support machine, my memory went back to the Royal Victoria hospital years ago, when a young soldier had been diagnosed as being brain dead. He had been looked after for quite a while, but the surgeon eventually told the sister that the life support machine should be switched off. Because of the pressure upon her that night, the sister overlooked that job. By the morning, the young man was showing signs of recovery. He did not fully recover, but he is now living a reasonably normal life. I support the Bill because it would put a check on the medical profession, requiring it to be even more careful about its decisions. I can understand the point made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw about parents. I have been down that road and know what it is like to be in a hospital for hours while the medical profession fights to save a four-year-old. I understand parents' anguish.
<P>
The disabled have been referred to. I was at a function in Belfast three weeks ago; at the end of it, a woman came and asked whether I remembered her. I said that my power to recall names was not as fast as it used to be, but that I recognised her. She said that she had been a member of a congregation at which I had been an assistant. I looked at her again: people change over 40 years. I said that the congregation had been either Sicily Park or Locksley Park; she smiled. I said that I continued to tell the story of the day on which she and her husband had brought their youngster to church and had their first family row, because they had both wanted to hold his hand to let the congregation know that be was their son. The boy was handicapped with a brain problem. Nobody else could have brought such care and love to the family.
<P>
We must be careful when we start to take the right of life and death. I have met people over the years who wished to die. The apostle Paul wanted to die. A fella said to me not so many years ago that he was getting out of the hell-hole of Northern Ireland and migrating. He said that I had better watch myself. I asked him why—what the problem was. He replied, ``You do not understand—you'll be killed.'' I asked what the problem was. He looked at me and asked whether my head was all right. I replied that I thought that it was, but that I could not understand why he was concerned. He asked why not; I said that he had just told me that he was getting out of the hell-hole but wanted to stop me getting into heaven.
<P>
I can understand people under pressure. The apostle Paul said that he did not know whether he wanted to be living or dead; to be with Christ was better by far—absent from the body, present with the Lord. I can understand that as a Christian and as a human. However, as has already been suggested, we should be careful when we mix that issue with the question of living wills. Doctors are aware of the problems with living wills. We can all understand the pressures on a family, but we live in a disposable age: if we do not like something, we change it—a car, our wallpaper, a wife or a husband—just because we are not prepared to work issues through.
<P>
It has already been suggested that we should not go against legal decisions such as that made in the Tony Bland case. A person might be accused of murder because the amendment would lay the responsibility on one person to clear others of liability. My understanding of law suggests that the harsh reality is that people not directly implicated might not even be charged with manslaughter. We are in another legal minefield, which lawyers love because that is where they make a living. The amendment does not help us to understand the law and the implications of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bassetlaw said something—I do not think that he meant it—that horrified me because it reflected practices in certain circles of our society. There are 300,000 terminally ill people and only several thousand hospice places. The expense that the national health service incurs caring for those people and the pressures that that put on carers has raised the question of whether we should prolong life. In addition to the reasons that the hon. Member for Crosby gave, we should be prepared to care for people because that is what has happened in other cases, both here and abroad. Medical people make wrong diagnoses. A man in my congregation, who was a first world war veteran, wanted to know how he could live without his wife who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. She lived for 10 years after I buried him.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When we talk about life, how do we evaluate its quality? Do we understand the arguments about Alzheimer's victims? I have ministered to them and know what problems it causes when relatives are not recognised. On the other hand, we live in a modern world. An old soldier of 82 has been in my mind for the past few weeks. He cared at home for his wife of 36 years, but she is now in a residential home that is provided by the health service; it is not a private home. The home does not look after her dignity. Although she has her own clothes, which he took to her, he has found her wearing other clothes. We have objected. I wrote to her specialist on 17 January asking whether she was in the right place, because I do not think that she is. I have not received a reply.
<P>
The shortage of provision means that we do not give such people adequate care. If the home does not recognise that woman's dignity, it would be easy for it to withdraw food and drink. She cannot speak, although she can communicate. She recognises her husband's writing, but she is only a statistic. If Parliament does not give a clear message to the medical fraternity that it cannot dispose of people simply because it believes that nothing more can be done for them, I fear that we will have sent the wrong signal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Trend:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that many of my constituents who wrote to me shared that fear. They believed that their relatives had been allowed to starve or die of dehydration in nursing homes and, in one case, a hospice. The point of trying to reverse the Bland judgment is to stop the slide down the slippery slope of people in the medical profession assuming that such behaviour is acceptable.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> I agree completely with the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight mentioned a body of medical practice. We must approach that issue with care.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to clarify my point. I was talking about a body of medical practice that has been accepted by the Bill's promoter rather than a body of medical practice that she has not accepted. However, the Bill does not make it clear which is acceptable.
<P>
<B>Rev. Martin Smyth:</B> The body of medical practice that is accepted by the Bill is the traditional medical practice that it should never be the doctor's intention to end life. It is his job to care with every means at his disposal. I understand that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw suffers from hearing difficulties, a similar disability to myself, and there may be a few bionic men and women around this place who have implants of one sort or another, intrusions that were never imagined by our forebears. However, at the same time, the principle of caring remains the standard that we in the nation of the Mother of Parliaments should be giving to the world. Why should we see heart-rending pictures of starving people in Sudan and during the Geldof campaign and yet accept that it is permissible to withdraw sustenance and treatment from people who require medical care?
<P>
<B>Yvette Cooper:</B> I do not want to repeat points that I have already made, but the hon. Member for Isle of Wight asked for some clarification of the legal advice that the Government had received on the Bill and on this clause in particular. I am advised that the Bill's provisions mean that actions will have to be judged on the basis of the purpose or one of the purposes of the doctors. Under current case law, when it comes to withdrawing or withholding treatment and care, actions are judged according to whether there is patient consent, whether there are valid advance directives, or the best interests of the patient. The Bill does not allow exceptions to be made to the criterion of the doctor's purpose or one of his purposes, such as whether something is in the best interests of the patient, whether the treatment is burdensome or any other criterion. It simply says that a judgment will have to be made on the basis of the purpose or one of the purposes of the doctor or person with care.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> I should like to clear up one or two points that have arisen during the debate, in particular in the speech made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. In the latter part of his remarks, he referred to burdensome treatment. If a treatment is burdensome, either to a mentally competent patient or, indeed, to a mentally incompetent patient, then the withdrawal or withholding of treatment is allowed. That is set out in paragraph 4 of the explanatory memorandum.
<P>
I was interested to hear what the Minister said about advance directives. I reiterate that the Bill will not change the current status of advance directives. I believe that there is a genuine debate about their legal status, but clinicians will bear in mind the provisions of any applicable directive. If advance directives are legally binding, doctors must abide by them, even if it requires withdrawal of treatment leading to death. In such a case, a doctor's purpose is to abide by a legally binding directive. However, if directives are not binding, the Bill makes it clear that doctors cannot act with the purpose of killing the patient. That is about as clear as one can get.
<P>
In her first contribution to the debate, the Minister spoke about double effect—something that goes to the heart of the Bill—and use of the word ``purpose'' rather than ``intention''. The reason why ``purpose'' is used instead of ``intention'' is because, in common sense, the two words have the same meaning, but lawyers often, although not always, give ``intention'' a wider meaning, so that it includes not only what one wants or is trying to get, do or achieve, but also what one foresees as certain or very likely to result from one's actions or omissions. In other words, in confusing technical lawyer's use, to which I referred earlier—or, rather, legal fiction—``intention'' includes both purpose and foreseen side effects. If I had used the word ``intention'' in clause 1, it could arguably have been claimed that we wanted to outlaw anything that would have the side effect or double effect of hastening or causing death. That would, of course, be an intolerable restriction on medical care.
<P>
The Minister rightly reminded the Committee of the existing requirement not to kill the patient intentionally by any means, action or omission, but she was using the word ``intentionally'' in common sense, not the lawyer's jargon sense. We would not be allowed to get away with that same commonsense use in the Bill, so we have used the commonsense term ``purpose'', which has not been spoiled with lawyer's fictions about foreseen effects. In short, the two words are, in common sense, the same, but one has been muddled with a legal fiction, so we have chosen the other.
<P>
In common sense, I intend what I choose either as an end or a means, but not what is neither an end or a means, even if it is certain. For example, I intend my curtains to make the room look nice and to keep out the light, but I do not intend to fade them, even though I know that that will happen. I do not intend to wear out my shoes, get jet lag or stutter, even though I know that those effects are certain when I wear shoes with the intention of protecting my feet, take a plane to go to Australia or speak to give testimony in court. In common sense, the terms related to ``intention'' are the equivalents of words and phrases such as ``purpose'' and ``with the purpose of'', ``aim'' and ``with the aim of'', ``for the sake of'', ``in order to'', ``with a view to'' or just plain ``to''—as in the phrase ``to impress my friends''.
<P>
Judges often explain or speak of intention in those terms. In the Bland case in the House of Lords many of the synonyms that I have listed were used. There are academic writers, sometimes followed by the criminal courts, who state that one intends what one foresees as certain, or virtually or morally certain to result from what one does. That idea ran into heavy and fully justified criticism and rejection in the House of Lords in 1980s murder cases, especially Regina v. Hancock 1986—Appeal Cases 455. Alas, it was casually but deliberately revived in a recent House of Lords decision in a homicide case called Regina v. Woollin—22 July 1998, [1998] 4 All England Law Reports 103. The offending passage is on page 110, where it is stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a result foreseen as virtually certain is an intended result''.<P>

<P>
That is a legal fiction of a rather gross kind. It is incompatible with the way in which the word ``intention'' is used by people and bodies as different as the Minister, the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics and the BMA ethics committee. I came to the conclusion that it was best to steer clear of the word ``intention'' and to use the word ``purpose'', which lawyers have not, in plain language, mucked about with.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The hon. Lady has just told us that the legal definition of ``purpose'' is uncertain. I am not sure how that creates clarity in her Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Winterton:</B> The definition of ``purpose'' may be legally obtuse, but it is understood in common law and in the understanding of people. We sometimes judge things legalistically. Everyone understands what ``purpose'' means and is. I have said at length that it is equivalent to ``intent'', but the latter has been besmirched by lawyers in the cases that I quoted. If the hon. Gentleman believes that ``intent'' is good, he can substitute ``purpose'' quite easily. That will be understood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ashton:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
