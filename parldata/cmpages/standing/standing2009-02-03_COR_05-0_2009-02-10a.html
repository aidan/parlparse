<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000328"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take the
following: new clause 9&#151;<i class="I">Deaths </i><i class="I">occurring</i><i class="I">
abroad</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) The
following provisions shall have effect in connection with the
investigation of deaths of British subjects occurring
abroad.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) When the body is
returned to a coroner&#146;s area, the senior coroner must conduct an
investigation, when one is appropriate, under the Coroners
Act.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(3) When there is no body,
or when the body has been buried or cremated outside England or Wales,
the relatives of the deceased may, within six months of the death (or
the presumed date of the death), apply to the Chief Coroner for an
investigation to be held.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4)
It shall be the duty of the UK consular authorities for the country
where the death occurred to draw the attention of anyone reporting the
death to them to the arrangements for investigation, and to liaise with
local public agencies to ensure that all material facts connected with
the death are ascertained and
communicated.&#146;.</div><a name="09021114000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19&#151;<i class="I">Investigations into deaths: special
circumstances</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;Where
there are specific circumstances which make it unlikely that a senior
coroner will be able to conduct an investigation or a series of
investigations quickly and effectively, bearing in mind the concerns of
the victim&#146;s family or the wider community, the Chief Coroner
shall draw the circumstances to the attention of the Lord Chancellor
who shall make appropriate arrangements to meet the specific
circumstances.&#146;.</div><a name="09021114000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000329"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): A warm
welcome to you, Mr. Cook. It is a pleasure to serve under
your
chairmanship.</div><a name="09021114000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to say a word or two about clause 1, which mirrors the
requirements of section 8(1) of the Coroners Act 1988. The requirement
to investigate deaths in prison has been altered to apply to deaths
where the deceased died while in custody or otherwise in state
detention, which makes sense. It is also sensible as it clarifies the
situation where the death is in a police station, a mental hospital, an
immigration hostel, or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>whatever. Obviously, there is a requirement that the death be sudden.
All in all, clause 1 is a good start to the
Bill.</div><a name="09021114000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have identified a problem appertaining to deaths occurring abroad. That
is why we have tabled new clause 9, more as a probing exercise than
anything else. Obviously, losing a loved one abroad can be incredibly
traumatic. We have all come across constituency cases where a family
have had a loved one travelling abroad&#151;perhaps on a gap year or
working abroad&#151;who has had a sudden, appalling accident and a
tragic and perhaps unexplained death has occurred. That causes a huge
amount of grief. It is dreadful enough to lose a loved one,
particularly a young child, but to lose a young child abroad in a
strange jurisdiction, with all the problems that might occur as a
result, is even more dreadful for the family involved.</div>
<a name="09021114000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that there is nothing in the Bill that covers deaths abroad.
I accept that clause 1(4)(b) is perhaps a
catch-all:</div><a name="09021114000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
circumstances of the death are such that there should be an
investigation into
it&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not say that it does not cover deaths abroad. I would like to draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to the draft Bill, which the then
Department for Constitutional Affairs published in 2006. A number of
clauses in the draft Bill related to deaths outside the United
Kingdom.</div><a name="09021114000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000330"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that the difficulty with subsection (4) is that
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are conjunctive? They relate to a senior
coroner who has reason to believe that, first, a death has occurred in
or near their jurisdiction; secondly, that the circumstances of that
death are such that there should be an investigation; and thirdly,
there is a duty to conduct an investigation. Therefore, a death that
occurs abroad would almost certainly not be covered by that catch-all
in paragraph
(b).</div><a name="09021114000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000331"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was
perhaps getting carried away in suggesting that the provision might
cover
that.</div><a name="09021114000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5(1) of the draft Bill addressed deaths outside the United
Kingdom:</div><a name="09021114000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
duty of a senior coroner to conduct an investigation into the death of
a person under section 1 does not arise where the death occurred
outside the United
Kingdom&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
6 of the draft Bill was supplemental, and it explained exactly what
should happen when a death occurs outside the United Kingdom. That is
why new clause 9 makes it crystal clear that in that circumstance there
will be a proper
investigation:</div><a name="09021114000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(1)
The following provisions shall have effect in connection with the
investigation of deaths of British subjects occurring
abroad.</div><a name="09021114000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">(2)
When the body is returned to a coroner&#146;s area, the senior
coroner must conduct an investigation, when one is appropriate, under
the Coroners
Act.</div><a name="09021114000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">(3) When
there is no body, or when the body has been buried or cremated outside
England or Wales, the relatives of the deceased may, within six months
of the death (or the presumed date of the death), apply to the Chief
Coroner for an investigation to be
held.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
spells out what should happen when a death occurs abroad.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div><a name="09021114000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have all
come across tragic constituency cases. I had one recently that involved
a constituent whose son was murdered in India while carrying out aid
work for a charity of which he was a founder member. My constituent
contacted to me to press for
action:</div><a name="09021114000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have had a total lack of information from the Indian police...the
only information we have had is the post mortem result, which was very
badly carried out. Our one source of information has been the coroners
office, &amp; even they have had a lack of co operation from the Indian
police. So I hope you can understand my concern. Without the coroners
office &amp; the inquest (which has yet to be held) we would know
nothing.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
feel very strongly that when one loses a loved one abroad, the United
Kingdom should make every conceivable effort to ensure that some
closure is brought to the family. Although my constituent,
Mrs. Mary Whitford, points out how competent and
understanding the Foreign Office was, she feels that the Bill should
spell out what should
happen.</div><a name="09021114000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may well point us to provisions in the Bill that allow such
inquests to take place as a matter of course. I feel, however, that
although clause 1 is a good start to the Bill, new clause 9 is needed
to complement it and to clarify what happens when a death occurs
abroad.</div><a name="09021114000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000332"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab): I
want briefly to discuss new clause 19 which stands in the name of my
right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.</div>
<a name="09021114000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Minister helpfully wrote to members of the Committee in
response to a request that I made last week about how the new
arrangements would work in cases such as Hillsborough. That was a
concern of one of my constituents, who spent a day at the mini-inquest
that took place after that event. My right hon. Friend&#146;s new
clause helps in that respect, because it envisages a role for the Lord
Chancellor in cases where there might be a question whether sufficient
resources are available for a speedy and efficient inquest to take
place.</div><a name="09021114000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 also draws attention to the fact that there might be great
concerns on the part of the bereaved or the wider community. I suspect
that my right hon. Friend tabled it as a probing amendment, and,
although I cannot speak for him, I do not expect that he would wish it
to go to a vote. Nevertheless, it is helpful, and I wonder whether the
Minister will address those concerns in that context. Perhaps she will
put on the record how she envisages the new arrangements applying in
cases where there are multiple deaths and legitimate public concerns
about the causes of those
deaths.</div><a name="09021114000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000333"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Order. It may help the Committee if I
call to mind that, while it is proper that we debate new clause 19
today, it will not be put to a vote until much later in proceedings. It
will be decided today whether clause 1 stands part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09021114000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000334"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): We broadly support the
bulk of clause 1. I rise to support new clause 9, which has been tabled
by the official Opposition. It seems to be a very sensible addition to
clause 1. It clarifies what seems to be an omission from the Bill as a
whole, particularly since it was flagged up as an issue in the draft
Bill that was previously
published.</div><a name="09021114000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
families that lose a member abroad, there are often even more
unanswered questions than there are for families that lose loved ones
in the UK. Clearly, an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>inquest is a very important way in which they can start the grieving
process and understand what has really happened. For a lot of families
that were not present at the time and that played no role in what
happened to their family member, the inquest is a really important part
of their grieving process. I would be grateful if the Minister were to
make it clear whether the Government intend to clarify the process for
deaths abroad in order to ensure that it is made much easier to see who
is responsible and that the deaths get investigated properly by a
coroner at an open inquest, so that their families can get the answers
to some of their questions.</div>
<a name="09021114000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that no one in Committee disagrees with the intention behind new clause
9. If there is no mechanism to tackle a backlog and deal quickly with
circumstances where there are a significant number of deaths&#151;as
happened in Hillsborough, which the right hon. Member for Knowsley,
North and Sefton, East has highlighted&#151;it can cause untold hurt
and distress to families. I am not completely convinced that the
wording of new clause 19 is the right way to go, but I am sure that the
Minister will be able to let us know the Government&#146;s thoughts
on how to manage such circumstances to ensure that families get the
answers that they need as soon as
possible.</div><a name="09021114000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other point that I want to raise concerns clause 1. We welcome the
extension of the provision from when death occurs in prison to a
broader list of circumstances&#151;for example, areas of custody.
There have been increasing concerns in the past couple of years about
immigration detention centres, where there have been increasing numbers
of reports of violence and of inmates experiencing problems at the
hands of some guards. As I understand it, fortunately there has not
been a death so far in an immigration detention centre, but it is
welcome that these provisions cover those institutions, so we will be
prepared if there is an unfortunate incident in the
future.</div><a name="09021114000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also welcome the removal of the requirement for the death to be sudden.
There are lots of circumstances where a death is not sudden but is
still deeply suspicious. Broadening the grounds on which an inquest can
be called, and making sure that it covers as many of the possibilities
as possible, is a positive way
forward.</div><a name="09021114000298"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09021114000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000335"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Madeleine Moon</b> (Bridgend) (Lab): I rise to discuss new
clause 19. In looking at this Bill, we have discussed the role of the
coroner in explaining the &#147;how&#148; of someone&#146;s
death. Often for the family, the explanation that they are seeking is
the &#147;why&#148;&#151;it is their desperate need to know why
their family member died, particularly in cases of
suicide.</div>
<a name="09021114000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
mentioned several times my interest in the promotion of psychological
autopsies and their role in helping to prevent suicide in wider
society. We currently have in the Department of Health a national
suicide audit toolkit. The toolkit is voluntary&#151;it is for
individual health authorities to design and use in their own way. It
does not collect national data, and it does not pose a national
strategy for examining
suicides.</div><a name="09021114000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East spoke
about events relating to Hillsborough. I do not consider the events in
Bridgend to be of the same order as those at Hillsborough, but they
pose similar issues of national concern as to what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>was happening and why. They provide us with an opportunity, as a
society, to understand what we can do to prevent the needless deaths of
young people. There have been studies of suicide autopsies,
particularly by Hawton and Appleby, and a structure has been created
for carrying out such
autopsies.</div><a name="09021114000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 offers us the opportunity to implement suicide autopsies
nationally, so that we can gather data nationally, develop
understanding and provide local authorities and local health
authorities with the information, advice and guidance that they need to
provide new services and ways of operating that would prevent clusters
of deaths in the
future.</div><a name="09021114000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to summarise the sort of information that is gathered. The study
carried out by Appleby includes data from interviews with families and
friends carried out by an experienced mental health nurse, along with
an examination of inquest notes, medical records, psychiatric notes,
social networks, demographics, previous self-harm&#151;a particularly
important issue when we are looking at suicide&#151;education, work
and certain life events. In cases of suicide, the motivator is often a
life event in the previous three months&#151;in many cases, it occurs
in the previous week. Finally, it is important to examine
the role of alcohol and substance
misuse.</div><a name="09021114000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 offers us an opportunity to take away from the local inquest
into an individual death information that may well answer the question
of &#147;how&#148;, which will enable us to look at the wider
societal need to prevent further deaths and clusters of deaths.
Hopefully that also answers for the family the much wider question of
&#147;why&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000336"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I am grateful for the
opportunity to follow the hon. Member for Bridgend, who obviously has
particular constituency experience. The debate to date has been
characterised by a serious tone, as one would expect, but it has also
begun to bring out two essential points in relation to
inquests.</div>
<a name="09021114000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
inquests have a vital role in providing closure for the family and, to
be honest about it, in certain cases they expose circumstances which
may or may not give rise to subsequent private legal action. But that
is not the only motive, by any means. Secondly, as the hon. Lady has
just said, the coroner&#146;s inquest and subsequent report may bring
out public interest aspects of the case. Anyone who has ever been
involved in any way would desire to ensure that that set of
circumstances is, if possible, avoided and not replicated, and that
lessons are learned for the future&#151;we all approach this matter
with that point in mind. I have signed new clause 9, which was tabled
and elegantly discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Norfolk, in relation to deaths occurring abroad, which I will primarily
discuss.</div><a name="09021114000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right to treat new clause 9 as a probing amendment, and we look
forward to the Minister&#146;s response. As I read it, which is
imperfectly as a lay person, the issue is not really rehearsed in the
Bill in the way in which it was in the draft Bill. There appears to be
an interesting disagreement of interpretation. The Library research
paper implies that the thinking in the draft Bill, which would have
limited inquests carried out abroad, has been dropped in favour of more
or less leaving the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>status quo. I accept, if only by faith, that there will still be
provision for inquests in relation to deaths abroad, but I wait for the
Minister&#146;s assurance to confirm that. For the reasons that I
have given and wish to give, that is very important, and perhaps the
Minister will explain the thinking on that
point.</div><a name="09021114000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know&#151;again, the Library research paper refers to
this&#151;that there are some doubts. Without making use of an
international provision&#151;I think that there is no Hague
convention in this area&#151;no British court or coroner could draw
on or compel foreign authorities to provide or carry out essential
procedures, such as post mortems, in a consistent way or, if the event
has occurred within British jurisdiction, according to their wishes.
There is a need to clarify the powers and circumstances under which a
coroner may proceed in relation to a death abroad. In new clause 9, we
provide that on return to a coroner&#146;s area, the senior coroner
will conduct&#151;indeed, must conduct&#151;an investigation, if
appropriate, under the Coroners Act 1988. In effect, that will bring
the matter into British jurisdiction. New clause 9(3) addresses a
situation where there is no body, or where the body has been disposed
of before return to the jurisdiction, and subsequently, the
family&#146;s right to apply for an inquest. There is a separate
provision in relation to consular
authorities.</div><a name="09021114000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
I can speak in general terms about that matter. As I understand the
thinking in relation to the draft Coroners Bill, one of the problems
identified by the Ministry of Justice is that one cannot compel the
giving of evidence. The suggestion is that the chief coroner would in
effect, stand in and act as the internationally representative
authority and would request his opposite number in another jurisdiction
to provide the information&#151;ideally, the information would be
provided in a reasonably coherent and standardised form. That role is
terribly important, because otherwise the nature of an
inquest&#151;even if carried out in the UK into a death occurring
abroad&#151;may be somewhat impaired and more difficult to conclude.
I modestly suggested that point to my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk for his new clause. In terms of the thinking behind
the charter for the bereaved and in the interests of the families
involved, we should take a very close look at the ability of the
consular service to advise family members as to their rights and
responsibilities, if a death occurs
abroad.</div><a name="09021114000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I would like to say a word from my own experience. Our
constituents often feel&#151;they sometimes write to us rather
bitterly about this&#151;that as Members of Parliament, we do not
know anything about difficulties. If we have been MPs for any length of
time, we know a great deal about the difficulties faced by our
constituents, and, how ever sad they are for the individuals, they are
invaluable in bringing up cases and problems. It just so happens that
in this particular case&#151;it is now half a lifetime ago, since I
refer to events in March and April 1974&#151;I have some personal
experience of a death abroad involving a close member of my own family.
To compound matters, the particular accident leading to subsequent
death took place on a British-registered ship in United States
territorial waters&#151;the lawyers in Committee may wish to reflect
on the particular interaction and conflict of laws and subsequent
private litigation on the matter. But I do not intend to indulge myself
or reveal any further details.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div><a name="09021114000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make no
criticism of the consular authorities, who were aware of the accident
and subsequently notified of the death. A British death certificate was
issued, as well as an American death certificate. Lessons could be
learned from the handling of that case. We ended up with a situation
where the US authorities conducted&#151;without our
involvement&#151;what might be called a peremptory inquest into the
circumstances of death. However, no substantive investigation of the
facts took place either there or in the United Kingdom, other than what
we were able to obtain through legal
process.</div><a name="09021114000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was suggested at the time that we might be able to ask for an inquest
in the UK, but I never saw any specification in writing. We did not
proceed with that, and I wish to say no more about it. But what I do
want to say, informed by my experience of those many years
ago&#151;it is in the past, and I do not wish to go back to
it&#151;is that even relatively sophisticated people are very
vulnerable in such circumstances, where they may find themselves in a
forest of jurisdiction. It is self-evident that in a highly developed
country with good medical and legal services, the same working language
as ours and broadly the same legal system, it was easier to deal with
the situation than it must have been in the case referred to by my hon.
Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk, which involved a road
accident in India with different languages and different public
expectations.</div><a name="09021114000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we should be able, so far as we can, to offer the
same kinds of services to bereaved families through the consular
service and the activities of the chief coroner. We should seek an
exchange of information in order to investigate such circumstances,
where it is appropriate, not to a higher standard, but ideally to the
same standard or to a broadly equivalent standard. That is important
not only for the families&#151;I have mentioned that the event
actually took place on a United Kingdom-registered ship, and there were
issues of potential liability and so forth&#151;but so that lessons
of failure or success can be learned for the future. As I have said, I
do not want to pursue that point, but I think that it is
valuable&#151;it has certainly been valuable for me to at least get
that off my chest. Nearly all bereaved families who have an interest in
this Bill would say that whatever happened can actually serve to
advance a better understanding of the circumstances and better practice
for the future. That, frankly, is what we would all wish to
see.</div><a name="09021114000061"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000337"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> This has been a very intelligent and thoughtful
short debate on clause 1 and the two new clauses. In my response, I
hope that I can reassure the Committee that the new clauses themselves
are unnecessary. I accept the assurance of the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk that new clause 9 is a probing new clause.</div>
<a name="09021114000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will deal
first with situations where a death occurs abroad and the body is
returned to England or Wales. I believe that the powers suggested in
new clause 19 already exist in clause 1. What the hon. Member for Rugby
and Kenilworth said about subsection (4) being conjunctive is true.
However, once the coroner is made aware that the body of a deceased
person has arrived in his area&#151;no matter where the death
occurred&#151;then he has the duty to carry out an investigation. It
does not matter whether the death occurs abroad or even in another part
of the UK; if the body is returned to the jurisdiction of the coroner,
then the duty exists.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div><a name="09021114000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Daventry and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton East have highlighted some of the problems
in cases overseas&#151; in particular, getting the necessary
information to carry out the investigation. In that situation, the
chief coroner will have a central role in establishing relationships
with the relevant authorities overseas in order to act on behalf of the
senior coroners, where such information is required. At present, that
liaison is undertaken by the Foreign Office or sometimes by the UK
central authority.</div>
<a name="09021114000275"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I have spoken to
someone who was in the Foreign Office and who dealt with deaths
overseas, such as the tsunami in south-east Asia. That person was
involved in supporting families and was party to ensuring that inquests
took place
properly.</div><a name="09021114000299"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09021114000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000338"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the Minister accept that although the
Foreign Office did an amazing job in the exceptional circumstance of
the tsunami, one of the difficulties about individual cases is that
they will be relatively rare? Therefore, with the greatest respect to
consular authorities, who have many other commitments, they might not
have day-to-day experience, so should they not simply refer people to
the relevant experts at headquarters who can advise
them?</div><a name="09021114000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000339"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. I
agree that the work done by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and
consular offices has been outstanding in those cases. However, he is
right&#151;and that is why the chief coroner&#146;s role is so
important. Apart from anything else, many overseas countries do not
have a coronial service or anything similar. Therefore the chief
coroner&#146;s role would be central to acting on behalf of all
coroners in respect of deaths that occur abroad, and establishing
relationships with other countries in order to get the desired
information.</div>
<a name="09021114000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000340"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In a sense, this is an afterthought to my earlier
remarks: will the Minister consider the possibility that where a death
is reported to the consular authorities overseas and a death
certificate is issued, some notification should be made to the UK
authorities&#151;perhaps to the chief coroner&#151;so that there
could be some clearance to decide whether or not an inquest should take
place in the
UK?</div><a name="09021114000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000341"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will certainly consider that. I will come to
some of the practicalities&#151;I do not want to consider too many
&#147;what if&#148; questions, because we can find ourselves in
fantasy land if we go too far down that road. When I refer to the chief
coroner&#146;s role of establishing relationships with foreign
authorities, I do not refer to military personnel on active service,
for whom we have properly established arrangements, which will continue
to operate as they do now.</div>
<a name="09021114000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000342"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The Minister mentioned the tsunami. I quote
from page 21 of the explanatory notes on clause 5 of the
draft
Bill:</div><a name="09021114000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
purpose of this clause and clause 6 is to get the balance right in
terms of sensitivity towards bereaved people while at the same time
making sure that coroners are not being asked to carry out
investigations which will add nothing to the knowledge of how someone
came by their death. An example of the latter could be those who
tragically died in the Asian tsunami in 2004 where the cause of death
was clear.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="09021114000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were the Government
thinking at the time that when you have a large number of deaths caused
by one natural disaster there should not be individual inquests? Is the
Minister saying that that train of thought has been replaced by the
current thinking, which is that all such deaths would probably have had
separate
inquests?</div><a name="09021114000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000343"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The latter is correct. It relates to the
comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and
Sefton, East about the Hillsborough case. That would be an instance in
which the chief coroner could give direction as to whether inquests
should be held as a whole&#151;considering many deaths
together&#151;or individual deaths should be investigated separately.
For example, we want to use different jurisdictions to deal with
military deaths abroad, so that inquests take place closer to where the
family lives. That would be one example of the chief coroner being able
to intervene. When many deaths occur due to a natural disaster abroad,
the chief coroner could make that kind of
direction.</div>
<a name="09021114000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000344"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have listened carefully to my
hon. Friend. My concern about dealing with those who died in a disaster
as one event is that, although the cause of death might be
the same in every case, the circumstances might vary from case to case.
In the example of Hillsborough, everybody died as a result of the lack
of proper policing, as the Taylor inquiry established. However, had
medical attention been received earlier, some of them might have
survived. It is important for the bereaved that such issues are
explored, and that can only be done through individual cases, not by
treating them all as one class of
case.</div><a name="09021114000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000345"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I assure my right hon. Friend that I understand
exactly his point, which the chief coroner would have to take
cognisance of. In the investigation after such a disaster, it would be
important for the chief coroner to reflect on those kinds of issues,
and if appropriate to direct that individual inquests need to take
place.</div>
<a name="09021114000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
that part of the new clause that deals with deaths overseas where there
is no body or where it has been buried or cremated. In reference to the
hon. Member for Daventry&#146;s intervention, there are already
arrangements in place to register deaths in order to accommodate the
circumstances in which a death has occurred but the body is
irrecoverable. The bereaved family could make an application for a
leave to swear death order, based on evidence. If the court makes that
order, probate can go forward. To some extent, that is part of the
closure procedure for a family. That is what was used in the 2004
tsunami. Special arrangements were made for consular death certificates
to be issued where the bodies were not recovered, on the basis of
evidence gathered by British police teams in their own special
investigation.</div><a name="09021114000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the body is buried or cremated outside England and Wales and has never
been situated in England and Wales, obvious practical difficulties
could hamper a coroner&#146;s investigation and certainly make it of
pretty dubious value. I am not convinced that that would not be a
recipe for further dissatisfaction for a bereaved
family.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div><a name="09021114000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000346"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I want to refer only briefly to my personal
experience. There was no question as to the immediately proximate
circumstances&#151;viz, a head injury. The concern would be more with
the kind of narrative verdict that a coroner in Britain could now
generate about the alleged negligence or otherwise that led to the
circumstances in which the family member was injured. I am not at all
clear that an entirely satisfactory issuing of a foreign death
certificate would not be in order, but it precluded, or appeared to
preclude, a separate investigation as to the antecedent circumstances,
which were clearly more important as far as we were
concerned.</div><a name="09021114000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000347"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. I
hope, however, that that is covered under clause 1 by the different
duties that the senior coroners and the chief coroner have. The duty to
investigate</div><a name="09021114000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not arise because of the destruction, loss or absence of the
body&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
subsection (4), the senior coroner has a power to report to the chief
coroner if there is good evidence that a death has occurred. The chief
coroner could weigh up the evidence and decide whether to direct an
investigation into the
death.</div><a name="09021114000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000348"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I return to the point I made while interviewing my
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. The provision to which
the Minister refers applies only if the death has occurred in or near
the coroner&#146;s area&#151;it does not deal with the point that
my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry raises about deaths that occur
abroad.</div><a name="09021114000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is right that there will be some occasions when the
investigation by the coroner of a death occurring abroad&#151;where
the coroner does not have access to the body&#151;will be
unsatisfactory. Could I ask her to consider subsection (3) of new
clause 9, which says that relatives of the deceased
may</div><a name="09021114000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;apply
to the Chief Coroner for an investigation to be
held.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not oblige the chief coroner to carry out such an investigation,
but it enables the chief coroner to consider such an application where
it is appropriate for him to do
so.</div><a name="09021114000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000349"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. In the situation
described by the hon. Member for Daventry, the bereaved family can make
that application to the chief coroner. Depending on the circumstances,
he or she could then direct that an investigation be held. I think that
that covers as many cases as possible without allowing outlandish
ideas. We are trying to be as practical as
possible.</div><a name="09021114000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000350"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister wants to say
something about the final subsection of the new clause. It would help a
lot, and it would be entirely in the spirit of the charter for the
bereaved, if the consular authorities at least had the standard
practice of issuing to families a piece of paper explaining their
rights and recourse. They could bring that back with them and, on
reflection, consider whether or not they wished to take the matter
forward.</div><a name="09021114000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000351"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is a practical suggestion, which I will
take forward. I strongly believe that we should give people as much
information about those situations as possible and allow them to take
responsibility for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>making a decision that is best for them. All coroners will have to
provide statistical information to the chief coroner&#151;further
information of that nature will be helpful to him&#151;as will the
medical adviser, who will be able to interpret some of that statistical
information on behalf of the chief coroner. That will be helpful
too.</div><a name="09021114000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09021114000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk tabled this as a
probing amendment. As he stated, the idea is to help bereaved families
whose loved ones have died overseas to find closure through the
coroner&#146;s investigation. That is particularly the case where
there is no body or where the body has been buried or cremated
overseas. I hope that the procedures that I have set out provide that
reassurance.</div>
<a name="09021114000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new clause
19 tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth, the chief coroner already has the power, under clause 3, to
direct coroner resources to deal with delays and backlogs. In a case of
mass fatalities, a local authority can appoint further deputies to help
out. It is important to put on record that the changes made in this
clause that give that duty and responsibility to the chief coroner
rather than the Lord Chancellor are, as I hope that everyone would
agree, the right road to go down. As the chief coroner will have
overall responsibility for the day-to-day running of the coroner
service, he should be more aware of what the problems may be and how
best to allocate resources.</div>
<a name="09021114000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend about psychological
autopsies, the charter explicitly states that the chief coroner will
set out minimum standards in relation to specific deaths. That could
include advice on the use of psychological autopsies&#151;I do not
preclude that possibility in any way.</div>
<a name="09021114000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000352"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her
explanation. I want to clarify a couple of points. To recap quickly,
the clauses in the draft Bill prevented an inquest into a person killed
abroad unless certain circumstances applied, including, for example, if
they were serving in the armed forces. The draft Bill said that there
will not normally be an inquest into deaths occurring abroad unless
certain factors apply, and stated that the coroner had the power to
refer a death occurring abroad to the chief coroner, who could then
order an investigation. Is this Bill likely to lead to more inquests
into deaths abroad than would have been the case under the draft Bill?
All hon. Members have received correspondence from worried constituents
who want to know whether getting such inquests will become more
difficult. Can she explain to the Committee&#151;she has not done
this so far&#151;the difference between what is in the Bill before
us, and what was in the draft Bill? That would put our minds at rest,
and enable me to conclude that the new clause is not
necessary.</div>
<a name="09021114000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000353"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The provision in the draft Bill and in this Bill
is not different. As far as deaths abroad are concerned, where there is
no body returned to England or Wales, the policy is exactly the same.
The language is different&#151;it is expressed slightly differently
in this Bill. To reassure the hon. Gentleman, deaths will be
investigated if they would have been investigated under the present
system. With the changes in the legislation and the widening in clause
1, there will probably be more inquests 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>on deaths abroad than has occurred up to now. However, it would not be
possible to put a figure on it. I reassure him and the Committee that
we are giving bereaved families more scope to have closure through the
inquest system than they have at the
moment.</div>
<a name="09021114000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000354"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The Minister is therefore saying that the more
widely drafted wording of subsection (4)(b) replaces two whole clauses
in the draft Bill. The Government are looking for a more flexible,
easier-to-understand system, which provides more scope and flexibility
for the chief coroner.</div>
<a name="09021114000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000355"></a>Bridget

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000356"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Clause 2 is similar to section 14 of the
Coroners Act 1988, which allows a coroner in one district to ask a
coroner from another district to assume jurisdiction over an
investigation&#151;in effect, to take over. One of the discussions
that has been going on relates to the costs of transferring inquests to
another coroner area. Will the Minister tell the Committee the
situation regarding costs? Will they be paid entirely by the coroner
area where the inquest takes place after the transfer, or will the
original coroner area pay some of those costs?</div>
<a name="09021114000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">This clause
is good news as far as military inquests are concerned, because we have
all been concerned about the situation relating to the bodies of
tragically deceased servicemen and women who have been flown into RAF
Lyneham in Wiltshire and RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Military
inquests have been taking place within Wiltshire and Oxfordshire and
carried out by the local county coroners. They have been carried out
extremely effectively, but the problem is that significant delays have
built up, and that has been a concern to both the coroners in those
areas and the families involved. Why can the families not&#151;as a
matter of course&#151;elect to have the inquest in their home town?
Under clause 2, according to my reading of it, families could speak to
the coroner, and the coroner could decide to request that another
coroner carries out the investigation. That coroner could be the
coroner for the home town or city of the families involved. The inquest
would therefore take place, probably as a matter of course, in either
Wiltshire or Oxfordshire, but when pressures build up and delays take
place, there could be an easy transfer to another city or
area.</div>
<a name="09021114000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members on
both sides of the Committee will have dealt with situations in which
families who have lost loved ones in either Iraq or Afghanistan have
found it extremely inconvenient and difficult to get to Wiltshire or
Oxfordshire. Recently, a family wrote to me to ask why an inquest could
not have taken place in Norfolk; I was sympathetic to that. Does the
clause make that eventuality more likely and more easily brought about,
and will the Minister answer my question about
costs?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="09021114000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000357"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Briefly, may I support my hon. Friend in his
queries? Two relevant cases have affected me, as it happens, because of
the strange geographical situation I find myself in. I live in the
extreme south-west of Northamptonshire. I sometimes have difficulty
persuading my constituents that I have lived in my constituency for 40
years, which I have, because I have an Oxfordshire post code. In
addition, a motorway immediately adjacent to where I live is policed
not by Northamptonshire police, but, by arrangement, by Thames Valley
police, because it would clearly be stupid to break up the
responsibility for a two-mile stretch of somebody else&#146;s
jurisdiction. On one occasion, less than a mile from my home, a
fatality took place in which a cyclist fell from the motorway down on
to the road below. That created a jurisdiction issue. Subsequently, a
former employee&#151;whom we took on part time to look after
livestock on my farm, which goes right down to the county boundary and
crosses it at one point&#151;was sadly afflicted, after a life of
perfect health, by a sudden heart attack. We found him dead in the
field, and it was difficult not only in personal
terms&#151;obviously&#151;but in terms of sorting out the coronial
jurisdiction. Everybody was helpful, but the body was removed to
Northampton because the death had occurred in Northamptonshire,
notwithstanding that the widow lived within two miles in Oxfordshire
and all the interests were down there. Within the spirit of
what the Minister seeks to do, I seek an understanding&#151;not in
those circumstances, because it is a matter of judgment&#151;that
such provision should become more frequent than it has been in the
past. To stray briefly into clause 3, if there are difficulties and the
coroner is stroppy and reluctant to forgo jurisdiction, the chief

<a name="09021114000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is
to be a transfer, it is terribly important that the process is cleared

and so forth. We do not want, as we have occasionally had from the
Government&#151;I will not stray into that now&#151;a commitment to
an administrative system that gives rise to further delay and distress.
I hope that the Minister can assure us that the provision will work

later.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="09021114000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000360"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments. The MOD has also moved a great deal in trying to be far more
supportive and flexible in getting the information that we need for
those investigations to be carried
out.</div><a name="09021114000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I can give both hon. Gentlemen the assurances that they need.
There are a number of reasons why a senior coroner might ask another
coroner to take on an investigation. The most common reason will likely
be that the family so wishes it. If the death occurred in one
jurisdiction and the body lies there, but the family lives in an
entirely different part of the country, it would be appropriate. I
assume that the coroner would be perfectly entitled to ask a colleague
to take on that investigation. There might be other reasons. The
coroner might know the deceased person and therefore feel that it would
not be appropriate to conduct the investigation. The important thing is
that the coroner should come to such arrangements so that bereaved
families receive the service they deserve and, as the hon. Member for
Daventry asked, the inquest is conducted as quickly as possible. The
clause replicates broadly section 4 of the Coroners Act
1988.</div><a name="09021114000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09021114000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am confident that coroners will act reasonably, accommodate requests
from their colleagues and help where they are able; they do that at the
moment. However, the fact that the chief coroner must be informed that
a request has been made will ensure that such requests are monitored,
and he will be able to see whether anyone is&#151;or appears to
be&#151;misusing the system. Therefore, the chief coroner will be
able to intervene, as under clause 3, at an early stage if there are
disputes; that will be part of his leadership role.</div>
<a name="09021114000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
issue of cost. Who will pay will depend on the circumstances; generally
it will be the transferring area. However, that will not apply to
military inquests, where the local area will be expected to pay. In
general, the policy on military deaths is that single deaths will be
transferred but multiple deaths will not, for reasons that will be
obvious to the Committee.</div>
<a name="09021114000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000361"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I want to ask the Minister one final question
about military deaths. Is it fair to say that, hitherto, families have
had problems getting the inquest transferred to their home cities? If
that has been the case, is the Minister confident that her good offices
will have prevailed on the relevant authorities to ensure
that if families now want a transfer, that will always be
allowed? The Bill makes clear exactly what the procedure
is.</div><a name="09021114000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000362"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Certainly, families have had problems in getting
cases transferred, because the law did not allow for it. The law states
that the inquest must take place in the jurisdiction where the body is
held. That is one of the difficulties in Scotland regarding military
deaths of Scottish personnel. It has a ridiculous situation whereby
aeroplanes must touch down at Brize Norton or Lyneham for an inquest of
a Scottish serviceman or woman to be held&#151;Scotland simply does
not have a coronial system in the same way that we do. Clause 2 is
therefore important.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
3</h4><a name="09021114000008"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Direction
for other coroner to conduct
investigation</div><a name="09021114000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div>
<a name="09021114000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000363"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Clause 3 gives the chief coroner the power to
direct another senior coroner to conduct investigations. I would be
grateful if the Minister will give us examples of where this might be
needed. Certainly, one can think of appalling accidents and disasters
such as Hillsborough or Hungerford, where there was a tragic mass
shooting in 1988. In those cases, the chief coroner would want to make
sure that the inquests were moved to different areas&#151;perhaps out
of that particular county. Will the Minister give examples where a
chief coroner might use the powers? Also, who will bear the cost of
transfers? The chief coroner might direct an inquest which takes place
away from the area in which a disaster happened; there would be
substantial cost. Would the transferring coronial area pay, or would
that fall to the area to which the inquest was transferred? The
implications are significant, because we might be talking about an
inquest lasting for many weeks and costing a large amount of
money.</div><a name="09021114000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000364"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Clause 3 gives chief coroners the power to
co-ordinate work in different coronial areas. I would like to highlight
the fact that, although this is a welcome provision&#151;as was
clause 2&#151;it is only needed because the Government have dropped
the proposal to have a centrally co-ordinated national coronial
service. I would be grateful if the Minister were to respond to a
number of concerns about that
element.</div><a name="09021114000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
clause allows for a sharing of burdens and workload across coronial
areas, if there is an issue with workload, backlog and so on. There
have clearly been significant problems in the past in certain
areas&#151;in some areas, there is still a significant problem. I
asked a parliamentary question in December 2006&#151;I do not have
more up-to-date figures&#151;when some outstanding cases had been
awaiting an inquest for more than five years, and some had been waiting
for 10 years. That causes severe stress and distress for the
victims&#146;
families.</div><a name="09021114000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the provisions in this clause would make a difference, I am
disappointed that the Government have not decided to go ahead with a
single, national coroners service. A properly co-ordinated service
would enable fair sharing of the burden of work, so backlogs would
arise less frequently. It would also be able to tackle the significant
issue of funding for coroners&#146; areas&#151;we heard evidence on
that in the sittings that we held last week. It is clear that funding
and the provision of resources other than funding&#151;space, offices
and services for witnesses attending an inquest&#151;are patchy
across the country. We heard evidence from the coroner from Liverpool,
who clearly has palatial suites and is very happy with his lot in life.
However, I have visited the Cardiff coroner&#146;s offices in the
court in my constituency, which is, I would say, probably closer to the
other end of the scale, given that it is located in a city centre and
has a significant workload.</div>
<a name="09021114000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The coroner
in Cardiff is a paired operation between the Vale of Glamorgan and
Cardiff county council. Most deaths occur in Cardiff, and the Vale of
Glamorgan 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>is reluctant to provide a lot of resources from which its residents will
not benefit. The provision in Cardiff is in the central police station.
The way in which you are greeted and how welcome you are made to feel
depends on the desk sergeant. There are no toilet facilities for the
jurors, no proper waiting area for the witnesses, very cramped offices
for the coroners and so on. The provision would tackle some of the
backlog issues, but it will do nothing to tackle that, because the
power for the chief coroner to do so is not provided in this
clause.</div><a name="09021114000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
the backlog that clause 3 would tackle, serious issues are built into
the system by the funding being provided on a local basis by local
authorities. For example, the coroner in Cardiff is employed on a
part-time basis, despite the fact that she actually works full time off
her own bat&#151;she is only paid to work part time. That is the only
way that she has been able to manage the backlog. Clearly, the
provisions in clause 3 would tackle that in some way, but I would be
grateful if the Minister were to answer why the Government decided not
to implement a fully national coroners service. Some of the fundamental
problems that are built into the current system are not being tackled
by this Bill and will therefore
continue.</div><a name="09021114000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000365"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> First, let me give some examples of when or why
the chief coroner may direct that an inquest be held in a different
area. One will be to deal with localised backlogs. I was a bit worried
about what the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central was saying. I hope that
she is not trying to give the impression that backlogs are springing up
all over the country, because I do not believe that that is the case.
However, backlogs and unexpected demand can occur&#151;the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk gave the example of a multiple shooting.
That might create a backlog and could be a case where a chief coroner
directs that investigations be held in another
area.</div><a name="09021114000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example is when the inquests took place into the deaths in the London
bombings. They were taken by one coroner, which means that the
coroner&#146;s other work may have to be sent elsewhere. The main
reason for that is to make sure that backlogs do not occur and that
bereaved families get prompt investigations. A further example is where
several deaths occur but the families live in different areas. In this
case, the chief coroner may decide to allocate the inquest to a
particular place that is most convenient for the families
involved.</div>
<a name="09021114000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000366"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): A moment ago, we heard
about resources and backlogs. Should we not assert as a matter of
principle that in the main the inquest should be in the place where the
body is and where the death has occurred? That is the position in the
Bill, and it has been the case in the history of the coronial service
for ever. It should never simply happen for administrative convenience.
In relation to clause 2, the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk asked
about families that say, &#147;We think the inquest should be here,
where we and a lot of the witnesses are, rather than there, where the
death occurred.&#148; Is that a case where the chief coroner might be
asked to step in, if the senior coroner did not agree to the
family&#146;s
request?</div><a name="09021114000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000367"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is a very good example of exactly the role
that the chief coroner would have under clause 3, and given that
direction&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div><a name="09021114000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000368"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the Minister confirm to the Committee that
any one of these decisions on an instruction would be judicially
reviewable, if somebody felt that that were
appropriate?</div>
<a name="09021114000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000369"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Yes, such decisions would be judicially
reviewable. The chief coroner will have the power to make those
directions, irrespective of the views of the receiving coroner. That
brings me to the issue of costs. I do not wish to repeat what I said
earlier&#151;basically, my position is the same as stated in a
previous debate.</div>
<a name="09021114000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
turn to what the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central said about the
relationship between different local authorities. I know we will come
to this in greater detail under clause 23, when we will specifically
discuss resources. I suggest to the hon. Lady that, as Cardiff city
council is run by the Liberal Democrats, she might want to have a word
about properly funding the coroners&#146; service in that area. I am
sorry to bring party politics into it, but I could not help
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000370"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> May I ask the Minister again about cost? I
appreciate that she has told us that the position is the same as she
outlined in relation to clause 2. However, I hope that she accepts that
there is one important difference. Under clause 2, where a case is
transferred from coroner A to coroner B, coroner B has to agree to
carry out that inquest, and they may decide not to do so on the basis
of inadequate resources. Under clause 3, as I read it, there is no
opportunity for the receiving coroner, if I may put it that way, to
refuse a request or instruction from the chief coroner. That is surely
a difference in relation to resources. Will the Minister help us on the
consequences for a coroner who believes that they have inadequate
resources but who has been instructed by the chief coroner to take on
an additional
inquest?</div><a name="09021114000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000371"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in his description
of the difference between clauses 2 and 3. Regulations will be made
later in relation to costs, which will be consulted on. I will say two
further things. First, the transferring area will generally pay.
Secondly, if a receiving coroner felt that they did not have the proper
resources, one hopes that a reasonable chief coroner would not try to
send investigations to an area that has its own problems with backlogs
or whatever. The reasonable test would have to come into effect, and I
hope that in that situation the chief coroner would not direct to an
area where it would not be appropriate in those
circumstances.</div><a name="09021114000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000372"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Clause 4 is fairly straightforward, because it
relates to the discontinuation of an investigation when the cause of
death is revealed by a post-mortem. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>It would be helpful if the Minister could elaborate a bit on the clause,
and perhaps give us some examples that we can have a look
at.</div><a name="09021114000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
it is my lack of in-depth reading of the clause, but I am not 100 per
cent. clear about whether there will be an appeal procedure in this
particular case. The family may well feel unhappy about the outcome and
that, despite what has come out of a post-mortem, questions still need
to be asked and lessons learned for the future. They may be very keen
to still have a full inquest. I do not see anything in the clause that
gives immediate rise to the opportunity for an appeal, if the family
feel strongly about it. Of course, they could write to the chief
coroner, who could use their powers in other parts of the Bill, but
would it not be easier to cover it as part of this
clause?</div><a name="09021114000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000373"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> I have a quick question for the Minister about
the clause. My question specifically relates to subsection (4), which
calls on the coroner to provide a written explanation, if requested, of
why the inquest has been discontinued. Clearly, giving an explanation
is to be welcomed, but I want to ensure that, as with all Government
missives, any written explanations are cleared through a plain English
directive, because some Government letters are easier to understand
than others. In a circumstance such as this, clearly it needs to be
easy for the family to understand. I would also be grateful if the
Minister were to clarify whether there will be the opportunity for the
interested person to raise any questions or to get further
clarification, if they do not understand all the issues highlighted by
the coroner. Clearly, making people happy and ensuring that their fears
and concerns have been laid to rest is
important.</div><a name="09021114000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000374"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I hope that I can give the hon. Lady that
assurance. I am a great campaigner for plain English in all Government
documents. I have not been successful on many occasions, but split
infinitives and aberrant apostrophes are included in my campaign for
making sure that people get the information that they need. Of course,
people can return to the coroner and ask for further information. I
know that many coroners often invite families to see them and talk
through the situation, which is often much better than receiving
something in
writing.</div><a name="09021114000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
awful lot of deaths are referred to the coroner because the cause of
death is unknown, but then a post-mortem reveals natural causes and
that there is a perfectly natural explanation. If that happens, there
really is no need for the coroner to investigate the death further.
Sometimes, investigating a death further can cause additional stress
and concern to bereaved families. That is the reason why this clause is
set out as it is, but one has to be sure that it is only the
appropriate cases that are discontinued. If it is suspected that the
death was violent or unnatural, or if it occurred in custody or in
other forms of detention, those cases must progress to an
inquest.</div>
<a name="09021114000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on
the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, clause
30(2)(b) provides an appeal system for families, if an inquest has been
discontinued.</div><a name="09021114000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000377"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> This is a key clause, because it sets out the
purpose of investigations. Our amendments 35 and 48, along with the
Liberal Democrat amendments and the one in the name of the hon. Member
for Stafford, are mainly about trying to learn lessons. They all aim to
ensure that future deaths are
prevented.</div><a name="09021114000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
39 is a legal aficionado&#146;s point. It involves quite a
complicated argument, with which I do not plan to detain the Committee
for long, but we need a full explanation from the Minister. Maybe this
is an opportunity for the hon. Member for Cambridge to chip in, because
he was a distinguished law fellow at Cambridge university. If I had
been taught by him, my law degree might have been slightly better than
it
was.</div><a name="09021114000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5(2) seeks to codify into statute the provisions of R on the
application of Middleton, the HM coroner for the western district of
Somerset and Avon 2004 2AC182. The Government say that 5(2) is needed
to ensure compliance with ECHR article 2, which relates to the
state&#146;s responsibility to ensure that its actions do not cause
the death of citizens. The Bill&#151;I find this
surprising&#151;does not define the precise circumstances when a
coroner should conduct an article 2 investigation. I listened carefully
to what Andr(c) Rebello had to say to the Committee in the
evidence-gathering
session:</div><a name="09021114000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have concerns regarding matters to be ascertained at an inquest in
clause 5, because the draftsman has taken the words of Lord Bingham in
the Middleton case and enshrined them in clause 5(2)...It is far
better to leave clause 5 as &#145;how&#146;, where how means in
some inquests &#145;by what means&#146; and in other inquests
&#145;by what means and in what
circumstances&#146;&#148;<i class="I">,</i></div><a name="09021114000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is, of course, what article 2 would lay down. He takes the view
that</div><a name="09021114000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would be far better to leave out clause 5(2), so that
&#145;how&#146; means whatever the common law says it means for the
time being. If we are now reforming the 1887 legislation, I am fairly
sure that in 2051 the law will have developed somewhat, and I do not
think it right to tie the hands of the European Court and the House of
Lords with regard to
developments.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Coroners and Justice Public Bill Committee, </i>3 February 2009; c. 56,
Q119.]</div><a name="09021114000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a
word with Mr. Rebello afterwards, and I have looked at the
judgment that he quoted. I have also spoken to learned sources, who
take the view that the Government should explain why they feel that
Andr(c) Rebello is wrong and that subsection (2) should remain in
the
Bill.</div><a name="09021114000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000378"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Before my hon. Friend sits down, will he reflect
on whether subsection (2) would require a senior coroner to take a view
as to the applicability or otherwise of the convention rights before
any investigation has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>taken place? That would require, with the greatest respect, a degree of
legal expertise and interpretation, which might give rise to further
litigation on whether those convention rights had been so
considered.</div><a name="09021114000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000379"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> That would be a lawyer&#146;s dream. There
would be cases going on appeal and possibly all the way to the House of
Lords time and time again. I hope that the Minister can explain to the
Committee, possibly in layman&#146;s language, why it is necessary to
keep that
subsection.</div><a name="09021114000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come now to the nub of the clause and the crux of amendments 35 and 48,
which relate to paragraph 6 of schedule 4 on page 129 on</div>
<a name="09021114000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Action
to prevent other
deaths&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
6(1)
states:</div><a name="09021114000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
coroner may report the matter to a person who the coroner believes may
have power to take such
action.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
suggest that rather than &#147;may&#148;, the coroner
&#147;must&#148; make that report. There should be a statutory duty
on the coroner.</div>
<a name="09021114000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friends and I have put a lot of work into drafting amendment 48, which
is the key amendment. It would add to paragraph 6:</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;(3) The senior coroner may then request the
relevant person to submit, within 3 months, a full update on any action
he has taken, or alternatively detail the reasons for any failure to
take action.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4) The senior
coroner must at the end of each year forward all reports and updates to
the Chief Coroner, who must present them to
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may not be brilliantly drafted, but it makes the point loud and clear.
When there is a tragic death, lessons must be learned.</div>
<a name="09021114000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have all
come across constituency cases where families have lost loved ones. In
the past few years, there have been two appalling fatal accidents in my
constituency. Very near the county boundary between Norfolk and
Cambridgeshire there is a junction where a small road called Broad End
road crosses the A47. Of course, the families involved realise that
nothing can be done to bring their loved ones back. One case involved a
young lad on a motor cycle who was minding his own business on the main
road and a van pulled out at what is a notoriously dangerous
junction.</div>
<a name="09021114000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a more
recent occasion, four youngsters in a car navigated from the minor road
on to the major road, trying to cut across it&#151;it was night, it
was raining and the traffic was moving at high speed. I think that the
girl driving the car had only been driving for a number of months.
There was a car travelling at very high speed&#151;way in excess of
the speed limit&#151;and although that junction has broken white
lines, they are not double white lines, so cars can legally overtake on
the junction. It was a tragic accident. The family realise that nothing
can bring their loved ones back, but they want closure above all else.
In that case, they felt that the driver of the other vehicle should
have been prosecuted for causing death by dangerous driving&#151;the
matter is ongoing, and I will not comment further because it is a
sensitive issue.</div>
<a name="09021114000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The family
also want lessons to be learned. They take the view&#151;they feel
very strongly indeed&#151;that in the case of the Highways Agency,
the coroner should have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>duty to report to the relevant person. There should then be a duty on
that authority&#151;be it the Highways Agency, the Health and Safety
Executive, the Department of Transport, the Ministry of Defence or any
number of different Government bodies&#151;to report back on what
improvements could be
made.</div><a name="09021114000303"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09021114000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned that the Bill as drafted does not go far enough. Let us
consider what various organisations have said to us. I refer again to
our friend Andr(c) Rebello. In his evidence to the Committee, he
talked about the rule 43 provision. We all know about rule 43. He said
that the Bill as it stands is inadequate&#151;he was referring to the
relevant schedule&#151;and that there are no sanctions for failing to
respond. That is very poor, given that learning lessons is one of the
most important parts of coronial jurisdiction. He certainly feels
strongly that we can learn quite a lot from what happens overseas. For
example, in Canada and in Victoria, which he
mentioned&#151;</div><a name="09021114000164"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000381"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman as he
has tabled a similar amendment. Hopefully between us, we will be able
to make some progress, perhaps even by voting on one of the
amendments.</div><a name="09021114000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000382"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that his amendments
do not include the sanction that Mr. Rebello pointed out is
not in the Bill? What does he think would be the best
sanction?</div><a name="09021114000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000383"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> We do not include a sanction, but our
amendment includes a statutory duty. Legal action could then result
from that. I am tempted by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion that
a firmer sanction should be laid down in the statute. There should be a
statutory duty on the coroner to report at the end of each year to the
chief coroner, who would then present a report to Parliament. It is
vital that the knowledge gleaned from those inquests does not go to
waste.</div><a name="09021114000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberty
is another organisation that has briefed us at some length. It talks
about schedule 4 and says
that</div><a name="09021114000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
senior coroner who believes that action should be taken to prevent the
reoccurrence of fatalities may report the matter to the relevant
authorities.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would replace the word &#147;may&#148; with
&#147;must&#148;. Liberty goes on:</div>
<a name="09021114000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no responsibility to report findings, and there are no guidelines on
cases where recommendations should be made. Furthermore, coroners have
no power to ensure their recommendations are implemented, and there are
no duties on the part of other agencies to respond or institute
changes.</div><a name="09021114000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
the past coroners have been found to be making identical findings and
recommendations which were not
implemented.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone
who has been following the coronial system over the past few years will
know that to be the case. Liberty goes on:</div>
<a name="09021114000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
previous draft Coroners Bill gave a nod towards this problem with
provision made for the Chief Coroner to report to Parliament so that
contentious issues could be
scrutinised.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
submit that our amendment takes care of that, although not with quite
the same wording as the draft Bill. What we are saying in our amendment
is that the senior coroner must, at the end of the year, forward all
reports 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>and updates to the chief coroner, who must then present them to
Parliament. There would be an annual report from him and he would be
able to identify the different types of lessons that can be learned
from a multiplicity of types of deaths&#151;for example, on the road,
drowning or other accidents that take place and result in tragic
deaths.</div>
<a name="09021114000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">If one
considers what happens elsewhere&#151;for example, in New South
Wales&#151; recommendations are an integral part of the inquest
process and are logged in a detailed document at the end of the
inquest. The document is then available to the public and is tabled in
Parliament. Doing so obviously exerts substantial political pressure on
the Government to take action. In Ontario, for example, the inquest
jury gives a verdict and makes recommendations, which are published
centrally and sent to all the parties involved. Implementation is
monitored annually by a department of the chief coroner&#146;s
office. Although our amendment does not go as far as the provisions in
Victoria, New South Wales or Ontario, it is a sensible move in the
right direction. It would put a statutory duty on the coroner to make
those reports. It would put the duty on the person involved&#151;the
Government agency, the Department or whatever it might be&#151;to
respond. That would mean that the report came through to
Parliament.</div>
<a name="09021114000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Bill
stands, there is nothing that will enable that to happen. My concern is
that lessons will not be learned. I shall conclude with another example
from my constituency. Norfolk is well known for its long sandy beaches,
but the tides can be fairly perilous. On a beach at Brancaster,
drownings have resulted from youngsters taking a risk and going out to
different sand banks. One particular sand bank has an appealing
shipwreck on it. A tragic case of drowning took place during the time
that my predecessor George Turner was MP for North-West Norfolk. He
raised the matter in Parliament and was determined that lessons should
be learned. Of course, there was an inquest and the coroner made
various recommendations, but that is where it ended. I do not believe
that any of the key authorities&#151;whether it was the Crown Estate,
Natural England, the National Trust or the parish council&#151;were
given any proper advice about how to prevent drownings in future.
Perhaps advice could have been given on signage, how to work with other
parish councils or how to look at best practice elsewhere in the
country.</div><a name="09021114000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mercifully,
that tragedy has not been repeated, but the lessons that could and
should have been learned from that incident were not properly learned
or processed in a way that reassured the family. Above all, the family
want closure and for lessons to be learned to prevent future deaths.
Let us improve the Bill so that that can be
achieved.</div><a name="09021114000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000384"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> It is a pleasure, Mr. Cook, to serve on
the Committee under your fair and firm leadership. Clause 5
is subject to paragraph 6 of schedule 4. As the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk said, where a coroner conducts an inquest and feels
that lessons could be learned from a particular death under
investigation that, if applied more generally, could reduce the risk of
deaths in the future, further action should follow. My amendment is in
part to make sure that further action does follow, so that we can
reduce the risk of death in future cases. I am sure that the public
would want us to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div><a name="09021114000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 93
is my own work and I have had no outside help, so I instantly accept
that there are probably flaws in the drafting. There are two points to
my amendment. I intervened on the hon. Gentleman in relation to the
first point, which is the question of sanctions. Since S.I. 2008/1652
was introduced by the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon.
Friend the Member for Lewisham, East last year, there has been a duty
on people who receive a report from a coroner to say something in
response, but so what?</div>
<a name="09021114000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">What if
people do not respond to the coroner&#146;s report&#151;and some
people are not responding to it at present? In theory, if the Bill
became law, the chief coroner could go to the High Court and seek an
injunction to make someone comply with the duty and give an answer.
Having spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers&#146; money, the chief
coroner could get the answer, &#147;Thank you, we have received the
report, we are going to do nothing about it.&#148; We need to make
people sit up and take notice, so my proposal is that it should be a
criminal offence not to respond to the coroner&#146;s report. That
might sound a bit harsh, but it would get people&#146;s attention and
mean that in most cases we would get a response. That does not go as
far as the Liberty proposal, for example, and make people carry out the
coroner&#146;s recommendations, but we should hear the other
side&#146;s response before we conclude what more should be done. It
is important to have their attention and to make them
respond.</div><a name="09021114000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment is inadequate in that it does not specify who the criminal is
if the offence is proved. If the criminal were a hospital trust or a
multinational corporation, who would be convicted? I have not dealt
with that detail. That is something that I would have to rely on the
Minister, with her hoards of civil servants, to take care of, if she
agreed with the principle of it being a criminal offence.</div>
<a name="09021114000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
alternative, of course, would be to go down the route of a civil
penalty and say that someone who does not respond could have a civil
penalty imposed on them. That may be the more modern and progressive
way. It would perhaps not have the negative implication of someone
ending up with a criminal record. However, it would open up further
questions about who would impose the civil penalty. I find it difficult
to envisage that the chief coroner would welcome such a
role.</div><a name="09021114000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000385"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> By way of a helpful suggestion, has the hon.
Gentleman even considered the possibility that the coroner&#146;s
court, or the coroner, might be able to hold the person in contempt for
not
responding?</div><a name="09021114000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000386"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> That is a helpful point. I like the idea of the
coroner summoning someone to court to explain why they did not respond
and to make them give their answer in the court. Such inconvenience
might get their attention too, so there are many ways to do it. The
point is that the Bill, as drafted, has no sanction at all. I would
like the Minister to take account of the many people who have said that
it should.</div>
<a name="09021114000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issue
of reporting, it is important that the public, decision makers and
policy makers understand the trends behind the facts that coroners are
unearthing. It is vital that Parliament sees the results of the
coroner&#146;s recommendations, the person&#146;s responses and any
analysis 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>of trends that the chief coroner is able to give. It is vital that
Parliament has a report from the chief coroner that shows that to us.
It may be that an annual report is too restrictive, because if
something is urgent and action is urgently required, it would be
reasonable for the chief coroner to alert Parliament to a particular
set of circumstances, or a particular trend, in a short space of time.
The chief coroner should not have to wait for an annual report in order
to alert us to
it.</div><a name="09021114000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the draft coroners Bill, in clause 59, there was a provision for the
chief coroner to deliver an annual report to the Lord Chancellor and an
obligation on the Lord Chancellor to lay that report before Parliament.
It is disappointing to see no reference to that provision in the Bill.
The House of Commons Library, in its research paper 09/07, says that it
is the Government&#146;s
intention</div><a name="09021114000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
this would be dealt with in regulations under clause
33(3)(d)&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is drawn in the most general of terms and does not specifically cover
this point.</div>
<a name="09021114000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister is happy to leave it to statutory instruments to require the
chief coroner to give the Minister a report, that is fine&#151;the
Minister can have that option. However, I represent Parliament and the
people, and Parliament wants its report on the face of the Act, whether
or not the Minister makes statutory regulations requiring that a report
be made to the Minister.</div>
<a name="09021114000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last line
of my amendment says that the chief coroner must give the report to
Parliament. That is particularly important. Even if the Minister does
not want primary legislation to receive the report herself, can she
bear it in mind that Parliament wants
it?</div><a name="09021114000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000387"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Somewhat worryingly, I agree with almost every
word that the hon. Gentleman has just said. I also agree with almost
everything that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said. There are
clearly issues here which have broad support on both sides of the
Committee. Particularly with regard to the group of amendments relating
to reports by coroners, there is a strong view on both sides of the
Committee that, at the moment, what is in the Bill does not go far
enough. We all have different ways of suggesting how it could be
changed, but there is a strong view that the provision needs to be
beefed up in some way and
strengthened.</div><a name="09021114000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09021114000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I want to return to the issue of narrative verdicts. The reference in
clause 5(2) that enables juries and coroners, when looking into article
2 deaths, to make a narrative verdict is welcome, but it does not go
far enough. We have had a lot of evidence from witnesses last week, and
I am sure that members of this Committee have spoken to constituents
who have been affected. There is a general desire for a lot more
flexibility&#151;more than the Bill currently provides&#151;to be
built into the
system.</div><a name="09021114000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Narrative
verdicts&#151;when a jury or coroner expand on the information that
is provided&#151;can be incredibly valuable both for the family of
the victim, and also for those who have an interest in the case. They
help in genuinely understanding what happened, why and what the
circumstances were. The hon. Member for Bridgend 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>has raised the issue of psychological inquests. In some ways, it is a
similar idea that a broader amount of information should be provided
and that, following an inquest, there should be flexibility for that
information to come out and be published, so that the first level of
lessons being learned can start to take place.</div>
<a name="09021114000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
with article 2 deaths that there is a requirement for the Government to
allow, where necessary, broader narrative verdicts. That relates to,
for example, whether there are systematic failings that were a factor
in the death or, in the case of a suicide that takes place in the hands
of the state, if that happened because the danger was not recognised by
authorities. There are a number of other cases, and although they were
not in the hands of the state, there may have been circumstances and
incidents in the past that should have been identified. That could be
where somebody was at a particularly high risk of suicide and it did
not get picked up, or where somebody has died in such a way that
significant lessons could be learned. Given that, we are proposing in
amendments 112 to 114 to enable juries and coroners to provide a
narrative verdict where they feel that there is a need to or that they
want to. That is not a requirement&#151;it is making additional
flexibility and giving juries and coroners the ability to do
that.</div><a name="09021114000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
goes hand in hand with amendment 70 which deletes lines 3 to 9 on page
4. It is, in our view, an unprecedented gagging order, which basically
restricts juries from expressing views or explaining the circumstances
of a death beyond the bald facts laid out in paragraphs (a) to (c). I
believe that it is not justifiable to gag a jury or a coroner. By
definition, jury inquests consider the matters most relevant to wider
public interest, because of the type of deaths where jury inquests are
initiated. I feel that clause 5(3) interferes with the ability of
juries to undertake what should be considered as their function and
duty, sitting in coroners&#146; courts. Removing it would enable
narrative verdicts to be introduced, when the jury feels that it is
necessary.</div><a name="09021114000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to highlight that we intend to press amendment 114 to a
Division, because it is an area that we feel strongly about. We have
had a lot of evidence that narrative verdicts can offer significant
benefits, and we would like to flag up to the Government that the Bill
is too restrictive. We would like to enable coroners and juries to make
their own decision about whether to expand on a verdict, when they feel
that that is
necessary.</div><a name="09021114000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of the senior coroners&#146; reports, which has already
been discussed at length, there is a clear need to identify patterns of
problems and systemic failings. There are strong views on both sides of
the Committee that that is an issue that needs to be beefed up. As I
commented on an earlier clause, given that there is no national coroner
service, there is an even greater need to ensure that there are
measures in the Bill for recommendations and reports to be centralised
in either a database or some sort of system, so that patterns can be
identified. Our proposal is that senior coroners&#146; reports would
include recommendations that would be sent to the chief coroner, who
would maintain it centrally, and it would be reported to the Lord
Chancellor annually. The hon. Members for Stafford and for North West
Norfolk have advanced other proposals, all of which attempt to achieve
the same end, and we are happy to support whatever measure achieves the
ultimate goal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="09021114000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Stafford, since bodies are supposed to
respond to coroners&#146; reports, we should&#151;if that is done
fully&#151;be able to start gathering a full picture and identify
where there are problematic patterns of behaviour and broad health and
safety breaches that are repeated across the country. There has been a
problem&#151;I am sure that all hon. Members agree with
this&#151;with the implementation of some recommendations made in
previous public inquiries, where there was no proper monitoring to
ensure that they were implemented. We have fantastic public inquiries
that come up with strong recommendations, which are then not
implemented, and there is very little monitoring of what happens. The
amendments would ensure that that would not happen in coroners&#146;
courts, and nobody could get away with not noticing that something had
not happened. Recommendations would be gathered centrally, and the
chief coroner would have to report to either the Lord Chancellor or
Parliament, so that there would be better accountability and
transparency of what is happening to the reports and the responses on
the recommendations that have been
raised.</div><a name="09021114000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
my experience of talking to and dealing with coroners, I know that they
are extremely experienced and are very good at spotting patterns,
consistent problems and systematic failings. At the moment, we are not
taking advantage of their expertise and knowledge. The
amendments&#151;whichever ones the Government may like to
make&#151;would enable that knowledge and expertise to be better
utilised and the recommendations to be better implemented and
monitored. That would enable Parliament and the Government to have a
much better understanding of the lessons that need to be learned and to
be able to see which public bodies are not implementing the
recommendations. I hope that the Government will take into account the
views that have been expressed on both sides of the Committee, and we
will press amendment 114 to a
vote.</div><a name="09021114000196"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000388"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have little to add to the debate except warm
assent to almost all the points that have been made on both sides of
the Committee. On the utility&#151;or otherwise&#151;of an inquest,
the self-evident point that sometimes needs to be gently put into the
minds of bereaved people is that whatever process we have, it will not
reverse the process of death. The rather more general point is that the
inquest may either be unable to reach a firm conclusion or reach one
where perhaps there are no villains and nothing can be generalised from
the particular proceedings. However, I think that the concern of all
members of the Committee who have spoken is that if a pattern is
building up, it should be the subject of a report. There should be a
system that eventually produces at least an opportunity to capture the
attention of Parliament.</div>
<a name="09021114000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
mentioned at least once in these deliberations, I have had a fairly
long association with the British Lung Foundation and have taken an
interest in mesothelioma. Much of this debate is about good practice.
We will not really, in debating legislation, be able to introduce the
requirements for good practice, except that I hope that the Minister
has noted
them.</div><a name="09021114000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Lung Foundation identified a particular issue in one of its
inquiries. Two years ago, in February 2007, it published a report
called &#147;An unnatural death&#148;. One of the striking things
about it was that it highlighted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>the lack of consistent practice among coroners in responding to deaths
from mesothelioma. There is a variety of circumstances, but the point
that is germane to this debate is that there needs to be some
consistency of reporting, so that the nature of what is happening is
clearly available to the chief coroner and to the decision
makers.</div><a name="09021114000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
happen to know that the Department for Work and Pensions has an
elaborate model and a database relating to all mesothelioma deaths and
is able to predict the likely pattern of mortality over perhaps the
next 40 or 50 years. If that were to be questioned by what was
happening at inquests, and if the coroners&#146; accounts were
sufficiently coherent to build up a pattern of a change in the
epidemiology, it would be a matter of public
interest.</div><a name="09021114000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
if we can use these narrative judgments or reports in the widest
possible context, we can draw the attention of people in government or
in public life to a variety of circumstances in which things might be
better in the future, but one needs the facts to do that, so one needs
a certain coherence in reporting. One needs a readiness to report and
then, as the hon. Member for Stafford, among others, has said so
clearly, an ability to respond on the part of the various interested
persons for whom that report was made. The world is littered with White
Papers and good intentions, none of which has ever been acted on
because we have moved on to the next thing. I would take the process a
stage further back and say that we need consistency and coherence in
reporting.</div><a name="09021114000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other point that I shall add, which again is more a matter of
administration than legislation, is that the chief coroner needs to be
very alert. The chief coroner possibly needs a chief information
officer to complement his activities and to look at the pattern of
information as it comes in, to be able to analyse and cross-analyse it
and to draw people&#146;s attention to what is developing. Let me
give an example. It is often easier to say that cars are all the same
these days, but there might be a particular pattern of failure in a
particular marque. Perhaps some component is wrong, or it might be
brake failure or whatever&#151;something more than one would normally
expect by the nature of the accident. That should be flagged up and
then someone should do something about it. I think that there is a
common will on both sides of the Committee&#151;I certainly wish to
include the Minister in this, in anticipation of her remarks&#151;to
do something about that, but we should set up the best possible
arrangements.</div><a name="09021114000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000389"></a>Mrs.
Moon:</b> It is difficult to rise to speak in this Committee
when one is not a lawyer and one is surrounded by so many lawyers who
speak so wisely and graphically about their involvement with the law.
My background is much more with individuals and their personal
experience of life. That is what I draw on when I consider the
discussion that we have had
today.</div><a name="09021114000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I talk to families who have experienced inquests, I find that part of
what they looked for from the inquest is some resolution to their
grief. They look for answers and explanations as to
&#147;why&#148;. It has been suggested that narrative verdicts are
a particularly helpful way of providing that, in that they give a
longer discussion and explanation of what may have occurred. Equally,
narrative verdicts have caused distress&#151;as have open
verdicts&#151;to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>families that were distressed by things that were said and placed in the
public domain without a full understanding of the individual, their
life and their
background.</div><a name="09021114000204"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09021114000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
urge caution on seeing open and narrative verdicts as potentially
useful ways forward. They also have risks in terms of suicide data
collection, because in the case of narrative verdicts, they are not
recorded as suicide and in the case of an open verdict it is down to a
clerk in the Office for National Statistics to trawl through the
information and decide whether it was a death by suicide. We have some
problems there. I heartily concur with the suggestion that someone must
be held to account and that where we can identify patterns of
information and patterns of failure, someone clearly needs to be
responsible for taking action. Bridgend was identified as a centre
where there had been a cluster of suicides. In fact, Bridgend did not
have the highest number of suicides across Wales&#151;it was quite
low down. What we had was a huge problem building up across Wales that
was not being
identified.</div><a name="09021114000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also urge caution regarding the suggestion that the report must always
come to Parliament. With devolved Administrations, health and transport
are devolved issues. If the area of problematic behaviour or failure
that needs to be identified is not within the purview of Parliament but
within that of a devolved Administration, such as the Welsh Assembly,
there may well be difficulties if the report comes only to Parliament,
and we need to take that into
account.</div><a name="09021114000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I am on my feet, I must quickly mention the charter for the bereaved,
which is extremely welcome. Families have told me that the judicial
atmosphere of the coroner&#146;s court&#151;we have heard the
description of the court based in central Cardiff&#151;is horrendous.
Imagine going there within six months, eight months or a year of the
death of a close family member and having to face the welcome of a desk
sergeant who tells one where to go, a judicial atmosphere, a sense of
stigma and almost a sense of guilt. Families have talked to me about an
invasion of privacy. Because of the need to pull together social and
personal information, there is a feeling that there is almost a desire
to find the dysfunctional nature of a family or individual, which can
be particularly distressing in the full glare of media
coverage.</div>
<a name="09021114000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly welcome clause
5(3):</div><a name="09021114000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Neither
the senior coroner conducting an investigation under this Part into a
person&#146;s death nor the jury (if there is one) may express any
opinion&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly,
families have expressed concern about the following difference in
procedure, and I would welcome a comment from the Minister. A coroner
can express an opinion&#151;and, indeed, hold a press conference in
which to give an opinion&#151;whereas a judge hearing a court case
cannot do that. If, as my understanding is, that provision would
preclude a coroner from doing that, families who have spoken to me
would welcome
it.</div><a name="09021114000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
on delayed inquests, particularly when there has been a tragic death,
we must be mindful of intruding into the grieving process and of the
fact that, for some families, the process is delayed and damaged by the
need to return to court&#151;sometimes, two or three years 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>later&#151;to hear graphic details of their family member&#146;s
death. There must be greater awareness of the damage that we can do to
individuals through delayed inquests. The charter is an opportunity to
help and prepare families prior to the inquest, and an opportunity to
give them guidance and support through it, which is something that we
must all welcome.</div>
<a name="09021114000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09021114000390"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): May I comment briefly on
amendment 70? It addresses the principle of the matter, which is the
restriction&#151;the muzzling&#151;of the jury. As the hon. Member
for Bridgend has said, in some circumstances a jury&#146;s extended
account of the circumstances in which the death came about, or further
information about how such deaths might be prevented in the future,
might not always help. However, the question is whether the jury should
be told that it should never be allowed to do anything of that sort.
The hon. Lady shakes her head, and I think that she agrees that the
jury should have that power, as should the coroner in cases without a
jury. That is the principle of the debate about clause 5. I shall ask
for a vote on amendment 70, so if my hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, Central would be so kind as to withdraw her request for a vote
on amendment 114, it would help, because amendment 70 is far more the
matter of
principle.</div><a name="09021114000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk mentioned amendment 39, the meaning
of subsection (2) and the question raised by Mr. Rebello at
our evidence sessions. Mr. Rebello is wrong, however. The
Bill makes sense, although it is rather mean. It tries to provide for
minimal compliance with human rights standards for the time being.
Mr. Rebello read subsection (2) as meaning that when the
Bill was passed, we would somehow decide the human rights requirements
for an article 2 hearing&#151;we would fix them&#151;and tell
coroners&#146; courts what they must do. He felt that that would be a
rigid way of doing it, and that it would not necessarily comply with
human rights law. But that is not what the provision in
subsection (2) means. It means that a coroner conducting an
investigation must apply human rights law as it stands, so there is no
list of human rights requirements that is drawn up once and for all.
The subsection also applies to every investigation, so a coroner making
an investigation must ask himself whether the restrictions in
subsection (1) would violate the human rights standards for the time
being. If they would, the coroner would have to apply subsection (2)
and go beyond it to ask in what circumstances the death occurred, which
is the broader requirement in the Middleton
case.</div><a name="09021114000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000391"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I use the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments as
an opportunity to ask the Minister whether any training on the human
rights convention and standards is envisaged for coroners? It is a
complex field, and it may not be within their normal purview of
activity.</div><a name="09021114000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000392"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an interesting question. I suspect that
coroners, like all members of the judiciary, receive human rights
training already. Magistrates certainly do, so I would be surprised if
coroners did not. All public officials are bound by the Human Rights
Act. Mr. Rebello&#146;s criticism of clause
5(2)&#151;that it is inflexible&#151;is incorrect. If there is a
criticism, it is that it is minimalist. Instead of admitting the
general principle that the broader circumstances of a death should be
investigated, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>at least where the state is involved, but possibly in other cases as
well, clause 5(2) effectively states, rather mean-spiritedly,
&#147;Well, if not going further would violate human rights, go
further, but otherwise just stick to clause 5(1).&#148; That is the
criticism, not the argument that Mr. Rebello stated in the
evidence session and that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk
repeated just
now.</div><a name="09021114000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000393"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May I ask the hon. Gentleman to resolve the
differences with his colleague while the Minister is responding to the
debate? In any case, any amendments requiring a Division will need to
be moved formally, at which point a decision can be
made.</div><a name="09021114000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000394"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I shall attempt to respond in some detail and
explain what clause 5 is about. In so doing, I hope that I can give
some succour to some of the amendments, although not all of
them.</div><a name="09021114000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5 outlines the matters that a coroner is legally obliged to ascertain
during the course of the investigation. It does not prescribe what
opinions he may express as a result of that investigation. People might
have that impression because they are focusing too narrowly on clause 5
and not taking it in conjunction with clause 10 and paragraph 6 of
schedule 4. In that context, it can be seen that coroners may make such
comments at the end of their investigations. However, the purpose of a
coroner&#146;s investigation is not to apportion blame, but to
ascertain fact. Any inquest forming part of an investigation is
inquisitorial and collaborative; it does not seek to apportion blame or
to establish legal
liability.</div><a name="09021114000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000395"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Clause 10 puts in place yet another restriction
on what the coroner or jury can say. Clause 10(2) states
that whatever is said
cannot</div><a name="09021114000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be
framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question
of...criminal...or...civil
liability.&#148;</div><a name="09021114000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause seems to be restrictive, rather than
expansive.</div><a name="09021114000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000396"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I just said that the purpose of a
coroner&#146;s investigation is not to establish criminal liability,
but fact, so I do not think that I am being
inconsistent.</div><a name="09021114000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
39 relates to article 2 of the European convention on human rights and
the Human Rights Act 1998. The hon. Member for Cambridge is right that
there was a misunderstanding among some coroners giving evidence to the
Committee. Subsection (2) provides the necessary flexibility to take
into account future judgments changing or extending the circumstances
in which convention rights apply. Coroners are already being trained in
the application of the convention and being kept up to date with case
law and so on. Also, regulations will be made dealing with training,
which we can discuss under clause
28.</div><a name="09021114000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000397"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> To state the obvious, has the Minister not
noticed that the fact that the senior coroner giving evidence to this
Committee, who presumably is as skilled as, if not more skilled than,
many of his colleagues, has difficulties interpreting the clause
suggests that more attention needs to be paid to training and
information than has hitherto been the
case?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div><a name="09021114000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="09021114000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000398"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments.
Perhaps some revision and homework may need to be done in order to
ensure that coroners fully understand what article 2 and the convention
are
about.</div><a name="09021114000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
their very nature, article 2 inquests probably need to be more
wide-ranging than ordinary inquests. There are between 200 and 300
inquests that involve article 2, which is about 1 per cent. of all
inquests that are heard each year. Such inquests are expected to
address matters relating to the broad circumstances surrounding the
death, rather than merely the &#147;who, where, when and how&#148;
that would be required in the course of a normal inquest. If we were to
remove clause 5(2), that would leave the Bill lacking in clarity as to
what is required in article 2 inquests over and above what is normally
required. Also, by removing clause 5(2), we would be ignoring existing
case law. I hope that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk withdraws
that particular
amendment.</div><a name="09021114000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
70 would remove from the face of the Bill the obligation not to express
an opinion with respect to the matters to be ascertained under
subsections (1) and (2). That obligation is there because those matters
are matters of fact. There should be no room for additional opinion in
determining those matters. Additionally, coroners should probably not
be giving press conferences to discuss individual cases. They may, of
course, talk about policy in general, but it is usually bad practice to
be having press conferences about individual cases, regardless of the
circumstances of those
cases.</div><a name="09021114000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(3) contains the proviso that it is</div>
<a name="09021114000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to
paragraph 6 of Schedule 4.&#148;</div>
<a name="09021114000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means that
coroners can make reports regarding the action to be taken to prevent
future deaths, which is similar to reports that are currently under
rule 43. That gives the coroner sufficient scope to make detailed
reports on things that they think should be brought to the attention of
those who have the power to take action to prevent further
deaths.</div><a name="09021114000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also scope within the associated rules under clause 34 for narrative
verdicts, for which the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central made an
eloquent plea. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend gave an
equally eloquent response on why such verdicts might not be
particularly helpful to bereaved families. Given that the central aim
that we are looking to achieve here is to make sure that the grieved
families get the best possible service, it is a difficult area, because
in some instances a narrative verdict can cause further distress.
However, I accept that phrases such as &#147;death by
misadventure&#148; do not really tell anyone very much about exactly
what happened. Therefore, we have to give coroners some flexibility to
express exactly what happened in a more rounded fashion than short
versions such as &#147;death by misadventure&#148; or even
&#147;death by
suicide&#148;.</div><a name="09021114000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
surprisingly, amendments 112 to 114 take the coroner further down the
road of expressing an opinion, possibly even attributing blame and
assigning civil or criminal liability. That is not the purpose of a
coronial
investigation.</div><a name="09021114000230"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000399"></a>Jenny
Willott:</b> Does the Minister accept that the amendments
would not do that, because such matters would still be subject to
clause 10? Clause 10(2) makes it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>clear that the coroner cannot determine criminal or civil liability.
Therefore the coroner or the jury will be able to provide more detail,
but not to accord
blame.</div><a name="09021114000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000400"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Amendments 112 to 114 would tempt a coroner down
that route. That is a problem with those amendments. However, a coroner
can properly give their views in any report to prevent further deaths,
which is an important part of what they do. That point is covered in
paragraph 6 of schedule 4. The changes made last year under rule 43
gave coroners much wider discretion to make whatever comments they
think are necessary to ensure that improvements are made as a result of
their
investigations.</div><a name="09021114000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
35 would introduce a duty to report to the relevant person, whereas it
is currently discretionary. I see some merit in that point and will
reflect on it. Amendment 48 would give the coroner the power to request
that the relevant person submit an update on their actions within three
months. It would also introduce a duty on the coroner to forward all
updates to the chief coroner at the end of each year, who would lay
them before Parliament. There is merit in that, and I will reflect
further on it.</div>
<a name="09021114000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
point applies to amendments 121 and 122 and the last part of amendment
93, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford. The
public expression of coroners&#146; findings is important in ensuring
that deaths do not occur as a result of nobody taking cognisance of
what a coroner has found. Those amendments would strengthen the
obligations on coroners and on the relevant persons to prevent future
deaths.</div><a name="09021114000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will give an example of something that happened under rule 43 and the
current discretionary system. A coroner issued a rule 43 report into a
death from injuries incurred on a railway line. He asked for a response
to ensure that the issues found in the investigation did not recur.
British Transport police responded and outlined the action that it had
taken in relation to the circumstances of the case. It also listed a
further six actions that it had taken over an 18-month period to
improve its investigations of deaths on railways. It was keen to keep
in touch with coroners to improve investigative processes. Even under
the rule 43 system, we are seeing improvements in how people respond to
causes of death reported by
coroners.</div><a name="09021114000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the reasoning behind the amendments that I have mentioned.
They would not only ensure that coroners and organisations take
seriously the responsibility of preventing further deaths, but would
give the public confidence that that is the case. In this area, as in
many others, people express the view that the hon. Member for Daventry
gave: they understand that they cannot bring their own loved one back,
but they do not want to see the same thing happen to someone else. If
they can see that the response is taken seriously, it helps them to
obtain closure and get through the bereavement
process.</div><a name="09021114000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will reflect further on the amendments that I have outlined, including
the last part of amendment 93 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford. I cannot commend the idea of the criminal sanction at this
stage. I am not yet convinced that even the threat of a level 5 fine
would be a sufficient deterrent. However, the indication

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000401"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> After listening to the debate, does my hon. Friend
like the idea that the coroner could summon someone to court, if they
did not answer the
report?</div><a name="09021114000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000402"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Yes, I do, but I am not sure whether it can be
put into the Bill and will have to consider the matter. Coroners need
to be given all possible tools to ensure that their investigations are
thorough and can reach a proper conclusion. That is something that we
might consider further. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk to withdraw the amendment and the hon. Members for
Cardiff, Central and for Cambridge to decide which ones they wish to
vote
on.</div><a name="09021114000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09021114000403"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am mindful of the time. I am grateful to the
Minister for her explanation of the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998.
Obviously, the Opposition will have to return to Andr(c) Rebello
and take further advice on that. In the meantime, I am happy to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09021114000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am delighted by what the Minister said about amendments 35 and 48. We
are certainly not trying to pretend that amendment 48 is absolutely the
best way to achieve those ends. If she can pick out the best of the
Liberal Democrats&#146; amendment 121 and of amendment 93,
tabled by the hon. Member for Stafford, the Committee will achieve
exactly what it wants to achieve, which is to ensure that lessons are
learned. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09021114000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
