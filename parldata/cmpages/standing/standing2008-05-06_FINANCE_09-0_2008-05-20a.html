							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Hood. It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship this morning. Last Wednesday, the
Treasury kindly sent members of the Committee explanatory notes on
several schedules to which amendments have been proposed. In the main,
it is easy to compare the explanatory notes with the amendments
as tabled. However, it is not possible to link to the explanatory notes
several amendments that have been tabled to schedule 17, which we might
debate this afternoon. Can the Treasury supply members of the Committee
with information that cross-references the explanatory notes and the
amendments, so that those who wish to participate in the debate on life
assurance taxation can do
so?</div>
					<a name="08052044000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000372"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. That is not a point
of order, although I am sure that the Minister heard what he said and
may well
respond.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000373"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> The clause increases the limit for enterprise
investment schemes from &#163;400,000 to &#163;500,000. It is one
of a series of changes that have been made since the scheme was
introduced in 1993. The limit was increased to &#163;150,000 in April
1998, to &#163;200,000 in April 2004, and to &#163;400,000 in April
2006. Can the Minister advise the Committee why the Treasury increased
the limit to &#163;500,000, not to any other amount? The scheme is
covered by European Union state aid rules and the clause makes it
clear that the increase is subject to approval by the EU. When
will clearance be given, and has it been applied for to date? What is
the reason for the delay between clearance being applied for and its
being granted? There is some ambiguity about the meaning of paragraph
10 of the explanatory notes, which
states:</div>
					<a name="08052044000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
EIS has been notified to the European Commission as a State aid, but
not yet approved.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>
					<a name="08052044000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that mean that the increase to
&#163;500,000 has yet to be approved or that the scheme itself has
yet to be approved? It is important for the Committee to know that.
Have the Government commissioned research on the effectiveness of the
relief in stimulating investment in high-risk
businesses?</div>
					<a name="08052044000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000374"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):
						</b> As for
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point of order, we will certainly see if we
can do anything in advance to assist the Committee&#146;s
proceedings. I am not sure when we are due to discuss schedule 17, but
if we can make the explanatory notes more clear, we will do
so.</div>
					<a name="08052044000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may help
the Committee if I set out some background to the clause. The
Government are committed to encouraging entrepreneurship, innovation
and growth among smaller, higher-risk enterprises and to improving the
United Kingdom as a place for businesses to start up, invest and
expand. Venture capital schemes, including the enterprise investment
scheme are important tools. They contribute to the Government&#146;s
wider policy of improving access to finance for small companies and
tackling the so-called equity gap suffered by smaller companies
struggling to obtain the finance that they need to grow into
sustainable, profitable enterprises. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer
said in his Budget speech, we need to do more to help small and
medium-sized enterprises gain access to finance.</div>
					<a name="08052044000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in mind, as the hon.
Member for Fareham rightly pointed out, the clause increases the annual
amount of investment on which income tax relief is available under the
enterprise investment scheme from &#163;400,000 to &#163;500,000.
As he suspected, that increase is subject to state aid approval and
will apply only from 2008-09, once it has been brought into effect by
Treasury order. To date, the enterprise investment scheme has helped to
raise around &#163;6.1 billion, invested in 14,000 small or high-risk
companies. The increase in the annual investor limit is
intended to stimulate further investment in such companies by offering
a greater incentive to business angels and other individuals,
particularly in the light of current financial market disruption. I
might point out that the increase has been well received by industry.
For example, the CBI confirmed that it
welcomed</div>
					<a name="08052044000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the uplift in
thresholds for the enterprise investment scheme which should encourage
more investment in growth
companies.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052044000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked if the scheme has been notified to the European
Commission. I can confirm that it has, but it has not yet been
approved. The change described here must also be approved before it can
come into effect. When that happens, the proposal is to make it
effective from 6 April 2008 by means of a Treasury order. The scheme
and the increase have both been notified, and approval is awaited for
the combined
package.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000377"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> This group of amendments probes schedule 11, which
amends the rules for the schemes and carves out the three areas of
shipbuilding, coal and steel. The explanatory notes to the schedule
indicate that the carve-outs have been prompted by EU state aid rules,
which specify the circumstances in which aid can be given to those
industries. Schedule 11 cites three documents to justify that position:
for shipbuilding, the framework published in the <i class="I">Official Journal of
the European Union</i> on 30 December 2003; for steel, the guidelines
published on 4 March 2006; and for coal, article 2 of &#147;Council
Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002&#148;, which was published on 23 July
2002. One question that immediately springs to mind is why the
Government have taken so long to implement the regulations, since they
have been part of EU rules for between two and six years.</div>
					<a name="08052044000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly want to discuss
the amendments on the coal industry, which would remove the coal
industry from the excluded activities in schedule 11. When I looked at
the Council regulation, it appeared that it would still be permissible
for aid to be given to the coal industry through venture capital
schemes. For example, article 5 of the regulation deals with aid for
accessing coal reserves, whereby aid for initial investment can be paid
until 31 December 2010. It appears that under EU rules a VCT could
invest in a company seeking to open up new coal reserves or exploit
existing reserves until the end of 2010. However, the Government,
through the changes in the schedule, seek to prevent that. When energy
security is an issue&#151;that is referred to in the
regulation&#151;we should be considering how best to exploit our
domestic reserves. Some hon. Members will doubtless think about the
environmental impact of mining more coal, but we currently have
coal-fired power stations. Several people are looking to build new
stations using clean coal technology. If nothing else, it could be
argued that we should mine more coal. Why has coal been excluded from
schedule 11 when, according to the Council regulation, coal mining
could qualify for aid and it might be possible to encourage VCT schemes
to invest in exploiting new or existing reserves of
coal?</div>
					<a name="08052044000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000378"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> The amendment probes the schedule&#146;s
exclusion of shipbuilding and coal and steel
production. As is clearly set out in the text of the Budget, that is
necessary to meet European state aid regulations so that we can get
approval for the three venture capital schemes and enterprise
management incentives. We  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 282</div>will thereby be able to continue to enable smaller, higher-risk UK
companies to receive vital funding across the full range of industry.
They will be able to use the investment management incentives to help
recruit and retain staff. The Committee will no doubt remember that
last year&#146;s changes to the venture capital scheme were
introduced for the same reason. The state aid and notification process
is ongoing and, I hasten to add, it is going well. However, it
became clear in the course of our negotiations that the additional
exclusion in the schedule was necessary to demonstrate the
scheme&#146;s compliance with state aid for risk capital guidelines
and for
EMI.</div>
					<a name="08052044000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that, in practice, the exclusion of shipbuilding and coal and
steel will have a minimal material impact. Analysis shows that fewer
than 10 companies in all three sectors have used the venture capital
scheme for the last 14 years, and no coal production companies have
ever used the enterprise management incentives scheme. To date, about
&#163;1 million has been invested in companies in these sectors
across the enterprise investment scheme, venture capital trusts and the
corporate venturing scheme. To put it in context, that represents 0.01
per cent. of the funds raised under the tax-based venture capital
schemes. Despite evidence of what happens in practice, we were obliged
to put this matter on a legal footing by explicitly excluding those
trades, and that is the purpose of the schedule. It is important to
remember that state aid controls mean that British companies can
compete fairly because their European competitors are being prevented
from receiving unfair subsidies as well. There is a prize to be gained
by successfully achieving state aid notification and approval for our
schemes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000379"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Does the Exchequer Secretary recognise that the
rules set out in the EU Council regulation come into force on 31
December 2010? We seem to be having early adoption in the UK whereby in
other EU member states aid can be granted similar to that which is
prevented from being granted in the
UK.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000380"></a>Angela

context for these exclusions is small start-up

industries to gain
support.</div>

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The Exchequer Secretary argued
that the exclusion is necessary for EMI schemes and I do not doubt
that. She said that there is a requirement to put this on a legal
footing and I am sure that that is true. She is also right that there
are other schemes for start-up
companies.</div>
					<a name="08052044000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure whether it has happened yet, but there is a determination to use
carbon capture and storage with coal-fired power stations. There is a
possibility that low-sulphur coal mines will be reopened. There may be
new entrants to the market who wish to do that. Given that, and given
the possibility of future energy shortages, will it be possible to
revisit this issue if new entrants want to use CCS and low-sulphur coal
and reopen existing
fields?</div>

						</b> It is important to realise that there are other
opportunities for getting investment into those industries, and I do
not demur from the analysis of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div>hon. Member for Dundee, East regarding the potential
for innovation in clean coal technology. I would agree with that
analysis. We have to remember that the UK has the most efficient coal
industry in Europe, but until July 2002, European Union rules
prevented the Government from supporting viable investment
projects. Since its launch in 2003 under the regulations on state aid
to the coal industry, the coal investment aid scheme administered by
the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has made
awards of &#163;58.5 million. In 14 years, less than &#163;1
million has been invested using those schemes. The plain fact is that
companies that need state support for developing the worthy things that
we all wish to see with respect to clean coal technology, tend
to be larger and established. They are not small, innovative, start-up
businesses. In 14 years, before it became clear from our negotiations
with the EU that those industries had to be excluded from the state aid
schemes, partly because other EU state aid is available in those
sectors, almost none&#151;in fact, only 0.06 per cent.&#151;of the
money under these venture capital schemes had been used in the
sector.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Is the Exchequer
Secretary arguing that we cannot do this because of EU regulations, or
because of a decision by the Government, as it does not affect many
companies?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000384"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> I am arguing that it is because EU rules preclude
us from doing it. If the amendments were passed, it is clear from our
negotiations that we would fail to get state aid notification from the
EU, and we would lose all three schemes, with all their benefits. That
is absolutely clear. What I was hoping to do with the figures for those
three sectors over the past 14 years was to reassure hon. Members that
those exclusions will not produce a great effect. That overlap existed
prior to our negotiations on state aid rules. The European Commission
has made it absolutely clear that the coal industry must be excluded.
The amendments, if passed, would jeopardise all the schemes, which I am
sure is not the aim of the hon. Member for Fareham. He said at the
start that they were probing amendments, and I take him at his
word.</div>
					<a name="08052044000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000385"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> The Exchequer Secretary referred both in this
debate and the previous one to the negotiations with the European
Commission about the schemes. Is she saying that the only
barrier to the schemes obtaining formal notification from the
Commission is the exclusion of those three industries, or are there
other issues that have been debated? If there are other issues, would
she outline those to the
Committee?</div>
					<a name="08052044000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000386"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> That is not the only barrier, but it is an absolute
barrier. The Commission has made it clear that if we do not exclude
those three sectors no state aid notification will be granted for the
schemes, which would destroy them and produce the related negative
effects. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree with me that not
being able to run the schemes would have a negative effect on our
ability to support those companies that find themselves in what is
known as the equity gap&#151;in the middle of start-up and growth. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>There are other issues, some of which crop up in
subsequent clauses, so I do not want to go into great detail now. I can
assure the hon. Gentleman that the negotiations are ongoing. We are
confident that we will be able to get state aid, and we are working
through the issues as the European Commission raises
them.</div>
					<a name="08052044000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000387"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am grateful for that clarification, which
addresses some of the points that we will raise later. Would the
Exchequer Secretary explain what the consequences would be if we did
not receive approval for the schemes? Would the impact be
retrospective, for
example?</div>
					<a name="08052044000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000388"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> In theory, it could be retrospective to the
beginning of the schemes, and it could require us to chase
every grant that had ever been given to a company. I do not wish the
Government to find themselves in such circumstances and I hope that the
hon. Gentleman agrees.</div>
					<a name="08052044000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is in the interests of all
our start-up companies that we maintain the schemes and the benefits
that they convey. That is why we are working to avoid the worst-case
scenario. If the changes to the schemes are not introduced, we risk a
Commission investigation under article 88.2 of the EC treaty, which
could lead to our having to withdraw the scheme or the associated
tax reliefs and engage in what is known as aid
recovery&#151;reclaiming all the money, going all the way back. I
cannot think of anything that I would rather the Treasury did not have
to spend its time doing, which is why we are trying to be as helpful as
we can in the negotiations for state aid.</div>
					<a name="08052044000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the amendment is
a probing one, and that given the explanations that the hon. Member for
Fareham has received about why certain sectors have been excluded, as
well as their tiny presence over the years in this particular scheme,
he will be sufficiently reassured to withdraw
it.</div>
					<a name="08052044000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000389"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for responding in
such detail to the amendments, which are indeed probing amendments. She
has helpfully shone a light on the process that we have to go through
to get the schemes approved by the Commission. I hope&#151;and I am
sure that she will do so&#151;that she will take a robust approach
with the Commission. I share her view that it would be a dreadful waste
of time and resources to try to chase up all the companies to recover
the money, and it is important, therefore, that the schemes receive the
approval that they need from the Commission. For people investing in
those schemes, that process creates uncertainty in some respects,
because the goalposts keep shifting, almost from year to year. I do not
want to move on to the next group of amendments, but in previous years,
&#163;1 million was invested in schemes that are now excluded, and
there may be other changes, which creates uncertainty about
what is appropriate when managing the future development of a scheme.
In light of the explanation that the Committee has received from the
Minister, I would not wish to impede the approval of these schemes by
the Commission, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

							<a name="08052044000393"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I think that the debate on this group of
amendments will proceed along similar lines to the previous
debate. The rules affecting enterprise management incentive schemes are
being amended through clause 30 with the introduction of a new test for
qualification&#151;an employee number test. That test will join a
series of other tests set out in part 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and
Pensions) Act 2003, which deals with issues such as independence,
having only qualifying subsidiaries, a gross assets test, and ensuring
that businesses do not engage in excluded activities, which are listed
in that provision. They are principally activities involving investment
in significant property assets and real assets, whether intangible or
tangible; financial services; and facilities management. I suspect that
at the end of our proceedings coal, ship-building and steel will also
be excluded. The amendments to clause 30 will introduce a further test
to enable companies to qualify, requiring them to employ fewer than 250
full-time equivalent employees.</div>
					<a name="08052044000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has set out the
process that led to the introduction of that requirement, but it would
be helpful for the Committee to understand why the magic number is 250
and not a lower or higher number. Unlike amendments in the previous
group, there is no cross-reference to the relevant Council regulation
or document to support that 250 cut-off. It would therefore be helpful
if the Minister would explain where that requirement came
from.</div>
					<a name="08052044000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple of
points of detail have emerged from representations that have been made
to members of the Committee on clause 30. The Institute of Chartered
Accountants has suggested that there should be guidance on who would
need to work full-time and part-time so that businesses, when
calculating full-time equivalents have some understanding of what rules
should apply. Does that mean a 40-hour week or a 35-hour week, and does
it mean that someone who works 20 hours a week is working half a week
or two thirds of a week? Some indication from Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs on that issue would be
helpful.</div>
					<a name="08052044000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ICA has
also suggested that, for completeness, those on adoption leave should
be discounted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>alongside those on paternity and maternity leave when calculating the
250 figure. Because of the difficulty in calculating the number of
full-time equivalents, it has asked whether HMRC will disregard minor
breaches where it is evident that the company has taken reasonable
steps to comply with the new
requirements.</div>

							<a name="08052044000394"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> To put the discussion in context, the enterprise
management incentives are intended to help smaller, higher-risk
companies recruit and retain staff by allowing them to issue share
options with tax advantages to employees. Provided that the conditions
of the legislation are met, any gains from EMI share options are free
from income tax and national insurance contributions, and that is the
context of this debate. The hon. Gentleman asked a couple of
questions about the changes set out in clause 30. He was right to point
out that we have introduced a limit of 250 employees as a definition
for those companies that will be eligible for the scheme. He asked why
the figure is 250. It comes from the requirement that the Commission
has laid down, because it is within the European Union&#146;s
definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise. As part of our
ongoing discussions for state aid approval, that is what the Commission
has suggested we base the figure on.</div>
					<a name="08052044000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The national employers skills
survey consistently finds that skills shortages in the labour market
are most severe among companies with fewer than 250 employees,
so there is an evidence base there. There is also the potential for
market failure, with regard to the ability of companies of that size to
attract appropriate staff to help them grow and expand, and that adds
to the evidence base for the 250 figure. We have no other evidence to
present to the Commission in favour of a different limit, which is why
we have settled on the limit that it suggested. It has always been our
intention, since the introduction of EMI, to target small and
medium-sized enterprises. To that extent, I hope that I have given the
hon. Gentleman the justification for what might have seemed, initially
at least, to be an arbitrary figure. It is actually based on EU
definitions and our own evidence base of skills
shortages.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000395"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Would the Minister give us an indication of the
points on which we won the argument with the European Commission? We
have identified those issues where we have completely lost the
argument, and I do not doubt the basis for that: 250 employees is seen
as a limit for small and medium-sized
enterprises.</div>

ensure that we can get state aid approval for pre-existing schemes so
that they do not have to end.</div>

Hosie:
						</b> I think the 250-employee limit is very sensible,
not least because it covers 277,000 of Scotland&#146;s 279,500
businesses. However, there are other rules, including the one on
&#163;30 million of gross assets. Every European economy is
different, so I wonder whether there is a breakdown of the proportion
of businesses that might be eligible, country by country and nation by
nation within the UK. The breakdown of SMEs in England is rather
different from the composition in Scotland, where there is a small
number of very large companies and a large number of very small
companies. Do we have a comparative analysis, country by country, as
that would be very
helpful?</div>
					<a name="08052044000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000400"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> I am not sure that I have one to hand, but I take
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. These incentives are aimed at small
and medium-sized enterprises, which comprise the bulk of businesses in
the UK. There are other EU state aid arrangements for large global
companies which would not become involved in this kind of very
specific scheme. The aim of the scheme is to fill what is known as the
equity gap, and to help small and medium-sized developing companies
with high growth potential to attract employees, who will help them
make that next step, and therefore convey the benefits of that
innovative, high-growth sector to our economy. The hon. Member for
Dundee, East is right: other European economies can have very different
structures. The European Commission has to work within its own state
aid rules to accommodate those differences.</div>
					<a name="08052044000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have managed to
explain the point about the 250 employees for the hon. Member for
Fareham. He asked how that would work as a definition, which is clearly
important for companies that are close to that limit. Guidance will be
produced shortly after Royal Assent. Guidance on similar points is
already available in the venture capital manual. HMRC is happy to
discuss any difficult cases or any cases where there may be some
confusion among companies which qualify now, but think they might be
quite close to the edge of not
qualifying.</div>
					<a name="08052044000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
point about adoption, we have to follow EU guidelines, which do not
currently include adoption leave. The UK is ahead of much of the rest
of the EU in recognising adoption and parental leave. Some EU countries
do it, but the vast majority do not. Again, HMRC is happy to discuss
cases where this may be an issue. I hope that those answers satisfy the
hon. Gentleman and that he is happy to accept the contents of the
clause. Let me again reassure him that 6 per cent. of those currently
receiving assistance will be excluded from the 250 limit. That is 400
out of the 7,000 or so companies that are currently
benefiting.</div>

advantages that they have to date, but they will not be able to access
any more. That is how the change will work. With that reassurance, I

that those listening to the Committee&#146;s proceedings will be
interested to know that guidance is to be published on what
&#147;full-time&#148; and &#147;part-time&#148; mean. Given

					<a name="08052044000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to pick up the comment
made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I wonder whether we have
really analysed the interaction between the different limits and to
what extent the gross asset test rules companies in and out. Is the
interaction in danger of reducing significantly the pool of companies
that can take advantage of the schemes, to the detriment of encouraging
entrepreneurial activity in the UK? I leave that thought with the
Minister, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.</div>

end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5A) The
amendments made by subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall not
come into force until the Treasury has laid before the House of Commons
a report which sets out how companies deemed to be in a group because
they are owned by a private equity and venture capital firms can become
qualifying companies under paragraph 8 of Part 3 of Schedule 5 to the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act
2003.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08052044000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment that I want to explore with the Minister because
it deals with an important group of companies that cannot take
advantage of EMI and other schemes. They are small or medium-sized
companies that work, in many cases, in high-risk sectors of the
economy, have the same recruitment issues that the Minister outlined in
relation to the previous amendment, and are owned or invested in by
venture capital and private equity companies. The qualifying conditions
for these schemes mean that firms owned by venture capital companies
cannot take advantage of them because they will aggregate
employee numbers, or the gross assets of companies owned by a single
venture capital business or by a partnership that has invested in them,
and potentially catch companies out through the independence rules. I
recognise the importance of rules about independence and the
aggregation of employee numbers and gross assets. They prevent large
trading groups from circumventing the rules to qualify for those
reliefs by trying to fragment their activities over a number of
companies. One would not expect companies that private equity or
venture capital have invested in, such as Boots or BAA, to be able to
fragment their activities and qualify for these schemes. In the same
way, one would not expect large companies not owned by venture
capital to be able to take advantage of the same schemes. Many venture
capital funds invest in start-ups, as well as small and medium-sized
companies, but they sometimes lose out and cannot offer their
employees EMI schemes. Nor do venture capital funds qualify for the
research and development tax credits for small
companies.</div>
					<a name="08052044000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have rightly stressed that there should be a level playing
field so that companies owned by venture capital companies do not have
any unfair advantage compared with those owned in other ways. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>That principle was established clearly and beyond
any doubt in last year&#146;s debate about the private equity sector.
In this situation, small and medium-sized companies are unfairly
disadvantaged compared with their peers that are not owned by venture
capital partnerships. The British Private Equity and Venture Capital
Association has been in discussion with the Treasury about this matter
for some time, and I know that the issue exercises its members. I
should be grateful for an explanation of how the Government can tackle
it. How can we use the existing definitions of venture capital schemes
in other legislation to create a framework to ensure that small and
medium-sized companies operating in high-risk markets all receive the
same advantages and can all participate in EMI schemes regardless of
whether they are owned by venture capital
businesses?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000405"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> Will the Minister turn her attention to what
happens when a company goes into administration? Could part of it be
saved by being purchased by a venture capital firm? It could be run as
a stand-alone company, but the new-purchase part that comes out of
administration could not benefit from EMI schemes. Such schemes could
be the sort of incentive needed to keep the best staff and stop them
drifting off.</div>
					<a name="08052044000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
cite the real example of an engineering company that had lost a major
contract and gone into administration. A venture capital outfit said
that its core business was extremely successful. The company was small,
with 85 highly skilled people, but because the venture capital firm had
bought and developed two or three other companies over time, it did not
need these rules. In those circumstances, we would still have, in
effect, a stand-alone company that did not fit in with other parts of
the business but needed time to grow and re-establish itself to win
back some of the business that it lost. Is there sufficient flexibility
to allow at least that part of the business to benefit from the EMI
schemes? I ask that not because it would benefit that particular
company or similar companies, but because it might be an added
incentive for venture capital firms to see the opportunity to buy out
something to protect it or to increase its growth in a way that was
less marginal or more attractive if EMI schemes were available for the
part of the business that was purchased. Will the Minister consider
that
example?</div>

Eagle:
						</b> The hon. Member for Fareham was right to be wary
and warn the Committee of the dangers of fragmentation and tax
avoidance in the control arrangements. He rightly pointed to the nub of
the issue. Clearly, there is a balance between making the schemes
available in the widest possible way and not opening up loopholes that
would be exploited by those who would fragment for tax avoidance
purposes. </div>
					<a name="08052044000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
enterprise management incentive scheme was introduced in 2000 to allow
smaller, high-risk companies to grant share options with tax advantages
to their employees. They have been a success, with more than 7,000
companies granting options to more than 100,000 employees by 2006. The
scheme is aimed at smaller, independent companies that are less likely
to have access to the finance needed to attract highly-skilled
employees, and that is where we intend these schemes to assist. We need
to keep that in mind when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>we are thinking about venture capital companies or, indeed, private
equity. The provision has a control requirement so that EMI is
available only to companies that are genuinely small and independent.
As the hon. Member for Fareham said, that has a valuable role in
preventing tax avoidance. I am not suggesting that private equity
engages routinely in tax avoidance or any such thing, and I would not
like anyone to think that I was, but unfortunately the tax avoidance
industry will take advantage of any opportunities to exploit
incentives. The balance to which the hon. Gentleman alluded is
therefore important. Private equity-backed companies are more likely to
have the financial resources to offer competitive remuneration packages
to the employees they need in the companies they acquire. It is not
obvious that the scheme should be routinely available to private
equity. However, I am happy to say that we are in discussions
with representative bodies in the area to see how to address their
perceived worry about not having access to such schemes without
creating avoidance opportunities&#151;that is the key point&#151;or
opening up the incentive any wider than its deep and successful focus
since its introduction in
2000.</div>

essence, amendment No. 96 would drop the amendments made to clause
30(2) and (3) until a Treasury report was laid before the House of
Commons. That proposal is not sensible; again, it brings us back to our
negotiations on state aid. Our amendments are necessary to secure state
aid clearance of the EMI scheme. The Government are seeking to ensure
certainty for companies by securing approval for the enterprise
management incentive scheme. All member states have to be compliant
with state aid guidelines. Non-compliance would risk the worst-case
scenario talked about under earlier clauses. We are in discussions
about this. We have to balance other methods of financing companies,
particularly through venture capital or private equity, against the
creation of avoidance opportunities. We believe that the focus
of the scheme has been correct to date. With those explanations, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

Hoban:
						</b> The Minister is correct about the
importance of striking the right balance between creating incentives
for legitimate activity and encouraging tax avoidance. That underpins
much of part 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.
However, we must be careful not to get sucked into too rosy a view of
private equity and venture capital. Before coming to the House, I had
experience of working with people who have been backed by private
equity and venture capital companies. They would not have argued that
they were well rewarded by their backers. The money invested is capital
for them to expand the business, not to pay the management fancy
salaries, particularly at the smaller, higher-risk end. Boots and the
Automobile Association are very different from the companies able to
qualify under the tests, which have gross assets of less
than &#163;30 million and fewer than 250 employees. In such
companies, many are paid low&#151;if any&#151;wages because their
venture capital backers want to see them invest in growing the
business, not in fancy cars and flash offices. We should not fall into
the trap of thinking that their life is easy or that the money from the
backers is on tap.</div>

find a way to incorporate other forms of support without creating those
potentials for tax avoidance and while keeping the scheme focused, then
we will certainly do that, and we are in discussions to see how we can.

companies might not suffer the same recruitment problems as those not
backed by VC funds because they could afford to pay better salaries. In
my experience, that is not the case&#151;they suffer from the same
recruitment issues as other high-risk ventures. Money is not there on
demand from the backers to fund the businesses. Where additional
investment is made at a later stage, a price is extracted for such
investment. These ventures are as high-risk and have the same
recruitment challenges as any small or medium-sized companies&#151;it
is an equally challenging environment. I welcome the Exchequer
Secretary&#146;s assurances that discussions are taking place with
representative bodies to see whether the rules can be modified to
enable these companies to benefit from this and from other incentives
from which they are currently
excluded.</div>

she should use her best endeavours to reach a situation that would
encourage more entrepreneurial activity in the UK and expand
the incentives to private equity-backed companies. In these economic

Ussher:
						</b> As this is the first time that I have taken the
floor this morning, it may be appropriate for me to respond to the
point of order raised by the hon. Member for Fareham at the start of
the sitting, if that would be in order, Mr. Hood. He rightly
pointed out that the numbers of the amendments to schedule 17 used in
the explanatory notes were different from those on the amendment paper.
I am grateful to him for pointing that out. I am advised that a
complete set of explanatory notes for all the Government amendments to
schedule 17 is on its way to the room forthwith. Since we are a little
time away from discussing schedule 17, I trust that that will be
sufficient for the hon. Gentleman. I assure him that there was no
intention to mystify any further what is a rather technical
schedule.</div>
					<a name="08052044000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of
background to Government amendments Nos. 123, 124 and 125, I should
explain that schedule 12 will introduce changes to the system of taxing
individuals who receive dividend income from shareholdings in foreign
companies. The changes have effect for the tax year 2008-09 and
subsequent
years.</div>
					<a name="08052044000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the Bill
was published, it has become clear that some collective investment
schemes are seeking to exploit the extension of the non-payable
dividend tax credit by locating their cash or bond fund ranges
offshore, primarily to secure tax advantages for their UK investors.
That behaviour could carry a significant Exchequer cost and was not the
intention behind our policy. In order to prevent that tax
leakage, the Government amendments will exclude distributions from all
offshore funds from the extension of the non-payable dividend tax
credit. An offshore fund is already defined in legislation. The
amendments mean that the position for UK investors in offshore
collective investment schemes will remain exactly as it was before 6
April
2008.</div>

							<a name="08052044000415"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> It is a pleasure, Mr. Hood, to serve
under your chairmanship for the first time on this Bill. The Minister
has made the case for closing a gap that has opened up. We do not
dissent from her view, but there is a concern here. The Minister
indicated that some funds had already moved location to exploit what
would have become a loophole. Clearly, their
premature action has allowed the Government to intervene and amend the
Bill during its passage through Parliament to close a
loophole.</div>
					<a name="08052044000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is rather
disconcerting that, with the vast resources that the
Government have available, an avoidance opportunity of this nature was
not spotted when the schedule was drafted. The Minister told us that
substantial amounts of Exchequer revenue could be at stake. Presumably,
if those seeking to exploit this loophole had been able to contain
themselves for just another two months and not shown their hand until
after the Bill had received its Third Reading, the Exchequer would
indeed have suffered that loss of revenue as those avoidance
opportunities were exploited and presumably then reversed in next
year&#146;s Finance
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08052044000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
tell us, because it is not always clear how this works in government,
what lessons the Government have learnt from this and what analysis of
this problem has taken place within the Treasury? How 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>are the Government moving to ensure that other such loopholes are not
being opened up unintentionally in areas where the potential exploiters
will not be so accommodating as to show their hand at a time when the
Government are still in a position to deal with
it?</div>

							<a name="08052044000416"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
question, which is very prescient. The answer is simple: we are in
continuous dialogue with the various parts of the asset management
industry. It is precisely because of that relationship of trust and
close dialogue that they alerted us to the fact that this was taking
place. Obviously, we have our own experts and lawyers and we seek to
consult as widely as possible and as much as possible. We will always
take prompt action where
required.</div>

loophole had not been spotted? If the Bill had been passed into law
without the amendment, and the loophole had then been exploited, would
HMRC or the Government have any tools available to deal with it in the
interim, or would it have had to be reversed in the next Finance
Bill?</div>

situation because we have spotted it and so there will be no loss to
the Exchequer. It is always possible in Finance Bills to legislate
retrospectively. So, hypothetically, we would have made it entirely
clear that this was not the intention and would have sought to remedy
it at the earliest opportunity. The point is absolutely clear. In
response to industry concerns, we are using the opportunity to do the
right thing. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support in

							<a name="08052044000421"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> Section 31, which this schedule introduces, seeks
to create a level playing field for the receipt by UK residents of
dividends from foreign companies. That has become pressing, not because
people in the UK are rushing out and investing in foreign companies
more than they were, but because some companies have become foreign
companies as a result of flight from the UK. Perhaps it is not always
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>a result of that, but it is a concern. It is also because of
acquisitions such as that of Abbey by Banco
Santander, and because of the re-domiciling of Shell. Many people who
thought that they held solid old-fashioned British company stocks now
hold shares in a foreign company. The measure is generally welcomed, in
that it provides some clarity.</div>
					<a name="08052044000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope, Mr. Hood,
that if I stick narrowly to the amendments, we can have a brief clause
stand part debate, and raise some slightly more general points about
how the measure has been introduced and the next steps that the
Government intend to
take.</div>
					<a name="08052044000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div>
					<a name="08052044000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
71 and 72 to 74 are an unashamed attempt to embarrass the Government
over their failure to use plain language. I accept that a Bill or any
legal document contains definitions, and one can define things to mean
what one wants them to mean. It would be perfectly possible for the
Government to put into schedule 12 &#147;black means of the colour
white&#148;. If that was what the definition said, everywhere that
the word &#147;black&#148; was used in the schedule we would
understand it to mean &#147;white&#148;. However, I have to suggest
to the Economic Secretary that, with all the rhetoric about making
legislation&#151;especially tax legislation&#151;simpler, it would
not be a bad principle to try to stick to using words in their plain
meaning, and where the plain meaning of a word is clearly one thing, to
avoid using that word to mean something
else.</div>
					<a name="08052044000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
word &#147;minority&#148; to me has a plain meaning. It means
&#147;less than a majority&#148;. It has a meaning in relation to
shareholdings. The term &#147;minority shareholding&#148; is well
understood. It therefore struck me as unsatisfactory to have the term
&#147;minority shareholding&#148; defined as a shareholding of less
than 10 per cent. That seems to be an arbitrary definition. Twelve per
cent. is apparently not a minority shareholding. By extrapolation, I
assume that the Economic Secretary would wish us to regard anything
less than 90 per cent. as not being a majority shareholding. A holding
of 89 per cent. in a company would not give you a majority, if 11 per
cent. was not a
minority.</div>
					<a name="08052044000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
suggestion to the Government to avoid that nonsense is to use
&#147;minority&#148; where it has its plain meaning and, where the
meaning that the Government wish to import is not
that which is normally understood, to use something different. I have
suggested the novel approach of calling a 10 per cent. shareholding a
small shareholding&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> Well, my
hon. Friend the Member for Weston-Super-Mare thinks that that might
raise some issues, but my underlying point is serious, and I shall be
interested to hear the Economic Secretary&#146;s comments about that
use of language, and whether she agrees with me that it is
confusing.</div>
					<a name="08052044000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
substantively, the underlying provision in the schedule is a result of
a European Court decision&#151;Manninen in 2002. The Government plan
to introduce further measures in next year&#146;s Finance Bill to
extend the tax treatment&#151;possibly with
restrictions&#151;to holders of what according to the
Government&#146;s definition is a majority shareholding in a company,
namely, anything over 10 per cent. It will be interesting if the
Economic Secretary can explain why there is a need for a two-stage
process and why it is not appropriate to address the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>issues facing the holders of larger shareholdings at this
time. What does she think the consequences of that
would be? It will also be interesting to hear the Economic
Secretary&#146;s view on the implications of the Lasertec
judgment&#151;another ECJ judgment in 2004&#151;which I believe
suggests that the limit, if there is to be one, should be much higher
than 10 per cent. and could be as high as 25 per cent.</div>
					<a name="08052044000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we are on the subject, I
understand that HMRC is currently resisting claims for relief based on
the Manninen decision&#151;ahead of the schedule being
enacted&#151;and is seeking to distinguish the details of individual
cases of claims brought by taxpayers from the precedent that Manninen
sets. It is the view of the Law Society among others that in most, if
not all, of those cases, the distinction that HMRC seeks to make is not
justified. HMRC&#146;s fear of the Manninen judgment appears to be
the lack of a time limit on its application; I suppose that it is
concerned that there could be back claims going back many years,
perhaps running to tens of millions of pounds. Other European Court
decisions in relation to tax, particularly value added tax, have opened
up just that scenario.</div>
					<a name="08052044000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Economic Secretary
explain to the Committee the retrospective effect of the provisions in
the schedule? Will they apply only to new dividend distributions, or
will they apply retrospectively to distributions received in previous
years? If the provisions are extended in the 2009 Finance Bill to apply
a similar treatment to larger shareholdings, is it
the Government&#146;s intention that that will be
retrospective, at least to this year, or will the holders of larger
shareholdings be disadvantaged in comparison to smaller
shareholders?</div>
					<a name="08052044000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that there are two simple choices: either the Government can
accept the logic of the Manninen judgment and use domestic legislation
to regularise the position and deal with retrospective claims resulting
from Manninen, or they can turn their back on the ECJ decision,
legislate for the future only and require all those with historic
claims to trudge through the courts in a process that is expensive and
tedious for all concerned. It strikes me that the Government are not
afraid to use retrospection&#151;I had written that note before I
heard the Economic Secretary not five minutes ago telling us that she
would use retrospection if necessary to deal with any loopholes that
appeared as a result of poor-quality drafting in the Bill. If
retrospection is sauce for the Government goose, should it not also be
sauce for the taxpayers&#146; gander, in a case such as this? I look
forward to hearing what the Economic Secretary has to say about, in
particular, the position of taxpayers with historic claims as a result
of the Manninen judgment.</div>

they will not be pressed. There seems to have been some
misunderstanding on the part of Opposition Members, which I hope I can
clarify. On retrospection, I do not know whether the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge misunderstood or did not understand what I
said. In the hypothetical case to which he referred, I said that a very
strong statement would be made because we always could use
retrospection if required. That is different from landing an unexpected
tax bill, which we should always avoid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>unless it is necessary, so the hon. Gentleman is making mischief,

Manninen and Meilicke cases, but they are not driving the taxation
change in front of us. The Manninen case indicates that providing less
favourable treatment for foreign dividends infringes the principles of
freedom of establishment and free movement of capital, but the
UK position is different from the position in
Manninen.</div>
					<a name="08052044000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have many
double taxation agreements designed to relieve taxation of income in
more than one country. Manninen does not deal with foreign tax credit
relief available in respect of foreign dividends. The changes to the
tax treatment of foreign personal dividends that we are proposing from
6 April 2008&#151;I hope that this answers the question that
the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about when it comes
into effect&#151;have no effect on the past treatment of foreign
dividend income.</div>
					<a name="08052044000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Lasertec judgment, which indicates
that the relief should be up to 25 per cent. As I have stated on
several occasions, we believe that the 10 per cent. figure is the
generally accepted dividing line between small investments and those
where the shareholding is large enough for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>shareholder to be more closely involved with the
business and to influence company decision making. The Lasertec case
was about the freedom of establishment rules within the EC treaty and
the 25 per cent. figure referred to the degree of shareholding that
would confer determinative influence on the company&#146;s decisions
and activities. That is not the issue here because ECJ issues are not
driving the policy&#151;it is a simplification
measure.</div>

Ministers, they refer to EU decisions, to which they are perfectly

different view and our view will prevail&#148;. The Minister used the
term &#147;small shareholding&#148; in the last piece of brief that
she read out. She has not addressed the substance of the amendment yet,
and explain why the Government have chosen to use the word,
&#147;minority&#148;, rather than &#147;small&#148;, which
appears in her own briefing note. It is the more natural term to use
and it conveys the meaning in question. Why is she choosing to use

clear.</div>

defined as 10 per cent. or less. I do not think that anybody would say
that that is not the natural meaning of &#147;small&#148;.
&#147;Minority&#148; has a meaning; it means a percentage of 49.9
recurring or less. That is my understanding, but perhaps she went to
school in a different place from me&#151;I am sure that she did so.

paragraph 24, which seeks to deny the use of the new tax credit on
foreign dividends from non-UK companies for gift aid purposes. While
addressing the need to create a level playing field across EU and
European economic area companies for most purposes, the Government have
sought, for reasons that I do not understand, to carve out an exception
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>the gift aid scheme. As drafted, the Bill excludes the use of dividends
received from European companies or tax paid in respect of
dividends received from EU companies in the gift aid scheme. Does not

the European institutions. Nothing could be further from the

for gift aid, and why I do not propose to accept the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08052044000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would allow donors to use the new tax credits on dividends
from non-UK companies to frank donations to charity under the gift aid
scheme. The key principle that underpins gift aid is that donors can
redirect UK tax that they have paid to charities. Where UK income tax
is paid on dividends received from abroad, the principles behind gift
aid allow UK tax paid by donors to frank gift aid donations. The new
dividend tax credit, however, reflects tax paid outside the UK, so the
schedule&#146;s provisions simply reflect the fact that there is no
UK tax to redirect. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000443"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but
having accused us of reverting to type, which is nonsense, she has now
adopted a &#147;little England&#148; approach on this. She has
talked about the UK tax deducted and about making it available for the
gift aid scheme. Does she have advice, in the light of the Manninen
judgment, that the terms of paragraph 24 of the schedule are in fact
compliant with the EU treaties and do not fall foul of the free
movement of capital provisions? I understand her concern about the
possibility that the UK Treasury would essentially be reimbursing to a
charity revenue that it had not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>received from the taxpayer in the first place&#151;my hon. Friend the
Member for Wellingborough, who was very interested in what I said
earlier, would no doubt entirely support that view. However, it is in
the nature of the arrangements that we have with the EU that there will
be occasions on which one national Government will effectively
subsidise another because of the free movement arrangement.</div>
					<a name="08052044000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall just ask the Minister a
simple, factual question. Is the drafting of paragraph 24 based on
specific legal advice that it will not fall foul of the treaty
provisions? She made her case to the Committee very clearly, but it
will not astonish her to know that I did not dream up this challenge to
paragraph 24 on my own. There are serious professional bodies out there
that doubt whether the measure will survive a challenge in the European
courts. While it may be clear in her mind, it is not clear to
professionals outside who take an interest in these things. It would be
useful to know what legal advice she has
received.</div>

						</b> There are a couple of other points that I should
like the Economic Secretary to clarify for us. Will a taxpayer be able
to claim the credit against the higher rate tax due for any foreign tax
deducted in respect of the dividend, in addition to the deemed tax
credit? Unless credit is available for all or part of the foreign tax
paid, the taxpayer will have an increased tax liability compared with
that of a holder of shares in a UK company.</div>
					<a name="08052044000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister confirm that
section 397A(3) of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005
does not refer to deductions by way of foreign tax? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>Section 397A(7), which the schedule imports into the Act, deals with
deductions by way of foreign tax. It is therefore important to confirm
for the record that section 397A(3) does not refer to the foreign tax
deductions that have been dealt with in the newly inserted section
397A(7). Parity of treatment, which lies behind the schedule, does not
apply to individuals who will be claiming the remittance basis of
taxation&#151;in other words, non-doms&#151;in line with the
revised provisions of the 2005 Act. In those cases, following other
changes proposed in clause 65, there will still be a discrepancy
between UK and foreign dividends. A higher rate taxpayer who is a
resident non-dom will be subject to an effective rate of 25 per cent.
on UK dividends, but a rate of 33? per cent. on foreign dividends, as
they are charged at the higher rate of 40 per cent. on remitted
dividends rather than the special 32.5 per cent. dividend rate, which
applies to dividends that are taxed on an arising basis. Do the
Government have legal advice on this, or is it their considered
position that that discrimination between the dividends of UK companies
and EU companies in respect of resident non-dom shareholders is lawful
under the EU
treaties?</div>
					<a name="08052044000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="08052044000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me draw a couple of minor points to the Minister&#146;s attention.
The Income Tax Act 2007 contains a definition of grossing up. It states
that the grossed-up amount
is</div>
					<a name="08052044000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the amount produced
by adding to a net amount that net amount multiplied by the fraction r
÷ (100-r)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08052044000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a different calculation from the one envisaged in new section 397A.
That will be rather confusing. We will have one definition of
grossed-up amounts in new section 397A(2), but in new section 399 of
the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, we will have a
different definition using the definition in the Income Tax Act 2007.
It returns to the earlier point about trying to make all this
understandable. Does it make sense to have a different definition of
grossing up in new sections 397 and 399 of an Act? Could we not have
avoided that by more careful use of language in drafting?</div>
					<a name="08052044000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally&#151;this is related
point, although it is not a definitional
one&#151;the definition of grossed-up distribution is the
distribution increased by tax withheld at source. The definition in the
schedule says, &#147;including special withholding tax&#148;. Will
the Minister explain why those words are necessary? Surely, a special
withholding tax will always be included in the definition of a
tax deducted at source. Since provision is already made in the
definition of grossed-up distribution to deal with tax withheld at
source, why do we need a separate reference to special withholding tax?
Is there some special significance that other members of the Committee
and I have missed?</div>

to explain the basic effect of the measure, which is to simplify the
system for people with shares in foreign companies. More than 95 per
cent. of UK individuals in receipt of dividends from a foreign company
will be entitled to the non-payable dividend tax credit. That will
simplify the tax system for about 300,000 people. It is somewhat
predictable, given the interventions of Opposition Members, who all
posed valid questions that I will answer, that there should not

Ussher:
						</b> No, I am going to make some progress. I will give
way to the hon. Gentleman shortly. Turning to the specific points, the
second part of this reform 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>will not be retrospective, and we will make
announcements in due course with clarity. The hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge mentioned the way in which the provision relates to the
higher-rate tax credit and a withholding tax. There is no effect on
foreign tax credit relief; both types of credit are non-payable and
therefore act only to offset UK tax liability due. According to
statute, credit for withholding tax will be given before the dividend
tax credit. After foreign tax credit relief has been offset against any
liability to income tax the dividend tax credit will be deducted from
any remaining tax liability. If the total credit relief available
exceeds the UK income tax liability the excess is lost; it is not
re-payable and cannot be used to offset other tax
liabilities.</div>
					<a name="08052044000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned interaction with non-UK
domicile rules. The schedule does not seek to change in any way the
position for non-domiciled individuals who invest in offshore funds. I
am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has read in some detail new
section 397A of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. He
makes the point that we have two separate definitions of
&#147;grossed-up&#148;, but he is incorrect in his supposition. The
definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 is a general tax provision; by
convention a specific provision such as new section 397A, on which he
is now an expert, overrules a general provision, so that is entirely
clear in law. He asked if we think that the way in which we tax
individuals using the remittance basis is legal. Of course we think
that it is legal; that is why we are doing it. The new dividend tax
credit will apply to dividends paid to remittance-based taxpayers to
the extent that for such dividends brought into the UK and charged a
tax, when taken with the change in the headline rate of tax for
higher-rate taxpayers to 40 per cent., it will give a new effective
rate of tax of 33.3 per cent.</div>
					<a name="08052044000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his detailed reading of new
section 397A, the hon. Gentleman queried the point about deductions. I
am advised that &#147;deductions&#148; in this part of the schedule
means relief under UK tax law for things such as interest. It does not
mean foreign tax that another country has deducted from a dividend, and
that is the point of that part of the schedule. I trust that with those
answers we can now
proceed.</div>

In addition, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has set up a
group specifically to look from a company&#151;rather than an
individual&#151;point of view at the competitiveness of the UK

							<a name="08052044000467"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> The simplification has been broadly welcomed by
industry groups because it deals with situations perhaps involving
partners in firms of accountants. Under previous legislation, it would
have been assumed that their companies were associated by virtue of the
fact that they were partners rather than because there was commercial
interdependence between the companies. The provision, particularly in
the advent of large partnerships comprising several hundred partners,
is to be welcomed. However, other situations are still caught by
section 13 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 when, because
people are connected, it deems that their companies are associated even
though there is no commercial interdependence.</div>
					<a name="08052044000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, let us consider
companies that are owned separately by relatives. Can the Minister
clarify whether discussions are taking place on simplifying that aspect
of the rules? There are other ways in which to deal with the same issue
in respect of the annual investment
allowance.</div>
					<a name="08052044000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000468"></a>Angela
Eagle:
						</b> The clause deals with associated company rules, and
I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for the simplification
process. Associated company rules provide a range of anti-avoidance
protection measures within the corporation tax regime. For the purposes
of claims for small companies rate, they do that by preventing
directors or shareholders from fragmenting business activities in order
to qualify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>artificially in some ways for reliefs that were not
intended, an issue that we have talked about
before.</div>
					<a name="08052044000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause amends associated company rules to make it easier to establish
the number of other companies with which a company is associated, thus
removing a potential cause of undue compliance burden. That is brought
into effect, as the hon. Gentleman has rightly identified, by the
changes to companies rules that allow for much larger
partnerships&#151;sometimes of more than 1,000. Clearly, it is not
viable to expect a run-down on partnerships of 1,000 by one person and
for that person to have detailed knowledge of all the holdings of the
other partners in a way that perhaps happened in the past when
partnerships were
smaller.</div>
					<a name="08052044000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is the first of what we hope will be a series of simplifications. The
hon. Gentleman referred to another area and further meetings will be
scheduled to see how we can simplify the associated companies
rules further. The matter is complicated. The
stakeholders with whom we are engaging know and admit that it is
complex. We are continuing to engage with them and we hope that further
changes and simplifications in other areas, hopefully along the same
lines, will come out of our discussions. With that reassurance, I hope
that the Committee agrees that the clause should stand part of the
Bill.</div>

						</b> Clause 33 and schedule 13, which we have just
agreed, are simplification measures, when combined with schedule 14,
which is before us. They are about profits on life insurance policies
owned by companies. Together they turn some 60 pages
of legislation into three, including some of the transitional
provisions, leading to far lower compliance costs for industry. I trust
that that too will be welcomed by the Opposition.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>
					<a name="08052044000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 98 to 104 show that we can take the simplification in
schedule 14 slightly further by also repealing some rules that apply to
a purchased life annuity owned by a company. The rules set out how to
calculate the non-exempt part of the annuity, which is the taxable
income part. Amendment No. 99 repeals the relevant legislation on the
special tax rules, which are no longer needed to identify separately a
taxable part of the annuity. Amendment No. 98 ensures that, following
the repeals, the tax treatment of an insurance company&#146;s profits
from its purchased life annuity business remains the same. An insurance
company must continue to calculate a non-exempt amount for the purpose
of its tax computations, where the annuity is owned by a company, in
the same way as it does now. To do so, it must apply the rules that
apply to purchased life annuities held by individuals; those rules
continue in force. Amendments Nos. 100 to 104 repeal a number of
provisions that are no longer needed or that inserted amendments into
legislation that is being
repealed.</div>

							<a name="08052044000474"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I speak to amendment No. 75, which stands in my
name and those of my hon. Friends. The change in this schedule is one
of the more technical in this year&#146;s Finance Bill. The change is
slightly odd. It seeks to put on a statutory footing a tax treatment
that dates back to 1955, raising the question of why that is needed for
what seems to be an established part of tax law. I am sure that the
Minister will address that in her remarks, but it might be helpful for
the Committee if I give some background to the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="08052044000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The tax
treatment stems from a case, Sharkey <i class="I">v</i>. Wernher, that was heard
in the House of Lords in 1995. The case held that a trader who had
appropriated the stock from her business for private purposes should
account for tax purposes for the profit that would have arisen had the
stock been sold in the normal course of business, where the value of
the asset sold was in excess of its cost. Lady Zia Wernher ran a stud
farm, which was classified as a trading activity. She also ran a
racehorse stable, which was not classified as a trading
activity&#151;in line with many people who have had experience of
owning horses. It was deemed that when Lady Wernher transferred her
horse from the stud farm to the stable, the stud farm accounts should
show, as profit, the difference between the cost of the horse and its
market value at the time of the transfer. Thus the notional profit on
the horse should be taxed. That is different to the accounting
treatment of taxable profit. Case law has extended that, to ensure that
it applies to transfers within groups, or to when an asset has moved
from being part of the trading stock of a business to being a fixed
asset. Schedule 15 seeks to codify that longstanding
treatment.</div>
					<a name="08052044000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two schools of thought about the schedule. The first is that it is an
unnecessary move&#151;the practice has been long established so why
do it now? That is reinforced by the fact that when the Income Tax
(Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 was passed as a result of the tax
rewrite process, it was decided not to enact the treatment in statute.
The Rewrite Committee
reported:</div>
					<a name="08052044000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
see no reason to doubt that the principles explained in Sharkey v
Wernher continue to apply to the calculation of business profits. But
it would be wrong to enact those principles while others doubt the
position. The only way to preserve the law is to continue to rely on
case law in this
area.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052044000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That hints at
another school of thought, which is that the original 1955 ruling was
flawed. Keith Gordon, a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>tax barrister, argued in an article entitled &#147;Sharkey
Revisited&#148; in <i class="I">Taxation</i>, on 24 July 2003,
that</div>
					<a name="08052044000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the rule was
susceptible to challenge on two broad bases. First because their
Lordships had not had the advantage of evidence concerning the
accounting treatment of such appropriations, and secondly, because
(arguably) the importance of accounting principles became even more
pronounced following the enactment
of&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052044000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Finance Act 1998,
section 42. That principle is now reflected in the 2005 Act to which I
referred. The Institute of Chartered Accountants
stated:</div>
					<a name="08052044000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposal is that trading stock appropriated or otherwise
&#145;used&#146; by the trader for his own benefit should be
treated as sold at market value. This treatment is contrary to the
treatment under UK
GAAP&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052044000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;generally
accepted accounting
practice&#151;</div>
					<a name="08052044000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;under
which the transaction should be accounted for at either the cost price
of the stock or at the price paid on disposal. FA 1998 section 42
states that taxable profits must be computed in accordance with GAAP
unless an adjustment is required or authorised by
law.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052044000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
different treatment in the Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher case and UK GAAP
shows a difference between accounting and tax profits. Schedule 15
emphasises that difference and, by having that difference between
taxable profits and accounting profits, works against the
Government&#146;s stated desire to simplify the tax system. It would
be useful if the Economic Secretary could clarify why the Government
decided to add schedule 15 to the Bill. Is it, as Keith Gordon suggests
in his article, that taxpayers have been much more assertive in
questioning the continued applicability of the rule? There is also the
wider point that the schedule enshrines in statute a further gap
between the tax and accounting definitions of profits. One of the ways
to make tax simpler is to align more closely the two definitions of
profit. Why have the Government not chosen to go down that
route?</div>
					<a name="08052044000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
that arises from the codification of Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher is that
the rule&#151;the 1955 judgment&#151;has been relaxed in statement
of practice A32. Let me quote again from Mr. Gordon&#146;s
article:</div>
					<a name="08052044000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Statement
of Practice A32 gives rise to another interesting issue. The current
draft of the new clauses makes no reference to the undoubted relaxation
of the <i class="I">Sharkey v</i>
						<i class="I"> Wernher</i> rule, assuming that the rule is
valid. Consequently it would appear that property developers and other
traders who appropriate stock which they have constructed, as a fixed
asset of the business, together with other traders who receive (or
whose family or household members receive) meals or other services from
the business, will now find that they have to start paying tax on
profits they have not made and that this will apply in respect of
appropriations after 11
March.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08052044000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statement of practice has allowed certain relaxations of the Sharkey
<i class="I">v.</i> Wernher rules. The concern that Keith Gordon outlined in his
article is whether the statement of practice still holds and whether it
is overruled by the schedule. It is customary in the restaurant trade
for the manager or owner to take some bottles of wine from the cellar
for personal consumption and not pay the full price for them. As I
understand it, such appropriations have not been deemed to be subject
to tax in the
past.</div>
					<a name="08052044000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Economic Secretary clarify whether Mr. Gordon&#146;s
interpretation is correct that the schedule will overrule the statement
of practice? Has she considered the administrative impact that that
will have on small businesses, which will be required to compute 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>the market value of the assets appropriately?
Sometimes that is not entirely straightforward. For example, it could
depend on the point that the asset has reached in its
construction.</div>
					<a name="08052044000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the VAT treatment of these appropriations is to tax
them at cost rather than market value. It would
appear that there is a very logical approach in the VAT system, which
is entirely consistent with UK general accounting principles. A
different approach is used for income tax and corporation
tax.</div>
					<a name="08052044000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where an asset is
transferred at market value from a company&#146;s trading stock to
its fixed assets under the Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher rule, it creates a
notional profit on the trading account of a business, which would be
subject to corporation tax. For CGT purposes, the base cost becomes the
market value of the asset transferred. The principle also works in
reverse. For example, a fixed asset is transferred into trading stock.
To use Lady Wernher&#146;s example, a racehorse becomes part of a
stud.</div>
					<a name="08052044000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under current
rules, an election can be made under section 161(3) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992 to transfer the asset into trading stock at
its original cost rather than its market value. That means that any
gain or loss on the transfer is taxed within the business&#146;
trading profits rather than as capital gains. There is therefore no
chargeable gain or loss on transfer, but they are dealt with as part of
the trading activities of the business. It is not clear in the schedule
whether election under section 161(3) of the 1992 Act can be made in
respect of these transfers. Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 would make it
clear that the election continues to be available for those businesses
subject to income tax, by amending the 2005 Act, and
corporation
tax.</div>
					<a name="08052044000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 77
deals with the transfer of assets between group companies. As drafted,
paragraph 9 ignores the possibility that group companies might wish to
make the election under section 161(3) of the 1992 Act to transfer the
gain or loss to the trading account and be subject to tax through that
route, rather than as a chargeable
gain.</div>
					<a name="08052044000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
some clarification from the Economic Secretary on why the Government
have chosen to legislate for the Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher ruling. With
the amendments, I am keen to ensure that there is clarity that the
existing elections available to businesses and individuals will still
be available under schedule
15.</div>

							<a name="08052044000475"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a number of different
questions and perhaps it will help the Committee if I first explain
what we think the effects of the amendments will be. I believe
that they are unnecessary, but perhaps they are
probing amendments. I will then answer the specific points of substance
before saying why we are legislating in this
area.</div>
					<a name="08052044000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
seek to clarify how the market value rules introduced by clause 34 and
schedule 15 intend to interact with similar rules for capital gains
tax. They appear to be based on a concern that the legislation will
override and affect the capital gains rules set out in sections 161 and
173 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. I am sure that the
hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know that that concern is unfounded.
The schedule will have absolutely no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>impact on the operation of the capital gains legislation, and sections
161 and 173 of the 1992 Act will continue to apply in the same way as
they do currently. Had our intention been to override those sections of
the 1992 Act, we would have explicitly amended or repealed them. We
have not done so because that is not our
intention.</div>
				
					<a name="08052044000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08052044000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that schedule 15 will do nothing more than maintain the
status quo, including the way in which the market value ruling in
Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher interacts with capital gains tax rules, and I
will explain why that is the case. Businesses will continue to be able
to elect to disapply the market value rule for the purposes of capital
gains tax under section 161 of the 1992 Act, in the same way as they
have done in the past. That will include companies within the same
group, which will be able to make such an election as they do currently
under the provisions of section 161 as applied by section 173.
Therefore, I do not feel in general that those amendments are
necessary, but hope that my explanation has provided some
background.</div>
					<a name="08052044000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
some of the wider points, the hon. Member for Fareham wanted to know
where the new legislation will leave the statement of practice to which
he referred. The statement of practice A32, as it is properly called,
is part of HMRC&#146;s published guidance. That sets out how HMRC
applies the market value rule in Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher in practice.
Once the rule is legislated in the Bill, as we propose to do today,
there will be no need for a separate statement of practice, but there
will be no practical effect on businesses, which will continue to
operate the rule in the same way as they have always
done.</div>

							<a name="08052044000481"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am not sure that I would go so far as to call it
excitement, but the Opposition have raised in relation to previous
Bills the problem about relying on guidance to articulate the meaning
of legislation. In this case, the guidance softened or provided
exemptions to the status quo&#151;as the Minister mentioned
earlier&#151;that are based upon the Sharkey <i class="I">v.</i> Wernher case.
If that guidance does not form part of HMRC&#146;s body of guidance,
those exemptions are swept away. The schedule provides no exemptions to
permit the existing relaxation of those rules to continue to apply, and
that is the problem.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000482"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> It appears that I am about to be advised on that
point. The purpose is to maintain the existing situation. I will take a
little step back and diverge from what I was about to say to explain
why we are doing this. We have been asked to legislate on this
by the normal types of body that one would expect&#151;the trade
associations and the accountancy and legal professions&#151;because
although the case law has been operating happily for the best part of
50 years, it seems that there is now some uncertainty in the
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000484"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I will give way, but I will first answer the
question that was just asked. The statement of practice A32 will be
obsolete, as I have just said, but there will be no effect on
taxpayers. We do not believe that represents a softening of the case
law, so perhaps that answers the hon. Member for Fareham. The
exceptions, as he said, will remain, but statement A32 will be obsolete
because it will be incorporated into law. I hope that clarifies the
point.</div>
					<a name="08052044000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000485"></a>Mr.
Bone:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, as my
question is on that point. If we are creating new legislation so that
the guidance is removed, HMRC will be forced to interpret the new law
and catch people who previously were exempted. I do not think that is
what the Government mean to do, so will they look at the provision
again?</div>
					<a name="08052044000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000486"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but I have explained that it is absolutely our intention not to change
the way that the process is carried out. It is simply a translation
from guidance into legislation. Following the points that have been
raised, I will take it upon myself to re-satisfy myself with my team
that that is indeed the case. That is our explicit aim, so although the
hon. Gentlemen are right to raise the issue, I hope that we can
reassure them.</div>
					<a name="08052044000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of the provision on small businesses, including restaurants,
which the hon. Member for Fareham mentioned, will not give rise to any
additional administrative burdens. Its effect will be to maintain the
existing treatment of movements of goods into and out of trading stock.
No business will, as a result of this legislation, be required to do
anything different from what they currently do. We are simply
responding to concerns that it would be helpful to put the measure into
law.</div>
					<a name="08052044000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Fareham asked whether the statement of practice is lawful,
following the Wilkinson case. The decision of the House of Lords in
Wilkinson concerned the proper authority of HMRC to make concessions
from the strict application of tax law. That decision has no bearing on
HMRC&#146;s statement of practice, A32, or other published guidance,
which, as I have already said, will now become obsolete; it will merely
confirm that the market value applies only to goods, not to
services, in line with tax case law subsequent to Sharkey <i class="I">v</i>.
Wernher.</div>
					<a name="08052044000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned the report in <i class="I">Taxation</i> magazine, which said
that the House of Lords decision was not informed by evidence of
accounting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>treatment and that the rule is therefore susceptible to challenge. We
believe that Sharkey <i class="I">v</i>. Wernher is sound case law based on a
decision by the highest authority in the UK and that it has not been
overturned by any subsequent court decision. We have simply been asked
to include that result in legislation and I hope that we are doing so
uncontroversially.</div>
					<a name="08052044000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000487"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> If the rule stands and has been decided by the
highest court in the land, why does it need to be included in the
Finance Bill? We do not seem to be changing anything by doing
so.</div>
					<a name="08052044000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000488"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> I hoped, innocently and naively, that I could deal
with the substance and then with the timing issues. Perhaps I should
deal with the timing now. Why is this measure being included in
legislation? There is no evidence that the market value is not being
applied in practice, but as modern accounting standards have developed
in the past 50 years there has been a degree of uncertainty about
whether the principles established by tax cases continue to override
the relevant accounting standards, which of course they do. To put the
matter beyond doubt, the Government are putting the principles arising
from Sharkey <i class="I">v</i>. Wernher on a statutory basis, because we want
the tax system to be as clear as possible and to operate on the
principle that areas of uncertainty should be addressed wherever
possible. The measure supports that aim and puts the position beyond
doubt.</div>
					<a name="08052044000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why we abandoned our plans to legislate on the market
value principle as part of the tax law rewrite project in 2000. We
intended to do so, but some respondents felt that as the rule was not
previously contained in law, to include it in a law rewrite was
inappropriate. That is a grey area, but we thought it best to err on
the side of caution, so the relevant provisions are excluded from the
tax law rewrite Bill. However, including such a thing in the Finance
Bill enables us to debate the matter properly and get the issues
on record. I hope that we have achieved
that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000489"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her remarks on
the amendment and those covering the broader issues relating to the
schedule. I am particularly grateful for her clarification about the
availability of the election under section 161(3) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992, which was the main concern raised by one of
the representative bodies. It was felt that it was not clear
previously.</div>

							<a name="08052044000490"></a>Kitty

						</b> I should like to make it crystal clear that
we set out not the exemptions to the codes, but the operation of case
law. But the point is the
same.</div>
					<a name="08052044000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000491"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> That is in relation to statement
of practice, A32, rather than the availability of the election, which I
was touching on. I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification
that the election is still available. That is
important.</div>
					<a name="08052044000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
clear position on the statement of practice, A32, which the Minister
just raised. However, although she was saying that A32 explained case
law, surely that case law has been overridden by schedule 15. Although
the Government were confident that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>case was still the right one, the problem is that it was subject to
greater challenge. Does that not have precedent over previous cases
that have explored the measure? I think that in the past there was even
a case over the cost of a bottle of
wine.</div>
					<a name="08052044000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to
detain the Committee for too much longer, but we need a clearer
understanding of the status of the previous guidance and whether the
schedule now applies to all cases where assets are appropriated from
trading stock for personal consumption or are moved from fixed to
trading assets. Another of the representative bodies has raised that
point and it is important. It leads to an enshrining of the difference
between profits as defined by UK GAAP&#151;generally accepted
accounting practice&#151;and profits as defined by tax law. I suspect
that will continue to be an issue as accounting practice develops to
reflect changing circumstances. We are in danger of making a system
more complex by maintaining the distinction between accounting profits
and tax profits.</div>
					<a name="08052044000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the reassurances that the Minister has given on the section 161(3)
election, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

Hoban:
						</b> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 78 and 80
because amendment No. 79 is made redundant by amendment No.
80&#151;as no doubt the Minister will point out. These amendments are
about a point of principle rather than the underlying tax treatment.
There needs to be certainty in the tax system and an appropriate
process by which tax law is made and changed. Those matters are
relevant to the schedule.</div>
					<a name="08052044000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
investment management exemption enables UK-based fund managers managing
overseas domiciled funds to avoid any income or corporation tax charges
on profits made on the funds that would otherwise arise. For a fund
manager to qualify for the exemption, transactions that they undertake
must fall within the definition of an investment transaction set out in
section 127(13) of the Finance Act 1995. That provision has been
supplemented by four statutory instruments and augmented by a statement
of practice; in this case it is SP1/01, which gives further guidance on
the application of the exemption.</div>
					<a name="08052044000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fund management industry
has argued that using primary and secondary legislation to define an
investment transaction is not flexible enough to deal with the rate of
innovation in the industry, so an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>alternative approach needs to be found. The proposal in the schedule is,
therefore, to repeal the primary and secondary legislation and, in
effect, to give HMRC&#146;s commissioners the power to determine what
constitutes an investment
transaction.</div>
					<a name="08052044000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it from representations on the provision from the
Investment Management Association, the expectation is that HMRC will
publish on a website transactions that it considers to be investment
transactions, therefore qualifying to secure the exemption. That will
mean that investment managers will not need to seek pre-clearance as
often as they do now, because there will be much greater transparency
about what qualifies under the rule, and they will be able to consult
the website to see whether clearance has been given, and will need to
approach HMRC only when a new type of transaction that has not been
dealt with before comes into view, and they want to use
it.</div>
				
					<a name="08052044000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
45 pm</div>
					<a name="08052044000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the
approach of the schedule is to remove inconsistencies
between the legislation and the statement of practice not by refining
legislation or making sure it is up to date, or redrafting it in a more
encompassing and clearer way, but just by scrapping legislation that,
it would appear, is inconvenient. I do not think that that is how this
Parliament makes tax law. We believe that it is for Parliament, not the
commissioners, to decide on tax. The schedule removes
Parliament&#146;s right to do so.</div>
					<a name="08052044000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament should have the
right to scrutinise changes in tax policy, through scrutiny of primary
and secondary legislation, and it is in the interest of proper,
considered debate that the making of the changes should be scrutinised
in public by Parliament, not discussed behind closed doors.
Furthermore, it is in the interest of certainty that the principles of
what is or is not an investment transaction should be laid down in
statute. How would investment managers be able to challenge, argue or
discuss the decisions reached by HMRC without a statutory framework
within which to work?</div>
					<a name="08052044000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although in the short term
certainty will be achieved by the elimination of
primary and secondary legislation, the lack of clear, consistent
statutory principles will, in the long term, create uncertainty if
contradictory or ambiguous conclusions are reached. We had debates last
year on guidance produced by HMRC with respect to capital losses;
despite two iterations when we debated it in Committee, ambiguous
conclusions were still reached about whether certain types of
transaction fell within the laws. Guidance itself is not perfect in
bringing about a considered
view.</div>
					<a name="08052044000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">London has a
poor reputation in the financial services sector for uncertainty. Our
competitive position in the long term is strengthened by clear,
consistent legislation that is properly drawn up. If there is a problem
for fund managers, arising from the gap between legislation and the
statement of practice, the answer is to refine the legislation rather
than scrap it. That is the purpose of amendments Nos. 78 and
80&#151;to restore or maintain the status quo and ensure that the
changes are dealt with through proper legislative means, with full
parliamentary scrutiny, rather than by the commissioners for Revenue
and Customs.</div>

					<a name="08052044000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ability of the UK
tax authorities to respond quickly to changes is important in a rapidly
evolving industry&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08052044000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 16 delivers those benefits and
is what the industry
wants.</div>
					<a name="08052044000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
general view that the City of London and the financial services sector
is a jewel in Britain&#146;s crown and one of our most important
industry sectors, employing more than 1 million people throughout the
country. Currently, about $400 billion is under management in the UK,
and we are No. 2 in the world in the sector. Hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of people are employed, so when the main industry bodies say
that we can do something to make us as attractive, if not more
attractive, to investment and expansion in the future, that is
something that Governments of any colour should listen to. The
amendments would undermine the approach that we are taking and leave
the law exactly as it is. That is contrary to what the
industry expressly sought during consultation and
would mean that we could not deliver the simplification and speedy
response to product innovation that are the drivers for what we are
trying to do here.</div>
					<a name="08052044000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the general point that the hon. Gentleman makes. It is good
government to scrutinise as much as possible in Committee and on the
Floor of the House. We have sought to square the circle by giving
positive assurances. HMRC has already given assurances as to how this
power will be used. It is important that these are on the record, so I
shall briefly reiterate them. All transactions that currently meet the
definition of &#147;investment transaction&#148; in primary
legislation will be included in the regulations made under the new
power, so investment managers can be reassured that all transactions
that currently qualify will continue to do so. HMRC has also said that
it will agree with the industry and publish in guidance a statement of
assurance about handling any future changes to the transactions that
qualify for the investment manager
exemption.</div>
					<a name="08052044000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC is
also committed, as indeed am I, to maintaining the dialogue with the
industry and its representative bodies in relation to this and other
issues of interest or concern&#151;the dialogue out of which these
proposed legislative changes have themselves arisen. It may be helpful
if I set out how I see this working in practice. HMRC would not
spontaneously decide that a new type of product should be added to the
list, but the industry would tell us about an innovation or a new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>type of derivative that it wants to trade in because it thinks that it
would help its business. The product would not be doing any harm to
anyone else, and industry will ask us to clarify that the rules mean
that it is still exempted. We will have a look and say
yes.</div>

						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that
it is not for me to say that right now. I have said that HMRC will be
working with the industry to produce this. It will be done
collaboratively. The process has not yet finished. The whole aim is to
simplify and speed up, and to make sure that we can retain our
comparative advantage in this area. I therefore urge the Committee to
resist the amendment and to allow the legislative changes sought by the
investment management industry to
proceed.</div>

							<a name="08052044000498"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> While I share the Minister&#146;s view about the
importance of the financial services sector&#151;it is a tremendous
contributor to Britain&#146;s tax revenues, to employment and to
economic growth, and it has grown faster than the economy as a whole in
recent years&#151;we need to be careful about introducing changes
such as this. There are other features about the environment in which
businesses work that are important. One of those relates to certainty.
In the study produced recently by the City of London Corporation on tax
as a motivation for the location of business in the financial services
sector, one of the areas in which the UK rated poorly was certainty of
tax law. While it may be convenient for the industry now to offer this
approach, in the long term is it appropriate to proper governance to go
down this route? That is why I asked about the principles that HMRC
will use to determine whether new products satisfy the
rules.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000499"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that we should set
out what type of transactions fall under the new power without
consulting with industry
first?</div>
					<a name="08052044000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000500"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Far from it. We have seen plenty of examples of
where lack of consultation caused the Government problems. We shall
come on to some of those later. There should be proper consultation,
but my argument is about determining some clear, unambiguous principles
that are accepted by both industry and HMRC as to what transactions
will qualify as investment transactions. If all of those criteria can
be satisfied, why not have them set out in primary legislation? Why not
have those principles set out in the Finance Bill, or even in a
statutory instrument, rather than in guidance, which Parliament has no
opportunity to scrutinise through this process or in a delegated
legislation Committee? That is what I am trying to get at.</div>
					<a name="08052044000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is at risk of
failing to observe proper parliamentary process or to consider whether
there are ways in which the same aim could be obtained through primary
legislation rather than relying on guidance. That is the area that I am
trying to explore, and I am yet to be convinced that I should withdraw
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>amendment. The Minister has not been convincing or persuasive as to
whether the Government considered an appropriate legislative framework
rather than reaching for guidance
first.</div>

							<a name="08052044000501"></a>Mr.

						</b> I urge my hon. Friend to press his amendment to a
vote, because it is a major leap into the dark to give the Revenue
decision-making powers without establishing the principles in the first
place. The Minister gave no assurance that there would be any
principles. It seems that the Revenue will simply come to a
decision.</div>

					<a name="08052044000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
makes an important point. The Minister said that HMRC would seek to
come up with some principles in collaboration with industry, and that
is the right way to do it. The process should be consultative and
collaborative, which is in the best interests of HMRC, the Treasury and
industry. However, we should not cast to one side the proper process,
which is through primary and secondary legislation, to reach a point
that is acceptable to both industry and the Treasury. Does the Minister
have anything to
add?</div>
					<a name="08052044000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000506"></a>Kitty
Ussher:
						</b> Absolutely. In the interest of my work, I am
delighted that the Conservatives are pursuing this approach because it
seems to be proof, if any were needed, that they do not understand the
sort of derivative products that we are discussing. Huge principles are
not required because we are talking about technical derivative products
and whether they are added to a list. What is happening is simply that
Britain is losing out because of the process that would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>otherwise be required. We would have to sit here and debate incredibly
complicated matters that have no wider principles that need to be
discussed at parliamentary level. I am absolutely clear that what we
are doing is right for the City of London and for the financial
services sector. There are precedents for it, and it is being used in
other areas, such as in relation to the power given to commissioners of
HMRC to designate the Stock Exchange as a recognised stock
exchange.</div>
					<a name="08052044000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
seriously think that what we are doing today would undermine the role
of Parliament, because these are fairly mathematical transactions and
we would slow down the City of London&#146;s competitiveness by not
pursuing this approach. That is what the industry unanimously said, and
I would be delighted if the hon. Gentleman pressed his amendment to a
Division, because it would show that he simply did not
understand.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08052044000507"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Well, that was an impassioned outburst from the
Economic Secretary on what is an abstruse technical issue. If
principles can be determined as part of the whole process of
reassurance, is it not possible for those principles to be converted
into primary or secondary legislation? That is the point that I want to
tease out and we are getting a better understanding of the issue, but
why does the Minister believe that primary legislation cannot be used?
If HMRC and the industry bodies are looking to produce a statement of
principles, why can they not be converted into
legislation?</div>
