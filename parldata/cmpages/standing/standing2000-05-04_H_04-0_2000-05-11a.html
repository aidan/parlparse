<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the convenience of the Committee, I should explain that it is normal for the dress code to be observed at the beginning of a sitting. It is my fervent hope that we can conduct our affairs in a tolerant and tolerable frame of mind. To improve our powers of concentration on the line-by-line scrutiny to which we must apply ourselves, I am happy for hon. Gentlemen to divest themselves of their outer garment upperwise at every sitting. I will not need to repeat that. For sittings chaired by my co-Chairman, Dr. Clark, it will be necessary to obtain his permission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Committee, at its rising on Tuesday 16th May, do adjourn till Thursday 18th May at One o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
By way of explanation, next Thursday there will be Treasury questions on the Floor of the House. I think that all hon. Members have a great interest in Treasury questions. We propose that, with agreement through the usual channels, the Committee sits next Thursday, exceptionally, at 
<P>
<H5>1 pm. </h5>

<p>We intend the sitting to continue until 3.30. With the approval of the Chair, we might have a short break between 3.30 and 4.30. That will allow members of the Committee to participate fully in parliamentary questions next Thursday morning.</H5>
</P>

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Basis of calculation of ad valorem element of duty on cigarettes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I do not want a long debate on this clause. I hope that the main debate on tobacco and smuggling will take place under clause 14, so I have only one question. Clause 13 appears sensible. As I understand it, the excise duty is calculated by reference partly to the number of cigarettes and partly to the price, and a percentage is charged. Reading the notes on clauses, I understand that there is an avoidance problem, in that manufacturers can have a recommended price, but in fact charge more than that by putting a higher price on the packs. Therefore, the duty should be calculated on the higher price. If I have understood that correctly, I shall not quarrel with that.

<P>
However, I am slightly intrigued to know what happens when there is neither a recommended price nor a marked price. Let us suppose that a trader imports a consignment of cigarettes from a new source. How much tax is payable? Let us suppose that an individual at the frontier brings in a huge number of cigarettes, on which duty has already been paid, but at a lower rate in another country, perhaps outside the European Union. That person wants to pay duty on the cigarettes, because he does not want to be accused of doing anything illegal. He does not intend to smoke them all himself, but wishes to sell them on to workmates or friends and, therefore, wants to pay the full duty. Presumably, he has no recommended retail price for those cigarettes and nothing, certainly not in English currency, is stamped on the pack. How does the system work in such eventualities?

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> Mr. Cook, I welcome you back to the Chair. As the right hon. Gentleman said, the clause changes the basis for calculating the ad valorem or price-related element of the duty on cigarettes. It will prevent tax avoidance by cigarette manufacturers and importers by ensuring that the duty charged is based on the highest retail price at the time duty is payable. The excise duty on cigarettes has two parts-a specific duty calculated by the number of cigarettes and an ad valorem duty calculated as a percentage of the retail price.

<P>
Of late, there has been some evidence that, in a small number of cases, some advantage has been taken of the current law, which requires the calculation and payment of the ad valorem component based on published recommended retail prices, even though individual packs are marked for sale at a higher price. That system has the potential to become more widespread. It has been used to avoid paying the higher ad valorem duty due following a price increase. The measure provides that the basis for the calculation of ad valorem duty is the higher of either the price marked on the cigarette pack when duty is due or the published recommended retail selling price. That complements our action to curb trade forestalling of duty increases, which will be considered in the longer debate that the right hon. Gentleman and I expect will take place on clause 14.

<P>
In an example of the kind about which the right hon. Gentleman asked, the requirement is technically to charge duty on the highest price at which cigarettes are sold in the United Kingdom. If there is any doubt, it is for Customs and Excise officials to use their best judgment about the correct price to use. In practice, Customs and Excise tends to consult its records and use the most popular price category.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary, but I am none the wiser. I gave an example of a new importation of which there would not be a record of any sort. By definition, there would therefore be no established retail price. My second example related to an individual attempting to pay duty at the frontier. Clearly, Customs and Excise would have nothing to go on, as everything would lie in the future. The person might modestly mark up his purchase of cigarettes from a country such as Turkey or another further afield in order to resell them. There would be no published tariff and nothing on which Customs and Excise could work.

<P>
It is all very well to say that Customs and Excise could make a judgment, but I would like to know on what it would be based. Tax cannot be levied purely at its discretion if that tax is based on a figure that is simply plucked out of the air. Will the Financial Secretary give a fuller explanation now, or let me have one in due course?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have made the point that the strict interpretation of what is required is for duty to be charged at the highest price for which cigarettes are on sale in the UK. In the example that the right hon. Gentleman gave, I imagine that the person importing the cigarettes would be required to state the price at which it is intended that they be sold in the UK. Duty will then be payable on that price, so the question is about the highest price at which cigarettes will be sold and on which duty is payable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I still find the situation in which someone does not know at what price he eventually wishes to sell the cigarettes unsatisfactory. If it were a new consignment, possibly of a new brand of cigarettes, from a country that had not previously exported to the United Kingdom, we could be in entirely novel territory. I am surprised that there is no definitive answer on the revenue payable. If the individual brought in a large consignment, the sums involved could be considerable. So it is unsatisfactory for someone to turn up at the border, say that he will resell the cigarettes, hand over a cheque and walk away free. That is a very confused and confusing way of levying an important duty on an importer.

<P>
I am hardly the wiser after the Financial Secretary's reply. I understand it in terms of an established system of importation of a known brand from a previous supplier through a route that is known to customs, but I am talking about a new situation or about someone who has in his possession many cigarettes that he has bought very cheaply, which he does not intend to smoke himself, who has a crisis of conscience at the border and wishes to pay the duty. Will he simply be asked the price at which he intends to resell them and be asked to pay the duty? If so, I find that unsatisfactory and subjective.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The answer depends on the circumstances. He described the case of someone who decided, mid-journey, that he wanted to sell the cigarettes that he was importing, but the normal situation would be a commercial one and commercial records will be available for that. Such packs will need UK health warnings to be sold legally in the UK so one could not decide to sell such cigarettes on the spur of the moment. In the off-the-cuff situation to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, officials will be able to refer to the price established for that category of cigarette-king-size for example-in the UK. Commercial documentation will normally be available, a commercial arrangement will have been entered into and UK health warnings will be printed on the pack. On that basis, those cigarettes can legally be sold in the UK and information will be available for the application of the correct rate of duty.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. The Committee will recall that we discussed on Tuesday the rate of duty for hydrocarbon oils and alcoholic liquor. During those debates, the Financial Secretary was straightforward in his account of how the Government's figure of 3.41 per cent. was fixed and stated clearly that that figure included the Government's Budget estimate of the amount by which interest rates would increase during the summer. In response to pressure, the Financial Secretary undertook to write to every member of the Committee to provide that figure, which the Government had included in their estimates. I mean no criticism-yet-of the Financial Secretary, but I have not received such a letter. I do not know whether other members of the Committee have. I hope, Mr. Cook, that you will encourage the Financial Secretary to fulfill his pledge to the Committee before we leave the issue of setting duty rates. On Tuesday, the Committee agreed to 3.41 per cent. because the Government said that they would provide that information to the Committee. They have not yet done so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I am pleased to tell you that I do not require the further encouragement that the right hon. Gentleman suggested that you should give me, because a letter is being prepared. The right hon. Gentleman's recollection is not quite right. I did not say that I would provide the Government's estimate, because that would not be appropriate. I said that I would provide further information about the market expectations on interest rates, as referred to in box C1 on page 195 of the Red Book. I will write to the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am indebted to the Financial Secretary for that explanation, in response to a point that was not really a matter for the Chair. It was more a question for debate, and I am sure that the good nature of the exchanges will continue.

<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fiscal marks on tobacco products</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 8, leave out lines 40 to 46.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 7, in page 10, leave out lines 4 to 26.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This clause is important, because it breaks new ground in giving Customs and Excise additional powers to counter smuggling, by setting up a fiscal marking system that will place a ``duty paid'' mark on packs of cigarettes and tobacco. People possessing cigarettes without such marks may be assumed to have imported them illegally or obtained them from illegal sources. That is not a new idea, but it is a new means of countering smuggling.

<P>
Last week, we debated on the Floor of the House the issue of smuggling of tobacco products and alcohol. We agreed about the seriousness of that, but we did not get to the bottom of the connection between the level of duty on those products and the smuggling incentive or incidence. Correspondingly, it is difficult to assess the likely effectiveness of other measures against smuggling. That is particularly regrettable, because people have studied that issue and commented on it. Mr. Martin Taylor was asked to investigate it and made a report to the Treasury. As I understand it, he also wrote to the Chancellor about his findings.

<P>
The Select Committee on the Treasury is Labour controlled and has a Labour Chairman, so it is worth my quoting its comments on the Government's failure to publish Mr. Taylor's report. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We consider it unacceptable that the Treasury should commission a review of an important area of Government policy, and announce policy measures apparently based on the outcome of that review, without allowing Parliament access to the review's conclusions. We recommend that the Chancellor make available for Parliamentary scrutiny the results of Mr. Martin Taylor's recent evaluation of Government policy to tackle tobacco smuggling.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are considering the measures to combat smuggling mentioned in that quote, so perhaps the Minister can tell us more about the report. We have all made it clear that sensitive intelligence or national security matters could be deleted from such a report.

<P>
We need a better explanation of why the Government are keeping the report secret, because that makes it more difficult to discuss such amendments. The Financial Secretary hinted previously that sensitive matters were involved, but Opposition Members feel that they are sensitive for the Government only because they are an embarrassment. The report points out that unless the root cause of the problem-the duty level-is tackled, all the other measures will be in danger of failing. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will tell us a little more about his reasons for keeping the report secret, especially as the Government have apparently made a commitment to openness and the public's right to know. If public money has been used to commission and write a report, we are entitled to more of an explanation of why it has not been published.

<P>
Although the report that the Government produced on the back of the Taylor report was sanitised and incomplete, it nevertheless highlighted an extremely serious problem. More than one in five cigarettes smoked in this country are imported illegally, as is about 80 per cent. of hand-rolling tobacco. It is especially alarming that, even after the introduction of the measures that the Government propose, including the fiscal marking scheme that we are now considering, the problem is due to continue getting worse for the next three years. An increase in the number of smokers is anticipated, especially among young people. It especially appals me that the illegal trade is growing, putting increasingly more money into the hands of criminals and smugglers, and less into the pockets of
 the retail and distributive trade, including small shopkeepers, who are also threatened by developments in the high street.

<P>
Bitterness is developing among people in the retail and distributive trade, making them rather less inclined to look favourably on the fiscal marking scheme. They realise that many of the costs involved are likely to fall on them, and they may fall foul of the date marking scheme, if it is introduced. It will certainly involve extra expense in setting stock levels and managing businesses. They realise that they have an obligation-indeed, a civic duty-to counter illegality and under-age smoking, but they are increasingly annoyed that the Government do not seem to be playing their part and are placing the full obligation on the trade, while running a fiscal policy that the criminal fraternity regards as a complete joke. It has been put to me that, ``You up in Parliament have no common sense if you really think that making cigarettes more expensive is not going to increase smuggling. Where do you get your information?'' I find it difficult to answer that.

<P>
Turning to the details of the fiscal marking scheme, it is to be introduced through rather general regulations. My eyebrows always shoot up when I read phrases such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commissioners may make provision by regulations  as to such matters relating to fiscal marks as appear to the Commissioners to be necessary or expedient.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``necessary or expedient'' always gives the Government great latitude.

<P>
I am also slightly worried that other details of the fiscal marking scheme can be introduced or amended simply by notice-in other words, without reference to Parliament, simply by pinning up, publishing or issuing a notice. People may incur penalties under a law that can be altered by a simple notice, which should concern the Committee, but is a matter for a separate amendment. Does the Minister really believe that the fiscal notice scheme will make a material difference? Will he quantify his hopes for the scale of that difference?

<P>
In our debates last week, some Labour Members were looking for a panacea for the smuggling problem. The Government said that they would purchase X-ray machines that could examine lorries that came in from the continent. The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), who is sadly not a member of the Committee, displayed a touching faith in technology's ability to counter the problem. He, and members of the Committee, have perhaps not had experience of the sheer ingenuity of the criminals engaged in that trade. If one blocks one avenue, they find another means to import the product.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that he would not be opposed to the increase in duty on health or other grounds, were he not sceptical about the ability of Customs and Excise to cut back the smuggling, or that, even if those anti-smuggling measures were effective, he would still regret the increase?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Let me put it this way. I would be sympathetic to the proposition that higher tobacco prices deterred smoking if I could be sure that the increased duty rate raised the price of illegal tobacco products. However, raising the price of legal tobacco does not, by definition, increase the price of illegally imported tobacco. Indeed, it gives an incentive for smokers to switch from legal to illegal supplies. The Government's own investigations and report show that that undermines the concept that a higher price has a benign health effect. The evidence shows that, regrettably, the incidence of smoking is increasing, so the health policy cannot be working.

<P>
I would be more sympathetic to the policy if I could be sure that measures to crack down on smuggling were likely to be effective-but they are not. The Government report shows that they believe that the problem will continue to worsen for the next three years, despite the recruitment of an extra 950 civil servants, the deployment of the X-ray machines and the fiscal marking scheme.

<P>
We are faced with a policy that has broken down, as an intolerable limit of illegality has been reached. The Government must address the issue of the duty level, which is why we ask for evidence in the matter. I do not want to make any bold assertions about the link between duty levels and smuggling. However, common sense tells us that smuggling must be affected by the price, in some way; we need the exact correlation from the Government.

<P>
Other countries, notably the Nordic countries and Canada, have investigated the matter and come to the conclusion that they have to work on the duty level as well. It will not be sufficient to erect more effective barriers against smuggling unless the price issue is addressed. That might also be an important matter for the Committee, but I do not have the relevant information. The Government do have that information, which is why I persist in asking for such evidence before we proceed with anti-smuggling measures.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
To return to the issue of fiscal marking, I am worried that, although it is presumably designed to identify tobacco products that have not borne duty, there are many ways in which people can legally possess and smoke cigarettes on which duty has not been paid. I am therefore not sure that the system is as foolproof as we are being asked to suppose. For instance, the importation for personal use of cigarettes and tobacco will continue. Therefore, if I bring in a load of cigarettes for my own use at Dover, and then give them away to my family and friends, packs of cigarettes will legally be in circulation without fiscal marking. A crime has been committed only if those cigarettes are sold; furthermore, I believe that the crime is in the selling of the cigarettes, not the buying. Therefore, the possession of cigarettes without such marking does not unerringly lead to the conclusion that a crime has been committed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): Is my right hon. Friend aware of the estimate, in the financial statistics, that of all tobacco that comes into the country across the channel, 10 per cent. has been imported legally? It is therefore a substantial part of the cross-channel market.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Can the Minister therefore confirm that, although 10 per cent. of the cigarettes in the country will not carry a fiscal marking, that will not be evidence that anything has gone wrong? Indeed, much time and effort could be wasted on tracking down such cigarettes, when there is an innocent explanation that undermines what I understand to be the thinking behind the fiscal marking scheme.

<P>
Cigarettes are not only imported duty-paid; duty-free cigarettes continue to enter the country from outside the European Union, and will not be fiscally marked. If I am wrong about that, it would help if the Minister intervened at an early stage. People will not necessarily be deterred from buying or selling cigarettes without the mark, as they already buy and sell cigarettes illegally, which show up because, although they do not carry a fiscal mark, they carry a foreign health warning-for instance, the cigarettes that are imported from France, Belgium and further afield. What additional deterrent will be achieved by adding a fiscal mark?

<P>
My other more general concern is about the forging of such marks. According to my reading of the draft regulations, the duty-paid label will not be embossed, carry a watermark or be difficult to forge in any way. Therefore, what will stop criminal gangs manufacturing their own fiscal markings, putting them on packs of cigarettes and passing them off as the real thing? I may have got that wrong, and there may be something clever about the fiscal marks, but that in turn raises questions about cost. If we are going to make these marks more like bank notes, the cost will presumably have to be borne by the Government or the trade.

<P>
I have several further questions, but if you will allow me, Mr. Cook, I will leave them until the clause stand part debate because I am trying to focus on the amendments. At the heart of our proposals is the fact that the Bill permits the variation of a fiscal mark to allow for a time-limited element. In other words, there will be a period of sale mark on the label, as well as an indication that duty has been paid. That is primarily to prevent the forestalling of large quantities of tobacco that are released from store shortly before a duty increase and drawn down over many months so that the Government lose the higher revenue.

<P>
The Bill allows for the extension of the fiscal mark to include a date so that the trade will be given only three months to get rid of stocks; otherwise they will fall outside the permitted date and an offence will have been committed. However, retailers have told us that that could be expensive for them to implement. Although the forestalling or avoidance is not of their making and is conducted by manufacturers, the cost of a date mark scheme, which could be as high as £20 million, would be borne by the retail and distributive trade.

<P>
The trade is concerned that the commissioners, rather than Parliament, will have the power to extend the fiscal mark to include a date, and it believes that that should be done instead through primary legislation. Given that the Government will not proceed immediately to date marking but will wait to see whether other anti-forestalling measures succeed, they should return to the House in a year's time for permission to extend the fiscal mark if they think that that is necessary.

<P>
I agree with the retailers that there is an important issue of powers and penalties, in particular because those who fall foul of the date-marking scheme will be fined and have their premises disallowed for retailing purposes. Given those penalties, it is doubly important that Parliament, rather than the Revenue should be the source of the necessary regulations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook. I congratulate the Government on their provisions to add fiscal marking to the panoply of measures that Customs and Excise has to combat smuggling. That is an important and welcome step. International experience-in particular, recent experience in Canada and Ireland-shows that marking has an effect if introduced properly. Never the less, the Minister needs to answer the Committee's questions about whether the Government have opted for the right type of stamp. There is also the detailed issue of dates in amendment No. 6, which I have signed, although it originated with the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory).

<P>
As regards the benefits, the Canadians introduced fiscal marks formally-rather than through voluntary agreements-in 1994. They found that fiscal marking was effective as part of a wider group of measures, and the Government have said that they will implement other measures. Fiscal marking was also effective against small-scale smuggling. When considering the practicalities, it is common sense that the measure will deal with the Jack the lad, white van type of smuggling rather than the consignment-type smuggling carried out by large-scale criminals. It is a most appropriate measure.

<P>
When excise duty was debated on the Floor of the House, some Conservative Members supported reducing the tax on tobacco and were worried about the implications of smuggling for public morality. They said that it was worth spending public money to turn the position around. The scheme is a more cost-effective way to tackle the problem because it meets the real worries that such an incentive encourages ordinary, decent people to break the law. It will persuade such people not to break the law but to pay the proper taxes.

<P>
Why have the Government gone for a duty stamp, not a tax stamp? Paragaph 71 of the Treasury Committee report on HM Customs and Excise that was published in February states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend that further consideration be given to the introduction of tax stamps on tobacco products, including the publication of a full analysis of the costs and benefits of such a course.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That followed its analysis of whether tax stamps or duty paid markings would be the appropriate way in which to go ahead with fiscal marks. The Committee was bringing attention to the fact that ``duty paid'' markings may not be as effective as tax stamps. Although the measure is not designed particularly for large-scale criminals, they would find it much easier on a large scale to counterfeit the ``duty paid'' stamp.

<P>
Concern has been expressed that the ``duty paid'' stamp will still enable a manufacturer to export cigarettes without the duty having been paid on them, but with the packs bearing the marker. The cigarettes could then be re-imported with the consignment notes designating a different product and, thus, not subject to duty and smuggled and causing the problems that we know only too well. It is thought that the ``duty paid'' marking will not be effective, which is why the Select Committee was right to talk about the Government having another look at such an approach and carrying out, in particular, a full cost-benefit analysis. Customs and Excise is concerned, as is the industry, that the costs of tax stamps would be greater, although they would take slightly longer to introduce. Indeed, some representatives of the tobacco industry have suggested that their introduction may take two or three years, as a result of which the Government rejected such an approach. They should look again at the proposal, because it may prove to be more effective in the long run.

<P>
The Government are certainly right to introduce fiscal marks. I am sure that other members of the Committee can speak more knowledgeably than I can about dates of sale. The clause would prevent forestalling, whereby tobacco manufacturers try to anticipate large increases in tobacco duty prior to the Budget. Unsold stocks on which duty has been paid are held back and are sold after the Budget at the lower duty rate, thus depriving Customs and Excise from significant revenues. That is a practice that no hon. Members wish to support. The Select Committee was against forestalling on such a scale. It dents the revenues by hundreds of millions of pounds, so it is a very extortive practice.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
What is the right way to deal with forestalling? As the right hon. Member for Wells said, the Government have other ways to tackle that problem and they are right to use them first. They are asking us to give them powers using the fiscal marks to tackle forestalling by using date stamps attached to the ``duty paid'' marks. It is right not to do that yet. If those dates were attached to the ``duty paid'' marks we could, as the right hon. Gentleman said, store up great problems for small retailers. Small businesses would be taking a huge risk. In some cases, they would be paying hundreds of thousands of pounds to stock up on cigarettes and rolling tobacco and would thus have a great deal of working capital invested in that. They could find, particularly with slow-selling brands of cigarettes and tobacco, that they are left holding stock and having to send it back to the manufacturer. Even if they were reimbursed, the logistics and costs of that working capital would be significant. It would create huge problems for small retailers and small businesses and I am incredibly worried about it.

<P>
Labour Members must realise that if the power is used to tackle forestalling, it is not the big tobacco giants that will be hit but the small businessmen, the small retail shops up and down the high streets and, indeed, the corner shops of all members of the Committee.-[Intervention.] The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) says that corner shops are on the high street, I meant to say both the corner shops and the shops on the high street. I am grateful for his sedentary correction, even if it was slightly pernickety.

<P>
The other issue is related not only to the economics of small retailers selling such products but to consumer choice. The Government are right to introduce both tax and advertising policies to try to reduce smoking. I speak as an ex-smoker having given up smoking at the millennium.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That explains the twitch.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That may be to do with something else-I cannot possibly comment. The issue is consumer choice and, while smoking is a legal activity, people should be allowed to choose what they wish to consume from a decent range of tobacco products. The types of brands that are slow selling tend to be those in the different ranges of tar contents. Cigarettes with a very low tar-the healthier cigarettes, if it is possible to have such a thing-are among the slow-selling brands. It is important to ensure that smokers have a range of choice including the less damaging cigarettes-perhaps a better way to describe them. Conservative Members are right to probe the Government on whether they need such power. Surely it would be better to look at other measures to tackle this problem and to work with the tobacco industry to stop this practice, rather than take powers that could have many unintended and damaging side-effects.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I congratulate the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) on giving up smoking. It is a pernicious habit. I gave up when I was 16 and I have never regretted that decision. As members of my family continue to smoke, perhaps I should declare an interest.

<P>
The Government must clarify the primary intention of their policy on smoking. Is the idea of ever higher taxation simply to raise more money for the Treasury or is it to dissuade people from smoking by making it so expensive that they can no longer afford it? There is a mass of evidence that smoking is addictive and price insensitive and, so the argument goes, higher rates of duty will simply lead to higher revenue. However, according to table C9 on page 203 of the Red Book, tobacco duties fell from £8.2 billion outturn in 1998-99 to £5.7 billion in 1999-2000 and, even after the measures that are being introduced this year, the revenue from tobacco in the current year is projected to be £0.8 billion less than it was two years ago. If the Government's policy is to raise the maximum amount of revenue, why has it failed so dismally? What evidence can they adduce to show that raising taxation discourages people from smoking, rather than simply encouraging them either to bring in tobacco products legitimately from other parts of the EU, or to resort to the illegitimate methods that the clause and the amendments seek to tackle?

<P>
I understand that the industry recognises that the introduction of compulsory fiscal marking will be a welcome step in the fight against smuggling. That is not disputed in the amendments. However, the industry argues that during consultation, Customs and Excise was forced to accept the threat to the competitive position of many small retailers, if a date mark was introduced. Therefore, it is surely wrong for it to have the discretion to introduce such a date mark without the matter being considered by Parliament. The Government must explain why it would be right to leave that decision to Customs and Excise when it could have such a damaging effect on high street shops.

<P>
Another apparent injustice is that the small retailers will be punished for a tax-avoiding process undertaken by the distributors of tobacco products. If the distributors can avoid paying more taxation by forestalling, why should the penalty for trying to end that practice land at the door of the small shopkeeper? The distributors may not regard the small shopkeeper as key to the distribution of the product. They might find other ways of distributing it without using the small shopkeeper, so it is no disincentive to threaten the small shopkeeper with the potential penalty of £20 million a year. The threat will not worry or disturb the importers, who will blithely carry on forestalling until such time as date mark is introduced. What have the Government done to investigate alternative fiscal frameworks that might inhibit the practice of forestalling other than resorting to the use of the date mark, which will hit the wrong target?

<P>
The two amendments proposed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells are justified because the Government have not made the case for going down this route. The issue will return to Parliament in due course if the problem of forestalling cannot be dealt with in another way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Members of the Committee will have received a letter from the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents 21,000 retailers whether on the high street, the corner or up a side alley. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton started to make an important point-but failed to finish it-about the cost to small shopkeepers of time marking as a result of forestalling. The Association of Convenience Stores carried out research in conjunction with Bournemouth university, which showed that at the end of each year, the majority of small shops are left with £200 to £300 worth of date-expired stock, which is legally unsellable. It is estimated that the cost to the tobacco retail and distribution chain could be as high as £20 million a year.

<P>
On 22 March the Government announced that they would not proceed with the sell-by date scheme to curb forestalling because they had reached agreement on alternative measures. Will the Minister tell us what they are and why, if he has reached agreement, he will not accept the amendments?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells made a wide-ranging speech, in which he attempted to re-open some of the issues that we dealt with on the Floor of the House in relation to clause 12. I shall respond to the particular issues raised about the amendments and make some more general remarks about wider issues later.

<P>
The amendments would have two effects. First, they would weaken the Government's ability to tackle forestalling tax avoidance devices. Forestalling involves tobacco manufacturers and their customers-including, contrary to what Opposition Members suggested, many small shops. All the players in the industry gain large stock profits on tobacco by removing high quantities of it-up to six months' supply-from duty-suspended storage in the run-up to a Budget and then either selling it after the Budget at post-Budget prices and pocketing the difference or selling it at the lower price to gain competitive advantages.

<P>
Society would prefer that neither of those actions took place. The Exchequer receives less revenue than expected and health policy can also be undermined. We estimate that forestalling costs the Exchequer £300 million a year. We are committed to ending the practice both by direct action as provided for in the clause and by increasing uncertainty about the scale of Budget increases each year through taking future decisions about duty on a Budget-by-Budget basis instead of through the escalator-introduced by the previous Government-that was applied in the past.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The second effect would be to hamper the ability of Customs and Excise to change the pack mark in future. As the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) said, we originally intended to tackle forestalling by introducing a sell-by date on the pack mark which would have limited its currency, so that the pack could not be sold after such and such a date. That would significantly reduce forestalling but would not limit the quantities of tobacco that could be delivered to the market to meet legitimate needs.

<P>
The proposal has cost implications for wholesalers and retailers, so we listened carefully to what they said. We were persuaded not to proceed with the sell-by date at this stage, but to reintroduce restrictions on the clearance of tobacco for home use in the run up to the Budget-the announcement to which the hon. Gentleman referred. That was done in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, restrictions of that kind fell into disuse with the coming of the single market because of anxieties about their legality. That is what enabled the large-scale forestalling to take place.

<P>
Tobacco manufacturers and importers, responding to the original announcement on pack marking with a date, have accepted that the game is up for forestalling; they have agreed to comply with restrictions if we reimpose them, and on that basis we are prepared to try them again. However, I emphasise that it is a last-chance saloon; we made it clear in discussions with the trade that if the restrictions fail, or become the subject of lengthy legal wrangling, we would want to reconsider the introduction of the sell-by date to ensure that forestalling indeed ends.

<P>
There were several references to the work on Customs and Excise of the Select Committee on the Treasury, which the right hon. Member for Wells described as Labour-controlled. When I was a member of that Committee it was certainly not a Conservative-controlled Committee and I suspect that its present members do not regard it as being Labour-controlled. The Treasury Committee produced a helpful report on Customs and Excise, which concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The proposal that tobacco products should be marked with a date, after which they cannot be sold, is intended to deal with the problem of forestalling, rather than smuggling. We see no reason why the tobacco trade should be able to benefit financially every year from a one-way bet on tobacco duty rates being raised by facilitating the sale after the Budget of tobacco products on which pre-Budget rates of duty have been charged, and, consequently, we support action to put an end to forestalling.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I imagine that that view will command wide assent in the Committee.

<P>
The amendments do not only limit our ability to deal with tax avoidance; they could also hamper our ability to act quickly to end fraud. That is another reason why it is so important for the Committee to reject the amendments. We must accept that changes to the form of the pack mark may need to be made in future, for example if counterfeiting were to become a problem. In those circumstances, Customs and Excise may need to set a date after which packs with old pack marks cannot be sold. I do not envisage such changes being necessary. I place it on the record that as long as the restrictions route that I have described ends forestalling, we will not bring into effect the provisions in the clause that allow a date to be included in the pack mark. That provision will be used only if the restrictions route is unsuccessful.

<P>
Apart from the specific issue of whether a date should be included in the mark, there is the possibility that in future, in some circumstances, we might need to change the content, form and appearance of the pack mark. We have introduced it in the way that is least burdensome to business. We have carefully assessed the risks from fraud of different kinds of marks including tax stamps, which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton mentioned.

<P>
We are satisfied that the current specification of the mark is right for the United Kingdom, but we must recognise that changes might be needed in the light of experience. Under some circumstances, Customs and Excise might need the flexibility to limit the currency of older marks. I suspect that an unintended by-product of the amendment would be to make that impossible.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Is the legislation flexible enough to enable tax stamps to be introduced as well as ``duty paid'' marks?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, it is not. We decided that we should adopt marks. We consulted extensively on the subject, and the clear conclusion was that pack marks were preferable to tax stamps. The hon. Gentleman referred to the issue earlier. Tax stamps are used in other countries mainly to collect duty, whereas in the United Kingdom our collection system from the legitimate trade is efficient.

<P>
Tax stamps could easily become a smuggled commodity and gain a black-market currency of their own. Given that the cost of a tax stamp regime would involve heavy set-up costs and around £30 million a year in recurring printing costs, we take the view that their use would not be as attractive as the use of pack marks. That view has been set out in the regulatory impact assessment. The effectiveness of fiscal marks in tackling the smuggled or diverted product is the same regardless of whether pack marks or tax stamps are adopted. I think that we have made the right choice on the issue.

<P>
I emphasise that the entire trade-manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers-and health organisations support the approach that the Chancellor announced in the Budget. There was a great deal of anxiety about the possibility that dates would be included in the pack mark. As long as our other method to deal with forestalling is successful, we shall not proceed with the introduction of dates to pack marks.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that that assurance is welcome to the industry. What is the Government's objection to making the change to a date mark subject to consideration by the House, even by regulation? Why, as I understand matters, could the commission simply introduce it without reference to Parliament?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There would need to be a resolution of the House, which would be subject to negative procedure as it would not extend the tax base, so the matter would be dealt with in the normal way.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked, as he did in the debate on clause 12 on the Floor of the House, why we have not released the Taylor report. As I explained then, the report contains operationally sensitive material so it would not be appropriate to publish it. The Chancellor wrote to the Chair of the Select Committee explaining that, for that reason, the Government would not publish the Taylor report. However, the interesting and informative document that we have published sets out fully and clearly the scale and nature of the tobacco smuggling problem. It contains a full summary of the recommendations that Martin Taylor made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): That document provides the recommendations but not the analysis. A moment ago, the Financial Secretary said that he could not publish the Taylor report because it contained operationally sensitive material. It would be a simple task to delete that sensitive material and publish the rest of the report. Will the Minister undertake to do so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, we do not intend to do so. The Taylor recommendations have been set out in the report and we have acted on them. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General has announced how we are putting into effect a range of measures that will effectively deal with smuggling. If I have the opportunity, I will say more on that subject.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Can the Minister confirm that Mr. Taylor, either in the report or in a side letter, observed the connection between duty rates and smuggling, and said that the root cause of the problem was the duty differential between ourselves and the continent? We know that he made such a comment to the Chancellor. Can the Minister confirm that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I cannot confirm that. I have the letter that the Chancellor sent to the Chairman of the Treasury Committee. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am afraid that the advice which Martin Taylor gave to me contained matters that were recognised to be operationally sensitive, the release of which, even in summary form, would give smugglers a valuable insight into Customs strategy for tackling tobacco smuggling.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, we will not publish the report.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about the effect of price on tobacco consumption. The report said that the share of the market for smuggled hand-rolling tobacco was already more than 50 per cent. in around 1995. The previous Government took no action to deal with the scale of that problem. They continued to run down Customs and Excise, and the problem continued to get worse. By contrast, we are taking the necessary steps, and our measures will be effective for the smuggling of both hand-rolling tobacco and cigarettes.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman says that the incidence of smoking is rising. The data that are published in that report include the results of the latest survey, which shows a welcome resumption of the downward trend in smoking. However, it is too early to tell whether that is the beginning of a longer downward trend, or just a blip. The right hon. Gentleman also referred to the alarming proportion of children who smoke regularly. The proportion of 11 to 15-year-olds who smoked rose steadily between the mid 1980s and the mid 1990s. However, the latest figures show a fall in that proportion.

<P>
The view of those who work on health matters is clear: increases in tobacco taxation send out the right signals about smoking. I am pleased to say that that view is shared by the shadow Secretary of State for Health. I presume that that is why the Conservative party has not proposed rates of tobacco duties different from those in the Bill. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton says that the Conservative party favours a lower rate of duty on tobacco. It may, but Conservative Members have not tabled any amendments to that effect. The Opposition are split on this and are certainly not proposing a reduction of duty in this debate.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Let me move on to some of the other points that were raised. The right hon. Member for Wells asked me what revenue benefit we identify from the introduction of pack marks. The figure for the regulatory impact assessment is £220 million. It is based on work carried out by operational researchers in Customs and Excise and has been scrutinised by the National Audit Office, which was asked to see whether it was a robust figure in its audit of the assumptions for the March 2000 Budget. It conducted the audit and said that it was satisfied.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells suggested that we were introducing excessive powers for Customs and Excise. A power to make necessary or expedient provision in regulations is not excessive. It is a common power. The previous Administration gave the commissioners a similar power in 1993 when they introduced lottery duty. Any regulations made under this power will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and may be annulled by a resolution of either House.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Minister seems to be wandering away from the rate of duty without answering the key question that I put to him. How is it that the Government have so mishandled matters that, even after all these new provisions, the revenue from tobacco duty is projected to be £0.8 billion less in the current year than two years ago? What mistakes have the Government made to lead to that significant loss in revenue?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have certainly not mishandled this. By contrast with the previous Government, we are taking the steps that are needed to tackle the problem. A large part of the reduction in take to which the hon. Gentleman referred arises from forestalling. There was large-scale forestalling in November 1998 before the pre-announced duty increase on 1 December 1998. That is why it is so important to put into effect these measures to tackle forestalling. The hon. Gentleman accused me of wandering, but I am dealing fairly systematically with the wide-ranging points that were put by the right hon. Member for Wells.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am a bit confused. We are told that a rise in the level of tobacco duty led to a loss of revenue through forestalling. The forestalling would have been because tobacco tax was being paid at the old rate, not the new higher rate. If it had been paid at the higher rate, the revenues would have been greater. The loss caused by forestalling cannot explain the drop in the level of revenue. It might explain why the revenue did not go up as fast as the Government expected, but it cannot explain the significant drop. What mistakes led to that drop of nearly £1 billion after two years, and even after the new provisions being put forward in the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I repeat that mistakes were made not by the present Government, but by the previous Government, who failed to provide the resources needed to tackle smuggling. In 1999, there were 55 per cent. fewer cigarette clearances than in 1998, and the majority of the fall was due to changes in the pattern of forestalling by manufacturers. They had cleared large quantities of tobacco in November 1998, before a pre-announced duty increase on 1 December. They had built up large supplies of duty-paid stock, so clearances through much of 1999 were especially low. There was no forestalling in November 1999, because the Chancellor had announced in March that duty increases would be aligned with the spring Budget cycle. Factors such as smuggling will have an impact, but forestalling is a significant element, which is why it is important to put in place measures to deal with it.

<P>
It has been suggested that the pack mark could be easily counterfeited. We have deliberately kept the printed fiscal mark simple for manufacturers so that they can produce it quickly, so that costs are kept at reasonable levels and so that people can readily recognise it. The fiscal mark must be printed on packs before cigarettes are put in them, which will make counterfeiting expensive and limit the number of criminals who can get involved. Customs will also have more resources for catching the large-scale smugglers. I agree with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that the measures will most effectively tackle the white van operations. People should not underestimate the resources that are needed to produce a good quality cigarette packet. A very sophisticated operation is required, so the number of people who can produce counterfeit cigarette packets is limited. They would need a major freight smuggling operation, and that is the kind of operation that we will target using the additional resources with which customs will be provided.

<P>
Just this week, a fraudster was found guilty of large-scale evasion of the duty on tobacco, and he was jailed for six years. That is a good illustration of the Government's determination to tackle this problem and of the effectiveness of the steps that we have taken.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for answering some of our questions, although I will press him further on some of mine. We have not got to the bottom of the issue of the Taylor report. The Minister is now claiming that the only reason that the report cannot be published is operational sensitivity. However, when I asked the Chancellor in a written question whether he would publish it with the relevant items removed, he replied that he would not. Operational sensitivity is not, therefore, the reason. It is interesting that the Minister did not deny that Mr. Taylor had-either in his report or in a side letter-pointed out to the Chancellor the connection between smuggling and the duty rate. I am afraid that the Government are still seeking to suppress that link.

<P>
I find it surprising that the Minister can estimate the supposed reduction in smuggling that will result from the fiscal marking scheme but cannot advance any estimate of the connection between smuggling and the duty rate. If the Government can calculate the effect of anti-smuggling measures, they must surely be able to assemble information-from experience here and overseas over the years-about the important connection between price and smuggling. Therefore we remain unsatisfied with the Government's response. We are baffled that this measure is being introduced by a Government who are introducing a Bill about public information and the right to know, especially when we are talking about such important matters of public policy.

<P>
The Minister also talked about forestalling. He was at his least convincing in debating with my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), who pointed out that forestalling may explain why revenue is not increasing as fast as the Government estimate, but cannot explain why it has reduced. The figures are startling. Between 1998-99 and 1999-2000, revenue from tobacco fell by £2.5 billion and it will not recover to its earlier levels in the current year. Even more eloquent is the fact that, when the Government produced their previous package of anti-smuggling measures, announced in the pre-Budget report in November 1999, they estimated that revenue from tobacco would rise as a result of those measures to £8.9 billion in the year 1999-2000. In fact, only £5.7 billion of revenue was received-a gap of more than £3 billion.

<P>
Given that the Government made such a spectacular mistake about the success of their earlier anti-smuggling measures, why should we believe that the present measures will be any more successful, especially when the Government are persisting with another duty increase of more than 8 per cent.? In earlier years, at least they had the sense to freeze the rate of hand-rolling tobacco. We remain sceptical.

<P>
Let me explain the key issue. We are in a single market in the European Union, with no fiscal or customs frontier between ourselves and the continent. Goods pour in. The single market was an achievement of the previous Government: we are proud of it and support it. It follows, that a policy based on buying a packet of cigarettes in France or Belgium for less than £2 and selling it in this country for more than £4 is not sustainable. It is like pretending to run a pricing policy of £2 for cigarettes in London when the same cigarettes cost more than £4 in Birmingham. It does not require great belief in the market economy to work out that some people will make a living out of transporting them from one location to another. In a single market, the revenue authorities cannot routinely stop lorries and people at the frontier: the frontier has been abolished by the rules of the single market. The Government are attempting to defy logic.

<P>
It was disappointing to hear the Minister say that it was wrong for traders to continue to sell tobacco at earlier and lower duty rates in order to keep prices low for competitive advantage. They are not seeking a competitive advantage but seeking to stay in business. Small sole traders are routinely approached to buy smuggled cigarettes at way below the legal price levels. The Minister is castigating the trade for attempting to avoid the relentless increase in duty on tobacco products. The best way to tackle the problem is to deal directly with duty rates.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has not proposed a rate of duty different from that which the Government have proposed. Is he proposing a lower rate of duty?

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> A week is a long time in politics. The Financial Secretary has already forgotten that Conservative Members voted against the rise in tobacco duties last week in Committee. Unless and until the Government publish their secret report, our objection stands. I am surprised that the Financial Secretary has forgotten, as we voted on the matter only 10 days ago.

<P>
To return to the amendments, the Financial Secretary said, encouragingly, that he did not intend to bring forward the date stamping element of the ``duty paid'' mark unless the other measures against forestalling failed. That provides some assurance, so we will not press the amendment to a Division. However, I was disappointed by the Financial Secretary's comment that one reason for introducing the date stamping element might be to repair mistakes in the regulations quickly. If the Government are contemplating introducing a scheme, which has an acknowledged compliance cost for the distributive and retail trade, simply to put right mistakes in regulations that are yet to be published and acted on by the Inland Revenue, that indicates the wrong attitude to business generally. As I said, it was slightly encouraging to hear that date stamping would not be introduced quickly for those reasons alone. Overall, however, the proposed duty rate and smuggling measures are likely to be no more successful than the earlier packages, which, as the figures show, comprehensively and completely failed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall speak briefly on the issue of the Taylor report. My right hon. Friend has eloquently described Conservative Members' demand-in which we have been joined by the Liberal Democrats-to see the report. The Financial Secretary has again told us that the reason for not revealing the report is the security element. I have written to the Tobacco Manufacturers Association to suggest that it might benefit the Committee and the nation by instituting an action for judicial review. Will the Financial Secretary and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury be able to sustain, at judicial review, the reasonableness of a decision that is clearly based on a false premise?

<P>
We are not asking for those parts of the report that show the basis on which the statistics were derived, as neither we nor the Government would want to reveal security matters to smugglers. We are only asking for those parts of the report that reveal the statistics and Mr. Taylor's observations, if any, about the possible or probable connection between the duty differential and smuggling. As the basis for the Financial Secretary's refusal clearly relates to other matters, it is, prima facie, unreasonable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I hope that my comments will help my hon. Friend. Under the previous Government, a journalist made a request to the Treasury for access to briefing received by Ministers in connection with the explanation of the Budget. An agreement was eventually reached in relation to sections headed ``Advice to Ministers'', and so-called sensitive information was taken out. Therefore, a precedent exists for edited versions of Treasury documents to be made publicly available when requested.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for those observations, which certainly enhance my knowledge of the matter. As a former Financial Secretary, he speaks with experience. There are many precedents for such action to be taken by Departments and there is a prima facie legal case to answer, because such a matter is an administrative decision. If the matter goes to the courts, it will be interesting whether an administrative decision that is based clearly on unreasonable grounds, when it relates to the release of documents, is or is not reviewable in the opinion of the judges. I believe that it will turn out that it is and that such a test will prove to be a landmark case. It may even turn the Freedom of Information Bill into something that is usable, which it certainly is not at present.

<P>
Some Conservative Members have asked specifically for information that has no relation to the sources on which the statistics may or may not be based. Can the Financial Secretary curtail the problem by doing something that will clearly meet his criteria? Will he tell us whether Mr. Taylor suggested that there was a correlation between the level of duty differential and the amount of smuggling and, if so, say whether he gave any qualitative or quantitative estimates of its size? That takes us back to arguments about wine duties and statistical measures. The hon. Gentleman has not given a reason for not answering the question that he was asked earlier; on the contrary, he has outlined a basis that would lead him to answer it and it would help us immensely if he could now respond to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): As, perhaps along with the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn), one of the most notorious smokers in the House, I felt that I should say something about the amendments. The two potential objectives of duty are to raise revenue and, in the case of cigarettes, to discourage smoking. The Financial Secretary referred to the shadow spokesperson for health, whose position and that of the Conservative party is clear in that the price mechanism is entirely acceptable where it is seen to be working to reduce smoking. However, we appreciate the trade-off between the official position and the extent to which price mechanism encourages smuggling. The Government are misguided in their policies on both marking and pricing.

<P>
There is absolutely no reason why Members of Parliament should not have sight of Martin Taylor's report with the exception of anything that is sensitive, but that is not necessary to prove the point. At present, approximately 80 per cent. of hand-rolling tobacco is smuggled and duty is not paid on one in four ordinary cigarettes. Within that one in four, roughly half are brought legally by people going to France and so on, while the other half are smuggled. We have only to visit university campuses and the shop floor to see people's reaction. It is like the Boston tea party. People are not willing to pay the duty on tobacco and regard buying cigarettes illicitly as morally justifiable. The level of duty has had that effect. Well-known historic precedents have been set. I commend members of the Committee to read Parson Woodford's diary, which was about coffee duty in the 18th century, when respectable clergymen felt morally justified in buying coffee illicitly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): There was a little confusion about the statements made by the Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen. I understood that in the enabling vote after the Budget, the Opposition did not vote against the tobacco duty changes. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that official Conservative policy is to repeal the changes in tobacco duty if the Conservatives come to office?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The position is clear. As I said, our principle is that where the price mechanism works to discourage smoking without producing an excessive increase in smuggling, it is justified. Martin Taylor's report is central to that and until we have fair sight of it and the work that has been done, it would be incorrect to support a further increase in duties. If the report shows, as I suspect that it will, a high level of correlation between the increase in smuggling and duty, that would support the argument that an appropriate level of increase has been exceeded.

<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it would be incorrect to support the measures, which implies an abstention. Is he abstaining from or opposing the measure?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wasting the Committee's time. We plainly voted against the increases, for the reasons that I and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells have set out at length.

<P>
There is an elitist, head-in-the-clouds perception among Labour Members. This country has a major problem with the smuggling of drugs, both hard and soft, which require far sterner measures than marking or extra expenditure on customs officers-measures that have had minimal impact. Cigarette smuggling will be increasingly driven into the territory of hard smuggling and taken up by the hard, unpleasant criminal elements who operate the supply of hard drugs and cannabis. The measures proposed will not reduce smuggling, but they will probably have the unfortunate side effect of making smuggling practices considerably more criminal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman has confirmed that his party would cut tobacco duty and voted against the increase. Can he explain where the Conservatives would find the money to invest in the health service that they would lose as a result?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That otiose point again wastes the Committee's time. First, we will oppose the increase in duties until we know far more about the overall position in relation to duties and smuggling. Secondly, revenues are forecast to be down £800 million on a year ago. I fail to see where the alleged hypothecation will come from. The extra £300 million in duties will not in any case exist. I suggest-cynically-that if the hon. Gentleman were so keen on hypothecating cigarette duties to the national health service, he would probably vote for a massive cut in duties, as a result of which revenues would rise substantially.

<P>
I refer the Committee to the experience of the United States during prohibition. Prohibition is a different issue to that of high rates of duty and smuggling, but the prohibition era showed that making illegal products that people want to consume or putting them at a price that people do not accept has a major corrupting effect on society. I am especially disturbed by the reaction of both my own and others' children in the campuses of our universities. The policy has, if anything, encouraged smoking as an act of rebellion against the forces of political correctness and has created an attitude that people are morally entitled to engage in smuggling when the Government overprice products. That is the undesirable reality.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I doubt whether the marking scheme will have an impact other than on forestalling, which is now being tackled differently. It will increase costs and complications and make life difficult for small traders. Regrettably, I doubt that the extra £209 million for customs officers will impact on the level of smuggling, as, indeed, the Government's Red Book figures predict.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The Opposition are blurring three separate issues-the impact of duties on the reduction of smoking; the impact of duties on the reduction of smuggling; and the impact of duties on revenue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I made clear, revenue is a separate item. Smuggling and smoking are self-evidently interrelated, in that the question is whether the price mechanism reduces the absolute level of smoking or increases it by increasing the amount of smuggling. The two are part of the same whole.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> It is certainly correct that an interrelationship exists. However, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, if the official price of a product increases, so, usually, does the unofficial price, because the smuggler will attempt to maximise his revenue by preserving only the necessary discount on the official price.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I will give way, but I should like to complete my point before hon. Members respond to it.

<P>
It is reasonable to assume that smuggling becomes worthwhile at a discount of, say 10 per cent. on the official price, so if the official price increases, the smuggler will usually attempt to benefit from that by increasing his price, too. Additional smuggling may follow, but so will a reduction in smoking, because the cost of cigarettes from either source will increase.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The hon. Gentleman forgets the supply-demand curve. Clearly, the smuggler will pitch his price to optimise his revenues. It does not follow that price increases in line with revenues. The hon. Gentleman seems to accept that such a level of duty is a wonderful encouragement to smugglers.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The point that the hon. Gentleman makes reconfirms the confusion evident in his previous remarks. He also said that a massive cut in duty would tend to lead to a big rise in revenue. I am not sure whether that was an off-the-cuff remark or whether
he was formulating Conservative policy and recommending a massive cut.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head; it was merely an off-the-cuff remark.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My comment was clear. Raise the price so long as it succeeds in a net reduction in smoking. Raising revenues is not the first objective. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton talked about revenues for the health service. I made the factual point that if he wanted to maximise the revenues to divert more money to the health service, that could be achieved by a major cut in duty that would wipe out smuggling and increase demand.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful for the clarification that Conservative policy is to increase the duty if it will result in a reduction in smoking.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I did not intend to speak again, but I want to thank the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) who, after this morning's exchanges is known throughout the country as the smuggler's friend, for answering the question that I put to the Financial Secretary. The hon. Member for Broxtowe said that as a result of increasing the tax rate on cigarettes, the amount of smuggling had increased and the number of cigarettes sold legitimately had gone down. That explains why billions of pounds of revenue that could have been used in the health service and other needy areas have been lost as a result of the Government's mismanagement. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that he agrees with the analysis of the hon. Member for Broxtowe on the matter and, in so doing, admit that it has all taken place since the beginning of 1998, which I remind him was the period throughout which his party was in government, not the Conservative party?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The mismanagement was by the previous Government, not the present Government. The reduction in the resources available to Customs and Excise enhanced the scale of the smuggling problem that we now want to resolve. The previous Government did not take the necessary steps, but we are taking them now.

<P>
We may have set a record in the debate on amendments Nos. 6 and 7 because, so far, we have heard four Opposition Front-Bench speeches on them. We have almost exhausted the potential number of such speeches.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I will not. A wide range of further issues has been raised, most of which we have dealt with. There is a persistent misunderstanding on the part of Opposition Members and I shall make a further attempt to explain matters. The vast majority of the cigarettes smuggled into the United Kingdom come here duty free from countries outside the European Union. That is the fundamental point that Opposition Members repeatedly miss. The difference between duty here and the rest of the EU has no impact on smuggling from outside the EU.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, I will not. Other EU countries with low duty rates such as Italy and Spain, which were referred to in the debate on the Floor of the House also have significant problems with smuggled tobacco.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will give way in a moment. There is not the differential between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU. That is an important point to bear in mind in all of these debates.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am intrigued by the Financial Secretary's observation about the source of smuggled products being outside the European Union. Can he say whether that was the finding of the Taylor report and whether any definitive data are available to help substantiate that fact?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We published a substantial amount of data on all aspects of this problem in the ``Tackling tobacco smuggling'' report, which I commend to members of the Committee.

<P>
I return to the Taylor report. I have explained why we do not intend to publish Martin Taylor's report. He provided personal and confidential policy advice to the Chancellor, which we have made clear will not be published. My hon. Friends reminded me that many reports to the previous Government were protected on the same grounds. It would be interesting to see several of them, such as that on the future expenditure review, which I understand was personal and confidential advice to the previous Chancellor. It was the report that led to the run-down of Customs and Excise and created the problems with which we now have to deal.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is certainly my impression that the Financial Secretary is now seriously rattled. The friendly and co-operative Financial Secretary of whom we have grown so fond has developed a new tone and a harder edge, shown in his refusing to give way to me, and possibly a slight disappointment in his Back Benchers. The intervention from the hon. Member for Broxtowe was remarkable. He admitted that the increases in duty enriched smugglers by giving them greater profits.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Before that acquires mythic status, I should point out that I merely drew attention to the inconsistency between Conservative Members' arguments on profitability for smugglers, reduction of smoking and maximising revenue. I felt that it would be useful for the Opposition to clarify what their priority was, which they helpfully did.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That may have been the hon. Gentleman's intention, but what he said will greatly encourage the smuggling fraternity. It has been reminded that Government policy gives it the opportunity to widen profit margins even further.

<P>
The Financial Secretary gave a new figure on the subject of the derivation of smuggled products. I have always understood that the smuggled tobacco is derived from inside and outside the European Union, and the trade believes that its derivation is equally spread between the two. The fact that some of it is derived from non-EU countries says something about the failure of the EU's external boundary. Such smuggled products should be intercepted when they enter the EU, and most of them do not directly arrive in this country. We also know that much of the tobacco comes from France and closely neighbouring countries, as we have witnessed in Calais.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend's remarks prompt me to reflect that there is an oddity in the argument about products coming from outside the European Union. Is it not odd that people bother to import them to some part of the EU, and then transport them all the way here? Might that not have something to do with the duty differential between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely telling point. The real profits are made in the UK. The Financial Secretary said that the vast majority of the tobacco comes from outside the European Union, which needs substantiating. I cannot find that assertion or those figures in the published report. He must know that the figures exist. The Committee needs them. If he cannot produce them immediately, it would be another embarrassing gap in the information published so far. Will the Financial Secretary correct what he said or substantiate it?

<P>
My main point concerns the workability and effectiveness of the fiscal marking scheme. The Financial Secretary has not yet answered my question, so I shall repeat it. If 10 per cent. of cigarettes smoked in this country are legitimately brought in for personal use and so will not bear the fiscal mark, how will the marking of tobacco work? How will it assist the law and order effort? My other associated point is that the sale and purchase of smuggled tobacco already shows the extent to which most of the packs bear foreign health warnings. The addition of another, fiscal mark would not do much to help the audit trail.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The figures available show that nearly half the cigarettes on which duty is not paid come into the country legally; it is not 10 per cent. but 40 per cent. of the non-duty market and that is the magnitude of the problem. The marker issue is irrelevant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Vast numbers of cigarettes circulate legitimately and legally without the famous fiscal mark. Will the hon. Gentleman explain exactly how it will help? Unless it will make a decisive contribution, why go to the additional trouble and expense of the compliance and revenue costs of introducing a scheme when its effectiveness is so seriously in doubt? Before we assent to the proposal, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will explain exactly what will be added by the fiscal marking that is not already present.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Information on smuggling from outside the European Union is published. It is, as I said earlier, in the ``Tackling Tobacco Smuggling'' report-

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Where?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will show the hon. Gentleman where in a moment. We set out the scale of the problem fully in that report and in a host of data relating to it. We are open about the scale of the problems that we face. Paragraph 21 of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A very substantial proportion of the cigarettes smuggled into the UK come from parts of the world where duty is negligible. Bringing UK tobacco duty rates closer to those of other EU states would have very little impact on those smugglers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that Conservative Members have grasped that point.

<P>
Paragraph 15 of the same report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Initially, the problem of smuggling was confined to cross-Channel smuggling of hand rolling tobacco. But more recently smuggling of cigarettes especially in freight containers has increased very rapidly. Customs estimate that now about 70 to 80 per cent. of smuggled cigarettes are transported by freight and roll-on, roll-off lorries-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the great majority from outside the European Union.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Financial Secretary accept that most of that freight will come directly from Channel ports? Something must be dragging illicit tobacco right through the European Union and into Britain.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is a substantial smuggling problem, too, in Italy and Spain, for example. Although some cigarettes come from outside the European Union and end up in the United Kingdom, others end up in countries where duty is much lower than ours. Hon. Gentlemen are therefore mistaken in what they say.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells is unclear about the benefits of having a fiscal mark. A fiscal mark clearly states that United Kingdom duty has been paid on a given packet of cigarettes; that information cannot be deduced from a foreign language health warning. In addition, it gives us the opportunity to introduce new measures which will make it an offence to sell cigarettes that do not bear the United Kingdom duty-paid stamp. The measures will be an important step forward. English language health warnings are not proof of duty payment and do not give rise to offences. The UK duty-paid mark will be plain visible proof for everybody. We are taking an important step, which will allow us to make substantial progress in dealing with smuggling. We are determined to stop the rising tide of smuggling, which started under the previous Government and was encouraged by their reductions in Customs and Excise. We want the tide to turn.

<P>
Amendment negatived.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may not have escaped the Committee's notice that I have been very tolerant-indeed, remarkably lenient, if not inordinately so-in allowing the debate to range widely and in permitting numerous repetitions. I do not intend to be so lenient on the next two groupings. I alert the Committee to the fact that I am of the opinion that the question of whether clause 14 should stand part should be put forthwith after discussion of the following amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Will you please give notice when you consider that there should be no stand part debate?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am trying to remember what I just said, because I thought that I had given such notice. Unless there is pressing cause, I will not adjust my assessment, which I have made clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 9, leave out lines 14 to 21 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) No regulation under this section shall come into force until it has been published by a notice sent by post to all persons to whom (to the best of the Commissioners' knowledge) section 8H might apply.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 9, in page 9, line 23, leave out from ``under'' to end of line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`regulations made under section 8C above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendments concern the giving of notice by Customs and Excise about the changing or withdrawal of regulations affecting the scheme. The Bill allows the commissioners to make changes by regulation or publication of a notice. The Financial Secretary confirmed that a regulation would be subject to negative resolution in Parliament. However, other changes could be made simply by notice. That concerns us and the trade, particularly because the explanatory notes do not draw a clear distinction between the two methods of making changes. The notes confirm that the details of the scheme may be specified by either method. Paragraph 43 says that the provisions will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>allow the Commissioners to respond flexibly to changing circumstances. For example, where minor adjustments to some elements of the mark are necessary, these may be simply made by Notice. More fundamental changes to the specification could be made by regulation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not a clear guide. It does not say that more fundamental changes will have to be made by regulation, and it leaves open the possibility that even more important changes could be made simply by publishing a notice. Therefore, I would like the Minister to clarify the differences and give us more guidance than that paragraph does. The amendment would abolish notice-giving as a means of making those changes, particularly as the scheme involves criminal liability. It is not right to make changes or additions, or withdraw regulations affecting criminal liability, simply by notice.

<P>
I am also advised that the issuing of VAT notices is sometimes late and not always complete. As I know from my time in the Department, such notices are extremely valuable and much appreciated by traders. However, traders sometimes receive them weeks, if not months, after the date of publication. If the date of publication is to refer to changes in the details of the fiscal mark scheme, that would be regrettable. Therefore, the Minister should at this stage explain a little more about how the notices will be published and distributed, and how traders will be aware of them.

<P>
If we do not completely abolish the notice system, I urge the Minister at least to accept amendment No. 8. It would ensure that the regulations-this suggestion is from the trade itself-only came into force when they had been sent by post to all persons to whom, to the best of the commissioners' knowledge, they might apply.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I rise to make a few brief comments in support of the amendment and what the right hon. Member for Wells has just said. The clause creates new penalties, and it is important to ensure that all those who might be affected are properly notified. The exact form that the notices will take and how widely they will be available is not clear from the regulations or the clause. From reading articles in the trade press and the national press, most retailers will probably be aware of the changes and any penalties that the Government decide to introduce by regulation. However, it is important for Ministers to realise that a minority will not have read the trade press and will not be aware of the changes and penalties, unless the process of notification is much more detailed. Therefore, amendment No. 8 is needed. It certainly probes the key point: if the Committee is to pass the clause and its penalties, we must be assured that our constituents in the retail trade will be properly informed.

<P>
The Minister may be asking us to reject the amendment on the grounds of cost or because it is unnecessary, but he has a task before him to convince all members of the Committee that his preferred process of notification will be full, comprehensive and universal. If the Minister fails to do so, we can justly question whether we can accept this part of the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I rise to support my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. What constitutes a criminal offence must be clear. If tertiary legislation can be used to turn an honest trader into a criminal because he has not realised the precise import of the notice, that is a most unjust way of proceeding. It is all very well using notices for the VAT retailers scheme, but where criminal liability is involved, it is highly likely that those facing prosecution will take the matter right the way through the courts system, arguing that it is contrary to natural justice for Customs and Excise notices to turn a legitimate practice into a criminal offence. Has the Minister thought about that?

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is another aspect in that a spurious distinction is made between the use of notices to change the regulations and the use of secondary legislation, which is still required under the Bill where tobacco products require a fiscal mark. When a fiscal mark has been introduced, the Government recognise that the matter should be subject to regulation, not just to a tertiary notice. However, it could be equally disruptive to traders for the notices to change the contents of a fiscal mark, the appearance of a fiscal mark or-on page 9, line 7-the layers of packaging that are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to carry a fiscal mark.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If a notice were to say that a fiscal mark should be on every layer of the packaging, would it not leave traders with a stock of products that failed to meet the new requirements of the notice? That would make it criminal for traders to continue selling and, if they abided by the law in that respect, they would be left with a massive stock of unsellable products and the same costs as the date mark scheme would have imposed.

<P>
The date mark element is being deferred. It remains a threat to traders, although it is at least subject to secondary legislation in the House. Every day of the week traders face the threat that Customs and Excise will produce a notice-subject to no check by Parliament-that will leave them with an unsellable stock of products. What protection for traders against that threat does the Bill provide?

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The clause creates several criminal offences. Proposed new subsection 8G creates the different offences of possession, transportation, display, sale, offer for sale, and otherwise dealing, which presumably covers purchasers. Proposed new subsection 8H provides for further offences regarding managers of premises. Proposed new subsection 8J refers to offences in connection with interfering with fiscal marks and to penalties.

<P>
Customs and Excise is a separate prosecuting authority. In the past, there has been some confusion between different prosecuting authorities in England and Wales. There is no such confusion in Scotland. Will the Financial Secretary tell the Committee about the arrangements for customs, as an independent prosecuting authority, to liaise with the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Crown Prosecution Service, so that one Department of state has some knowledge of what the other is doing?

<P>
Who in customs is the independent person who takes the decision whether to prosecute? That is an important element of customs' powers, but we know little about it. Will the Financial Secretary provide this information, in particular, about the checks and balances-if there are any-as regards the person in customs who makes the powerful decision on whether to prosecute.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 would have two effects. First, they would prevent the commissioners of Customs and Excise from specifying some technical aspects of the fiscal mark by notice. That means that any changes to the slightest detail of the pack mark specification would have to be subject to revised regulations. Secondly, they would require the commissioners to post a notice to all persons to whom they thought that the offence of suffering the use of premises for the sale of unmarked tobacco might apply.

<P>
Clause 14 distinguishes between three levels of provision, which we believe warrant different levels of parliamentary scrutiny. A high-level change, such as extending the scope of the fiscal marking scheme to cigars, for example, could be achieved only by an order approved in draft by both Houses of Parliament. Other provisions deal with less important issues in which Parliament might none the less still have a strong interest, such as when products should and should not carry the mark. Such provisions need to be contained in regulations that may be annulled by a resolution of either House.

<P>
There is then a third level, which consists of detailed, technical provisions, which it would be sensible for the commissioners to be able to make by notice. We have been careful to provide for such a course by direct delegation from the Finance Bill, rather than by permitting sub-delegation through regulations. I hope that the Committee will welcome that caution. There is a directly comparable example in schedule 1 to the Finance Act 1997-the last Finance Act before the general election. The schedule makes provision for the commissioners to give directions on all aspects of making a gaming duty return. The provision that we are implementing goes one stage further and introduces an additional protection by requiring the publication of a notice, which will add to transparency. At my request, the Committee was sent copies of the draft regulations and the notice on 3 May.

<P>
The matters that can be dealt with by notice will include the exact specification of the fiscal mark, the exact words used, the size and font of the lettering, whether the mark needs to be on the outer wrapping as well as the retail packet, the exact position of the mark on the pack and so on. Those matters will require action on the part of the half a dozen manufacturers involved and of a small number of importers-they are the people who will need to act on the information once it is published. The ability to prescribe such matters by notice will allow the commissioners to act relatively quickly-for example, in response to manufacturers' requests to accommodate marks on unusual packaging and to any counterfeiting that emerges. In such cases it will be necessary to respond quickly.

<P>
Of course it is right that changes to the specification of the mark should be the subject of proper consultation with the trade. As with many of the matters that the commissioners of Customs and Excise already look after, they will continue to discuss changes to the detail of the pack mark scheme with the trade before making them and to allow sufficient time for them to be made. It is right that that should continue to be the case, and it is in everyone's interests that it should. However, I see no reason to reserve such matters to regulations. Members of the Committee will note that we have made provision for such matters to be prescribed in regulations. That power could be used to make changes that are perceived to be sensitive or to alter the more long-lasting elements of the scheme once it has become well established. However, the power is not needed for minor matters, and the notice route will be fine.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Minister clarify what protection the trade will have against changes in notices making its current stock unsellable?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clearly, if there were to be such a change, a transitional arrangement would be required.

<P>
