<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. The arrangements for our proceedings seem to be hitting the timetable agreed between Front Benchers and we have been extremely pleased to co-operate. However, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) has notified the Minister's private office of our anxiety at our not receiving anything in writing from him regarding the procedures for ballots of grammar schools, which we are due to debate next Tuesday.
<P>
Yesterday, we received a letter from the Minister about adjudicators--I collected mine from the Members Letterboard at about 6 o'clock. We have already discussed adjudicators in the context of the school plan, but we shall discuss admission arrangements today, which also involve the adjudicator. However, the Minister's letter arrived after the deadline for submitting amendments for today's proceedings.
<P>
If we do not receive from the Minister his promised written guidelines about ballots for grammar schools by 6 o'clock today, we shall miss the deadline for tabling amendments for next Tuesday's proceedings. I seek an undertaking from him that the information will be made available on the Members Letterboard by 6 o'clock.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. However, if the Minister wishes to intervene on a point of order, he is at liberty to do so. I can tell the Committee that, since I have the last two motions on the Order Paper tonight, I am relaxed about proceedings in the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. The document to which the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) referred was written in response to a commitment given by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to the right hon. Member for Charnwood to write and clarify the role of the adjudicator.
<P>
I intend to provide members of the Committee with details of our thinking on ballots for grammar schools as they will be set out in regulations. I do not accept the need to provide the information so that amendments can be tabled, because the regulations that we are discussing cannot be subject to amendment. I shall ensure that members of the Committee have details of our ballot arrangements, so that they will be aware of them by the time we debate the matter on Tuesday morning.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. If the Minister accepts that, in order to conduct our proceedings on ballots next Tuesday, members of the Committee will need to have sight of such details, it seems strange that he is not willing to make them available by 6 o'clock today. In a point of order at our first sitting, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said that we would require such information in a timely fashion. If the Minister is still not able to supply it if it is not yet drafted I request that you suspend today's sitting, Mr. McWilliam, to allow the hon. Gentleman time to discuss the detail of the document with his officials, so that it can be made available to members of the Committee later today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The document will be circulated either tomorrow or on Monday because I am still consulting hon. Members about their local circumstances. I could have denied Conservative Members the opportunity to consult by issuing a document earlier. However, I chose to offer all Members the opportunity to discuss their constituencies' circumstances, an offer accepted by many Conservative Members. I met the right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon yesterday to discuss the circumstances affecting Ripon grammar school. It was a most instructive meeting. Indeed, when the document is published, either tomorrow or on Monday, it will incorporate one or two ideas suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. We want to hear the views of all Members, not only the members of the Committee. We seek a system of balloting that all Members of the House will find fair and just.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton asks me to suspend the Committee until that document is available. I have no power to do so, but, Madam Speaker has ruled, as have previous Speakers, that documents should be provided for Members timeously, and she deplores it not happening.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Nobody criticises the Minister for engaging in genuine consultation with Members, of whatever party, but he will be only too aware of the time scale of the Committee's proceedings, which may be less apparent to Members of the House who are not members of the Committee. I accept what the Minister said about my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, but he will be aware that he is close to a deadline and is, as a result, depriving Opposition Members.
<P>
I repeat that we have been extremely co-operative in arranging the Committee's proceedings. Our request is not unreasonable. I seek your endorsement, Mr. McWilliam. It is essential that members of the Committee, particularly Opposition Members have the information by 6 o'clock today.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have no power to require that information be published by any time whatever. I require only that amendments are tabled early enough for them to be unstarred on Tuesday morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I seek a little clarification. I am somewhat confused by the Minister's remarks. He seemed to claim that the document would outline the Government's thinking and that it would have no bearing on any amendments that we might wish to table, yet he thought that it would be impossible to produce that outline, however, broad,[Mr. Graham Brady]
without exhaustive consultation. As the Minister apparently believes that the detail in that outline is crucial, is it not essential that we should have it in order to be able to table amendments?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be using a different system of hearing from mine.
<H4><center>Clause 75</center></H4>
<H4><center>Code of Practice</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 336, in page 54, line 16, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) The Secretary of State may under subsection (1) make different provision for England and Wales (whether or not by means of separate codes of practice); and references in this section to `the code' accordingly apply to any such separate code of practice.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I briefly intrude into the Committee's deliberations? I hope that in being brief I shall not disappoint you, Mr. McWilliam, in keeping you going until the late hours.
<P>
The amendment allows the Secretaries of State for Education and Employment and for Wales to make different provision for England and Wales, which could be incorporated into a single code of practice on admissions in England and Wales or in separate codes for England and Wales.
<P>
There will be no difficulty once the assembly for Wales has been established and functions of the Secretary of State transferred to it, because clause 41 of the Government of Wales Bill expressly provides for such transferred functions to be exercisable separately by the assembly. However, as clause 75 stands, it would not be possible for separate provision to be made by the Secretary of State for Wales before the transfer of the function to the assembly. The amendment is therefore necessary to allow the Secretary of State for Wales to make separate provision before such transfer, if it appears appropriate.
<P>
Without the amendment, it will not be possible to make any provision that applies only in relation to Wales until after the assembly is established in May 1999. We do not expect the principles that apply in Wales to differ from those in England as the primary legislation is largely common, but the amendment would allow those principles to be applied specifically to Wales. We shall in due course need to determine whether a single code or separate codes are appropriate. Once the National Assembly for Wales has been established, it will be free to develop the code and to apply it in Wales as it sees fit.
<P>
The Bill provides for the draft code to be subject to Parliamentary approval. Associated clause 76 sets out the means for making and approving a code. Prior to devolution, those provisions will apply to any code issued under clause 75, whether the guidance contained applies specifically to Wales or covers England and Wales. After devolution, any code for Wales or amendments to an existing code for Wales will require the approval of the Welsh assembly under procedures that are set out in clause 43 of the Government of Wales Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 75, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 76 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 77</center></H4>
<H4><center>Parental preferences</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 369, in page 55, line 18, after "preference", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(including a preference for a school outside the area of the authority)".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 369 relates to clause 77, which allows parents to express a preference and the local education authority to co-operate in assisting them to exercise that preference. The amendment, would enable parents to express a preference for a school that is outside the local education authority area in which they reside. There is a reason for that.
<P>
There are many children with a statement of special educational need whose parents clearly have the right to express a preference on that statement about what school they believe to be appropriate for their child; certain schools would not be available in that LEA, and the most desirable school may well be some distance from it. In addition, there is the question of the Greenwich judgment. Is the Minister willing to accommodate parents' requests for a school that is outside the LEA area to be their first preference?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Pariamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> We are certainly happy to give those assurances. Nothing in the Bill prevents parents from exercising the right to express a preference for a school that is outside their local education authority area. Indeed, in later clauses, which we shall debate later this morning, we have made it easier for parents to express such a preference by requiring LEAs to publish admissions arrangements not only for their own but for other schools as well.
<P>
I also assure the hon. Minister for Tiverton and Honiton that the rights of SEN statemented children are protected by different legislation, and they will not be affected by anything that we are discussing today.
<P>
<B>Kali Montford </B>(Colne Valley): I shall be brief, but I am a little surprised. The previous Government introduced powers covering parental preference across LEA boundries, and when I was a member of a local education authority and a school governor, I exercised that power on behalf of parents. Perhaps Opposition Members feel that their legislation did not go far enough.
<P>
Nothing in clause 77 changes the situation. Moreover, clause 80(3)(b) provides for LEAs to make proper arrangements for out-of-area placements for children whose parents express that wish. I am concerned that Opposition Members have not understood the Bill properly. I am happy that parents will be able to express such a preference.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The hon. Lady should not be too surprised at the amendment. We are seeking a belt-and-braces reassurance on an issue where anything goes. Indeed, the Minister's Department will think the unthinkable, so she will not be surprised that I sought such a reassurance from her I was simply doing my duty on behalf of parents to ensure that that right is in the Bill. Given the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendement.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 371, in page 55, line 28, after "resources:" insert "or"
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 370, in page 55, line 31, leave out from "82" to end of line 38.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We now deal with a very different matter. There are philosophical differences between the Government and the official Opposition on how parental preferences are exercised hence these amendments.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (3) lists the circumstances in which the duties imposed on local education authorities in listening to parental preferences do not apply. Amendment No. 371 would insert the word "or" between subsection (3)(a), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"compliance with the preference would prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and subsection (3)(b), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if the preferred school is a foundation or voluntary aided school and compliance with the preference would be incompatible with any special arrangements under section 82".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the amendment would only insert a small word, it is important.
<P>
Subsection (3)(c) deals with circumstances in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the arrangements for admission to the preferred school"</font></ul>
<P>
are based
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on selection by reference to ability or aptitude".</font></ul>
<P>
We believe that subsection (3)(c) should be deleted. I am sure that the Minister does not agree, but no doubt we shall have an opportunity to debate such matters next week. However, it would help the Opposition to know the Government's definitions of "ability" and "aptitude", and how they define the difference in terms of LEAs responding to parental preferences.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Lady has moved amendment No. 371, because it would not allow grammar schools schools that select by high ability to leave places open if insufficient numbers of pupils achieve the scores necessary to gain entry. However, we do not want to give that option to schools that band by ability. I think that the subsection re-enacts existing legislation; there is nothing new in it.
<P>
We do not want schools to be able to leave a band empty because insufficient children do not achieve the necessary level of ability. I am sure that Opposition Members welcome that because it enhances parental choice. Places will not be left empty in schools where there is banding and, therefore, parents will be able to exercise choice and their children will have access to those schools.
<P>
We accept that grammar schools that select wholly by ability claim that the quality of education that they give is determined by the fact that their children have a certain ability. The amendment would remove their right to leave places empty if insufficient children achieve the required level of ability. Given that that would be the amendment's effect, the hon. Lady should seek to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am satisfied with the Minister's reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): Clause 77 is one of the clauses that was referred to in debates on chapter I limits on infant class sizes. During those debates, the Minister said that, when we debate clause 77, he would clarify how the appeals procedure would operate, given the limits on infant class sizes. I accept that I have only limited experience of reading Bills, but I understand that the Bill leaves the door open for an appeals procedure to determine that a child should be admitted to a school, notwithstanding that that would increase the size of the class above the limit set down by the Government. That may be incorrect, but the Government should state clearly whether they intend there to be no appeals process for parents of children in infant classes. Will the Minister clarify how that appeals procudure will operate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I intended to speak on clause stand part, but I am pleased to be invited to do so by the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May).
<P>
As members of the Committee will recall, at our first sitting we discussed the clauses that deal with the reduction of infant class sizes. I gave a commitment that I would explain in detail how the Government view the interaction between that pledge and our pledge to meet parental preference. We believe that we can fulfil the class size reduction pledge and extend parental choice beyond that offered by the previous Government. I shall explain how we intend to achieve that; the policy will not be without financial consequences, but the Government will meet them from the savings achieved by the phasing out of assisted places and from the new deal money that was announced in the Budget on 2 July last year, after which we invited applications for the second round of new deal capital money for school buildings. The guidance referred specifically to the additional accommodation and alterations to premises that may be necessary to meet the class size reduction pledge.
<P>
Subsection (3)(a) states that the duty to meet parental preference will not apply if it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) refers to that prejudice in the context of the class size reduction pledge. Hon. Members earlier expressed concern that the introduction of a class size maximum of 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds could deny parents the school of their choice. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred to the difficulties that might arise in small rural schools, which are meeting a community need, if a 31st child had to go to a school 10 miles away.
[Mr. Byers]
<P>
Over-subscription has occasionally denied parents their choice of school over the past 10 years. There have been two areas of concern in that regard: small rural schools and schools that are popular with parents because they offer high standards. In both those areas, parents have confronted pressures when trying to gain admission for their child. The Government have therefore been considering ways in which we can solve the problems of small, isolated schools and of popular schools problems that exist irrespective of the class size pledge while fulfilling that pledge. Through the regulations and the code of practice on admissions, the Government will ensure that if a 31st child cannot be accommodated within a reasonable distance of a small rural school, the local education authority will be required to provide additional resources so that both problems can be addressed: the child can attend the school and class sizes can be kept below 30. In other words, the arrival of the 31st child will ensure that an additional teacher is made available to accommodate the child. In addition, under the planning process, if that is clearly not a temporary arrangement for one year if there is a growing school-age population in the village additional capital resources may be triggered, because buildings may be required to accommodate further children from the community.
<P>
Isolated village schools that do not have another school within a reasonable distance what is a reasonable distance will initially be determined by the school concerned will ask the local education authority for resources. The local education authority will then have a duty to provide resources to ensure that the pledge is delivered by the school.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> In his latter comments, the Minister may have implicitly answered my question, which was going to be: will local authorities have a statutory duty to provide the required resources both revenue and capital? It will obviously have real implications for the rest of a local authority's budget if extra resources will not be made available to discharge that responsibility by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions by Government. The Minister referred to a duty, but will it be an absolute, statutory responsibility on the local education authority? Are you effectively saying that some of the budget will be ring-fenced because it will have to be paid out in certain circumstances? What will the Minister expect a local authority to do when it suddenly discovers in the middle of a budgetary year that it must make capital and revenue expenditure to provide such a facility, which may mean taking money away from social services, for example?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am saying nothing of the kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We debated the funding arrangements for delivery of the class size pledge a couple of weeks ago. We have decided that money will be provided by specific grant that cannot be used for any other purposes. It will be ring-fenced for delivery of the class size reduction pledge, and it will be triggered by the circumstances to which I referred.
<P>
When a local authority applies to central Government for its share of the national budget allocated to the policy, we will expect it to build a contingency provision into its application to meet the circumstances to which the hon. Lady referred, so that exceptional cases that arise outside the normal budget-making cycle can still be accommodated within the overall policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): How will the Rotherham judgment affect parental preference? That judgment made it clear that first preference is the most important criterion for the LEA to satisfy. If a school were partially selective, would parental preference for a child to attend that school overrule such partial selection?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was asking my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary whether she knew the answer to that from her personal experience. I cannot think of any infant school that is partially selective. I have deliberately been talking about the class size pledge and how we intend to implement it. I would be more than happy to debate the Rotherham judgment later, but I am not sure that it fits into this debate. I know that the Local Government Association has commissioned legal opinion on the validity of the Court of Appeal decision. That took many people by surprise. The hon. Gentleman may want to talk about the Rotherham judgment later; if I may, I will concentrate on the interaction between parental preference and the class size pledge, because I know that hon Members wish to put questions.
<P>
The Government believe that by ensuring that the teacher and the capital will be available, the circumstances and problems that might affect isolated, rural schools can be overcome. There is another issue relating to such schools 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B>  of which there are many in Altrincham. I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. As he knows, my concerns are partly for my own constituency, but we need legislation that will serve the interests of the whole country and not just the few who are lucky enough to live in Altrincham. How would the Minister define a reasonable distance? He might be creating a perverse incentive however welcome it might be for a number of communities for people to move so that their child would become a 31st child, thus securing smaller class sizes. Would he define a reasonable distance by geographical distance, travel time, or in some other way?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is not appropriate to give a definition of reasonable distance in the Bill because it will vary enormously. I know from my own experience that two miles in an urban area is not the same as two miles in a country area, which may be uphill and down dale. It will vary from place to place. The definition would be reasonable distance in the circumstances. It is far better to leave the decision to the relevant admissions authority. If the decision is reasonable, the local education authority will have to meet the financial consequences.
<P>
Most hon. Members will know that a three-mile or two-mile limit creates all sorts of difficulties. We must have enough flexibility to recognise that there will be variations and that the definition must be what is reasonable in the particular circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am delighted that the Minister has suggested a definition of reasonable distance that might benefit my constituents.
<P>
Will he confirm that it might be reasonable, in certain circumstances, to define a relatively small distance as unreasonable if the time taken to travel it was excessive, perhaps because of traffic congestion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> A range of issues might be considered. The issues might relate to safety, or to the difficulties to which the hon. Gentleman referred. In an urban area, for example, there might be an especially difficult route a dual carriageway or a motorway and that would be taken into account in determining what is reasonable or unreasonable. It is wholly appropriate that rather than try to determine such matters in Committee Room 12 of the House of Commons, we should leave them to people in Altrincham, in Devon or elsewhere. There are local circumstances, and we should be sensible enough to leave them to be determined locally.
<P>
A second important matter relates to popular schools and parental choice. It has not been raised in the context of delivering the class size pledge, but will demonstrate clearly the Government's commitment both to raising standards and to supporting schools offering a high-quality education, while supporting those schools that are popular with parents for those reasons. That applies to urban and rural schools.
<P>
All hon. Members know from their constituency experience irrespective of the reduction of class size pledge that some schools are popular and are therefore over-subscribed. At present, we have great difficulty in meeting the wishes and preferences of parents that their children attend such schools. There has been a rapid increase of appeals from parents whose child has been refused entry to the school of their choice. There are many dissatisfied parents who are unable to exercise the parental choice that they believe that they have been given.
<P>
The reality is and that is why we talk about parental preference that we have a system in which parents can express a preference. They do not have a legal right to choose the school that they want their child to attend. In that context, there are problems when a school becomes popular largely, perhaps because of the standard and quality of education that is offered.
<P>
How can we meet parents' legitimate expression of preference in those circumstances? If, coupled to that problem, we say that no five, six or seven-year old is to be in a class of more than 30, more parents will be denied the school of their choice. For those popular schools, that will often include not just the 31st child but the 37th and 38th child because many parents will want to get their child into a particular school. We want to introduce a quality element into the regulations.
<P>
Under our class size pledge, if the only place for the 31st child is in a school that is under special measures because it has been deemed by Ofsted to be failing, that would be wholly inappropriate. In those circumstances, the 31st child will trigger an additional teacher and additional capital. It would be wholly inappropriate to send a child to a special measures school; it would be unfair on the children and on their parents.
<P>
We want to go further and introduce a general quality test. If either the admissions authority or the appeal committee believes that the school to which the child will be sent because of the class size pledge does not offer a comparable quality of education the national curriculum key stages 1 and 2 tests, various Ofsted reports and the views of parents will be considered that again will trigger additional resources to provide a teacher and capital, in the longer term, if required.
<P>
<B>Sir David Madel </B>(South-West Bedfordshire): Does that mean that the Government are committed to the idea that if popular schools I am not thinking only of infant schools are over-subscribed, they will be given the necessary resources to expand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to lead me into another debate about how to use the planning process to meet parental preference and to raise standards. I believe that we can do that, but it is not a matter to discuss today. We are giving serious consideration to how to use the school planning process as a key element in our crusade to raise standards, which has never been done before. I believe that we can use the planning and organisation processes to ensure that we meet those needs. We can then respond positively to parents who want their children to go to popular schools whether they are infant schools, which we are debating this morning, junior or secondary schools.
<P>
We have to recognise that there are popular schools in isolated rural areas or elsewhere that parents want their children to attend because of high standards. We shall do that by regulation and by triggering extra resources to cover additional teachers and capital.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Will the Minister clarify a couple of points? He said that the 31st child would automatically trigger a requirement on the LEA to provide extra accommodation and an extra teacher. We are all aware that the first tranche of money that was announced last week to cover the Government's pledge to have only 30 in a class meant that various authorities put in their bids, some of which were successful while others were not. For example, the whole county of Cornwall received nothing at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): Devon did well.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It is a statement of fact. Therefore, what will be triggered when parents in Cornwall face the 31st child dilemma? What will happen if the sum that is ring-fenced by the Government is not used for the intended purpose, or if the LEA does not comply with that requirement in a timely fashion those words are pertinent because I am thinking of Victorian primary schools with no more than three classrooms, for which providing an additional one will not be easy?[Mrs. Browning]
What measures will the Government take to bring into line the LEAs that do not comply?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be interventions. If the hon. Lady wishes to speak later, I shall certainly call her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady should thank the Government for the œ1 million that we have given to Devon, which will help thousands of children in her constituency. I am concerned about North Tyneside which, like Cornwall, did not receive a penny either. That just shows how fair the allocation was.
<P>
The Government's original pledge was that no classes of five or six-year-olds would comprise more than 30 pupils. We are now bringing that pledge forward, and will start to deliver on it this September. I hope that Cornwall will be successful in September 1999. At least the parents of Cornwall can look forward to a reduction of class sizes from now on, which they were unable to do during the past 18 years when class sizes escalated ever higher under the Conservative Government.
<P>
I am confident that this will prove a popular policy unlike the imposition of the poll tax. Money will be provided by central Government, and local authorities will plan accordingly. Our officials have been meeting those from local authorities to spell out in detail how the class-size pledge can be implemented. The information that I have provided this morning will help Devon and Cornwall to plan to meet that pledge.
<P>
We have considered the issues carefully. Today's announcement will ensure that our policy on class sizes will be popular. It will make a real contribution to meeting parental choice and to allowing popular schools to meet the needs of children and their parents. It will also help to ensure a quality test for schools particulary infant schools so that quality education will match parent's preferences.
<P>
As a result of today's announcement we shall have a popular policy on class sizes and on meeting parental preferences. The key to delivering that popular policy is contained in clause 77. That is why I urge the Committee to ensure that it stands part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Dr. George Turner (North-West Norfolk):</B> It would be appropriate for the Committee to include in the Bill a minor balancing element, given what Conservative Members have said. I remind the Committee that Conservative Members would have prevented any money whatever from going to schools in the forthcoming year, because their amendments sought to constrain the Government to a tight timetable on the release of funding to pay for the pledge.
<P>
I should like to put on record the appreciation of people in Norfolk that the Government are delivering exactly what they promised. The ill intent and deception implied by Conservative Members at earlier sittings have proved to be unfounded. They might have had the decency today to withdraw their allegations about the Government funding their pledge by transferring pupils.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I wish the hon. Gentleman would listen not just to Opposition Members but to chief education officers and the leaders of local authorities. The leader of Somerset county council is on record in the past few weeks as saying that the pledge is undeliverable because the county simply does not have the money.
<P>
It is all very well for the Minister to say that extra money is coming from here and from there: the truth is that we have received letters from LEAs all over the country saying that they are having to cut their education budgets this year. They are having to make serious decisions over funding different types of provision. Cuts are being made: there is not a lot of money sloshing about out there, and hard choices over education and social services are having to be made.
<P>
What happened in last November 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am intervening, but I shall keep it brief.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady's intervention is too long. I can understand why the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) was confused. Please be brief, Mrs. Browning.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Very briefly, the chief education officer for Devon said that this provision is a gift to every lawyer in the country, because it creates so many anomalies, particularly on timeliness. LEAs will be involved in a lot of litigation from parents who cannot express their preference.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> The hon. Lady does not seem to recognise that the Government's pledge was to achieve their objective by the end of the Parliament, and the legislation is still in front of us. The Government are delivering early on their pledge and would not have been able to do so legally had the hon. Lady's earlier amendment been accepted. It would have been beyond the legal possibilities of Government 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the hon. Gentleman resume his seat. We are dealing with clause 77 stand part. We are not considering previous amendments that have been disposed of in Committee, and it is out of order to deal with them at length.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> We have had a difficult settlement in Norfolk this year, as we have had for every year that I can remember. The fact that earmarked funding will ensure progress in early years education, even in the most difficult time generally in education, will be extremely welcome in Norfolk. Some of the concerns in the county have been fuelled by the remarks of Opposition Members over the past month, who implied that we would not fund what we had promised. I would have thought that the hon. Lady would have withdrawn the aspersions that were made to that effect throughout the Committee stage.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Given the emphasis that the hon. Gentleman has put on the Government's pledge to introduce this measure by the end of this Parliament, will he explain what it will mean next year for those authorities such as Wokingham and Windsor and Maidenhead that have received no money from this extra funding? If parents continue to express a preference for their child to go to infant classes that have more than 30, it will be possible through the appeals procedure in the Bill to go beyond 30 if the school does not have the money to provide an extra teacher.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The use of the word "aspersions" is to be deplored in that it implies some dishonourable intention. If anyone had exhibited any dishonourable intentions or had alleged that any member of the Committee had dishonourable intentions, my co-Chairman or I would have ruled them out of order, so it could not possibly have happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Perhaps you will advise me, Mr. McWilliam. Clause 77 appears to me not to refer merely to key stage 1. The question I wish to raise is important in terms of 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Clause 77 certainly does not refer just to key stage 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Thank you for that ruling, Mr. McWilliam. The Minister, rather uncharacteristically, slapped me down and said that it was not appropriate to raise this issue under the clause. I deferred to his great experience and wisdom, but yours is obviously greater. I raised the issue of the Rotherham judgment because it is important. We agree with the Minister that parents should be able to express a preference for a particular school, but the Rotherham judgment made it quite clear that the first preference is the most important criterion in an admissions policy. In that case, would the fact that a school had sufficient places of first preference take precedence over those parts of the selection policy that relate to ability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue. I apologise for not dealing with the Rotherham judgment: I meant to do so, and it was an oversight. The Government are considering the legal advice that the Local Government Association has commissioned. We are also seeking our own legal advice about the Rotherham judgment and its effect. In the light of that, we shall make our own decisions about how to approach the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for that response. It means that the Bill would have to be amended if the legal advice was that the Rotherham judgment would take precedence. That would drive a coach and horses through the admission arrangements. It is important that the Committee understands that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 77 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 78</center></H4>
<H4><center>No requirement to admit children permanently excluded from two or more schools</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I beg to move amendment No. 365, in page 56, line 40, after "schools", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"within a period of three years".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 366, in page 56, leave out lines 42 to 44.
<P>
No. 368, in clause 124, page 91, line 9, leave out "(6)" and insert "(6A)".
<P>
No. 367, in clause 124, page 91, line 33, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6A) Section 78 shall not come into force until the Secretary of State has laid before the House of Commons a statement setting out the consequences of that section for the children to whom it applies.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is as well to remind ourselves of what the Secretary of State said on 11 November 1996, when a previous Education Bill was being debated. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"when we get into power next spring, many of the policies will already be in place, saving me a lot of time and trouble adding them to our first major Bill after taking office." [Official Report, 11 November 1996; Vol. 300, c.54.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was referring to the maximum period of exclusion being extended by the previous Government from 15 days to 45 days.
<P>
No Conservative Member will deny that exclusion is an important instrument in maintaining school discipline and that, in extreme cases, it protects the interests of the majority of children against the extreme actions of a single pupil. However, clause 78 shows the danger of upping the ante which the Labour party did at every stage before the election by going beyond what is fair and feasible.
<P>
It is most fortunate that we are debating the problem of excluded children, because a great deal of evidence has recently been taken by the Select Committee on Education and Employment about disaffected children, and by the Select Committee for Health about children in care. Although the data on excluded children are by no means perfect, we are beginning to learn a little more about that group of children.
<P>
Approximately 12,500 children are presently excluded from school, and a large proportion of them are children in care. About 50,000 children are in care, and evidence suggests that about 14 per cent. of them are excluded at any one time, which means that more than half excluded children are in care. They may be difficult and troublesome children, but we should remember that many of them are in care because they have been abused or neglected. They deserve every consideration before we pass a clause that automatically excludes them from school for two years following their second exclusion. Clause 78 provides that no other school will have to take them after two exclusions.
<P>
Another factor must be considered. A 1996 Ofsted report showed that Afro-Caribbean boys most excluded children are boys are six times as likely as[Mr. St. Aubyn]
white boys in the same group to be excluded. Clause 78 does not state what financial provision is to be made for the education of those children, so the Government could be called to account by the Commission for Racial Equality, which has already done some sterling work in that regard. We must look carefully at the possible effects of clause 78.
<P>
The amendments would mitigate the effects of clause 78. It seems absurd for a child who may have been excluded when he was six or seven and then again at 12 or 13 a wholly different stage in his life suddenly to find that clause 78 is applied to him because he had been the subject of two permanent exclusions from different schools. That seems an inappropriate use of the instrument. My amendment would provide that the two exclusions would have to occur within three years of each other in order for the clause to come into effect.
<P>
Furthermore, the Government must say how they propose to deal with those children it is important that they should make such a statement to the House before the clause comes into effect. Following yesterday's meeting with the Secretary of State, it is evident that there is tremendous confusion among Ministers on that issue. Before the election, the now Secretary of State was encouraging the Government to exclude children for longer and longer periods. In fact, when exclusion terms were increased from 15 days to 45 days, he took the credit and claimed that he had come up with the idea first. In the Grand Committee Room yesterday, however, he said that he wants education authorities to "think laterally" about their policies, and suggested that the costs of implementing the clause would have to be met by the schools that exclude the pupils. In other words, they will be fined for excluding a troublesome pupil.
<P>
The policy is in a complete mess. Schools would know that if they excluded a pupil, they would have to meet the costs of that exclusion for a full two years before any other school had even to consider him or her. The costs could be so prohibitive that far from the clause giving more strength to the school's disciplinary procedures, it would take away the ultimate sanction of exclusion altogether, because the school could not afford it. Moreover, a child who knows that may well become more disruptive and difficult to deal with.
<P>
As I said, the clause is a classic example of the Government's tendency to pick up ideas with catchy phrases that they think will go down well with focus groups without focusing on the effect that they may have on a group of children who, however much difficulty they cause, are among the most vulnerable in our society. It is the Minister's job to square the circle, Mr. de Gruchy said yesterday that the Secretary of State's proposals would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"punishing schools and their well-behaved pupils for the indefensible behaviour of an unruly element."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I think it is outrageous."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister must explain how the Government propose to deal with those children if they are excluded.
<P>
The evidence is that the cost of looking after permanently excluded children is more than œ10,000 a year. That includes not only the additional cost of educating them, but the costs incurred by the police, social services and the health service. The exclusion of those children has a tremendous cost. If the Government are going to insist that no school need take them back for two years, they must explain how that cost will be met.
<P>
We must also bear in mind the fact that when such children are excluded, they get very little education, despite the cost. It has been found that they typically get 10 per cent. of normal school time in the year following exclusion. No one denies that a delicate balance needs to be struck between maintaining the threat of exclusion and safeguarding the long-term interests of the pupil if that instrument of discipline has to be used. The amendment seeks both to make it clear to the Government that they have got that balance wrong and to go some way towards redressing the balance.

<P>

<B>Ms Morris:</B> I sometimes think that the hon. Gentleman suffers more than any other hon. Member from selective amnesia he seems to have no recall of what happened before 1 May last year; perhaps that date was so traumatic for him that it had that effect.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Under-Secretary seems to suffer from a different sort of amnesia; she forgets what happened on 1 May, when she took responsibility for education policy. Before 1 May, I was unfortunately not a member of the Government, or even a Member of the House. I have come to Parliament to represent my constituents and to hear what the hon. Lady intends to do about the problems we are debating.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would expect me to remind him and the Committee that the provisions of the clause are identical, to the letter, to provisions in the previous Government's Education Act 1997: many members of the Committee were also members of the Committee that considered that legislation. During those proceedings, there was unanimous, cross-party agreement that there was a problem with excluded children. The previous Government introduced a package of measures that had cross-party support measures that are just beginning to come through to local authorities and schools. That point needs to be repeated because the hon. Gentleman is saying that that cross-party agreement no longer exists. That is an important policy announcement from the Opposition. I regret it because the measures on discipline in that Act constituted a good starting point; they needed to be developed, but they dealt effectively with some of the problems that had arisen.
<P>
I should like to correct a misunderstanding: the clause does not lay down the commandment, "Thou shalt have no school place" if a child has twice been permanently excluded from school. If it did, I should be extremely worried. It says that in relevant circumstances parental preference could be denied. The previous clauses provided that parental preference should be met except in certain circumstances mainly, if class sizes and expedient use of resources would be affected. The clause states that in such circumstances a school can choose not to meet them; it can choose to admit a pupil who has been excluded two, three, four, five or six times. However, if a school deems that it is not in the interests of the child or the school to meet parental preference in such circumstances, the clause supports its right to make such a judgment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am conscious of the fact that I shall be able to respond to that later, but I point out to the Under-Secretary that the clause refers to clause 77, which sets out the Government's new regime of parental preference. It is disingenuous to suggest that excluded pupils would be allowed into schools. Over-subscribed schools would have a valid reason for refusing such pupils, and their only chance of admission would be in under-subscribed schools and the clause allows under-subscribed schools to refuse admission.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The provisions are restated to bring them into line with the new framework that we are introducing. The hon. Gentleman will find that the provisions were also introduced by the previous Government, in section 11 of the Education Act 1997. However, the hon. Gentleman is right that a difficult balancing act in regard to exclusions has to be performed although in the past two sittings, he has tried to argue the case from both points of view.
<P>
The behaviour of some children is so extreme that it prevents other children in the school from learning effectively. In those circumstances, a school must have the right to exclude. The right hon. Member for Charnwood was absolutely right to remind us of that at our previous sitting. The hon. Member for Guildford is arguing today that there are certain children, often within a group, whose life styles or circumstances mean that they are excluded more than others and that that added problem stops them achieving in school and in later life.
<P>
Getting the balancing act right is not easy. No one pretends that it is. I do not want to revisit the debate, but that is why I made it clear at our previous sitting that the Government realise that there is more work to be done. The Prime Minister's social exclusion unit is undertaking such work now and will announce proposals in the near future. It must be right that, in a case of a child who has been excluded permanently twice consider the behaviour that he or she might have exhibited to bring that about the parent loses the right to express a preference and have it met in all circumstances, other than that the class is full.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford must remember that such action does not mean that the preference cannot be met. Let us consider a school that is not full and which has in the past year already admitted a fair number of first-time excluded children, whose parents had the right to express a preference. It is difficult when several previously excluded children join a school, often in years 10 or 11 midway through the year. Under the provision, that school would have a right to say that, given the number of children it had already admitted that year, it would not be in its interest to meet the parent's preference regarding the child who had been excluded twice.
<P>
Another example concerns two children who were excluded permanently from one school at the same time for one incident. If two badly behaved children are separated, they are often not as bad. In those circumstances, the school could say that it would accept one child, but not the other, and that it is the child's right that he or she be educated at another school. We are simply giving the school the right to refuse to accede to parental preference when exclusion has taken place twice.
<P>
I have sympathy with the three-year argument and with the case of a child who had been excluded at the age of seven and again at the age of 14. It is possible that the two incidents were not related and that the child's behaviour in the interim period may have been good. The hon. Gentleman will know that the regulations under the clause have only recently come into force. We want to monitor their progress and we realise that they might have to be re-examined. In such circumstances, the school would probably accede to parental preference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> In 1992, I took more than 100 excluded children into a school. It was difficult to integrate them and some of them still write to me from gaol! Is the Under-Secretary saying that the LEA will lose its right to direct a school to take in a pupil? If a school can refuse children who have been excluded twice, how will some children ever get back into school?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, the LEA will retain that right under clause 87, which we shall discuss later. Furthermore, the school will have a right to appeal against that direction. The position will not change. It is important that nothing in the Bill removes a local authority's legal duty to provide a suitable education for children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Does the Under-Secretary agree that the so-called popular schools in fact, the GM schools and foundation schools that are full will never be directed to take excluded children, and that excluded children will be more and more focused on fewer and fewer schools? That is a massive problem not only for schools and LEAs, but for the Government in issuing their guidance.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> That is indeed a problem, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers in the Department have been reflecting on it for some weeks. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend made it clear that he wanted to offer protection to schools that, because of various circumstances, take a disproportionate number of excluded children. That is not as easy as it sounds. There is the notion of the revolving door policy if a school excludes a child, it should take in another excluded child. If the school were exceptionally popular, that could be seen as a way to jump the waiting list to enter a year group. The hon. Member for Guildford made some sensible remarks about this matter on Tuesday. We shall reflect on the matter and return to it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford might disagree, but one of the previous Government's better policies was to require local authorities to produce draft guidance. That policy had cross-party support, but it has fallen to us to enact it, and, therefore, the quality of its enaction will be far superior.
[Ms Morris]
<P>
The problem is twofold it is to do with the period immediately before the exclusion and the period immediately after it. On Tuesday, I said that the Government were considering those matters.
<P>
Under the behaviour support plans that local authorities are drafting the last date for their implementation is the end of the year they are required to prepare and review a statement detailing the arrangements made or proposed in their area for the education of children with behavioural difficulties. Those plans must include provision for pupils educated otherwise than at school for example, because of exclusion.
<P>
Under those important plans, which are just coming through to the Department for approval, local authorities will be required to do exactly what the hon. Member for Guildford suggests they must state their policy for dealing with excluded children. It will be interesting to see how this develops.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Under-Secretary will know that as children, especially boys, approach their 15th birthdays, there is a tendency for LEAs to spin out taking a decision for just a few more months, because they know that they will then no longer have a statutory responsibility for those children. Before Labour Members jump up to intervene, I should say that I made that point to the previous Government. I hope that, in assessing the plans, the Under-Secretary will take account of that age group and the gap in the exclusions system.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Morris:</B> I know about the problem that the hon. Lady refers to the weeks are passing by for one of my constituents. Such problems must be addressed, especially given that most exclusions take place in years 10 and 11.
<P>
This is an important debate because it focuses on what is a huge challenge for everyone in the education service. I hope that the hon. Member for Guildford will accept that the clause will not stop a child receiving a suitable education and, therefore, it is entirely proper that it remains unamended.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I listened carefully to the Under-Secretary. I appreciate the fact that she will carefully consider the three-year rule. We are learning more about such matters. Two Select Committees are looking at those who fall into the category of permanently excluded children. In the light of their reports, the Government should consider whether such a provision should be included in the Bill. As I said, we noted with amusement that the future Secretary of State welcomed the fact that so much was enacted under the Education Act 1996.
<P>
I did not deny the importance of keeping exclusion as an instrument of maintaining discipline in schools. I was suggesting to the Under-Secretary and her colleagues that the balance must be absolutely right. Looking at the evidence that has come forward, we do not seem to have the balance right at present. That is the purpose of the first amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In respect of the second amendment, I take on board the Under-Secretary's point about the need for LEA's to bring out these statements, but that still begs the question of how the money is to be found to pay for the cost of providing an education for the children who are in effect excluded from school. While she may say that it merely affects parental preference, no school will welcome these pupils because they will do nothing to help their standards.
<P>
Some schools will welcome them, however. There is the famous case of St. Paul's community school in Birmingham which had a tremendous record of achieving good GCSE results for its pupils, many of whom had been excluded or rejected by regular secondary schools. Birmingham city council thanked it by cutting off its small contribution to this independently funded school in the hope of destroying it. That was the Labour attitude in Birmingham to an outstanding school.
<P>
I am sure that that is not the hon. Lady's attitude. In case she is suffering from amnesia, I remind her that just 15 months ago she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Labour's crusade for excellence for everyone means zero tolerance of failure, and boys are failing in disturbing numbers."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She must now answer the following question how much resources are the Government prepared to commit to the problem of boys who are excluded from school and need that resource to equip them to re-enter the mainstream sector? At present, neither she nor her Department know the answer to that.
<P>
I flagged the question on Tuesday when I asked her to make a statement today. Although I welcome her remarks, they do not amount to such a statement. Her boss yesterday sewed complete confusion when he said that the additional costs that the clause would impose would have to be met by the second school to exclude the child. That has roused the ire of the teaching unions and puzzled us all.
<P>
It is essential that the Government get their act together so that people understand how they propose in practice, not just through statements of intent by local authorities, to fund the obligations they are creating in the clause. The debate has been illuminating and I see no purpose in forcing the matter to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I shall be brief. I had intended to raise one point which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Guildford. When the Secretary of State came before a joint Committee of the Health and Education Select Committees, during his helpful responses to our questions he mentioned the possibility of the second excluding school having some financial responsibility for the continuing education of the excluded child. The Secretary of State's comment was interesting, but it will not please the hon. Member for Guildford to know that I floated that suggestion two years ago. The idea has some merit. The Under-Secretary must respond to our debate on the clause so that we can hear, in more detail than we heard from the Secretary of State, about the Government's thinking on that proposal.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> As the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said this morning, it is about thinking the unthinkable, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was demonstrating in the Select Committee how committed the Government are to tackling the problem. It goes beyond what we have said and thought about already. The suggestion that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said that he put forward a couple of years ago is one of the issues that the social exclusion unit will be considering. That is the context in which the Government will announce any further relevant policies.
<P>
The Secretary of State was right to point out that some disincentives to exclude need to be built into the system. At the moment, sadly, some incentives to exclude remain and we have not yet achieved the right balance.
<P>
Clause 78 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 79</center></H4>
<H4><center>Admission authorities and admission arrangement</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 57, line 18, after "community", insert ", foundation".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 113, in page 57, line 23, leave out "foundation or".
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We are back to admission arrangement. The amendments would provide a sensible way forward and I hope that the Government will accept them. The whole Committee would accept that admissions arrangements represent the single most important decision facing parents when their children move to key stage 1, into key stage 3 and beyond. That is why the admission arrangements must be right.
<P>
The first responsibility should be to children and their parents, so the admissions arrangements must be simple, clear, fair and open. If the Under-Secretary came to Harrogate and Knaresborough she would find that all those tests have been met. We have very good schools there; there is no problem over admissions. Wherever pupils are ultimately placed on preference or on second choice few parents have cause for regret.
<P>
It is different in Wandsworth, where many parents have enormous problems. Must children have to face three sets of tests to obtain entry into the various types of school there? You have children on the same campus as a high school being denied access to that school and others in the authority 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not have any children at school. Mine are all grown up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, I get excited at these times.
<P>
We accept that admissions arrangements are important. We also accept that voluntary-aided schools should have their own admissions arrangments. Churches have played a historic part in our education system and they partly fund it. It is right and proper for them to be involved with their own admissions policies, particularly since they recruit from areas broader than a single LEA.
<P>
We also support the view that the LEA should be able to delegate to individual schools responsibility for admissions, and should allow any school that satisfied its criteria to be its own admissions authority. Again, we view that as right and proper. However, giving foundation schools that right, without giving it to other schools, is wholly improper, unfair and overcomplicated. Why should foundation schools be given admission rights not granted to other county schools? The purpose of the amendments is to remove that right, to put foundation schools in exactly the same position as community schools, and to say to foundation schools and community schools, "You can negotiate with the LEA about admission rights if you want to."
<P>
We reluctantly accept that some schools will select. Grammar schools, for instance which the Government are determined to preserve, despite having made promises to get rid of them before the election select, but at least that is open. People know where they stand; they know that there is a test of ability, or whatever the pretext, to enter a grammar school. We also know that partial selection will continue in some schools that is also relatively open, although I cannot believe that the Government can justify the criteria for partial selection, any more than could the previous Government.
<P>
However, many GM schools, which will become foundation schools, practice and under the Bill will increasingly practice what I call incremental selection. That is where a school gradually excludes those children who come from problematic or unsupportive families, children who have difficulties whether learning or behavioural difficulties and thereby introduces selection by the back door. That is what will happen if LEAs are not allowed overall control of selection policy.
<P>
We recognise that a governing body can disregard the admissions policy of the LEA, but only if it can convince the school organisation committee or the adjudicator that the LEA has acted wrongly or irresponsibly. The basis of the amendments is simple to give all schools the right to have admissions policies, but not to give foundation schools a selective right to pursue a different policy outside a national system of education.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> This pernicious little duo I refer not to the Liberal Democrat Members but to amendments Nos. 112 and 113 are the final throes of a party that was determined from the moment that grant-maintained schools were introduced 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I encourage all members of the Committee to ensure that they use the word "pernicious" in the same way as the hon. Lady to describe amendments, not other members of the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I take your point, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
From the word go, the Liberal Democrats have sought the demise of grant-maintained schools 
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Notwithstanding articles in The Bath Chronicle.
<P>
When the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough apologised to the Committee for his excitement in moving the amendment, I was reminded of someone who, having slaughtered a creature, takes a stake and runs it through its heart. The amendments are the piercing of the heart.
<P>
It must be with a sense of great disappointment that the Liberal Democrats find that the Government will allow foundation school status under the Bill. They now want to ensure that foundation schools do not have independence and a say in admission policy, and that the LEA controls them.
<P>
I totally deny the allegation made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that foundation schools will not accept children with learning difficulties. We all know of grant-maintained schools that do a superb job. Indeed, the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Bath have this morning drawn the Committee's attention to the fact that grammar schools and grant-maintained schools provide the high standards, excellence and quality that the new Government seek. When the hon. Gentlemen recognise excellence, what do they want to do? They want to take away the mechanisms by which such schools have grown and flourished under the policies of the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am in full flow, but I am willing to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I am extremely reluctant to interrupt the hon. Lady in mid flow. She seems to be giving The Bath Chronicle the same sort of iconoclastical significant that was once given to the Bath Oliver. Why does she assume that all Labour Members share the view that elements of best practice were seen only in grant-maintained schools during the previous Administration? We have persistently made it clear as has my hon. Friend the Minister that we value best practice, wherever we see it.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am delighted to hear that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will excuse me, but in my experience as a Member of Parliament I express some personal emotion in this whenever grant-maintained schools were proposed, the Liberal Democrats, in particular, organised the lobbies to see them off. The amendment surely represents the last throes of the Liberal Democrats attempts to put their stamp on excellence, which is well established with a good track record. They want to try to water down even further the way in which the Government have changed the standing of grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> This is definitely not the last throes of Liberal Democrat amendments. I remind the hon. Lady about Report stage and Third Reading. The Bill will then proceed all the way through the Lords and will no doubt come back to the House of Commons. The hon. Lady will see that we shall continue to oppose foundation schools as vigorously as we opposed grant-maintained schools, which I am delighted she noticed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I caution members of the Committee. Although the hon. Lady may quote from "Bram Stoker" if she likes, she should not start on "Lady Chatterley's Lover".
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I look to you for guidance, Mr. McWilliam. I was not aware that we could quote from certain publications but not others. I recall that in my youth, "Lady Chatterley's Lover" was not a book deemed suitable for reading, but I am now 51 and it is for sale in W.H. Smith, so I seek your guidance, Mr. McWilliam as to whether it is a suitable publication.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I read it at the time and could not see what was wrong with it, but there are some bits of unparliamentary language in it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We have much in common, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> You both have a gardener!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I should like to expand on the subject, but I suspect you will rule me out of order. Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
We strongly oppose the two amendments. The hon. Member for Bath said that he will pursue his crusade, so the blood is on his hands and it will not wash away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> With some reluctance, I shall respond to the debate and amendments No. 112 and 113. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough discussed the importance of an admissions policy. We recognise that we must get the new framework for admissions right. If there are unfair admissions, it can seriously disadvantage schools in their efforts to raise standards and offer a quality education to the children who attend those schools. The hon. Gentleman said that an admissions policy must be clear, simple, fair and open. We endorse that and our interim guidance will reflect those principles of fairness, openness and transparency, which are important.
<P>
Within the admissions framework that will be established, we have no problem in giving foundation schools the authority to take control of admissions. They will not be free agents or have total discretion; they will have to operate within the code of practice, whose objective is to establish a framework within which all schools will operate. The present arrangements are not fair. Some schools grant-maintained schools and others take advantage of that and only admit pupils who will put the school in the best possible light. We want an admissions policy enabling all schools to be part of our effort to raise standards.
<P>
The code of practice will allow us to do that. It is appropriate that foundation schools should be their own admissions authority, which is why we shall ask the Committee to resist amendments Nos. 112 and 113. However, that does not mean that we should simply endorse the status quo. Things will change as a result of the measures in the Bill, the statutory code of practice and the appointment of an adjudicator who will determine disputes between various admissions authorities.
<P>
Given the nature of the debate, it is worth pointing out, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) did, that there is good practice in grant-maintained schools. Indeed, there is good practice in many schools. We must not be dogmatic and say that one category of school is better than another in terms of the quality and standard of education that it offers. Many schools offer good quality education and we need to learn from their success.
<P>
The new framework for admissions and for schools is based on fair admissions and fair funding. The foundation category will play an important role and it is appropriate that foundation schools should be their own admissions authority. I hope that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will withdraw his amendments. If not, I shall ask the Committee to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I shall not withdraw the amendments, but will invite the Committee to vote for them. They cover an important issue and despite what the Minister said, the measure is a sop to GM schools. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton was beside herself with purple rage and proved exactly the case we were making. She wants the back-door selection rights that many GM schools, which will become foundation schools, have adopted, to be protected. The Minister rightly said that he abhorred such practices and wanted to get rid of them. It is grossly unfair for certain schools to exclude children, often from their own neighbourhood, simply because of the school's status and its selection and admissions policy.
<P>
We fundamentally disagree with the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends about that. The Minister says that he wants foundation schools to be free agents, but why should that not apply to all schools? How can it be argued that foundation schools are fit to be free agents but others the community schools are not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If there is an agreement between the LEA and a community school, it can become its own admissions authority. That provision exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Why, therefore, do we need to have a separate category of admissions policy for foundation schools? I acknowledged in my opening remarks that, with the agreement with the LEA, you can develop your own admissions policy. We have no problem with that, but it should be extended to all schools on an equal footing. When you go home tonight, you will reflect on that and will feel that you have been extremely unfair and unjust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If that really is the case, why has not the hon. Gentleman tabled an amendment to achieve that objective?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee will be relieved to know that I am not developing, and have no intention of developing an admissions policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not know, Mr. McWilliam; after your exchange with the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton and your knowledge of certain pieces of literature, it might be a very interesting admissions policy.
<P>
If we knew what the code of practice was going to say in detail, we would be able to address the question more fairly. The code of practice would give us the sort of answers that we require. But we do not have that detail. The Minister's response was unconvincing. We therefore ask the Committee to vote for the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having had a Scottish education, and having been forced to read Sir Walter Scott as part of English literature, the works of D.H. Lawrence came as a blessing.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 372, in page 57, line 28, after "shall," insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not less than three months".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would put in the Bill a time scale determining admission arrangements. It would introduce the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not less than three months".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The determination of policy for the following school year would therefore be announced three months before the beginning of each school year. As the school year begins in September, that would make it in June, and before the end of the summer term, which seems reasonable. If it is left until later, one difficulty would be that the information would not be available until the long summer holiday. For the parents, and from the school's point of view, that would not be ideal. Many Members of Parliament will have taken up admission cases on behalf of parents. If the policy is still being determined locally, it will be difficult for parents to seek factual information about it. I therefore ask the Government to consider introducing a time scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I welcome the principle that underpins the amendment, which would give adequate time for parents to discover a school's admissions policy. Although it is not in the Bill, the guidance that we shall issue to admissions authorities will include a clear statement on a timetable. We shall require that the policy is determined by March. That will provide slightly more than three months. I hope that that meets the hon. Lady's genuine concerns.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am delighted by that response. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 57, line 30, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) When determining the admission arrangements for a maintained school, the admission authority shall give precedence to pupils seeking admission who live within the area of the local education authority.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This, for us, is an important issue. The amendment relates to the Greenwich judgment and seeks to overturn the implications of that judgment.
<P>
I want to begin my remarks by referring to a press release issued on 8 January 1997 by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when he was the Opposition shadow Secretary of State. He was concerned then as I hope that we all are about the large number of parents who were involved in appeals procedures because they had failed to get the school of their first choice. At that time, the Secretary of State stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"over 54,000 parents chose to put themselves through the stress and trauma of the appeals process."
<P>
He acknowledged that there would be many others who had simply accepted that their child must go to a school that they did not choose.
<P>
In opposition, the present Secretary of State was rightly concerned about the large number of parents who were not able to have the school of their first choice. He has now become a member of the Government. On 15 October he issued another press release, which stated that the number of parents applying for appeals against admission decisions had rocketed to 62,900. It is interesting if you start to break down that number and consider where those appeals come from 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have not started to break down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If one were to analyse the number, Mr. McWilliam, one would find that a vast proportion of such appeals take place in London and in other large conurbations. Those are the very areas in which the impact of the Greenwich judgment is most marked. Based on an answer from the Secretary of State to my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), we know that in a large number of local education authorities 17 per cent. or more of the pupils come from outside the LEA boundary. They include the City of London not surprisingly and Camden, Greenwich, Hammersmith, Islington, Kensington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark, Wandsworth, Westminster, Barnet, Hounslow, Kingston, Merton, Richmond and Sutton. Those are all London LEAs. There are a few outside London Solihull, to name but one where a high proportion of pupils come into the LEA from outside its area.
<P>
The highest number of appeals against the refusal of first choice places occurs in London. That is also where a large number of pupils move cross-boundary into particular local education authorities. The connection between those two facts is important. Members of the Committee who wish to reduce the number of appeals could do so by supporting the amendment. That would help to overturn the effects of the Greenwich judgment.
<P>
In 1989, the Court of Appeal, in a judicial review, decided that the interpretation that local education authorities and the Department of Education had placed on section 6 of the 1980 Education Act concerning admission arrangements was unlawful. The court held that local education authorities must treat all applications for places at a school or a group of schools using the same criteria. Prior to that judgment known as the Greenwich judgment local education authorities and the Department itself had interpreted the Education Act 1980 as allowing for priority to be given to pupils who were resident within the local education authority area.
<P>
I do not claim that the Greenwich judgment created problems for all local education authorities. As I said, the worst affected ones tend to be relatively small boroughs in large conurbations, not least those boroughs where either its own or a neighbouring authority maintains a selective education system. One immediate impact of the Greenwich judgment in such areas although it is a minor problem in comparison with others to which I intend to refer is that boroughs, particularly those where there is selection, are required to open their selection procedures to any child whose parents may wish him or her to be considered for a place in that selective school, regardless of where they live. Clearly, that creates a problem for that local education authority's selection arrangements, as well resulting in an extra cost for the authority.
<P>
There is, however, a much more important effect. More people applying to go through the selection procedures many of whom come from outside the area effectively drives up the pass mark for the examination. That means that a particular selective school takes a smaller and smaller cohort of the very ablest children from the other comprehensive schools in an area, with knock-on effects. In addition, parents living within the local education authority who had reasonably hoped that their son or daughter might go to their local selective school find that that is no longer possible. They must then find alternative provision, which puts additional pressures on the authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that problem would be solved equally by guaranteeing funding either to increase the size of selective schools or to allow more schools to be built in those areas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I agree that that would be one solution. In fact, it has effectively begun to happen in many boroughs, but I shall argue that it is not an effective use of public funds.
<P>
An example of the impact about which I was talking can be seen in the royal borough of Kingston upon Thames, which has a partly selective educational system and two grammer schools. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that in September, at the beginning of this academic year, the entrance year of Tiffin boys school was made up of 69 pupils from within the borough and 80 from outside. In the case of Tiffin girls, only 55 incoming pupils came from Kingston, whereas 70 came from outside. Clearly, many parents in Kingston would have been disappointed because they were unable to get their children into what they saw as their local school.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I understand some of the problems to which the hon. Gentleman draws attention there are difficulties involved in selection but does he recognise that parents are mainly concerned about the standard of education and the distance of a school from where they live? They tend to be least concerned regrettable though it may be to those who run local authorities about where local authority boundaries run. His amendment would make an administrative process determine what the law should be rather than what parents should be enabled to achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has had long and distinguished experience within a local education authority. He will know only too well that the implication of the Greenwich judgment is that any boundary can be drawn as part of admissions procedure apart from the local education authority boundary itself that is the bizarre effect of the Greenwich judgment.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) is right; parents are looking for schools of high quality. That reinforces the importance of local authorities having the right conferred on them by the Government in this Bill to drive up standards and to use their powers at local level through taxation, for example, to do just that. Improvements can sometimes be denied to the very people who have paid for the improvements to take place.
<P>
I shall deal with the point in more detail later, but I am delighted that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk is with me so far. I suggest to him and other members of the Committee that many practical difficulties would be created for local education authorities if the amendment were not accepted. It would be difficult for LEAs to plan for the number of places that they must provide. In the past, as the hon. Gentleman will know, LEAs knew within reason the maximum extent of the demand for places in their schools with reference to the total population for which they were responsible.
<P>
In the past, LEAs had the power to educate pupils resident in other areas, but it was their specific duty to secure sufficiency only for the resident population. Their duty to secure sufficiency did not extend to individuals outside their areas. However, the effect of the Greenwich judgment has been to extend that notional duty to unquantifiable number of additional out-borough pupils. That creates huge volatility and pressure on the overall supply of places in a particular area and makes it difficult for an LEA to anticipate, fund or control the arrangements for school places. That applies not only to my selective examples, but to others, too.
<P>
There will be increasing pressure on public spending. In London there are 33 LEAs with complex patterns of cross-border pupils. Even the Funding Agency for Schools has admitted that in the past LEAs were very good at planning for the number of places that they needed to meet their resident populations [Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman seems to have lost the attention of some members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If hon. Members are not interested in an important issue, that is for them to decide. I believe that the issue is vital. I am arguing that because of the complexities of the Greenwich judgment, the potential is there for public funds to be used inefficiently.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, he continues to put administration first. In my experience, only a modest expenditure may be involved I would understand his argument better if the expenditure were extreme. If the objective is to give parents access to the quality of education that is sought by the Government, the administrative difficulties of LEAs and, indeed, their costs should be faced. Education should not be delivered on a shoestring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that education should not be funded on a shoestring. However, I do not agree that he can ignore the issue of cost to local authorities. Huge costs to local authorities are involved as a result of the impact of the Greenwich judgment. For example, in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames the capital costs of the inflow of additional pupils 42 per cent. of its pupils come from outside the borough are œ2.84 million in temporary accommodation. It has had to extend two existing schools and improve specialist accommodation at a cost of œ6.5 million. It has had to build a new secondary school at a cost of œ10.5 million. There are huge administrative and revenue costs to the local authority. Based just on the differentials of the SSA and splitting the difference, Hounslow pupils cost it nearly œ500,000 and Wandsworth pupils well over that sum.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is just one local education authority. If the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk looks at the percentage of out-county pupils in some local authorities, particularly in London, and their cost implications, he cannot say that cost is not an important factor. Nor can he say that the complexity of the admissions arrangements is not important. They are important issues, too, as is parental choice. The hon. Gentleman will remember that I began by noting that the number of parents who do not get their first choice has rocketed, especially in London where the impact of the Greenwich judgment is now being felt most strongly.
[Mr. Foster]
<P>
There is a real difficulty for local authorities in trying to plan their provision. Some authorities, acting perfectly prudently, are planning for increased numbers of pupils, yet at the same time there is an increased number of surplus places. As a result of the Greenwich judgment, more places are being built than are necessary overall. That is a waste of public money. In the capital arrangements that are in place for education there are two priorities basic need and money for getting rid of surplus places. It is ludicrous to have basic needs provision being built when it is not needed overall, and to spend money on trying to get rid of surplus places when those surplus places were not needed in the first place.
<P>
Another issue, which I hope the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk in particular will consider important, is local accountability. The Prime Minister recently issued a consultative document about the future of local democracy. It was a very exciting document. It demonstrated that he believes that there is an important role for local government in this country. I welcome that and many of the ideas contained in it. If the amendment is not passed those hon. Members who oppose it will not be supporting the importance of local government.
<P>
Local education authorities exist to exercise certain functions and duties in respect of the population from which they are elected and to which they are held accountable. The local authority has powers to raise taxation and has to make decisions about the extent and quality of local services. It is perfectly legitimate for a local council, a democratically elected body, to trade off higher or lower taxes against higher or lower levels of services. Local residents benefit or suffer as a result and can influence those decisions at the ballot box.
<P>
As a result of the Greenwich judgment, some individuals enjoy the benefits of living in a low-taxing area, but can send their children to a school in a generously funded authority, at times to the exclusion of local residents who paid for those higher levels of provision. That seriously undermines an important constitutional provision. It is fundamentally unjust and it has not, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, given parental satisfaction. All the evidence points to the fact that it has led to increasing dissatisfaction. I therefore hope that members of the Committee will accept an amendment that is fundamentally important in regard to the effective use of funds, the democratic principle and the planning of education as a locally delivered service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I oppose what I regard as a dangerous amendment that would do enormous harm to our education system. The Liberal Democrats made a point that demonstrates the whole of their philosophy if one can call it that of confusing choice and the ramifications of choice with questions of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The hon. Member for Bath said that the fact that the number of appeals has increased since parents were given more choice seems to show that they are less satisfied. I find that an astonishing leap of logic, which implies that if parents were denied all choice and right to appeal, there would be no appeals and therefore no dissatisfaction. On the contrary, if you give parents choice, rights to appeal and opportunities to consider schools in neighbouring boroughs, their chances of satisfaction increase. Removing choice, as the amendment would do, would be grossly unsatisfactory.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to urban boroughs, where you sometimes have a sharp distinction between the quality of schools. The amendment would remove choice and opportunities from people who have the misfortune to live in local authorities that are failing them. While I agree with him about local authorities' obligations, it is wrong to limit parents' choices if those duties are not fulfilled.
<P>
I am confident that the Government will resist the amendment. Prominent members of the Government take advantage of the Greenwich judgment; I strongly endorse their right to do so. The fact that the Prime Minister took advantage of it to send his child to a grant-maintained school demonstrates that he recognises the merits of such schools and of choice. The decision of the Secretary of State for Social Security to send her children to a grammar school further demonstrates that recognition. I hope that Ministers will follow that example in our sittings next week and recognise that choice should be more widely available.
<P>
In conclusion, I return to the critical point that I made in an intervention on the hon. Member for Bath you can go in two directions, removing choice and opportunity 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has said "you" so often that it constitutes a whole flock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam; I crave your indulgence on the ground that I have resisted the temptation to make classical or literary allusions.
<P>
One can reduce choice as a means of eliminating discrepancies such as the financial discrepancies to which the hon. Member for Bath referred between local authorities. The other, in my view infinitely preferable, option is to encourage all local authorities to have the same standard of provision the provision that parents want. Such provision often involves the kind of selective education to which the hon. Member for Bath referred. As he said, the fact that parents often choose to send their children to selective schools causes what he regards as problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I wish to make a small but vital point. The hon. Gentleman says that all parents want selective education. Can he give me details of any evidence that shows that parents want to send their children to secondary modern schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am not saying that all parents want selective education. I have no idea whether there are studies that support choice in favour of secondary modern schools, but I can refer to such schools in my constituency, which are excellent 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I caution the hon. Gentleman; the amendment deals with local authority education, not selective education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam; I was merely responding to the intervention.
<P>
My point was that if all local authorities offered the same standard of education, the discrepancies and distortions to which the hon. Member for Bath referred would not arise. The amendment is poor; it would damage education and I shall oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West has outlined clearly who we oppose the amendment. The Government have said that they will not overturn the Greenwich judgment, which we support, but reference is made in the technical consultation paper that was issued in support of the Bill to closer co-operation between admission authorities. It contained a proposal to introduce a forum that would discuss cross-boundary issues. I notice that that is not in the Bill. Will the Minister say whether he still regards that line of communication as important and explain how it will be structured?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> on the hon. Lady's final point, we have not yet published the code of practice. However, it will include measures to allow the establishment of the inter-authority forums to which she referred, so that there can be greater cross-border co-operation on admission than there is at present.
<P>
Even if we were to concede the principle of the Greenwich judgment and recognise that it caused the range of problems referred to by the hon. Member for Bath, the amendment would cause difficulties because of how it is worded. It would not give an admissions authority the discretion to take into account people within their local education authority areas, because it states that the admissions authority "shall give precedence". That may cause difficulties in some areas. In many parts of the country, there is good cross-border co-operation, which has worked well for many years. We are concerned about the detail of the amendment, but my approach and that of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary throughout these proceedings has been not to argue against amendments for technical reasons, but to deal with their principles, which makes debates more interesting and sensible.
<P>
Part of the speech of the hon. Member for Bath related to problems arising from the Greenwich judgment, but a large section of it had nothing to do with Greenwich, but concentrated on other issues. The nature of the selective system to which the hon. Gentleman referred is bound to lead to parental disappointment, because the schools select under a selective system and parents are not allowed to express a preference. That is why so many parents in Bromley and Greenwich are disappointed. It is not because they are allowed to cross over boundaries, but because of the nature of the selective system. It is important to make a distinction between the two.
<P>
As for the position in Richmond, it is always open to a school to declare itself to be full and then to say, "As we apply our over-subscription criteria, we will have to comply with the Greenwich judgment." The number of children that are accepted can be capped. Those schools that introduced temporary classrooms did so because they had chosen to take in additional pupils. That was the school's decision. Through its normal standard admissions number, the school can determine the total number of children who attend the school. Such schools chose to take in more pupils; it was nothing to do with the Greenwich judgment.
<P>
It is important that we isolate the impact of the Greenwich judgment. There is no doubt that there is an issue in London; it came about because the inner-London education authority situated schools accordingly. That had nothing to do with the boundaries of the individual London boroughs. When the ILEA was abolished, the artificial admissions boundaries were imposed to which my hon. Friend the Member of North-West Norfolk referred. A school can be on the border of, say, Camden, but really serving children who live in Islington. It was never set up to serve the children of Camden; it was established to serve the children of that northern part of London. The Greenwich judgment, which was reached two years after the abolition of ILEA, is wholly approprite in the context of what happened because it reflects the fact that schools serve particular communities. That is what the Greenwich judgment does.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If we were to reverse the judgment so that parents from outside an LEA could not make an application and would be discriminated against, the number of disappointed parents reference has been made to 62,000 would escalate enormously. The way to satisfy parental demand is not to deny choice to tens of thousands of parents in London, which is what reversing the Greenwich judgment would do. The matter must be tackled in different ways.
<P>
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. It would be wholly inappropriate to use administrative means to achieve the objective. We must tackle parental choice through the planning mechanism and through the removal of surplus places to allow popular schools to grow and meet demand. To use administrative devices, which is what the reversal of the Greenwich judgment would involve, would not satisfy parents' legitimate demands.
<P>
For those reasons, the Government will continue along the lines of the Greenwich judgment and allow parents, wherever they live, to choose the schools that they think appropriate for their children, irrespective of local authority boundaries. Therefore, I invite the Committee to resist the amendment.

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I entirely accept the Minister's point about the amendment's technicalities. I know that the Committee wishes to make rapid progress, but we shall return to this important matter of principle in later debates. Although I do not want to suggest that I shall not press the matter as vigorously as possible during later debates, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 349.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> These amendments will ensure that admission numbers will be part of the consultation process. Without the amendments, such matters would be excluded from the consultation process. It is important that they are included, which is why the amendments are necessary.

Amendment agreed to.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 351.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> These technical amendments will provide the opportunity to disclose further information that is appropriate in the circumstances for example, the current and proposed standard number, the date of commencement and the names of the schools. The amendments do no more than that, and I hope that the Committee will agree to them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I ask the Minister to consider allowing head teachers of relevant schools to attend appeals panels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We are not convinced of the argument for the amendment. As the decision is for the governing body, so it is the governing body which needs to be represented. Obviously, in most cases the head teacher will be a member of the governing body and may well be its representative, but the decision is for the governing body, not just the head teacher, so it is appropriate to restrict the membership to the governing body.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am disappointed, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
