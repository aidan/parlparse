<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000367"></a>The

Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> I welcome

you back to the Chair, Sir John. We had a long debate this morning on a

number of the clauses relating to schedule 4, and I was just coming to

the end of my remarks. I had referred to all five

amendments&#151; 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 256</div>amendments Nos. 40, 42, 53, 55 and 41&#151;and I

was answering a final question from the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet

(Mrs. Villiers) on transfer pricing. I concluded by saying that we did

not think that there was anything novel in the situation for transfer

pricing that will face the film industry. It will be no different from

the normal way in which transfer pricing rules apply. The normal rules

will apply and although that may be uncomfortable for those who

attempted to use them for tax avoidance reasons, we do not think that

there will be a problem to trouble any genuine film makers. On that

basis, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<a name="060518137000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060518137000368"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Theresa Villiers</b> (Chipping Barnet) (Con): I welcome a

number of points in the Economic Secretary&#146;s response to the

debate. I welcome his clear indication that development costs for films

that never go into production could be deducted according to ordinary

tax law principles. Even if he is not prepared to accept my amendment,

which suggests that they should receive the enhanced deduction, it is

welcome that they have not accidentally been excluded from the ordinary

regime.</div> <a name="060518137000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also

welcome his reassurance that film production companies will definitely

be able to correct estimates if they prove to be incorrect. That was my

understanding of what he said. I still have some anxieties as to how

that tallies with the Bill&#146;s terms, but his reassurance on that

point is welcome.</div> <a name="060518137000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

take issue, however, with his repeated assertion that what is proposed

in schedule 4 is in line with standard industry budget and accounting

practice. As I acknowledged in my speech on the amendments, there are

some structures that involve special purpose vehicles, where the

proposed new framework might not produce a significant burden. However,

as the British Screen Advisory Council points out, not all film

producers will want to use that model. It states that if so, the

requirement to look out for estimated income could be problematic both

for independent film makers and large production companies. It is

almost impossible to predict the success of a film in advance. The new

obligation would run counter to the process of tax buying accounting

treatment and could result in companies paying tax or receiving less by

way of tax credit on income that never materialises or well ahead of

receiving that income. It also questions its application to films, such

as television programmes, that do not attract the tax credit. That

illustrates the concern across the industry since that organisation

represents a broad-ranging coalition of film industry interests. In

contrast, the Economic Secretary seemed to imply that those issues were

somehow dreamed up by an incorrect brief from KPMG. I wanted to assure

the Committee that they are more widely felt.</div>

<a name="060518137000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure the Economic

Secretary that it is not the intention of any of my amendments to leave

the Government scheme open to abuse. I stand entirely by what I said in

opening the debate. My amendments have been tabled with a view to

exploring important issues regarding the computation of profits for

film production companies. At the end of the discussion, I remain to be

convinced that the move to the new method of calculating profit and

loss is necessary to prevent the abuse of the film tax scheme, but I

take on 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 257</div>board his comments. I will reflect on them, particularly those about

amendment No. 41 and possible abuse relating to deferral.</div>

<a name="060518137000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the

light of that, I will not press any of the amendments, but I hope that

the Economic Secretary will reflect with care on whether this punitive

new regime is necessary to prevent abuse of the film tax scheme. I beg

to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Balls:</b> It is a great honour to serve under your

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000372"></a>The

Chairman:</b> The similarity is not that great, I

know.</div><a name="060518137000043"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000373"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It is a first, but I hope not a

last.</div><a name="060518137000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

might help the Committee if I set out a little of the thinking behind

the clause. It sets out the first condition that a film must meet to be

eligible for the new tax relief: subsection (1) makes it clear that it

must be intended for theatrical release. That is the same requirement

that a film had to meet to qualify for the old relief. Both the old and

new reliefs are intended to provide support to films that are made to

be shown at the cinema, and exclude other films,

which we discussed in our debates 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 258</div>on clause 31, such as those made for television. The television industry

is healthy and productive and was excluded from the old film tax

reliefs in 2002, so this is not a new

rule.</div><a name="060518137000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)

gives more detail on this requirement. Theatrical release means

exhibition to the general public at a commercial cinema&#151;again

the common-sense, generally understood definition&#151;and a film is

considered to be intended for theatrical release only if it is planned

that a significant proportion of its income should come from cinema

exhibition. This condition was originally imposed because the old

reliefs were being abused, and claims were being made for soap operas,

news programmes and even for doubtful productions that were clearly not

intended to be viewed anywhere, by anyone.</div>

<a name="060518137000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We acted to narrow the scope

of the relief to genuine cinema productions, which is what was always

intended, and that intention remains. The question is: when should the

definition of the film be judged? Under the old system of reliefs, that

was done when the film was finished, which was when the old reliefs

were claimed. As we discussed earlier, we mean the new reliefs to be

claimable from the start to assist film makers with cash flow. That

approach is based on a modern understanding of best accounting practice

and the way in which TV and film makers work.</div>

<a name="060518137000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a consequence of the

decision to change the model for film tax relief&#151;enhanced tax

relief&#151;the film maker now needs to take a view at the outset.

But what if something changes? With the original drafting, we would

have preserved the original judgment, which was made at an early stage,

even when the situation soon changed. However, since the Bill was

published, we have held discussions with the industry, and we accept

that preserving the original judgment could have unintended

consequences. We were particularly concerned that that might lead to

film makers taking overly optimistic views in the early stages, so that

makers of many productions that are inevitably destined for television

or other media would claim film tax relief in the early stages of

production. Our amendment will allow greater flexibility when the

position changes. It will allow a film that was originally intended for

the cinema to drop out of the film tax relief without losing any relief

that it has earned to date. I invite the Committee to accept the

amendment.

</div><a name="060518137000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

turn to amendment No. 43. It will not surprise members of the Committee

to learn that I think that the Opposition amendment, which I accept

seeks to address the same issue, lacks clarity. The amendment would

allow a theatrical release to be determined at any time, which means

that it could well change back and forth several times, which means

that the tax position could also change, possibly leading to payments,

repayments and even re-repayments. The whole position could become

confusing and lack clarity. Rather than our accepting the

Opposition&#146;s amendment, therefore, I hope that the Committee

will reflect on my comments and instead support ours.</div>

Balls:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying

the situation. Even though my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,

South-West is not a PPS, I find his presence behind me reassuring. I am

sure that the fact that he will continue to hold the Government

properly to account from the Back Benches on the detailed issues is

reassuring not just to me but to the taxpayer at large.</div>

<a name="060518137000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 44 seeks to make it explicit that the expenditure incurred by a

third party, which is reimbursed by a film production company, should

be treated as if it had been incurred by the film production company

for the purpose of determining whether the film production company

meets the 25 per cent. minimum UK expenditure test. It is common in the

film industry for legitimate production costs to be recharged to a

third party rather than charged directly to the film maker. That is

almost universal in the United States, where the Screen Actors

Guild&#151;the Hollywood actors&#146; trade union&#151;has rules

to limit the number of companies to which an actor can charge fees for

his or her services. That is likely to be the film production

company&#146;s parent company, rather than the film production

company itself. I imagine that that is the sort of situation

that the amendment seeks to address.</div>

<a name="060518137000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is accepted accounting

practice for costs that are recharged in that way to be treated as

though they were incurred directly by the company, and there is nothing

in the legislation to indicate that that practice will not continue for

the purposes of the new film tax relief. Where costs are recharged to a

film production company through a third party, they can be treated as

qualifying production expenditure of the film production company as if

they were incurred directly by the film production company, provided

that they are recharged on a commercial basis and are not designed to

inflate the amount of film tax relief that can be claimed. That has

already been made clear by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs in

guidance, which I fear might not yet have been read by members of the

Committee, with the possible exception of my hon. Friend the Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West. It has been published since 11 April on the

website&#151;www.hmrc.gov.uk\films\faqs\htm&#151;which

says:</div><a name="060518137000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Q: Can

costs charged through third parties be included in production costs? A:

The recharging of costs to a subsidiary by its parent company is

standard practice in the film industry and elsewhere. Where such costs

relate to qualifying production expenditure, they can be included for

the purposes of film tax relief, provided they are recharged on a

commercial basis and are not designed to inflate the amount of film tax

relief that can be

claimed.&#148;</div><a name="060518137000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,

such costs will be taken into account when determining whether the

clause 41 expenditure test is met. Given that that guidance is already

on the website, the amendment raises a moot point, so I suggest that it

be withdrawn.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000376"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I very much agree with the policy objective of

the Government to ensure that television production is not subsidised

by the film tax break. That has led in the past to problems with the

tax break being used in an inappropriate way, and I would not seek to

reverse it. What concerns me, which is why I tabled the amendment, is

the problem adverted to by the Economic Secretary in relation to the

point at which the decision that a film is to be made for theatrical

release is made. The original text of the Bill would have provided that

that had to happen at a preliminary stage, as soon as film-making

activities began. Clause 33 states that those film activities include

development and so, to use the example given by the Economic Secretary

on Tuesday, the writing of a book that is to become a blockbuster

trilogy of films 40 years later could conceivably be considered to be

development.</div>

<a name="060518137000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would make no sense

whatsoever to determine the tax status of a film at the start of the

development stage. I welcome the Government&#146;s amendment and I am

happy not to press mine because theirs does an adequate job in meeting

the problem outlined by me and the Economic Secretary.</div>

<a name="060518137000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 44, I welcome

the clear indication given by the Economic Secretary that costs

incurred by a third party and recharged to the production company will

count as expenditure under clause 41. There is therefore no need for me

to press the amendment.</div>

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): There is no need

to dwell any further on the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for

Chipping Barnet, since she has made it clear that she will not press

them. We will not call for them to be pressed either.</div>

<a name="060518137000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also

welcome the Government amendment to clause 39(3). It seems that the

subsection as it stood would have created a series of perverse

incentives and would have been an incentive for people to misrepresent

the intentions of their film-making activities.</div>

<a name="060518137000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not keep the Committee

too long, but I wanted to draw its attention to the word

&#147;significant&#148; in subsection (2)(b), because the

subsection states

that</div><a name="060518137000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a film is not

regarded as intended for theatrical release unless it is intended that

a significant proportion of the earnings from the film should be

obtained by such

exhibition.&#148;</div><a name="060518137000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would

appreciate some clarification of how that can be demonstrated. It is

obviously not always easy to predict the proportion of earnings that a

film will generate from theatrical release compared with DVD or video

release. If the Minister could clarify what the word

&#147;significant&#148; represents, I would be

grateful.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000378"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It is a pleasure to be able to give an answer to

the hon. Lady. Films do not just happen by accident but are carefully

planned, so we would hope that the intended outlet for the film would

be clear from an early stage. That will be reflected by who commissions

the film, its intended outlet, how it is made and the distribution

agents that are put in place.</div>

<a name="060518137000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Revenue will look

carefully at the plans in each individual case, to see not only the

intended degree of revenue but how the film will be introduced to the

distributional channels. Different indicators can be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 261</div>brought together to allow the judgment to be made, so to set a number on

the word &#147;significant&#148; and to make that the only test

would be too narrow a view. It is much better to say, as the

legislation does, that the proportion needs to be significant and that

it needs to be clearly and demonstrably the case that the film is

intended for the cinema. That should be a judgment made in the round

based on a number of factors.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000379"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b><b class="B"> </b>Clause 40 focuses on the requirement that

a film be culturally British. I can see the merits of focusing film tax

relief on culturally British films and of the indirect benefits of the

promotion of UK plc around the world by the film industry. Those

benefits would be more direct and stronger with films of particular

cultural

Britishness.</div><a name="060518137000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

flag up one concern, however: there could be room for debate on what is

sufficiently British. For example, would &#147;The Chronicles of

Narnia&#148; have been sufficiently British? Will the &#147;Red

Dwarf&#148; movie&#151;currently in production&#151;be

sufficiently British? There is a lot of involvement in that film by the

British film production industry. Would that pass the

test?</div><a name="060518137000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

points-scoring system, whereby it is possible to take diverse factors

into account such as a film&#146;s cultural content and setting, the

nationality of its characters and its use of UK cultural hubs, seems to

be broadly workable. I welcome the fact that the test makes provision

for a UK cultural hub for visual and special effects because those are

some of the strongest aspects of the UK film industry; our visual and

special effects industry is one of the most successful in the world.

Encouraging film makers to use those facilities is

desirable.</div><a name="060518137000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

principal concern is the same as that which I raised during

deliberation on another part of the Bill: is the EU state aid regime

the principal concern motivating clause 40? Or did the Government form

the view that we need a test of

Britishness?</div><a name="060518137000072"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000380"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> As the clause makes clear, and as I think that we

discussed on Tuesday, in order to be eligible for film tax relief, a

film is required to be British and to be certified as such by the

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport under schedule 1 to the

Films Act 1985. That was the previous requirement for film tax reliefs.

However, my right hon. Friend has developed and introduced a new film

tax regime designed to be simpler to operate and more geared towards a

film&#146;s British cultural

status.</div><a name="060518137000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had the

pleasure to serve on the Committee that debated the details of that

cultural test. Certainly, the conditions set out are extensive, but it

will not surprise the Committee that that is the responsibility of my

right hon. Friend, not the Treasury. Obviously, it would 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div>be inappropriate for a Treasury Minister to comment on any matters

outside the direct purview of the Treasury, so that is really a matter

for my right hon. Friend&#146;s

Department.</div><a name="060518137000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

European Commission state aids, we discussed the procedure for state

aids clearance during consideration of the clauses on tax reform. The

state aids rules require that support be directed towards films that

are cultural products, which is why the Department for Culture, Media

and Sport has been in dialogue with the Commission over compatibility

with the state aids rules and its responsibilities. That Department,

like the Treasury, has notified the Commission of the test, but that is

for it to pursue.</div> <a name="060518137000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

can reassure the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet that this is not being

done because of a requirement from the Commission, but because we want

a test of Britishness that will allow us to say with hand on heart that

we are supporting the production of British

films.</div><a name="060518137000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Considerable concern has been expressed about the timing of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000383"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> I appreciate the right hon. Lady&#146;s

comments. The reason why I referred to tax credits is that many of my

constituents have extreme difficulties with the working families tax

credit system, which has had problems. I acknowledge that the example

that we are talking about is different from the tax credit systems

whose problems have been most serious, but it is reasonable to refer to

problems in other areas with a view to ensuring that such problems do

not

recur.</div><a name="060518137000083"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000384"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> If we are to have a serious debate, will the

hon. Lady draw the parallels between a payable tax credit to families,

which is based on integration of the tax and benefit systems, and

payable tax credits for research and development in the tax system, on

which the film tax credit is modelled? Their names are the only

similarity.</div>

arisen in one area to arise in

another.</div><a name="060518137000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Uncertainty

about the time scale for the payment of film tax credits will drive up

the cost of funding a film because of the increased risk involved in

delays. I hope that the Government will consider accepting amendment

No. 54 to inject a welcome degree of certainty into the measures. It

would also be useful if the Economic Secretary indicated how long the

Government expect that it will take, on average, to pay out a tax

credit. Are they doing any research on the

matter?</div><a name="060518137000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060518137000386"></a><b class="B">Rob

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000387"></a>Mrs.

look only to the Rural Payments Agency, which was debated today on the

reason why so many sectors of the economy are concerned about

exceptionally complex Government innovation introducing a new relief,

subsidy or tax credit that the relevant Government agency will be

incapable of delivering according to its own schedule and statutory

procedures. That is why the amendment is seeking to direct confidence

back into the system. That is its

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000394"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I will make a couple of short remarks. The

hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West makes a valid point. However,

it would have been appropriate to have an amendment to paragraph

9(1)(b) to ensure that the claim was valid. As for the amendment

introduced by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet, if the Minister is

confident that the payment will be delivered within an appropriate time

scale, clearly she will have no problem in accepting the

amendment.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 264</div><a name="060518137000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000395"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia

Goldsworthy) has made a good point. However, I think that the hon.

Member for Chipping Barnet misunderstood my intervention. I will

therefore repeat it, perhaps more fully. The effect of the amendment,

were it to be accepted, would be that if a film production company put

in a claim showing that it was entitled to a tax credit, it would be

entitled to have it paid out within 90 days even if it was not actually

entitled to the tax credit because it had not put in the right

documentation. The company could argue, statutorily, that it had to be

paid because the 90 days was up as per the Act of Parliament. With

respect to the hon. Lady, it would be a complete nonsense if a company

were to be entitled to receive a payment when it had not produced

proper evidence. All members of the Committee would recognise that

companies should provide proper evidence to validate claims to receive

tax

credits.</div><a name="060518137000096"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000396"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It is obviously important that we implement the

film tax credit as efficiently and professionally as we can. As my

right hon. Friend the Paymaster General said, there is much that we can

learn from the tried and tested model of the research and development

tax credit, which has been successful in its impact and

administration.</div><a name="060518137000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

important to say that we are talking about a tax credit. Therefore, it

depends on the company&#146;s tax position and that is why the claim

needs to be in the company&#146;s return and why repayment will

depend on the broader complexity of those tax

arrangements.</div><a name="060518137000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060518137000397"></a><b class="B">John

Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): I am having difficulty

in working out the circumstances under which a payment would be made.

As far as I can see, a payment would be made only when a film was

expected to make a loss over its whole lifetime, and on that basis one

would not even make the film. So I find the provision a bit

odd.</div><a name="060518137000099"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000398"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman may have missed some of the

detail of earlier debates&#151;in particular, that this is a payable

tax credit. It can either be taken as a credit against tax take, or as

a direct cash payment in the event that the film makes a loss. It

operates in a similar way to the research and development tax credit,

which is why it is called a payable tax

credit.</div><a name="060518137000100"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000399"></a>John

Hemming:</b> The difference between the film tax credit and

the research and development tax credit is that in this instance we are

calculating the liability to corporation tax on the basis of the

averaged-out income against the expenditure, whereas with research and

development the same assumption is not being

made.</div><a name="060518137000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000400"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> It is also the case that we are paying out this tax

credit on the basis of making a British film, rather than for research

and development. They are clearly not analogous; they are different.

One is about making a film, which has a particular tax treatment set

out in schedule 4; the other is about research and development. So I

would not say that they are identical, but the general model has

similarities, and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 265</div>one similarity is the fact that the film tax credit is payable. If over

the lifetime of the film the company is making a loss year by year, it

can claim the enhanced relief as a

credit.</div><a name="060518137000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

make the point to the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet that it is

helpful and constructive to have amendments that are designed to ensure

that the tax system is operated in an effective and efficient way, but

if one is going to table such amendments, and do so in a pointed and

sharp political way, it is important to get them right. The problem

with the amendment is not the wider political shenanigans surrounding

its introduction but the fact that it is badly drafted and flawed and

does not achieve what the hon. Lady intends.</div>

<a name="060518137000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I got the impression from the

hon. Lady&#146;s speech that she expects the clock to start ticking

on the 90-day entitlement when the claim is made; from her speech, one

would have assumed that the claimant would be forgiven for thinking

that the clock started ticking at that point. But in the amendment the

clock starts ticking not when the claim is made but when the

entitlement is established. I should have thought from my experience of

HMRC policy that 90 days is a generous or rather too long a period if

the clock starts from the point when the entitlement is established,

and the amendment appears to be drafted on that basis. We would hope to

get payments out much quicker than 90 days once the

entitlement has been established.</div>

<a name="060518137000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The entitlement needs to be

established promptly, without impediment, but the time that that

process takes depends on the broader issue of the tax return and its

complexity, and the time that it would take to establish that it is not

some sort of complex trade that is being abused for tax-avoidance

purposes. HMRC will take the time that it needs to establish that it is

not tax avoidance and its officials will want to do that as

expeditiously as possible. That is part of their job; they will also

ensure that they do it properly and they will take time to establish

the entitlement. From the point that the entitlement is established, 90

days is too long a period, but that is what the amendment refers to.

The proposal is flawed; it misunderstands what it is trying to achieve

and therefore lets the Revenue off the hook rather than tying it

down.</div> <a name="060518137000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">My advice to

the hon. Lady is that if she wants to criticise the Government on the

matter of administration it is important to get the facts right before

tabling an amendment. Being more generous, I would say that one of the

great advantages of this debate is that we can discuss these matters in

a friendly, co-operative way, knowing that we agree on the general

objective, which is to ensure that British films are subsidised in

Britain. If only we had the same unanimity on our goals to reduce child

poverty through the tax credit system; maybe in that respect there

might be a bit more consensus than there has been so

far.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000401"></a>Mrs.

Wolverhampton, South-West that the amendment does not seek to entitle a

film production company to the film tax credit automatically,

regardless of whether a valid claim is made, because it is inserted in

the last line of paragraph 9. The preceding two paragraphs make it

clear that a valid claim must be established before the last line kicks

in.</div>

<a name="060518137000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">This small amendment addresses

a slight drafting defect in the Bill, which we want to set straight.

Part 2 of schedule 5, paragraphs 14 to 25, makes changes to schedule 1

of the Films Act 1985. Schedule 1 sets out the rules for certification

of films as British. The new tax relief requires a number of changes to

those rules and some of those changes require references back to

chapter 3 of part 3 of the Finance (No. 2) Bill or, as I trust it will

eventually become, the Finance Act 2006. The amendment simply inserts a

full reference to chapter 3 of the forthcoming Act, instead of the

phrase &#147;that chapter&#148;, which is not otherwise

defined.</div><a name="060518137000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000403"></a>John

Hemming:</b> This comes back to the previous point. I am

trying to assess how this relief gets paid. I accept the point about

the research and development tax credit which is funded right at the

start of the project, but there are two issues here. First, there is a

massive nuisance in that to qualify for this relief one has to take the

tail end income and count that at the start of the project. One does

not have the cash, but one must account for a profit that will be made

on income that will be received in perhaps a couple of years&#146;

time and one must account for it as soon as one starts spending money

on the project. That is a real burden.</div>

<a name="060518137000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is, what is the

benefit? The benefit is the availability of a tax credit where there is

a surrenderable loss. With various complications, which are not as

complicated as those surrounding capital gains tax and so on but are

still quite complicated, one will possibly get between 16 and 20 per

cent. of the surrenderable loss at the best of times. The real question

is how in the real world we will have a situation where someone will be

paid a tax credit. If the calculation is on the basis of a loss, it

must be a loss over the whole of the project on the basis of the

initial calculation as to the estimated income, unless there is

something else within the entity that is losing money. That is the

issue that interests

me.</div><a name="060518137000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060518137000404"></a><b class="B">Jeremy

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I simply wanted to

ask a question in the absence of the hon. Member for Dundee, East

(Stewart Hosie). I am sure that he would have asked it if he were here.

It relates to paragraph 25, particularly subparagraphs (5) and (6),

which deal with the agencies that are entitled to conduct a prosecution

for the wrongful disclosure of information related to Revenue and

Customs. It is clear 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 267</div>which agencies prosecute in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland,

but which agency would do so in

Scotland?</div><a name="060518137000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000405"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> I will reflect on that and try to find an answer in

due course. First I shall make some remarks about the schedule and the

loss rules which I hope will help to clarify matters. The schedule is

in four parts. The first sets out how the relief is calculated. The

second part amends schedule 1 to the Films Act 1985, which deals with

the certification of films in Britain. The third part provides claims

machinery for the relief. The fourth part deals with claims for relief

made before a film is completed. Finally, to answer the hon. Member for

Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright), in Scotland prosecutions under

the schedule would be taken forward by the procurator

fiscal.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000410"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> I apologise, Sir John. It is helpful to be set

straight on that point of procedure. I was about to say that if that

issue had occurred earlier to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth,

I presume that he would have tabled an amendment to clarify this

schedule to the Bill. Obviously, that thought did not occur to him

until a much later stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000413"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> No. I am told that, in Scotland, the Procurator

Fiscal Service is not only an authority that may deal with these

matters but the only one that may do so. Therefore, it might be thought

to be overburdening the schedule to state the obvious within it.

However, we will reflect on the drafting advice of the hon. Member for

Rugby and Kenilworth for future occasions.</div>

just to clarify: I did not put in an amendment because the words on

line 42 are, &#147;England and Wales only&#148;. Paragraph 25(5)

so on; no such narrowing down was required in Scotland for the very

to earlier comments in response to the intervention by the

hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), the Committee should

be reassured to know that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,

South-West is scrutinising our proceedings with such care. In an

analogy with the Bank of England, where a decision not to raise

interest rates is as important as the decision to do so, knowing that

my hon. Friend considered whether an amendment was necessary and

decided not to table it provides me with a similar degree of

reassurance as if he had. Therefore we can move on, comfortable in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000417"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> Returning for a moment to film, I turn to part 1 to

set out some more detail which I hope will help all hon. Members,

particularly the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming). He

is asking the same series of questions and I fear that I am giving the

same answer, so if I put the answer in a broader context that may help

the Committee to understand both my answers and his

interventions.</div> <a name="060518137000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part

1 implements our announcement in the pre-Budget report that a British

film starting principal photography on or after 1 April 2006 and

meeting the conditions that we set out, is entitled to film tax relief,

which is given as an additional deduction in computing its

profits&#151;the amount of which deduction, as debated earlier, is

defined in paragraph 4&#151;and possibly as a payable tax credit as

set out in paragraphs 6 and 7. The amount of the deduction is based on

the actual UK spending subject to a cap of 80 per cent. of the

production company&#146;s spending. That cap, as we have discussed,

is needed to meet European Commission state aid rules requiring that it

must be possible to spend at least 20 per cent. of the film&#146;s

budget elsewhere in the EU without loss of relief. As also discussed,

we reduced that requirement from 40 per cent. at an early

stage.</div> <a name="060518137000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

4(3) would allow the Treasury to amend the 80 per cent. limit so that

any future changes in state aid rules could be accommodated, but at

this stage we do not envisage complications in state aid clearance. The

additional deduction is defined in paragraph 4 as the result of that

threshold multiplied by the appropriate rate&#151;100 per cent. for a

limited-budget film and 80 per cent. for a large-budget film. That

additional deduction will alter the overall profit or loss previously

calculated according to schedule 4, which we debated earlier. If the

results of the calculation place a company in loss, paragraph 6 will

allow some of the loss to be surrendered for a payable tax credit. The

amount that can be surrendered is capped at the same threshold amount

as I mentioned a few moments ago&#151;the actual UK spend up to 80

per cent. of the total spend. It is not limited to the amount of the

additional deduction. That is the position in the first period of

account, which in the case of most films will be the only

period.</div> <a name="060518137000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

unusual for a film to take several years to make, although it does

happen. In later periods, if there are 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 269</div>any, the rules are slightly more complicated and examine cumulative

spending, but the principle is the same. In calculating the additional

deduction for and the amount of loss that can be surrendered in such

later periods, paragraphs 4(2) and 6(4) take account of the amounts in

previous periods so that the Commission&#146;s 20 per cent. rule is

met over the film&#146;s overall production period. That measure is

necessary because the new film tax relief may be claimed by companies

period-by-period as a film is made, whereas the previous reliefs under

section 42 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 and section 48 of the

Finance (No. 2) Act 1997 could be claimed only on completion of the

film, which was much simpler because all the facts were known and final

positions could be determined.</div>

<a name="060518137000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the amount of loss to be

surrendered has been determined&#151;a company need not surrender the

maximum amount but can instead retain losses to set against future

income from the film, which might be more advantageous&#151;it is

multiplied by the appropriate credit rate as set out in paragraph 8 to

determine the actual payable credit. Again the credit is higher for a

limited-budget film than for a large-budget film. Were the losses

instead to be retained and set against film incomes, taxed at 30 per

cent., the losses would of course be worth slightly more. Whether to do

that is of course a company&#146;s choice. Once the amount of payable

credit has been determined and a claim made, paragraph 9 requires Her

Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to pay it to the company, although

there are protective provisions in that paragraph to deal with

circumstances where the company owes money to HMRC or its tax return is

being inquired into.</div>

<a name="060518137000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 10 makes it clear

that the payment of tax credit is not itself taxable. Paragraphs 12 and

13 are aimed at preventing the inflation of film tax relief. Paragraph

12 addresses circumstances where a payment is deferred. While we accept

that deferred payments are a legitimate practice in the film industry,

we do not accept that the film tax relief should be based on payments

that have not yet been made. When they are made they can be included.

Paragraph 13 is a more general measure aimed at attempts to inflate the

amount of film tax relief. It is along the same lines as other rules,

such as those on the R and D tax credit in paragraph 21 of schedule 20

to the Finance Act 2000, and targets arrangements the sole or main

purpose of which is to obtain or inflate the amount of film tax credit.

That does not include ordinary transactions that would in any case be

undertaken in making a film, such as establishing a film production

company in the first place. We do not want to get in the way of such

transactions, but as we have said, we will not accept amendments that

abuse the new system.</div>

<a name="060518137000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that detail makes

things clearer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley. As I said, a

film is typically made by a film production company under a contract.

If that contract results in the film production company making a loss,

the tax credit may be payable, but the film may be profitable to

whoever commissioned

it.</div><a name="060518137000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000420"></a>Mrs.

Villiers:</b> The clause concerns terminal losses. When a film

production company making a film that qualifies for tax relief ceases

trading, the clause will allow its losses to be transferred to another,

similar trade of the same company or within the same group. At present,

clause 45 relief for terminal losses on the cessation of activity on a

film is limited to films qualifying for the enhanced tax credit.

Amendments Nos. 36 to 39 would remove that restriction. They are

probing amendments so that we can discover the Government&#146;s

motivation for providing relief only for certain films. Will the

Minister outline his reasons for the proposed restrictions? The

amendments would provide that terminal loss relief could be claimed on

all films, not only those that qualify for enhanced tax credit. I can

see no good reason for the Bill to restrict terminal loss in such a

way.</div><a name="060518137000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point

relates to the losses generated by enhanced deductions when they can be

surrendered intra-group when the film is completed or has been

abandoned. The possibility of surrendering them intra-group is welcome.

It is an important part of the clause. My worry relates to subsection

(1)(a), which requires that a

company</div><a name="060518137000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ceases to carry

on a trade in relation to a qualifying

film&#148;</div><a name="060518137000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">before the losses

can be passed on. I should welcome the Economic Secretary&#146;s view

on the situation in which receipts continue to come in over months or

years afterwards. As we have discussed, some of the income that falls

within schedule 4 may come in at much later stages, unexpectedly. It

would be useful to have a point at which the terminal loss regime can

kick in, despite the outside possibility that revenue may be received

for the film in an unexpected way in the future. Will the possibility

of delayed receipts preclude the possibility of the loss being passed

on? I welcome the Minister&#146;s

clarification.</div><a name="060518137000146"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000421"></a>Ed

Balls:</b> I shall explain the purpose of clause 45, and then

discuss the amendments. The clause allows the unrealised losses that

will be available to a qualifying film in one trade to be handed to

another qualifying film, when it is no longer possible to utilise them

in relation to the original film. It will encourage films to be made

and rights held together in a company or within a group. If a film

production company chooses not to surrender losses for film tax

credits, it will make use of the film tax relief by setting the losses

created by the additional deductions against income from other films

that it produces, reducing the tax that it has to pay on real

profits.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 271</div><a name="060518137000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, and

when, the trade ceases because the film is sold or is no longer capable

of exploitation, it is possible that there will be unrealised film tax

relief. If nothing were to be done, those reliefs would be stranded or

lost for ever. One purpose of this chapter is to ensure that we not

only support individual British films, but encourage individual British

film makers to make slates of films: to implement a strategy for a

series of films over time&#151;even avante-garde films&#151;and to

use their losses

appropriately.</div><a name="060518137000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of

the aims of the relief is to encourage films to be held as a slate,

where risk and reward is pooled by producing and holding films at

different stages, so that films that make losses can be balanced

against those that are profitable. Under clause 45, when a qualifying

film produced by a film production company is sold or ceases to be

exploitable&#151;that is, when the trade cases&#151;and there are

losses that could have been carried forward, they can be passed on. But

it is important that the losses that would otherwise be stranded are

passed on only in a way that recognises the purpose of the chapter,

which is to support British films and thus meet our sustainability

objective.</div><a name="060518137000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

terminal losses can be passed to another trade within the company, or

to another company in the group only if that company is making another

qualifying British film. It will not be enough to buy in rights to

provide income against which to set the losses or to make any old film

that will make a profit. In their original setting, the losses could

only be set against the income of a British film so, in the trade that

acquires them, the losses are similarly restricted in their

use.</div><a name="060518137000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the

drafting of amendments Nos. 36 to 38 is not quite right in that it

would remove a reference to schedule 4 at the end of clause 45(6), it

is clear that the intent of those amendments is to remove the

requirement that, for terminal loss relief to apply, a film must be

qualifying film. It should be clear to the Committee, on the basis of

my remarks so far, that that is not acceptable to us. The terminal loss

relief is part of a balanced package designed to encourage the British

cinema and film industry. That is why it is restricted to films that

qualify for the new relief in schedule 5.</div>

<a name="060518137000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, I urge the

Committee to reject the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000426"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> It is a pleasure, Sir John, to see you in the

Chair. If I make the mistake of moving an amendment when I am debating

it, I know that you will pull me up at once and put me right. I think

that I am moving amendment No. 77 and speaking to amendments Nos. 78 to

87 and amendments Nos. 88 to 91. I do not know if the Economic

Secretary will be dealing with this chapter&#151;I think that he will

not, from the way that he is moving with his files&#151;so I might

not have the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment, which

I have not yet had the chance to do even though it has been recorded

that I have done

so.</div><a name="060518137000177"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000427"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. May I just make it clear, for the benefit

of all Committee members, that in relation to each of the amendments

that I have introduced, this will be the only opportunity for them to

be debated, although it will not be the only opportunity for them to be

voted

on?</div><a name="060518137000178"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000428"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful for your guidance, Sir John.

Because no Minister has had the opportunity to speak to clause 54, we

are in the correct but slightly difficult situation of having to

explain a little about the clause in order to make sense of the

amendments. Without pre-empting the clause stand part debate, I want to

outline the context, which is that the measures set out in clauses 54

to 58 aim to prevent the exploitation of charity tax reliefs. No doubt,

in due course, the Paymaster General will make the case for them. To

make part of her case for her, the measures have been welcomed by the

Institute of Fundraising, the National Council for Voluntary

Organisations and the charity finance directors group.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 274</div><a name="060518137000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand the

Government&#146;s concern about such exploitation, and support in

principle efforts to prevent it from taking place, as do other

organisations that have commented on the clauses, such as the Charities

Tax Reform Group, The Law Commission and the Chartered Institute of

Taxation. However, and in such matters there is nearly always a

&#147;however&#148;, those latter organisations are concerned about

the clauses both because some innocent transactions might inadvertently

be caught by them and because they will add unnecessary complexity to

the tax system. In addition, they fear that those two factors could

cause a reduction in charitable activity, which I am sure is not the

Government&#146;s intention. In short, we might have another example

of the law of unintended consequences.</div>

<a name="060518137000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth noting that

Ministers do not claim that the clauses are incapable of improvement,

given that they have tabled two amendments&#151;Government amendments

Nos. 62 and 63&#151;that seek to plug the gaps in the proposed

clauses. Government amendment No. 63, in relation to housing

associations, is particularly important in that regard. Our amendments

are essentially probing amendments. They seek to lessen the risk of

innocent transactions being caught by the clauses and to reduce

complexity.</div>

<a name="060518137000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060518137000429"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I understand that the

Charities Tax Reform Group has had discussions with Ministers to

express concerns about the very issues that my hon. Friend raises. It

would be interesting to know the results of those discussions as they

relate to my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns.

</div><a name="060518137000182"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000430"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> Indeed. As my hon. Friend appreciates, I was not

present at those discussions, nor, I believe, were any of my hon.

Friends. I am sure that the Paymaster General will want to comment on

them in due course and in a moment I shall raise some of the concerns

that were voiced. Our intention is to prevent innocent transactions

from being caught by anti-avoidance measures that are quite proper in

their intent, and we will listen carefully to what the Paymaster

General says before deciding whether to press the amendments to a

vote.</div> <a name="060518137000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 77 to 80 aim to clarify that the sale or letting of property to a

charity by a substantial donor at market value&#151;that is, as part

of a normal business transaction in which there is no special deal or

arrangement between the substantial donor and the charity&#151;would

not be caught by the clause.</div>

<a name="060518137000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 81, has a

similar aim&#151;to clarify that an exchange of property between a

charity and a substantial donor at market value will not be caught by

the clause.</div>

<a name="060518137000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 82 aims to

ensure that otherwise unexceptionable transactions by a charity are not

caught by the legislation. One example of an unexceptionable

transaction is when a charity buys a property from a substantial donor

at full arm&#146;s length value, whether or not the charity intends

to use it for charitable purposes.</div>

<a name="060518137000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">To illustrate the example, let

us suppose that a private landowner owning 5 acres of farmland next to

a school donates 1 acre of that land, worth &#163;200,000, to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 275</div>the school for use as a playing field. The next year, he decides to sell

the remaining 4 acres on the open market, of which the school buys

another acre to build a new science block. If the school bought the

same property at the same price from a non-donor, the expenditure would

be treated as charitable expenditure. However, it is claimed that under

proposed new section 506A(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act

1988, the school would be caught and would have a tax liability of

&#163;60,000 in respect of purchase if it was a corporate charity and

&#163;80,000 if it was a

trust.</div><a name="060518137000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another

example of an unexceptionable transaction is when a charity purchases

property from a substantial donor as an investment that qualifies under

any of the provisions of schedule 20 to the Income and Corporation

Taxes Act 1988 except paragraph 5. To illustrate the example, let us

suppose that a charity buys a house from a private householder as an

investment. Under the same section of the Bill, it would have a tax

liability of up to 40 per cent. of the value of the house if the

householder was a substantial

donor.</div><a name="060518137000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">A third

example is when a charity makes an investment in unquoted shares that

qualify under paragraph 9 of our old friend schedule 20 of ICTA 1998.

To illustrate, let us suppose that a charity enters into a joint

venture agreement with a commercial company. For example, a health care

charity might use its consultancy expertise to provide private health

care services through such a joint venture. The charity holds 50 per

cent. of the shares in the joint venture company and receives regular

and substantial payments of gift aid from the company. The 50 per cent.

subsidiary therefore becomes a substantial donor and, although the

investment is a qualifying investment, tax will be charged on the

amount of any share or loan capital invested by the charity in the

associated company.</div><a name="060518137000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

turn to another example. The National Trust is concerned that the

measures are drawn very widely and could catch many innocent

transactions in which the trust has a relationship with substantial

donors. It

says:</div><a name="060518137000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For

example, the following situations could trigger a tax change in our

circumstances: a donor family, living in a National Trust mansion free

of charge or at a below-market rent under a historic agreement entered

into at the time the mansion was donated to the Trust, who now make a

substantial donation to the

Trust&#148;</div><a name="060518137000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">to fund a

restoration project at the mansion, for example. The National Trust

believes that it would be caught by the

clause.</div><a name="060518137000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another

example is when a trust purchasing land from a substantial donor needs

to pay more for the land than its market value&#151;for instance,

when the trust makes a private offer to secure conservation land as an

incentive to the vendor not to sell it on the open market or at

auction. Those concerns were raised with me during the past few days,

after I had prepared my initial

remarks.</div><a name="060518137000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 83 seeks to remove subsection (3) from the Bill. The Charities Tax

Reform Group argues that the subsection is drawn too widely and that in

any case it is unnecessary because subsection (4), which catches all

transactions on non-arm&#146;s length rate terms, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 276</div>fulfils the same function. I would be interested to hear the Paymaster

General&#146;s response to that.</div>

<a name="060518137000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 84 seeks to

remove subsection (4) from the Bill. The Charities Tax Reform Group

argues that it can be difficult for a charity to establish what an

arm&#146;s length rate might be for the purposes of a transaction,

and claims, with some force, that most charities do not have the

resources to pay consultants in order to establish a market rate for

every transaction. For instance, the market rate for the use of a

charity&#146;s name and logo in an advertising campaign varies from

charity to charity. There is one main concern about the substantial

donor clauses: a substantial donor to a small charity might be a very

important donor whereas a substantial donor to a larger charity might

not be so important. Perhaps that is illustrated by the point about the

logos.</div><a name="060518137000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the

Paymaster General tell the Committee what steps charities will be

required to take to determine whether a transaction is at a market rate

and what evidence they will have to retain? The Charities Tax Reform

Group argues that unless subsection (4) is removed, charities will

incur substantial compliance costs. However, if the subsection must be

retained, and of course amendment No. 83, which I proposed, presumed

that it would be retained&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I was waiting

for some alert person&#151;possibly the hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West&#151;to get to his feet and ask why the

Charities Tax Reform Group proposed to delete one subsection relying on

another, and then to remove that other subsection. The Charities Tax

Reform Group argues that if it must be retained&#151;I am confident

that the Paymaster General will say that it will be&#151;there should

be a de minimis amount beneath which Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and

Customs would not dispute the amounts charged by or to a charity. I

would be grateful to hear her

comments.</div><a name="060518137000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 85 seeks to insert on page 39, line 26, after

&#147;remuneration&#148;:</div><a name="060518137000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless

it is paid either under a contract of employment at a rate not

exceeding an arm&#146;s length rate

or&#148;</div><a name="060518137000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">for services as a

trustee. The amendment aims to ensure that employees of a charity can

be substantial donors to that charity. As it is, the subsection

apparently means that if an employee of a charity who is not a trustee

makes substantial donations to that charity, either under gift aid or

as a deduction from payroll, that employee&#146;s salary is to be

treated as a non-charitable expense.</div>

<a name="060518137000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Paymaster General is

unwilling to accept the amendment, she might at least make it clear

that the subsection should apply only when an employee is paid more

than another employee doing a similar job who is not a donor, and that

it should be clarified that remuneration to an employee who is not a

trustee does not need to be approved by the Charity Commission. I would

be grateful for her

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000431"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I should now like to see whether we are alert; I

had picked up on the point to which the hon. Gentleman referred about

subsections (3) and (4). If I read amendment No. 85 correctly and if it

were inserted, subsection (5) would read extremely oddly, to say the

least. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of that?</div>



<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 277</div><a name="060518137000199"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000432"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b><b class="B"> </b>What the hon. Gentleman thinks may read

oddly is not necessarily what I think reads oddly. I should be happy

for him to enlarge on that

point.</div><a name="060518137000200"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000433"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Although I may be misreading it, under the

amendment, subsection (5) would read

that</div><a name="060518137000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the purposes

of section 505 as non-charitable expenditure unless it is remuneration

unless it is paid either under a contract of employment at a rate not

exceeding an arm's length rate or for services as a

trustee&#148;.</div><a name="060518137000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I have read

that correctly, and I concede that I may have not, it is because the

word &#147;unless&#148; is used twice within four

words.</div><a name="060518137000202"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000434"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman is using the term

&#147;odd&#148; to describe something &#147;inelegant&#148;. I

am willing to concede that it may not be elegant drafting, but I am

sure that, legally speaking&#151;although I am not a lawyer&#151;it

is effective or surely the amendment would not have been accepted for

debate.</div><a name="060518137000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can

move on to amendment No. 86, ready as I always am to be picked up by

the hon. Gentleman for stylistic inelegance or, indeed, for any other

matter. Amendment No. 86 would leave out lines 37 and 38 on page 39.

Subsection (1)(a) of the proposed new section 68B provides an exemption

where a transaction is undertaken as part of the donor&#146;s

business. As paragraph (b) deals with arm&#146;s length terms, the

Charities Tax Reform Group argues that there is no need for paragraph

(a) and asks what difference it makes whether the transaction is a

business transaction for the

donor.</div><a name="060518137000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

87 returns us to the country explored in amendment No. 82 and would

insert the words</div><a name="060518137000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or is

will note that the amendment attempts in some detail to draw a more

watertight definition of the words &#147;recognised stock

exchange.&#148; The amendment would enable charities to continue to

benefit from any investment by the charity that is a qualifying

investment under schedule 20 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act

1988. There appears to be no reason why charities dealing with

substantial donors should be prevented from making qualifying

investments that should surely be

unexceptionable.</div><a name="060518137000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 88 would leave out the words &#147;which is wholly&#148; on

hear the Paymaster General&#146;s

view.</div><a name="060518137000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

advance clearance on transactions would, in practice, be able to obtain

91, which is, in a sense, separate from amendment No. 90 and some

Government were to accept these contradictory amendments? I think that

he would accept that they are contradictory, or could not all be

<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 279</div><a name="060518137000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support in particular

amendment No.91, which covers the retrospective nature of the

proposals. I have no difficulty with the intent of the

Government&#146;s proposals to tighten up the provision to avoid

potential abuse. However, they need to consider the practical nature of

the definition of substantial donations, which goes back more than

sixyears.</div>

<a name="060518137000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will

illustrate my argument from my experience as a former trustee of the

Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which is a worthy charity

raising hundreds of millions of pounds globally each year. In the UK,

it raises at least a couple of million pounds each year mostly from

annual walks, which take place in cities throughout the

country.</div> <a name="060518137000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

several examples of teams put together by individuals or families,

often connected with diabetes, which raise several thousand pounds each

year from sponsored donations and contributions. Many could qualify, on

a cumulative basis, as substantial donors. However, it would be a

difficult challenge for the charity to unravel the records of the many

thousands of donations of what are currently sub-&#163;1,000 amounts.

Although the Paymaster General may respond by saying that the provision

applies only to donations of &#163;100,000 and that most charities

will have records adequate to pick up large donations, I am not

convinced that charities such as that which I gave as an example will

have good enough record keeping to enable them to make that

aggregation. A simple solution to the problem would be to accept my

hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, so that the legislation would take

effect from the date of the Budget without requiring many charities to

go to a great deal of time-consuming effort for no benefit to

themselves and potentially very little to the

Exchequer.</div>

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I, too,

should like to speak to amendment No. 91. I have a particular concern

that I hope the Paymaster General will address. As the Bill stands, how

far back would charities need to look through their records? My hon.

Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) referred to six years, but I

am concerned that it might be necessary for them to look back 11 years.

I say that because the wording of new section 506A, subsection

(2)(b)&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] It has clearly caused a reaction

somewhere, either in this world or another.</div>

<a name="060518137000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is reference to

&#163;100,000 over a six-year period, and then to the following five

chargeable periods. If donations were made between 1 January 1995 and,

for argument&#146;s sake, 1997, the six-year period in which the

&#163;100,000 would fall would run until 1 January 2001. At that

point, we should apply the following &#147;five chargeable

periods&#148;&#151;that is the following five years&#151;which

takes us to 11 years after 1995. To amplify the point that my hon.

Friend just made about the need for charities to look back, the way I

interpret the clause is that the need for amendment No. 91 seems to be

all the more significant. I shall be grateful for clarification from

the Paymaster General.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 280</div><a name="060518137000223"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000440"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I shall be brief. The clause seeks to deal

with the abuse of charity tax reliefs, and we support the

Government&#146;s efforts to tackle that. It could prove to be an

effective defence for charities that are trying to resist donors who

want to attach strings to their gifts, and that is very important. As

the intricacies of the Bill and the amendments show, relationships

between charities and their donors can be very complicated, as the

political parties are learning at the moment. What is the extent of the

abuse that the clause seeks to overcome, and will it create further

difficulties? Will it catch charities and donors inadvertently? I think

in particular of the examples that have been given of charities that

will have to look back at their records of regular donors to see at

what point they might have become significant donors. I shall be

grateful for clarification from the Paymaster

General.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000441"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Good afternoon, Sir John. I

compliment the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). This is

a complex set of amendments, and he advanced his arguments very

clearly. He made it clear that they are probing amendments, and

acknowledged that there are issues to be dealt with, as did the hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne.</div>

<a name="060518137000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to start by

answering the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions about the National

Trust. He looked perplexed as he was making his statements and I was

startled. There were two points. The first concerned a charity that

pays more than the market rate. I have to say that any charity that did

that would be in breach of charity law; such a situation has nothing to

do with the Bill. If he wishes to make the point differently after the

debate, I would be happy for him to write to me. As I am sure Members

would all agree, however, 99.9 per cent. of charities do not undertake

that type of planning, and they comply with the generous reliefs that

apply. Secondly, he asked about tenants in historical premises. My

understanding on that point is that contractual arrangements will not

be caught by the new rules&#151;that is

clear.</div><a name="060518137000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two points

made by the hon. Gentleman go to the heart of the difficulties with the

clauses and to the substantive debate on them, so I should like to

remind Committee members why the provisions are necessary. I assume

that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne wants to know how much

abuse there is already. Substantial donors either make payments or

transfer assets to charities, and then receive back money, shares or

property. Reliefs in the form of gift aid payments or share relief

payments are then triggered depending on which of those applies. Having

obtained the relief, the donor then gets back a loan that may, for

example, carry no repayment schedule with it&#151;in fact, the

charity may not want to be paid back at all. So the substantial donor

status is used as a money box to attract more reliefs, which is clearly

not a charitable function. I think that that is scandalous and

despicable.</div> <a name="060518137000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its

reaction to the proposed provisions the charity sector has made it

clear that it takes the same view. I agree with the Charity Finance

Directors Group when it

said:</div><a name="060518137000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

essential that the charity brand is protected and not tainted by

association with tax avoidance

schemes.&#148;</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 281</div><a name="060518137000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, the Charity Reform Group

said that it</div> <a name="060518137000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;strongly

welcomes the introduction of measures to prevent the exploitation of

tax reliefs for charities by substantial donors for their own

benefit&#148;</div><a name="060518137000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;rather

than that of the charity. I could go on with a long list of important

organisations that have

commented.</div><a name="060518137000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall deal in turn with each of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s substantive

points on the amendments and explain why the Government regard them as

unnecessary, because it seems to me that the amendments are based on a

misunderstanding of what the clauses seek to achieve. There was some

recent unfavourable coverage in the magazine <i class="I">Charity Finance</i>,

but I do not believe that the fears that have driven the drafting of

the amendments will

materialise.</div><a name="060518137000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

trigger comes not when the substantial donor makes a payment or

transfers property to a charity. The trigger comes if there is then a

relationship between the charity and the substantial donor, whereby

something comes out of the charity. That is what starts the clock. The

terms are not unfavourable for the charity, but they are most

definitely favourable for the substantial donor, and that is not the

point of the charity reliefs and their support.</div>

<a name="060518137000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of the charitable

reliefs is to assist people in charitable giving and to enable that to

happen, not to allow wealthy individuals to find ways of getting

reliefs to which they are not entitled and damaging the process or, as

the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne said, attempting to apply

undue pressure on charities in order to get that

advantage.</div>

<a name="060518137000233"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000442"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Although I cannot but agree with the Paymaster

General and support her substantive point, the use of slightly

selective quotes concerns me. Yes, the Charity Finance Directors Group

was complimentary about the measure, and so was the Charities Tax

Reform Group, to which the Minister referred, which

said:</div><a name="060518137000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While

CTRG strongly supports measures to prevent the tax reliefs for

charities being abused, we are concerned that it will become a

responsibility on the charity to police transactions entered into with

substantial donors and it will be the charity that could face a tax

liability where it fails to do so even if

innocently.&#148;</div><a name="060518137000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the

&#147;innocent&#148; matter that my hon. Friend the Member for

Wycombe and the Charities Tax Reform Group

raised.</div>

<a name="060518137000235"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000443"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I shall come to those points, and the

amendments, in a moment. I shall be careful here because our debates

have an important audience that we want to reassure.</div>

<a name="060518137000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the hon. Gentleman,

first, that charities understand their obligations under charity law

and they ensure that the transactions that they undertake are in the

best interests of the charity. Those organisations are equally able to

understand&#151;although they may be subject to pressure, on which I

cannot comment&#151;when they are making what is in effect an

unrelievable transaction or one that is clearly not to the benefit of

the charity. That is what is at the heart of the

proposal.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 282</div><a name="060518137000237"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000444"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> Will the hon. Lady give

way?</div>

<a name="060518137000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000445"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will let me make progress

on the amendments he will see that his fears about whether innocent

transactions will be caught or about the requirement for more

record-taking and so on are unfounded, and I will try to reassure

him.</div> <a name="060518137000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of

possible loss, it is very difficult to give a precise figure because

much of it would not necessarily be reported to HMRC, but on the basis

of the information that HMRC currently has, &#163;60 million of

reliefs are finding their way to being used in that avoidance

mechanism. It is in the best interests of charities and of taxpayers

that that loss of revenue is not seen either to increase or to close

off the opportunities, as the amendments propose.</div>

<a name="060518137000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite the reverse of the

points that have been made in the debate, the measure protects

charities because it makes it clearer under what circumstances they can

make transactions. Those transactions that fall outside those

circumstances are not therefore relievable, although they are not

supposed to undertake any transactions as charities that are not in

pursuit of their charitable aims, so there is a little mixing of the

pot.</div> <a name="060518137000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">As an

experienced Chairman of our Committees, Sir John, and of the

charities on behalf of which you are very active, you will know that

charities are extremely careful to ensure that they comply with

charitable law, in the best interests of their objectives, unlike

individuals who may just want extra money from the taxpayer to which

they are not

entitled.</div><a name="060518137000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

pm</div><a name="060518137000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 77 and 79 deal with the sale or letting of property or the

provision of services by a charity to a substantial donor. There is no

exception for the provision of property and only a limited one for

services provided by a charity as part of its primary charitable

purposes. However, a charge would only arise on a charity under

proposed section 506A(4) where the terms of the transaction are less

beneficial to the charity than would be expected in an arm&#146;s

length transaction&#151;and then, only the difference in terms. So,

this is saying to a charity that it should make sure it does not make

transactions that are actually less beneficial to it. Amendments Nos.

77 and 79 replicate that effect, so they are unnecessary, as provision

has already been made.</div>

<a name="060518137000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 78 and 80

deal, as the hon. Member for Wycombe said, with the sale or letting of

property, or the provision of services, by a substantial donor to a

charity. Expenditure by a charity on such transactions is treated as

non-charitable expenditure by virtue of proposed section 506A(3) and

will result in a restriction of the charity&#146;s tax exemptions. An

exception removes the charity from such treatment where it is

purchasing property or services from a substantial donor&#146;s

business&#151;we are not saying that there is no

relationship&#151;on terms that are no less beneficial to the charity

than the arm&#146;s length terms; that is, the same as everybody

else. The intention is to ensure that most commercial transactions

between a charity and a substantial donor are not caught.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column282" />Column number: 283</div><a name="060518137000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 78 and 80 have

the opposite effect. As we discussed, their effect is entirely

contradictory by ensuring that clause 54 catches only transactions that

are more beneficial to the charity than the arm&#146;s length terms,

and lets out the very transactions that the clauses are designed to

stop&#151;namely, those that are on terms detrimental to the charity.

I think the hon. Gentleman acknowledged that that may have been down to

a drafting error when he made the point that he was really seeking

clarification, as we go through the various subsections of proposed

section 506A, on what exactly happens there.</div>

<a name="060518137000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 81 seeks to

prevent exchanges of property between a substantial donor and a charity

from being caught by the rules. As with amendments Nos. 77 and 79, it

is unnecessary as a charge will arise under proposed section 506A(4)

only in relation to an exchange of property where the terms of the

transaction are less beneficial to the charity than the arm&#146;s

length terms.</div>

<a name="060518137000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 82 seeks to

ensure that any transaction involving investments would qualify for

relief under schedule 20 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988

and will not be caught by the new rules. I am afraid that I could not

support such a change. Schedule 20 provides charities with a list of

qualifying investments and loans that are acceptable for charity

investment. While that works well for most charities, it is at times

open to abuse by controlled charities. Clause 54 imposes additional

protection, trying to ensure that such abuse cannot occur.</div>

<a name="060518137000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 83 and 84 seek

to remove entirely the charging provisions from the legislation. Hon.

Members will not be surprised to hear that I am not at all attracted to

that idea. It would leave legislation that would have no effect. I am

trying to convey to the Committee how important it is as a matter of

principle for charities and for the continuation of security that those

who give to charities believe that they will

have.</div><a name="060518137000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

83 removes section 506A(3). That is the principal charging mechanism in

clause 54. If I accepted the amendment, which I will not, HMRC would be

unable to restrict a charity&#146;s tax exemption where it entered

into a transaction with a substantial donor that is not otherwise

accepted. Instead HMRC would be forced to rely on the application of

section 506A(4) to penalise such behaviour. However, amendment No. 84

also calls for the removal of section 506A(4), which is the secondary

charging provision. The legislation would be effectively gutted. I have

tried to make it clear why clause 54 is necessary to prevent the abuse

of the charity

reliefs.</div><a name="060518137000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 85 is intended to ensure that employees of a charity are able to

donate large sums to the charity without being designated as

substantial donors. I cannot accept the amendment. An extension of the

rule that prevents a payment of remuneration for services as a trustee

is on the face of it reasonable, but the rules are targeted at those

who abuse the reliefs. Providing for the payment of employees not to be

caught would enable artificial employments to be created by those still

seeking to abuse the charitable relief.</div>

<a name="060518137000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Charitable workers are not

always the most well-paid people. It is almost a vocation. The

individuals concerned are making a huge contribution. In looking across

the work of charities and how much they pay 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 284</div>and whom they employ I do not see that the problem could arise and so it

increases my anxiety that ghost employment might be created here in

order to create a category of

employees.</div><a name="060518137000251"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000446"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> The Paymaster General said that she was minded

not to accept amendment No. 85. She said that the rules are targeted at

those who abuse the reliefs. But will the proposed changes also catch

those who do not abuse the reliefs? If so, what justification is there

for

that?</div><a name="060518137000252"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000447"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I was going to come to the point about those

who do not abuse the reliefs. I touched on it in my opening remarks. If

the charities are behaving according to charity law and are acting in

the best interests of their charitable objectives, they cannot

innocently have been in a transaction of this type because they would

have noticed that they were paying or transferring value to a

substantial donor that would not have been in the best interests of the

charity. That comes back to the point about record keeping. Charities

know well enough what they are doing. The overwhelming majority will

have no concerns about the clauses. Although it is unfortunate, it

sometimes happens&#151;thus the requirement on

HMRC.</div><a name="060518137000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some

who, to put it politely, have the wrong end of the stick about what is

happening. They have raised a number of questions in the amendments. I

can understand why charities would be fearful if such concerns were

well founded, but they are not. Those who have moved the amendments are

mistaken. That is why I am taking as much care as I can in responding

to give assurance that the fears underpinning the

amendments&#151;more record-keeping, taxation of innocent

transactions, restriction of charities&#151;are ill-founded. The hon.

Member for Falmouth and Camborne hit the nail on the head when she said

that the legislation will actually stop the pressure that might be

applied to charities by those who might seek to achieve an advantage

for themselves.</div><a name="060518137000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since

1997, the Government have given great care to such questions. I have a

long list of all the legislation, changes in tax and work that we have

done with the charitable and voluntary sector. I shall not read it out,

but it cannot be disputed that we have done everything possible at

every point to assist charities and charitable

giving.</div><a name="060518137000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

86 aims to ensure that when a substantial donor sells or leases

property or provides services to a charity, such transactions will be

excepted where the transaction takes place at arm&#146;s length.

Again, I cannot accept the amendment. As I mentioned in relation to an

earlier amendment, proposed new section 506B(1) contains an exception

that will ensure that the sale or letting of property or the provision

of services by a substantial donor will not be caught by the rules

where they are provided in the course of the substantial donor&#146;s

business on terms that are no less official to the charity than the

arm&#146;s length terms. The overwhelming majority of such

transactions will take place in the course of a donor&#146;s

business. The exception in section 506B(1) strikes the

balance between eliminating the avoidance risk and ensuring

that innocent commercial transactions 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 285</div>entered into by charities are not caught. We are trying to do precisely

what the hon. Member for Wycombe

suggested.</div><a name="060518137000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 87 seeks to extend the investments that a charity can make in a

donor&#146;s business to include shares and securities listed on a

market recognised by the European Union, securities admitted to trading

on the alternative investment market and any investment that is a

qualified investment for the purposes of schedule 20 to the Income and

Corporation Taxes Act

1988.</div><a name="060518137000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing

exemption in section 506B(4) prevents investments in shares or

securities listed on recognised stock exchanges from being caught by

the new laws. Such an exception is drafted widely enough to prevent the

most common charity investments from being caught. Although extending

the list of investments to include those in the European Union list

sounds desirable, I do not believe that there is a material difference

between the lists of exchanges maintained by the European Union and

those on the list of recognised stock

exchanges.</div><a name="060518137000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): I am not clear about how

that will work in practice. It would be usual for a charity to hand

over its investment responsibilities to a bank. It would agree an

overall strategy but, having handed matters over to a bank, would not

be involved in detailed decision making on individual investments.

However, the managing bank might invest in a portfolio that included

someone who had made an donation. Will my right hon. Friend clarify

that that situation will not be caught by the

clause?</div><a name="060518137000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000449"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> That would not be caught because such matters

would be part of the charity&#146;s usual business when pursuing its

objectives. We thought that the particular abuse in a small number of

cases had been made clear to the charitable sector in respect of the

relationship between the substantial donor and the charity in the sense

of money shares, property going in and benefit coming directly out to

the individual.</div><a name="060518137000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was

trying not to jump around in respect of the amendments, but the

donation could have made to the charity by a substantial donor and the

benefits be yet to be acquired. The provision would make sure that

those benefits could not be acquired, though substantial donors had

still given money to the charity that had received the necessary

relief. We should applaud the donors for that, but they will not be

receiving benefit as a result of the provision. Confusion arises under

amendment No. 91 about whether the action is retrospective. I am sure

that members of the Committee are not suggesting that, when someone has

already arranged for a completely unacceptable use of charitable

reliefs, we should allow it to continue. As I said, that is triggered

by what happens to what comes out of the charity&#151;hence, the

period of six

years.</div><a name="060518137000261"></a>

case of the charity with an interest or property that it invests in an

individual&#146;s company at a high rate, but receives a poor rate of

return, and it is absolutely transparent to everyone that that is the

case. That is not really something that we expect charities to feel it

they.</div><a name="060518137000264"></a>

The worry that some of us have is about the bureaucratic burden that

may fall on charities to check previous donations to ensure how far

back they need to go to be confident that they will not be caught under

clause

54.</div><a name="060518137000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000456"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is

struggling with the idea that somehow a charity does not know that it

is about to invest in a company that has been triggered. The charity

might choose that company because it is wholly owned by a substantial

donor or is receiving a substantial loan with no repayment details and

an understanding that the loan will be struck out. I cannot believe

that a charity will not know clearly the relationship between the

substantial donor and the proposed transaction.</div>

<a name="060518137000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue that the hon.

Gentleman raised was about innocents being affected. The transactions

in question may be acceptable in the best interests of the charity if

they trigger reliefs in pursuit of charitable objectives and in the

course of the substantial donor&#146;s &#147;normal

business,&#148; or if the charity might have had the same

relationship with any other company without a substantial donor. I am

trying to be clear and reassure the Committee that the aim is to target

mischief, not to prevent charities from working. The question of the

time involved is difficult. In exceptional circumstances, the HMRC has

seen that, in such schemes, there might be quite a long gap between

resources going in and benefit coming

out.</div><a name="060518137000269"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000457"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I understand that the target of the

regulations is charities that are consciously exploiting loopholes and

seeking to benefit a major donor. Will the Paymaster General accept

that there are charities with substantial major donors that are acting

perfectly within the law but will now have to take on an additional

burden of

compliance?</div><a name="060518137000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000458"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> No, I cannot accept that. We are discussing a

very narrow set of circumstances. If a charity is complying with

charity law and the requirements of its charitable status, all its

transactions should comply with them. That is true particularly if the

charity is accessing reliefs that are specifically for charitable

purposes.</div>

<a name="060518137000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

discussing whether the transactions in question should enable access to

reliefs. If hon. Members can 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 287</div>give me specific examples&#151;it does not have to be done

today&#151;I will certainly consider the issues raised. If examples

cannot be provided, with an explanation of why the people involved

should not be covered by the measure or should be because they are

committing the abuse that we are trying to deal with, I cannot address

the more general matter of whether innocents will be caught. I say to

the Committee and those who listen to our proceedings that if they have

more information than they have provided us with to date, they should

come forward with it. Our current information is not detailed

enough.</div><a name="060518137000272"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000459"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I seek to give such an example. My concern relates

solely to subsection (1)(d) in proposed new section 506A

on</div><a name="060518137000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision of

services to a charity and a substantial

donor&#148;.</div><a name="060518137000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">There might be

individuals who are not substantial donors, but who are providing

services to a charity, such as their own time for lay review on a

charity&#146;s medical committee. Individuals whose donations differ

from year to year may suddenly become beneficiaries of a windfall, have

substantial funds to make available to a charity and then make a

substantial donation. As a result, their relationship might be caught

under the provisions in clause 54.</div>

<a name="060518137000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under proposed new section

506B(1), it will be for the HMRC to determine whether a transaction is

caught by those provisions. I am concerned about record keeping, as is

the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. For reasons with which all

Members will sympathise, we are placing an obligation on charities that

extends way beyond what is necessary to restrict dubious transactions,

which the Paymaster General is rightly seeking to do.</div>

<a name="060518137000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster General might

say that my example is not relevant and that such relief will not apply

because it will be caught by the exemptions. Surely, however, that does

not obviate the need for the charities to continue to keep records of

individuals who might become substantial donors. I do not have a

problem with that going forward, but there is a problem if charities

have to look back through the records for anybody who might

subsequently be caught under the

clause.</div><a name="060518137000276"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000460"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman entirely.

Fundraising charities know who their major donors are; that is good

fundraising practice. They keep such records and invest a great deal of

time and effort into securing their revenue, or future increases in

it.</div> <a name="060518137000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new

section 506B(1) ensures that the</div>

<a name="060518137000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sale or letting of

property&#148;,</div> <a name="060518137000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>

<a name="060518137000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision of

services...by a substantial

donor&#148;</div><a name="060518137000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">will not be

caught by the rules when provided in the course of the substantial

donor&#146;s business</div>

<a name="060518137000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on terms which are no less

beneficial to the charity than...a transaction at arm&#146;s

length&#148;.</div> <a name="060518137000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">That draws the

distinction in the relationship with a substantial donor with which we

are trying to deal.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 288</div><a name="060518137000281"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000461"></a>Helen

Goodman:</b> Does my right hon. Friend agree that there will

not be a burden on charities of increased record keeping? Every year

they submit their reporting accounts to Companies House, at the back of

which must be an annexe listing all donors, including donors

substantially below the level set out here. Furthermore, they are

required to keep copies of those accounts going back either seven or 10

years&#151;I cannot remember which. Certainly, that covers the

proposals in the

clause.</div><a name="060518137000282"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000462"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. In my experience,

charities are very thorough about knowing who their substantial donors

are and about ensuring the best possible outcome in the interest of

their charitable objectives. That matter is being confused here. The

issue is not whether they have a relationship with substantial donors

for the provision of businesses or services, but that that is conducted

in a transparent way. I know of no charity that does not drive a hard

bargain in seeking to get services, provisions or support in the best

possible circumstances for that charity and its purposes. They are

excellent at it, and a jolly good job too. That is part of making sure

that their resources are efficiently

used.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000463"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I come back to this question of timing. The

Paymaster General may be pleased to know that I will approach this from

a slightly different tack and for argument&#146;s sake I fully accept

her point that clause 54 relates only to dubious transactions that

should be picked up. If the donations were made in 1996, 1997 or 1998

and then the payment under subsection (3) or the transaction at less

than arm&#146;s length value in subsection (4) occurs in 2006, will

the clause be effective in dealing with that? In other words, will it

deal with mischief going back 11 years or does it go back only five or

six

years?</div><a name="060518137000284"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000464"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> In all truthfulness it is feasible that there

could be limited circumstances in which it could go back 11 years. The

hon. Gentleman suggests that the abuse has gone on for a much longer

period of time and is much more widespread than HMRC believes.

HMRC&#146;s view will be based on information and knowledge that it

collects in running the tax system on our behalf. I cannot give the

hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance that there might not be

exceptional circumstances and some charities might be in that position.

In those circumstances, they would need intensive support and clear

guidance from HMRC, but that happens in the tax system in exceptional

circumstances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000465"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> My point was merely a question of interpretation as

to what the clause is saying. I think that the Paymaster General has

clarified that. Because of the &#163;100,000 over six years, it may

be possible to look back 11 years. That is a point that charities will

need to bear in mind, whether they are acting mischievously or

otherwise.</div><a name="060518137000286"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000466"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The best way to avoid that is not to engage in

those arrangements from now on. Charities 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 289</div>will then not have to look back, so the issues that the hon. Gentleman

raises will not need to be addressed. This rather flexible use, perhaps

unintentionally, of retrospection came in because it is the second part

of the transaction when that is triggered.</div>

<a name="060518137000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not speak to the

Government amendments. The hon. Gentleman and others have welcomed them

and it was necessary for the Government to make them. I hope that I

have assured the

Committee&#151;</div><a name="060518137000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060518137000467"></a><b class="B">Sir

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): On Government

amendment No. 63, which as the Paymaster General said is welcomed by

registered social landlords, can she confirm that the Treasury cleared

it with the Housing Corporation and that those transactions that will

now be exempted by the Treasury will not be caught by the Housing

Corporation objecting to substantial donations being made by a housing

association to a charity that it set

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000468"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman. I

cannot answer that detailed question. It is an important point and I

wish that I had thought of it. I will write to the right hon. Gentleman

and give every Committee member a copy of the letter. I shall keep my

fingers crossed that that is all in order, as it was precisely because

of the interaction with controls and regulations that it was felt that

these changes could be made. I do not quite have the confidence to give

the right hon. Gentleman a straight yes answer this minute.

<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> With the elapsing of 30 seconds, I am apparently

able to answer yes, but I should still like to consider the matter and

write to the right hon. Gentleman, because it is an important

point.</div><a name="060518137000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,

I hope that I have been able to convey to the Committee that the

Government took great care with this legislation and did their best to

obtain the correct balance between trying to stop the abuse of the

reliefs and ensuring as much as possible that the law-abiding charities

were not affected by these changes. I hope, therefore, that the hon.

Member for Wycombe, in the spirit that he moved the amendment, will not

press the amendments today, even if he wants to reserve his position on

some of the answers I have given. I hope that he is reassured on a

number of

points.</div><a name="060518137000291"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060518137000469"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for the

way in which she responded in her marathon speech that would otherwise

have been the responsibility of the Economic Secretary. She suggested,

at the start of her response, that some of the objections by the

Charities Tax Reform Group may 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 290</div>have come rather late and may work contrary to the general welcomes of

other organisations, which I mentioned on moving my

amendment.</div><a name="060518137000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reservations

have been expressed by others, including the Law Commission and the

Chartered Institute of Taxation, as I said, but generally the Paymaster

being caught, to say either, &#147;Innocent transactions won&#146;t

be caught and I give guarantees and assurances&#148;&#151;which

were welcome&#151;or that some of the examples given should be

exceptionable transactions. My hon. Friends and I still have some

reservations about her response, particularly to amendment No. 91 on

substantial donors. She argued that charities know who their

substantial donors are. However, there may be a donor who is a

substantial donor, who later, for one reason or another, stops being

one, or there may be a donor who was not a substantial donor, who later

becomes one. That takes us back to issues about bookkeeping and how far
