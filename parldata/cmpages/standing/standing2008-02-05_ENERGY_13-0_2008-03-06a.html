						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000455"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):
						</b> Good afternoon,
Mr. Amess. I was certainly in full flow, and about to
respond to my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet on whether the
power in clause 70 to require information on action from a licensee
arises too late in the process. I do not believe that that is the case,
and I am reassured by my Department&#146;s lawyers, who agree with
me. I believe that it happens in a timely way, and I hope to explain
why in reasonably plain English.
</div>
					<a name="08030654000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Secretary of State was uncertain about a licensee&#146;s ability
to plug an abandoned well at the time that the licensee requested
consent to drill, he would not grant consent. In other words, financial
scrutiny at the beginning is crucial. However, the power to require
information to be provided and action to be taken can be exercised at
any time after drilling has been started. The provision is designed to
cover situations where we believe that the licensee, having started to
drill a well, will start to or has started to run into financial
difficulties; or, further down the line, where we believe that the
licensee, after suspending a well, will start to or has started to run
into financial difficulties. We would then require the licensee to take
specific action, including providing financial security, which could
involve the licensee giving a letter of credit. However, if a
licensee&#146;s financial capacity comes increasingly into doubt, the
aim is to take the necessary action before he loses the necessary
capacity. Besides protecting the taxpayer and giving the Secretary of
State greater assurance that wells will be plugged and abandoned, it is
worth noting that the power will give him greater flexibility in
accepting small companies&#146; business plans. He will be able to
consider allowing wells to be suspended in cases where he might
otherwise have no choice but to require immediate abandonment. I hope
that that deals with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
South Thanet.</div>
					<a name="08030654000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
clarify a couple of other points raised this morning. I thank the hon.
Member for Wealden for asking about the difference between a well and a
borehole. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>We think that a well and a borehole are broadly the same. The definition
in the clause follows that used in model clauses for licences granted
since at least 1934, perhaps internationally. However, usage over time
may vary. I may be wrong, but I think that the reason behind that
question was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s memory that in
1923&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Laughter.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I do not mean his personal
memory but his sense of history. As most members of the Committee will
know, in 1923 the oldest extant licence was granted to the Duke of
Devonshire for what was then described as a borehole. I wonder whether
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s historical literacy was behind the
question; I am sure that he was not trying to catch me out.</div>
					<a name="08030654000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to provide clarity on
what I said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton,
Test about what would happen if existing oil and gas wells were to be
used for the purpose of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> storage. There is flexibility on
whether such wells would need to be capped and redrilled&#151;it
would depend on the needs of carbon storage.</div>
					<a name="08030654000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Wealden asked whether entire structures should be
decommissioned, including everything below the seabed and the
associated pipelines. An international convention&#151;the OSPAR
convention, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory&#151;requires
that redundant installations are removed to shore for re-use, recycling
or disposal. To be more specific, the structures will be cut off below
the seabed, the wells will be sealed at the reservoir, and the pipe
work will be removed to a depth usually of 2 m or 3 m below the seabed.
A small number of installations may be given exemptions allowing them
to be left in place, because that is the most practicable option.
However, cutting them off at that distance below the seabed should help
in relation to the issue that was raised about
fishermen&#146;s&#151;or fisherperson&#146;s&#151;nets,
dragging and so on. I hope that that is a useful response.</div>
					<a name="08030654000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pipelines may
be decommissioned by removing them to shore for recycling of the steel
or, if they are already buried and therefore not a hazard, they may be
left in place. The Secretary of State&#146;s powers under the 1998
Act enable him to control the choice of decommissioning options, having
regard to the international convention and the impacts on safety,
environment and other users of the sea&#151;and, of course, the
taxpayer.</div>

							<b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): I thank the Minister for that very
helpful response and for the additional detail that he has been able to
give us. I would certainly never seek to catch him out&#151;he is far
too nimble-footed for that. My interest was much more parochial than he
suggests. My constituency is adjacent to Royal Tunbridge Wells, and I
have always wondered why it is not called Royal Tunbridge Borehole. I
am grateful to him for making the distinction so

Wicks:
						</b> &#147;Disgruntled of Tunbridge Borehole&#148;
has a certain ring to it, but we had better not go
there.</div>
					<a name="08030654000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a term of existing petroleum licences that a licence cannot be
transferred without the Secretary of State&#146;s prior consent. That
is to ensure that interests in a licence are not transferred to a party
or parties who would not have gained the Secretary of State&#146;s
consent for such a transfer had he been asked. The Secretary of State
needs such powers for situations where, for example, the licences
transferred to parties who will not or cannot put enough time and
resource into recovering oil and gas from the area. It is important
that licensees&#146; objectives are aligned with the
Government&#146;s aim of maximising production from the UK
continental shelf. However, despite the requiring of the Secretary of
State&#146;s consent to transfer a licence, experience has shown that
there can be circumstances where a licence interest has been
transferred without it. In such situations, under current provisions,
the Secretary of State could accept the transfer&#151;although if it
has already been decided that the new licensee is unsuitable, that
would not rectify the problem&#151;or revoke the whole licence,
although that would mean that any new licensee would need to wait until
the next licensing round to get the licence, which could significantly
delay production. However, the Secretary of State could not force the
parties to transfer the licence back.</div>
					<a name="08030654000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that the Secretary
of State&#146;s having the power to direct that a transfer revert
back to the transferor is a better solution because the transferor
would then have the option of transferring the rights under the licence
to a more suitable person. In turn, that would mean that production on
the field could continue. The clause allows the Secretary of State to
direct that the licence interest revert back to the transferor, should
he think fit. I believe that that creates an important safeguard and an
effective incentive for licensees to comply with the existing
requirements of a licence and to seek the Secretary of State&#146;s
consent before going ahead with any potential licence transfers. I
reiterate that this does not change any of the existing obligations
about seeking prior consent for transfers from the Secretary of State;
rather, it creates an effective system for addressing any such
transfers if the Secretary of State believes it appropriate to do
so.</div>
					<a name="08030654000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order to
ensure that the Secretary of State has the information necessary to
identify whether an unconsented licence transfer has taken place, the
clause also allows the commissioners for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs to give specific information to the Secretary of State for
the purposes of determining whether that has taken place. That ensures
that any actions that the Secretary of State may wish to take are fully
informed.</div>
					<a name="08030654000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08030654000458"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Given that the clause gives
the Secretary of State new powers relating to the uncontested transfer
of rights or benefits under petroleum licences, why is the Secretary of
State being granted these new powers at this point? What has gone wrong
in the past which has led to this need for additional
legislation?</div>
				
					<a name="08030654000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000459"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I hoped that I had touched on that in my opening
remarks, but I will try to give greater clarity in a few
moments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div>
					<a name="08030654000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to protect the information and the people to whom it refers.
That is why the clause sets out that the information supplied by the
commissioners at HM Revenue and Customs must be limited to that
necessary for the Secretary of State&#146;s decision. There are also
restrictions on the purposes for which the information can be used. The
clause also, in line with the rules on sharing information between
Government Departments, makes it an offence for information to be
further disclosed without the permission of the commissioners of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the people identified in the
information, or in pursuance of a court order. If found guilty of that
offence, a person will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine up
to the statutory maximum and, on indictment, to a fine, imprisonment of
up to two years, or both.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000460"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> May we have clarification on a couple of issues?
In what circumstances is the Secretary of State&#146;s consent
required? Is it always required if a licence is being transferred? Will
the Minister clarify the rules regarding the trading of licences? Are
people allowed to trade licences, subject to the consent of the
Secretary of State, and in what circumstances might he use his powers
to revert the licence to the transferor? Would it happen automatically
if it were an unconsented transfer, or only if the Secretary of State
had additional concerns about the consequences of that
transfer?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000461"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Let me deal first with the question from the hon.
Member for East Devon. As I have explained in the context of one or two
other clauses, the circumstances in the North sea UK CS are changing.
Whereas in the past it was dominated by relatively few big
players&#151;the well-known names&#151;the field is maturing as
some of the big players give priority to fields elsewhere in the world
and there are opportunities for new enterprise companies to come
forward, and issues of security have arisen. A number of smaller
players are active on the continental shelf. That is welcome, but the
other side of that coin is that they are potentially less financially
viable. We therefore thought it important to use the Bill as an
opportunity to introduce new
safeguards.</div>
					<a name="08030654000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wealden asked several questions, and I may not be able
to answer them all at this precise moment. He asked in what
circumstances consent is required and whether it is always required.
The answer is that it is always required. Moving on&#151;seamlessly,
I hope&#151;he also asked whether licences can be traded if the
Secretary of State agrees. Yes, they can. Indeed, that is now an
important part of the market. However, licensees can also transfer the
benefits without his consent, and that causes a disparity between the
benefits and the obligations of a licence. Perhaps that was not so
seamless. I need to clarify that point, as I muddled myself.</div>
					<a name="08030654000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question of whether the
Secretary of State will always revoke the licence of unconsented
transfers or do so only if there are other concerns, some unconsented
transfers are acceptable, but we would use the powers only if there
were concerns about one of the parties involved in the
transfer&#151;for example, about their financial health. If I can
clarify other matters later, I will do so.</div>

closely as I should have been and what the Minister said was brilliant,

							<a name="08030654000464"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> This clause will give effect to the amendment of
the terms of existing petroleum licences, as set out in schedule 3.
Section 4 of the Petroleum  Act 1998 allows the Secretary of
State to set out in regulations model clauses, which are incorporated
into petroleum licences. Section 4 requires that any regulations
prescribing model clauses for such licences are made through secondary
legislation. However, new regulations will affect only licences granted
after the regulations come into
force.</div>
					<a name="08030654000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
section 4 powers do not allow the Secretary of State to make
regulations amending the terms of existing licences, we are making
changes to existing licences by way of clause 72 and schedule 3. The
Government have used primary legislation to amend the terms of existing
licences in that way in the past. For example, amendments were made to
existing petroleum licences under the Petroleum and Submarine
Pipe-lines Act 1975, the Petroleum Act 1987, the Offshore Safety Act
1992 and section 5(5) of the Petroleum Act
1998.</div>
					<a name="08030654000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 3 will
amend the model clauses in four ways: first, by requiring licensees to
provide up-to-date contact details to Ministers to ensure that the
Minister can send notices and directions to the licensees; and
secondly, by allowing the Minister to issue a notice requiring
licensees to plug and abandon wells to reduce the risk of a licensee
leaving a well suspended, but not properly plugged and abandoned, for a
number of years and then not having the funds to plug and abandon it
properly at the end of their licence. Without that power, there would
be an increased risk of the liability falling to the
taxpayer.</div>
					<a name="08030654000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
such amendments can be made by extending the circumstances in which the
Secretary of State can revoke a licence in the event of a change of
control. The Secretary of State can currently revoke a licence if there
is a change of control or of the person to whom it was originally
granted, the Minister objects to the change of control, and the
licensee does not take the requisite steps to address the
Minister&#146;s
objections.</div>
					<a name="08030654000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new model clauses will extend the power, so that it can apply to anyone
the licence is assigned to, not just to the person to whom it was
originally granted. That is important because it is always necessary,
at any stage of a licence, to ensure that licensees are
suitable&#151;for example, that they are interested in and capable of
maximising 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>production on the UK CS. Without that power,  if a licence is
transferred to a party that experiences a change of control, the
Minister could not revoke  the
licence.</div>
					<a name="08030654000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
the Minister will be given a power partly to revoke a licence, so that
if one person in a consortium that holds a licence breaches certain
terms&#151;for example, becomes insolvent&#151;the Minister can,
rather than revoking the whole licence, partly revoke the licence
interest of the defaulting person. That is important because, in some
circumstances, it will allow a consortium to continue production,
rather than revoking the licence and forcing the remaining members of
the consortium to wait for the next licensing round to reapply for one
if they want to continue
production.</div>
					<a name="08030654000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will also set some conditions on the operation of those amendments to
the model clauses to ensure that all relevant licences already in
existence before commencement are amended with the new model clauses.
That is important to ensure consistency across the petroleum licensing

licences should contain these new model clauses, in certain
circumstances, where things happened before commencement of the Act, it
would be unfair to apply the rules retrospectively. So, for example,
the clause sets it out that, if the drilling of the well started before
commencement, the power to require a licensee to plug and abandon it
will not apply. It also sets it out that, if the event that leads to
the need for partial revocation happens before commencement, the power
will not
apply.</div>

Mr. Amess. I wish to address some of the issues raised by
the Minister, but I had expected to do so under schedule 3, which is
listed as the next item for consideration. I seek your advice on the
appropriate point at which to refer to the detail of schedule 3, which
addresses the same
points.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): The Minister has
confused me a little, although that is not unusual. I am concerned
about capping and abandoning a well in a given set of circumstances. I
assume that that will take place when an unconsented transfer has
happened&#151;that is, one without the Minister&#146;s consent. I
assume that, if the Minister thinks that the person to whom the
transfer is made is unsuitable to carry out the responsibilities, he
will also assume that the transfer has not taken place and the original
licensee will be told that he has to close and cap the well if the
Minister thinks that that is necessary.
</div>
					<a name="08030654000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legal matters are
likely to arise in such complicated situations, and I do not understand
what will happen. Will the Minister tell me in what circumstances he
might tell the original licensee to cap and abandon the well, what cost
there would be and whether it would be easy to open the well again
without too much cost? These are valuable resources to the nation, and
capping a well seems a pretty drastic step.</div>

							<a name="08030654000468"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Yes, I agree; we are trying to establish a regime
that will lead to that happening only in extremis. We need a regime
whereby licences can be transferred only in bona fide circumstances.
Much of this part of the Bill will put in place that regulatory system,
so that we can ensure that decommissioning is done effectively, at the
right time and in a way that does not jeopardise the taxpayer&#146;s
interest. That is the burden of this part of the
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000469"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> Can the Minister give me an idea of the cost of
capping and abandoning and then later reopening a well? I want to be
clear in my mind what the cost of the exercise will be for the people
granted the licence in the first instance, because that is where it
will revert, will it
not?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000470"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The endeavour will be to ensure that a well is not
capped while it still has economic life. Given the market situation,
there is every chance that another commercial player could be brought
in. However, I am advised that a well cannot be reopened once it has
been plugged and abandoned. We abandon only those wells that have no
economic life remaining. After all, they are valuable assets. I am also
advised that the cost of capping could be &#163;1 million to
&#163;10 million. There is a double jeopardy in the economics, which
is why we try to keep wells open.</div>

							<a name="08030654000471"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Those comments raise another issue: who decides
that the well is empty? We know from how drilling and extraction are
done that often substantial reserves&#151;20 per cent.
perhaps&#151;are left underground. Will a well be considered empty
because a large concern decides not to go on extracting oil or will it
have to be genuinely depleted before these actions come into
play?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000472"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I think that I used the phrase &#147;no economic
life remaining&#148;. That is not the same as saying that there is
not another barrel or so of oil down
there.</div>
					<a name="08030654000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We talked
earlier about the importance of enhanced oil recovery and the potential
to associate that with carbon capture and storage, for example. These
are largely commercial decisions, of course. It will be mainly up to
oil companies to make that judgment, albeit within the regulatory
framework. We are talking about a very good industry, whose
professionalism I have seen at first hand. No company is going to
abandon a well if it has commercial life left in it. It will be for the
licensee&#151;the company&#151;to judge, but as a safeguard,
Government will have to agree.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000473"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Some of the larger oil companies leave when a
significant amount of oil is left in the well. Indeed, other companies
have specialised in going into partly depleted oilfields and extracting
what remains. Although the major international companies might say that
it is not economical for them to do that, there is an economic benefit
to be pursued by a smaller company that has developed a niche market in
those areas. I hope that the Minister will not be guided only by what
the larger international companies say, if some smaller companies feel
that they can still go into those fields to extract more than is
currently being taken out.</div>

							<a name="08030654000474"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I understand the point that a time comes when a
large company wants to move on&#151;its geographical priorities may
lie elsewhere&#151;and that provides an opportunity for a smaller
company. However, one would imagine that the larger company would see
some commercial advantage in arranging a transfer to the new player,
because I assume that financing would be involved. I do not think that
it is in anyone&#146;s interest simply to abandon such a
resource.</div>
					<a name="08030654000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I was asked how we obtain the information that a company is no longer
using its well. We know that by a variety of means; largely through the
normal dialogue that takes place between the regulator and the
licensee, and not least because the regular well production reports
would start to  fall to zero.</div>

							<a name="08030654000475"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> Is there anything in the legislation, or anything
further envisaged, that would stop companies creating a bank of
drillable wells that still have resources within them, to maximise what
is coming out of the North sea? Is there anything in legislation that
prevents companies from stockpiling assets without exploiting
them?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000476"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> We have an effective partnership with the industry,
known as the PILOT partnership, which the Secretary of State now
chairs. There are regular meetings, which I normally attend, in which a
range of matters are discussed. I am therefore confident that we have
arrived at an acceptance of a &#147;use it or lose it&#148;
principle. The industry itself has signed up to that. If a large
company&#151;it might not always be a large company&#151;decides
that its priorities lie elsewhere, there is a recognition that the
licensed work should transfer to another company, given the importance
of the UK CS to the British economy. I am satisfied that the regime in
place is truly the envy of the world. Many oil company executives tell
me that they wish other  zones had that kind of partnership, so
I think that we have got it
right.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000477"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> It is good to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Amess. The Minister said that such decisions
would be essentially commercial, yet the powers in the clause are given
to him and not to the commercial operators. Therefore, the Department
for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will be evaluating the
commercial considerations. A rather crucial consideration that comes
into play is the future cost of climate change, especially if, as the
Minister says, the wells covered by the clause could be used for carbon
capture and
storage.</div>
					<a name="08030654000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Stern report recommended that we take the future cost of climate change
into account in making commercial decisions now. That was a key
recommendation, and it suggested a methodology based on a rather
optimistic outlook that may or may not be right. Not all the measures
that the world was trying to put into place to reduce carbon emissions
will succeed. That seems to be a realistic
assumption.</div>
					<a name="08030654000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stern
recommended that methodology as the commercial basis for calculating
the future cost of climate change. That would be important if wells had
a value related to carbon capture and storage. If the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>future price of carbon was expected to be high, carbon capture and
storage would probably be more viable in that respect. If the price was
artificially low, it would be less viable. Will the Minister confirm
that, in any commercial calculations that DBERR might make under the
clause, it would follow the methodology advocated by the Stern report
in calculating the future cost of climate
change?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, most of
this is about commercial judgment, commercial decisions, and deals and
partnerships between different commercial entities. However, the state
does not hold its hand. The state intervenes through a regulatory
process. The state intervenes through the PILOT partnership that I have
just described&#151;the use it or lose it, or fallow approach. The
state is actively involved. In these clauses we are trying to do our
utmost to ensure that there is final and effective decommissioning of
this infrastructure in our seas. We want to ensure that if one company
runs into financial difficulties and an associated company is involved,
decommissioning still happens, but not at the expense of the taxpayer.
That is what this is all
about.</div>
					<a name="08030654000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman introduces a far wider subject, which is featured in various
parts of the Bill. We have already discussed carbon capture and storage
and I feel confident that we will be able to demonstrate its value and
practicality. Given that the most obvious place in the UK to store
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> is under the sea in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, we
need to think this through. We are doing that, but we have some time to
consider the interface between the oil and gas industry and the
reservoirs and pipelines and the kind of infrastructure and regulatory
framework that we might one day need for CCS.</div>
					<a name="08030654000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the historian will
look back on this Bill&#151;I hope this will encourage Members during
the more tedious moments of dry explanation&#151;as the first time
that this Parliament looked ahead and sought to begin to put in place a
regulatory framework. Despite the Bill&#146;s excellence it will not
be the end of the story. We will need to make progress to ensure that
the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman are properly
considered.</div>

Horwood:
						</b> Perhaps I can buy the Minister a few more minutes
to glance at the advice that he might have been given. I hope that he
will respond to my substantial point about the future cost of climate
change and the carbon price that it would dictate in any cost benefit
analysis and commercial evaluation when deciding whether to maintain
access to a well or to plug and abandon it. The cost of carbon dictated
by the methodology on calculating the future costs of climate change is
crucial to that. Stern made clear recommendations on what that
methodology should be. I hope that the Minister can respond positively
now and say that DBERR, in making calculations like this, will use the
methodology on the future cost of carbon set out in the Stern
report.</div>

							<a name="08030654000480"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> The Stern report is a keynote document for the
century. I am not in a position yet to say the precise methodologies
that we will explore, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div>we are certainly seized of the need to relate our
thinking and planning on CCS to that on the UK CS. Where there is a
potential for CO<span class="Sub">2</span> to enhance economic production, for
example, we would want to insist that it happened. I may not entirely
understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from and perhaps there
will be another arena in which we can discuss this. It is not as if we
are being slow on CCS&#151;we are an active lead
nation.</div>

							<a name="08030654000481"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am not suggesting that we are going slow on
CCS, although I might have done so on other occasions. I am trying to
tease out the methodology that DBERR will use in calculating the cost
of carbon and whether it will be based on the methodology for the
future cost of climate change used in the Stern report. It is a fairly
straightforward question, although it may have a slightly complicated
answer, and it is critical to considerations such as this. If DBERR is
going to make essentially commercial evaluations of such projects, it
has to use a cost of carbon in its calculations. I am trying to work
out how it will calculate that cost and whether it will use the
methodology recommended in the Stern
report.</div>

							<a name="08030654000482"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I might need to come back to the hon. Gentleman on
those methodological issues once I have looked at the record and fully
understood his questions. It is not as if we are being relaxed about
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions. If companies in any arena emit large amounts
of CO<span class="Sub">2,</span> their activities will be captured by the European
Union&#146;s emissions trading scheme. They will therefore have
either to reduce their emissions&#151;that is what I would
hope&#151;or pay for any additional CO<span class="Sub">2</span> ETS allowances
that they would need to buy. I think that his point is more specific,
although I am not saying it is not important. With his approval, and
possibly without it, I will write to
him.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000483"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I am still concerned about the question of capping
and abandoning wells in the North Sea in relation to carbon capture and
storage and their potential use some considerable period hence after a
well has been abandoned. I think I understood the Minister correctly. I
think he said that, once a well had been capped and abandoned, it could
not be reopened. He also said that wells would only be capped and
abandoned in extremis. I am told by the industry that we could get up
to another 15 per cent. of additional oil using carbon capture and
storage from the North sea wells. The process and the technology for
doing that, however, are some way off. I wonder, therefore, what
&#147;in extremis&#148; means. I would hate the thought of capping
and abandoning a well which in 15, 20 or 25 years&#146; time could be
used not only for carbon capture and storage but to enhance our oil
energy needs at that time. Therefore, I want to understand what
&#147;in extremis&#148; means in that respect.</div>
					<a name="08030654000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is right to be
proud of the Bill. We are creating an important platform for the
future. Therefore, this is not a knocking process, but we need to
understand the possibilities inherent in additional North Sea
oil.</div>
					<a name="08030654000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000484"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I have touched on the issue of enhanced oil
recovery and I have said that, in future, where there is potential for
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> to enhance economic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>production, we would want that to happen. I am
thinking through the implications of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks. I agree with his train of thought and, although he was not
suggesting this scenario, it would be ridiculous if we abandoned all
the oil and gas wells, capped them and made it very difficult to reopen
them and then a few years later discovered that we wanted to use them
for CCS. Therefore, I can see where he is coming from.</div>
					<a name="08030654000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that, once a well has been capped, it cannot be
reopened. I will check again with some experts to ascertain whether
that is really the case or whether we are talking about reopening at
enormous expense. I will make sure that the record is accurate. We
could be talking about a real difficulty if a well is capped.</div>
					<a name="08030654000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two stories about the
UK CS. Both are true, but we need to say both of them virtually in the
same breath. We have been very fortunate with the oil and gas in the UK
CS since the mid-1960s. The first truth is that the resource is now in
decline. The last estimate I saw showed that the decline was something
of the order of 8 per cent. per year&#151;it is quite marked.
</div>
				
					<a name="08030654000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other story is that that oil and gas are still very important to us,
and probably will be for about half a century or more&#151;who knows?
No doubt, people will then re-evaluate. For example, there is the
potentially exciting development of feasibility studies looking at west
of Shetland, which was previously unexplored. Four major companies are
working together to determine the potential in that very difficult
terrain, where connections could be very expensive. The story of the
North sea continues, despite the decline. Why do I say that? Because
there will still be plenty of oil and gas wells as we develop CCS
potential.</div>
					<a name="08030654000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a lay
person, it does not seem to me that there is a problem of the two time
scales being totally out of sync, if hon. Members follow me. We will
have our demonstration project, and I suppose that in six or seven
years we will be in a better position to see the potential of CCS. I
hope&#151;we all hope&#151;that there is real potential. If so, we
will start to see new industries being born around carbon capture, the
transportation of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>and its
storage.</div>
					<a name="08030654000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can see
the economic opportunity and the importance of Britain becoming one of
the world leaders on the issue. One can imagine that there is a new
book to be written about the UK CS and the North sea in terms of the
storage, the monitoring and so on of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. We are not in a
difficult position time-wise, as far as I can
judge.</div>

hon. Member for Wealden, I was trying to think about how this area
might develop over the next few decades. In the future, when we think
that a well might be ideal for CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>storage, it is possible
that we could suspend it rather than abandon it totally. I am advised
that we need to be careful about that option because, apparently, wells
cannot be used after 10 to 20 years as they become unsafe in a number
of ways. Nevertheless, that new information helps us with the scenario
that we are building up. Although I was hedging a bit on the issue of
abandonment, I am now clearly advised that it is permanent. Even if it
was felt that there was potential, it would apparently be cheaper and
safer to drill a new well rather than to open one
up.</div>

						</b> It is tempting at this stage to whiz through what
appear to be humble clauses, or humble schedules in this case, but it
is still sometimes important to pay attention to the detail and look
for important and perhaps worrying precedents that might be set.
Perhaps the Minster can give reassurances  on those.</div>
					<a name="08030654000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister said on clause
72, there are essentially four areas relating to the various amendments
to regulations that the schedule provides for. The first area relates
to the provision of contact details to the Minister, and I have to
point out that there is a logical flaw in that provision. A provision
in paragraph 14(2) of the schedule
states:</div>
					<a name="08030654000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

the licensee fails to comply with that? Well, the Minister will have to
serve them a notice, but one wonders to what address he will send it if
the contact details have not been supplied. While that is a genuine
logical flaw, I suspect that it is not absolutely critical, although it
draws attention to another aspect. The explanatory notes
state:</div>
					<a name="08030654000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
the licensee&#146;s responsibility to ensure that the contact details
held by the Minister are up to date.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>
					<a name="08030654000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather subtly, that
provision in the schedule will transfer to the licensee DBERR&#146;s
responsibility for keeping its records up to date and having accurate
data. I would have thought that that might be a slightly risky
responsibility for a commercial operator.</div>

						</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
with interest, but I would have thought that it was obvious that the
address will be supplied by the company that applies for the licence,
and I am sure that he would not expect the Department to contact
everyone every so often to ask, &#147;Have you moved?&#148; I would
have thought that it was quite obvious that they would notify the
Department of any major change of address for their

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000491"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is perusing an interesting line,
because the alternative to the licensee keeping the Department informed
of changes is the Department contacting the licensee, perhaps on an
hourly or daily basis, on the off-chance that the address might have
changed. If he moves house&#151;after what he did last night, he may
be tempted to change party&#151;is it incumbent on him to notify the
supplier of his telephone, for instance, or is it incumbent on the
supplier to check with him regularly in case he has
moved?</div>
					<a name="08030654000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000492"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
entertaining intervention, but I have no intention of moving house,
especially now that I have been placed on the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> roll of
honour, which I must admit was not an honour that I had even been
seeking and which I hope is never repeated.</div>
					<a name="08030654000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explanatory notes state not
only that updates should be sent to the Department, but that it is the
licensee&#146;s responsibility to ensure that the contact details
that are held are up to date. Will licensees be able to check, for
instance, that DBERR&#146;s processing and data protection
arrangements are adequate? Does that set any precedent with regard to
placing the risk of error and of mistakes being made&#151;they might
be crucial if no legal notices are served&#151;entirely on the
licensee so that the Department will not accept any responsibility for
keeping its own records up to date?</div>
					<a name="08030654000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule also deals with
the power to issue a notice to plug and abandon a well, about which the
hon. Member for Northampton, South has already raised important
questions. Such a decision could have major commercial implications for
an operator, so that is quite a major power to pass to the Secretary of
State. Perhaps it is an important environmental initiative, but it is
also a technical and operational matter, which, one imagines, would
normally be dealt with by an operator, not a
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08030654000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My questions
on carbon pricing and the future cost of climate change&#151;one of
the technical considerations that would have to be factored into any
cost-benefit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div>analysis of whether to plug a well or whether to continue making it
accessible&#151;give an example of how technical this could get. It
is perhaps unfair to suggest that the Minister should have that
information at his fingertips, but it underlines how important it is to
get such things
right.</div>
					<a name="08030654000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The future cost
of carbon methodology can change the outcome of a decision such as
this. Therefore, if the methodology being used is wrong, or if it does
not follow the Stern report and sets the price of carbon too low, that
could change the outcome. As we have already discussed, it could mean a
well with the potential for future use in carbon capture and storage
being plugged and lost for that purpose. That is an important
consideration.</div>
					<a name="08030654000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes and the Minister himself have discussed the clauses
that deal with revocation on change of control. I struggled to find an
example of such a paragraph in the schedule. I found the other three
things that the Minister referred to, but perhaps it would be useful if
he drew our attention to exactly where an example of that is in the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="08030654000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we
have the prospect of the Minister stepping into what is a commercial
transaction, so this matter should therefore be dealt with using
particular care. As I say, I could find no example in the schedule, but
the explanatory notes give an example of something that might rival the
example of gobbledegook given by the hon. Member for Wealden. I found
it rather difficult to
follow.</div>
					<a name="08030654000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">When talking
about trying to include in the responsibilities not just the person to
whom the licence is issued, as the Minister said, but people to whom it
has been assigned, the notes
say:</div>
					<a name="08030654000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Schedule extends this by providing that where rights have been
assigned, there will also now be said to be a change of control
whenever a person takes control over an assignee who did not control
that assignee when the rights were assigned.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08030654000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I read that several times and I need a
little more explanation of what it means, so perhaps the Minister can
clarify it. We have the power of partial revocation, which he referred
to and in respect of which there are a lot of examples in the
Bill&#151;schedule 3, proposed new section 38A, for
instance.</div>
					<a name="08030654000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes contain an interesting
statement:</div>
					<a name="08030654000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Obligations
and liabilities arising before the partial revocation of an interest in
a licence are not affected by the partial
revocation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08030654000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
optimistic statement but surely, if the licence is shared, the
liabilities will be shared in some way. Looking at the text, it seems
that any of the persons who together constitute the licensee share in
the liability. If the licence is partially revoked for one of two
people, that will surely affect the liabilities of the other, and it is
difficult to reconcile the statement in the explanatory notes with
that.</div>
					<a name="08030654000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">My worry is not
that there is a huge technical problem in the Bill, but that we might
inadvertently be introducing loopholes into which lawyers may one day
crawl. That could land us with an unexpected public liability that we
would have to cope with. I seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance that
such loopholes are not being created.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> I will do my best to cope with those points. I had
hoped that my opening speech on the clause covered much of that
territory, but we will see. If I may say so, the first question was not
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s strongest card. It was about how we will
know where people live. In this era of concern about civil liberties, I
am not going to say that we know where they live and that we have their
number&#151;that would not be
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08030654000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
licence can involve more than one party, so a number of parties might
have to be contacted. There is no issue here. Let us get the record
straight: most companies do not abstain from giving us information
about their addresses, even if most of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intimate colleagues abstain in some other
respect.</div>

							<a name="08030654000496"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Indeed. The issue, which I thought I had covered
well, although perhaps at tedious length, is why the Secretary of State
is in a better position than the companies to decide which wells should
be plugged and abandoned. It is not quite like that, but let me repeat
some of the issues. Plugging and abandoning wells is not optional;
licensees are already required to plug and abandon wells at least one
month before the end of their licence. The issue is ensuring that
licensees can plug and abandon a well when it needs to be done.
</div>
					<a name="08030654000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the regulator, the
Secretary of State is the person charged with ensuring that the risks
to the taxpayer arising from licensees who default on future financial
commitments are minimised. Clearly, the regulator can have a different
perspective from the commercial players in a particular market. In
deciding whether a well needs to be plugged and abandoned, the
Secretary of State must weigh up whether the risk to the taxpayer of a
licensee being unable to meet the cost of plugging a well is
sufficiently great to warrant the plugging of that well immediately,
rather than waiting until the last month of the licence, as is
currently required by the model clauses.</div>
					<a name="08030654000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not go on in more
detail, because I think that when the hon. Member for Cheltenham reads
the record he will see that I had a great deal to say about that
matter. We are in the business not of making commercial decisions, but
of producing a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework, given how the
industry in the North sea has developed in a maturing field, so that we
can ensure that companies have the money finally to decommission wells
and that the taxpayer can be safeguarded.</div>
					<a name="08030654000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked about the partial
revocation provisions. I understand that they are in paragraph 1(4) of
the schedule, on page 104 of the Bill. I hope that is right, and I hope
that it helps the Committee.</div>

							<a name="08030654000497"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I beg the Minister&#146;s pardon, but I did not
ask about the partial revocation. That is quite clear; there are
numerous examples of partial revocation throughout the schedule. I
asked about revocation on change of control, of which I did not find a
single example in the schedule, although I may be in error about
that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div>

so we are getting into textual analysis here. The relevant provision

					<a name="08030654000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

							<a name="08030654000499"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I think that I have found the provision, if it is
the one numbered (4), but it appears to be in a broader section
concerning provision of contact details to the Minister. I am not sure
whether that is a drafting
issue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000500"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I know that the purpose of a Committee is
line-by-line scrutiny, but there might be another way of resolving this
issue. The paragraph that I have mentioned is where the hon. Gentleman
will find the relevant power. He asked about extending the power of
revocation from the person to whom the licence was originally granted
to a person to whom the licence was assigned. Currently, the Minister
can revoke a licence where there is a change of control in the licensee
who was originally granted the licence. In future, that will also apply
for the licensee who had the licence assigned to them. I have a feeling
that some of these matters would be better dealt with in writing, but I
hope that all that is clearer than it sounded.</div>
					<a name="08030654000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">What happens to the rights and
liabilities of the parties? Where a licence interest is revoked in
relation to one person on the licence, the person whose interest has
been revoked remains jointly and severally liable for any obligations
arising before the partial revocation takes place. After partial
revocation, the rights, obligations and liabilities associated with the
licence continue to have effect in respect of all the remaining
persons.</div>

second tier only if insufficient moneys were available. We teased out
some of those issues a little further during the debate on the

intended to gain clarification. They are, like my new clause 19,
technical amendments. You were fortunate to miss my previous

that this one will be a lot shorter.</div>
					<a name="08030654000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments relate to third-party access to infrastructure and concerns
raised by the industry about how the new wording will broaden the scope
in which the legislation can be applied. The industry agrees with the
intention to remove so-called ransom strips so that the Secretary of
State can meaningfully determine third-party access, but in order to
achieve that the new wording unduly broadens the scope with which he
can apply the legislation. In particular, the meaning of
&#147;pipeline&#148; has been extended from &#147;any apparatus
and works&#148; to a wider definition. There is no test of
reasonableness, which would require the Secretary of State to act
appropriately and proportionately and to ensure that infrastructure
owners were not commercially burdened. The definition now
includes</div>
					<a name="08030654000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all apparatus,
works and services associated with the
operation&#148;</div>
					<a name="08030654000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the system.

					<a name="08030654000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am informed that there is
further concern about upstream gas and oil-processing facilities now
being included in subsections (2) and (4). That could extend the
Secretary of State&#146;s powers beyond normal upstream activities
into downstream activities, given the inadequately defined distinction
between upstream and downstream, and would exclude refineries, gas
conversion plants and the like. I hope that the Minister will support
the amendments, which would bring clarity to the Bill in terms of the

upstream and
downstream.</div>

clarity to the provisions. Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 would do that, but
amendment No. 30 would limit them in that it takes a definition of a
gas-processing operation and applies it only to upstream activities.

Wicks:
						</b> Before I cover the specific issues raised by the
amendments, it might be helpful if I remind members of the Committee of
the rationale behind the clause that my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West wants to amend. We already have a legislative
regime that allows the Secretary of State to intervene, if requested,
in disputes over third-party access to most upstream petroleum
infrastructure. If he were asked to intervene, the outcome of a
disputes resolution might be that he sets the terms for access, such as
the tariffs to be paid for transportation and processing. In practice,
he has not been called to use such powers to date. We believe that that
is because the potential deterrent effects of their use have done well
in encouraging successful negotiation. They certainly add an additional
incentive towards effective and timely commercial negotiations.
However, some gaps in the scope of the current regime mean that, while
he can require and determine the terms for access to some
infrastructure, owners could lawfully charge exorbitant amounts for the
use of, or refuse access to, other facilities or services. The
existence of such ransom strips, as they are known in the industry,
effectively undermines the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to
deliver reasonable access to the third party. We believe that a more
comprehensive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>and consistent coverage of upstream petroleum infrastructure will make
the threat of the use of the Secretary of State&#146;s powers more
effective. The third-party access clause therefore closes the gaps that
we have identified in the existing legislative regime. I wish to state
for the record that we intend the clause to capture only the upstream
petroleum infrastructure, not downstream facilities. I hope that I have
put to rest the concerns of my hon. Friend that resulted in his tabling
the amendment.</div>
					<a name="08030654000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
73 modifies the Pipe-lines Act 1962, the Gas Act 1995 and the Petroleum
Act 1998 by expanding the relevant definitions of &#147;gas
processing operation&#148; and &#147;pipeline&#148;. The expanded
definition of &#147;gas processing operation&#148; covers
converting gas into a form that is acceptable to sellers or loading it
into a pipeline or tanker to be transported elsewhere. That means that
upstream gas processing facilities such as Mossmorran and Braefoot Bay
will now be covered by the third-party access legislation. The expanded
definition of &#147;pipeline&#148; covers</div>
					<a name="08030654000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all apparatus, works and services
associated with the operation
of&#148;</div>
					<a name="08030654000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">a pipeline. Without
that expansion, an infrastructure owner could lawfully comply with the
Secretary of State&#146;s directions over access to the pipeline in
question but refuse access to related services.</div>
					<a name="08030654000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 28 and 29 would restrict the proposed extension of the scope of
the Bill to cover only the existing services necessary for the
operation of such pipelines. However, that would run contrary to the
intended effect of extending its scope through clause 73 to cover the
whole upstream petroleum infrastructure chain. For example, if a
particular dispute related to the first time that a third party had
requested access to a pipeline, then the infrastructure owners would be
unlikely to have in place metering or allocation services, because
those services would not be necessary for the operation of the
pipeline. The owners&#146; petroleum would flow through the pipeline
very well without them, and the amount of flow would be measured when
it entered a terminal or joined another hydrocarbon stream. However, if
a third party is to be able to use the pipeline in addition to the
owner, then metering or allocation services will be needed.</div>
					<a name="08030654000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such services are not necessary
for the operation of the pipeline but are necessary to enable
third-party access. Thus they would not be caught by the
&#147;necessary for&#148; test proposed in the amendment but would
be caught by the &#147;associated with&#148; test. Furthermore,
such metering and allocation services would count as new services not
offered by the owner before, so they would also fail the
&#147;existing&#148; test. The amendments would prevent the
Secretary of State from including in a notice a requirement for an
owner to provide allocation or metering services, if those did not
already exist. The infrastructure owner could comply with the notice
for third-party access issued by the Secretary of State, but charge any
price for, or even refuse to offer, the associated services of
allocation or metering, thereby undermining the Secretary of
State&#146;s intervention. That is just one example of the possible
unintended consequences of the amendments.</div>
					<a name="08030654000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West asked me about a test of reasonableness. As with
any decision taken by the Secretary of State, there will be the usual
public law duty on him to act reasonably. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>Although the scope of his powers to determine third-party access
disputes is extended by the Bill, the exercise of those powers will
remain subject to that duty. Furthermore, the existing legislation
already requires him to take certain factors into account in so far as
they are relevant in considering an application for third-party access.
Some of those already refer to the concept of reasonableness. For
example, he must consider the owner&#146;s reasonable needs for the
transport and processing of petroleum. In relation to upstream
petroleum pipelines, sections 17F(8) of the Petroleum Act 1998 and
10E(8) of the Pipelines Act 1962 provide those checks and balances.
Moreover, the Bill provides that the Secretary of State may serve a
notice for third-party access only if he is satisfied that the pipeline
could be operated in accordance with that notice and without
prejudicing the efficient use of that pipeline by the
owner.</div>
					<a name="08030654000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my hon.
Friend for allowing me to clarify these issues, but I hope that my
response to his amendment and the explanation of how we would aim to

Iddon:
						</b> This clause is about third-party access to
infrastructure. I want to raise the issue of access to gas
infrastructure by biogas producers. All over Germany, they collect
biodegradable waste from farms, from the food industry and from civic
collections. That biodegradable waste is transferred to large
digesters, which are across the country, not site-specific. They
produce biogas&#151;largely methane&#151;along with a solid fuel
that can be burned and a liquid fertiliser that can go back to the
farms. That process is extremely efficient. We do it on a limited scale
in the United Kingdom, but I want to point out to the Minister the
difference between the German and British systems of biogas production.
The difference is simple. In Britain, biogas production is
site-specific, in that the biogas is used largely for heat production,
or sometimes goes into a combined heat and power generation process.
That is normally incentivised by an industry that requires that heat,
or heat and power. In Germany, biogas producers are incentivised by the
fact that they have a feed-in tariff to the gas main infrastructure,
which lies across Germany. That means that in Germany the digesters can
be anywhere, provided that they have immediate access to the gas
pipeline.</div>

least, would he agree to meet a delegation led by people who have

producers, I am advised that it is not currently possible to inject
biomethane into the gas network, due to practical constraints such as
nitrogen content and pressure issues. There are some practical
difficulties, but nevertheless it is a potentially important resource.

Wicks:
						</b> The clause focuses on pipeline modifications.
Without the ability to require modifications of upstream petroleum
pipelines at the third party user&#146;s expense, the owner of the
existing structure might legitimately follow the Secretary of
State&#146;s decision to grant access to his pipeline but refuse to
modify it, or charge an excessive amount to modify it. The clause
therefore allows the Secretary of State to intervene, if requested to
do so, in such disputes over modifications to onshore upstream
petroleum
pipelines.</div>
					<a name="08030654000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
intervention would be a pipeline modification notice&#151;an exciting
document, I am sure&#151;which must set out, among other things, the
modifications that the Secretary of State thinks should be made and the
amount to be paid, or how that amount may be determined, by the
applicant to the owner for the purpose of carrying out such
modifications. There is a requirement on the applicant to make
appropriate arrangements, in a specified time, for the sums to be
transferred to the owner if the modifications are carried out, or if
the Secretary of State is satisfied that they will be carried out.
There is also a requirement on the owner to carry out modifications if
the applicant makes appropriate arrangements for payment within the
specified period.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>
					<a name="08030654000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should add
that similar powers and sanctions are already available to the
Secretary of State, under the Petroleum Act 1998, over controlled
petroleum pipelines offshore. The clause applies an equivalent regime,
in effect, for modifications to upstream petroleum pipelines onshore
under the Pipe-lines Act 1962.</div>

							<a name="08030654000521"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I seek clarification. If I am out of order, I am
sure that you will quickly tell me, Mr. Amess. The Minister
has already said that the infrastructure in the North sea is valuable,
particularly the pipeline infrastructure. That value seems even greater
with the prospect of carbon capture and storage, and the ability to
extract more oil from existing oilfields by using carbon capture and
storage, as I explained before. However, that process is very long
term, so how much do these powers relate to that long-term
scenario?</div>
					<a name="08030654000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume
that pipelines will go out of use for periods of time over the next 20,
30 or 40 years because wells that they serve will have closed down. The
pipelines might be capable of being opened up, hence the value of the
infrastructure. I want to know how long we expect a pipeline&#146;s
operator to maintain and to modify it, while recognising its potential
value in the future. Also, to what extent is it right and proper that
the maintenance would be carried out at the operator&#146;s cost when
a pipeline is not in use? When its value is, we hope, general to the
nation over a long period, what part of that cost should the nation
pay, while recognising its value as infrastructure? Perhaps that does
not come under the clause; there may be other clauses where I have not
noticed maintenance coming in specifically, as well as modification. I
am sure that the Minister will point that
out.</div>

							<a name="08030654000522"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I should tell the hon. Gentleman, tedious though it
may be, that carbon dioxide is not covered by these provisions on
third-party access. They deal only with upstream petroleum
infrastructure, and not, therefore, with carbon dioxide. I am struck
and, indeed, pleased by his interest shown in carbon capture and
storage and its future implications. However, he is a little ahead of
the rest of us in raising rather serious issues that we cannot
reasonably answer now.</div>
					<a name="08030654000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, it would not be
reasonable to say that every pipeline has to be maintained in the
hopeful expectation that there might be a lot of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>flowing
through it in 20 years&#146; time. I am not a scientist, an engineer
or a technologist, but merely the Energy Minister, so I do not even
know whether the existing pipeline would be fit for purpose for
CO<span class="Sub">2.</span> Others will have an idea about that. I hope, however,
that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman, given a scenario where the UK
CS would be alive and well, as it were, for four or five decades to
come&#151;it might be more&#151;that the time scale for developing
CCS and the time scale of the UK CS are not totally out of synch with
one another.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000523"></a>Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I understand the point about gas going through
pipelines and that those pipelines might not be able to be used for
that, although modifications could be made, but my question is partly
about the extra petroleum or oil that we hope to get out through those
pipelines. That might mean a long delay between the last time that the
pipeline is used and its reuse in 20 or 25 years&#146; time. I assume
that a pipeline will last that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>long and I assume that the facility will be good
enough to carry the extra oil that we are going to shove out if
properly maintained, if carbon capture and storage works in this
respect. Who is going to maintain it and where will the costs fall in
the longer
term?</div>
				
					<a name="08030654000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the Minister tells me about the time scale and that no
one knows these answers. I want to tag it, as it were, so that thought
is given to it. It is an important area. To have the infrastructure now
and not to look after it to the point at which it would be useful would
be rather sad, and it would be an expensive exercise to do it over
again. That is my
thought.</div>

reassurance. Although, rather humbly, I am suggesting that many of
these issues need to be sorted out at a technical level in the years to
come, depending, of course, on how successful CCS turns out to be. We
all wish it great success because it is the only show in town for
tackling CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from fossil fuels. It is not just
another technology; it is absolutely critical, hence the demonstration
project.</div>

can reassure the hon. Gentleman by saying that the possible future use
of pipelines is considered before they are decommissioned and also that

clause extends the dispute resolution process so that the Secretary of
State can intervene in disputes over third-party access to oil
processing facilities, if requested by a prospective third-party user
of upstream petroleum infrastructure. Legislation in that area does not
currently cover such upstream oil facilities. However, by contrast, the
existing regime covers most upstream gas processing facilities under
the Gas Act 1995. As I mentioned earlier, these powers are meant as a
deterrent against the use of infrastructure owners&#146; monopoly
powers. A more comprehensive and consistent coverage of upstream
petroleum infrastructure by the third-party access regime will make the
threat of the use of the Secretary of State&#146;s powers more
effective.</div>
					<a name="08030654000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
specifies the steps that the prospective third-party user needs to take
before they can apply to the Secretary of State for directions. For
example, the clause sets out the process that a third party will need
to have followed to agree access with the existing owner of the oil
processing facility, before they can ask the Secretary of State to
intervene on their
behalf.</div>

directions, if he is satisfied that they will not prejudice the
efficient operation of the oil processing facility or its use by the

Horwood:
						</b> It is good to give the Minister a little rest,
even though we are enjoying his numerous speeches on the subject. In
the explanatory notes, we are told that the clause removes prescriptive
and outdated reporting requirements. That is strange. Since those
requirements were introduced only in the Sustainable Energy Act 2003
and barely seem to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div>had time to settle in, how can they be outdated? Further, if they
prescribe the provision of accurate information, I do not see how that
is such a bad thing.
</div>
					<a name="08030654000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first part of
clause 78 seems to relieve the Government of some of their reporting
duties under the Sustainable Energy Act, including what they have done
to develop renewable and micro-generation energy sources and to ensure
the necessary expertise to develop potential energy sources. That may
not just apply to the energy sources that I am quite fond of, such as
tidal power, biomass, or even biogas; the hon. Member for Copeland
might be interested to know that it could include ways in which we are
developing expertise in nuclear energy, which is quite an issue. The
clause also appears to relieve the Government of reporting duties on
what they have done to achieve the energy efficiency aims set out in
the Sustainable  Energy Act.</div>
					<a name="08030654000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause goes on to remove
the requirement for the Government to report on activities undertaken
during the previous year, although not the requirement to publish a
report each year. However, that means that they could report on any
period that they decided. In other words, the time scales could be
adjusted so that, for example, good things could be re-reported, or
they could miss out particular months so that some things went
under-reported.</div>
					<a name="08030654000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, we hit
the succession problem for the Minister. We all know that he is an
honourable man and I know that he would never, under any circumstances,
re-present, or re-package good news year after year. Nor would
he&#151;perish the thought&#151;adjust time scales to produce the
best possible spin on statistics. However, I know that he will be
shocked to discover that that sort of thing sometimes goes on in
government. The CO<span class="Sub">2</span> and greenhouse gas emissions targets
under the Kyoto protocol spring to mind. We are constantly told that we
are on course to meet those targets, despite the fact that the basket
of greenhouse gases has gone up under this Government and that since
2002 they seem to have been on an upward trend. Yet we are still
apparently on course to meet the greenhouse gas targets. The fact that
we are missing the domestic CO<span class="Sub">2</span> targets is rather glossed
over. That offers an example of the kind of trap that Ministers might
inadvertently fall into when they present these
numbers.</div>

					<a name="08030654000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The risk is
that some statistics will inadvertently be presented in an overly
generous way. It is important that, having set up these specific
requirements for reporting on particular issues and on particular time
scales, we do not change that regime unless there are very good reasons
to do so. It would surely be wise to remove the temptation from the
Minister&#146;s successors&#151;whoever they might be&#151;to
organise the statistics to their own advantage. I question the
necessity for the clause to remove those reporting requirements and
allow the temptation for future Ministers to massage
statistics.</div>

							<a name="08030654000532"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Clause 78 is one of the most important in the
Bill, about which I very much share some of the concerns set out by the
hon. Member for Cheltenham. I am particularly indebted to Andrew
Warren, from the Association for the Conservation of Energy, for
pointing out the possible consequences of the clause, about which we
should be profoundly
concerned.</div>
					<a name="08030654000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman implied that we should strike out the clause, under which, as
he pointed out, the Government would not have to report on, for
example, specified energy sources, the expertise to develop potential
energy sources and energy efficiency. As he also pointed out, the
clause will change the time at which the Government will produce their
reports. Currently, they have to produce them for the year in question,
but, as I understand it, that requirement would be removed by the
proposed changes. It would not remove the requirement to produce a
report every year, but it does remove the requirement for that report
to cover the whole year or, as is currently the case, the year ending
on 23 February, which ensures consistency in what is
covered.</div>
					<a name="08030654000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
clause, the Government could in theory choose to report on any period
that takes their fancy, including a period of less than a
year&#151;it could be six months or less. It is extremely unlikely
that they would choose to do that, but they could produce pre-dated
reports. We have serious grounds for concern about the implications of
the clause. Indeed, some months could be missed out of a report all
together, if appropriate, or the Government could cover a period longer
than a year. We are very concerned that, under the clause, some of the
requirements on the Government will be
removed.</div>
					<a name="08030654000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses 5
and 25 would provide for additional requirements for the Government to
report to Parliament every year. New clause 5 relates to energy
security and gas storage and new clause 25 relates to energy use and,
in particular, energy efficiency. We all accept that good gas reserves
give us energy security. We could have a long debate about whether
there is a risk of our gas supplies being cut off. In a very good
article in the <i class="I">Financial Times </i>this week, Gideon Rachman
explained why he did not think that that was a likely scenario.
However, it is in all of our interests that we take steps to ensure
against that scenario anyway.</div>
					<a name="08030654000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is general agreement that
this country&#146;s gas reserves are too low. Typically, we have 12
days of winter gas storage, which compares to 70 or 80 days in France,
Germany, Italy and other European countries. The situation will, of
course, improve as a result of liquefied natural gas facilities being
built and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div>pipelines that are now operating, particularly the Langeled pipeline,
which has made a significant difference. However, I still believe that
more should be done to improve gas storage facilities, which new clause
5 would do. Under it, the Secretary of State would have to make an
annual report to Parliament on his assessment of the appropriate gas
storage levels, which would be taken in days rather than an absolute
amount. It might say that there should be 20 days of average winter
use, for example. That assessment would provide us with details of the
energy security that he believes that we need. He would also have to
set out our progress towards achieving that level, which would give us
an opportunity to have a debate in Parliament every year about the
level of gas storage that we believe is necessary, in the light of
changing circumstances at home and abroad, and about what more needs to
be done to improve the situation if
necessary.</div>
					<a name="08030654000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it
difficult to see a reason why the Government would say no to that
proposal, although I am sure that the Minister will come up with one
any moment now&#151;he normally does. The only one that I can think
of is that he might want to be secretive about how much gas storage he
believes we need to maintain our energy security. In France, and
elsewhere, there is a legal obligation to keep a certain number of days
of gas storage. We are not suggesting that we do that. One of the
reasons for the problems two years ago was that the French could not
legally send us gas through the interconnector, because they would have
fallen short of their legal requirements for gas storage in
their  own country.</div>
					<a name="08030654000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not going that far. We
are trying to get a more informed debate, and to ensure that we make
sensible progress each year and never put ourselves into a situation in
which we do not have the storage necessary to protect our energy
security.</div>
					<a name="08030654000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
25 would ensure that we do rather more about energy efficiency than we
have done to date. The UK is lagging behind seriously, and this would
be one of the most important contributions to our energy security. It
is a great shame that the Bill has missed out altogether the issues of
energy security. In a note to me, Andrew Warren
said:</div>
					<a name="08030654000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
rather difficult to provide you with a brief upon it, other than as
that it is like that proverbial dog that doesn&#146;t bark in the
night. No part of it is designed to do anything to forward energy
efficiency in any shape or
form.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08030654000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly,
the Bill focuses rather more on electricity generation, but fails to
look at energy use and wastage in our homes. We are at a stage when
people want to do more to conserve energy. There is a great thirst for
knowledge, and a thirst to do things, but people are unclear about
exactly what they should be doing. It is worth the Committee spending a
moment looking at some of the
facts.</div>
					<a name="08030654000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, total
UK CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions were 554 million tonnes. The energy that we
use to heat, light and power our homes accounted for 153 million
tonnes, or 27 per cent. of those emissions. The shameful fact is that
at the moment only 10 million, or 40 per cent., of our homes are
sufficiently and properly insulated. Around 33 per cent. of the heat
lost from an uninsulated house is lost through the walls, and the
people who live in those homes could typically save &#163;90 a year
on energy bills by insulating their wall cavities. There is not just a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>cost to them: this would save &#163;720 million worth of energy
overall, and 9 million tons of carbon. That is enough to power 1.8
million homes for a year. There is very significant wastage here, and
no reason for people not taking this basic step to insulate their
homes. Insulating lofts is another way in which people would save
significant sums of money&#151;typically about  &#163;110 a
year.</div>
					<a name="08030654000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">We in this
country are not good at switching things off. We are three times as
likely as the Germans to leave our mobile phone chargers on and our
appliances on standby. Sky is being very innovative in this area, and
will be able by the end of the year to turn off remotely the standby
buttons on every single digibox. Business is doing very significant
work in this area, but in too many other walks of life we rely on the
individual to take action. All too often, they simply do not. According
to the Energy Saving Trust, leaving mobile phone chargers and lights on
results in an extra 43 million tonnes of carbon dioxide being pumped
into the atmosphere every year&#151;that is the estimate  for
the period 2006-2010&#151;and a waste of &#163;11 billion worth of
energy.</div>
					<a name="08030654000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK could
reduce electricity requirements by as much as 3 per cent. if all
non-essential household appliances were turned off when not in use.
That equates to the entire output of one medium-sized coal-fired power
station producing 500 MWe, or  3 million tonnes of carbon a
year. Switching to energy-saving light bulbs could save up to
&#163;60 of electricity over the bulb&#146;s lifetime. Now,
multiply that by the number of bulbs in the typical home. If, as a
nation, we switched to energy-saving light bulbs, the carbon emissions
saved would fill the Albert hall  3,000 times
over.</div>

high-efficiency condensing boilers convert more than 90 per cent. of

							<a name="08030654000536"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> You have been very generous, Mr. Amess.
I hope that we have explained some of the things that we could be doing
and what the new clause 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>could help to address. We are not very good at energy efficiency in this
country, and we have the bizarre situation that VAT is charged on
energy efficiency measures at the full rate, whereas wasted energy is
charged at only 5 per cent. We have a perverse way of dealing with this
issue.</div>
					<a name="08030654000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 78 will
reduce the reporting requirement, whereas we think that the Minister
should be required to report more clearly on some of those issues. New
clause 25 would drive forward energy efficiency. Other measures would
help more, but, as has been pointed out, they could not be included
within the scope of the Bill. There should at least be more information
about what we are achieving. The new clause would require that an
annual report be made to Parliament on the total energy consumption in
domestic housing, the total energy consumption by business and, most
importantly, the impact of Government measures to assess energy
efficiency. That means that every year, we could see what effect those
energy efficiency measures are having and whether we are managing to
reduce demand for energy or simply to stabilise it or reduce its
growth.</div>
					<a name="08030654000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The lack of
energy efficiency measures is a major hole in the Bill, and it is
unfortunate that, because of the way in which the Government have
phrased the Bill, it is out of order to talk about energy efficiency.
The new clause would at least help us to address some of those
failings.</div>
					<a name="08030654000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000537"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> The proposed new clauses are important, and I
support them. I give the Minister the benefit of the doubt, as I think
that there has been a sin of omission rather than of commission.
However, anyone who reads the reports of our deliberations&#151;I am
sure that there will be thousands of people up and down the country
hanging on every word that we utter&#151;will expect information. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Wealden has said, we need some kind of
guideline and incentive to meet the energy reduction targets that we
have been discussing. For whatever reason&#151;no doubt the Minister
will articulate his reasoning&#151;the whole thrust of clause 78 is
an attempt to reduce the amount of information available, and to make
it less incumbent on Government to meet certain targets and to be held
to account for those targets.</div>
					<a name="08030654000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 25 is indicative of
my party&#146;s thinking. We have a desire to be open and to have
targets in the public domain to which we will eventually, when we are
in government, be held to account. I should have thought that the
Minister would want to meet that aspiration. Those of us who have
children are very aware of the deliberations that they have at school
on energy conservation, climate change and so on. You are looking at me
in a forbidding way, Mr. Amess, so I shall not stray too far
on this. They will find it very strange that we are introducing an
Energy Bill that covers so many aspects of energy, but does not address
how we use that energy and how we can establish where we are expending
our limited resources. The new clause is uncontentious and positive,
and I very much hope that the Minister will find some way of including
it in the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>
					<a name="08030654000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 is different. I am
not an authority on these matters, and I was interested by my hon.
Friend&#146;s comments about the amount of onshore gas storage on the
continent. I think he said that the law in France obliges it to keep a
certain amount of gas at any time, which is why the French were unable
to help us out when we ran low. I think that my hon. Friend has been
unambitious with his new clause. Paragraph (a) talks about his
assessment of the appropriate volume of onshore gas storage to ensure
long-term energy supply. I would be intrigued to know about mid-term
energy supply. We were down to about 12 days of gas at one point quite
recently. Given the geopolitical situation with some of our suppliers
and the choppy waters of our current relationship with the former
Soviet Union&#151;and we have seen how Russia has behaved in the past
to some of the former Soviet republics in turning off supplies, as a
political tool&#151;I think that there is a real desire in this
country to know what supplies we have. The Minister will remember how
forward-thinking it was of a Conservative Government to stock up on
coal supplies so that they could head off any future disruption in the
coal industry back in  the
1980s&#151;</div>

have seen with Northern
Rock.</div>
					<a name="08030654000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">To go back to
what is an important point. People are interested in the security of
our supplies. I take on board the fact that things are going to improve
and that we are increasing our capacity for storage but I think that
most people were very concerned when we were down to 12
days&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000541"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Twelve is our normal amount. That is as much as we
would usually have in gas storage, compared to 70 or 80 days in France.
At the time of the particular gas shortage we were down to much less
than that&#151;just a couple of days.</div>
					<a name="08030654000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000542"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> That is even more worrying and I would like the
Minister, if he is allowed, to say what his aspiration is for storage.
We have heard that storage capacity is going to increase. Why is it
that by law the French are obliged to have 70 or 80 days and that the
average in this country is apparently 12 days? I was wrong: I said that
it had come down to 12 days and then that it had come down to two or
three days. In fact, that is not a supply at all: it is an emergency if
your supplies are down to 48 or 56 hours. It is completely
unacceptable.</div>
					<a name="08030654000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister does therefore need to include this in the Bill. I do not
think that national security concerns should mean that people do not
know what energy supplies this country, perfidious Albion, has for
survival. I think that it should probably be in the public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div>domain. The public have a right to know. They have that expectation. I
cannot see why the Minister is shy of putting it in the Bill. The
entire thrust of this clause is to reduce the information that the
Government are obliged to supply to the public whereas the new clauses
submitted by my party would achieve the reverse. In this spirit of
openness, the Minister should rise to the challenge and accept the new
clauses.</div>

such a fantastic speech that it made one think that, if only we could
get this report right, we would be well on the way to tackling climate
change and global warming. I am therefore greatly encouraged. The
authors of the report will be greatly encouraged about its importance
because I suppose that the cynic might think that the major
contribution of reports like this would be to lag the odd loft or two.
I thought that it was very interesting and I was waiting for the end of

important. They are the result of the rather frustrating situation that
all members of the Committee have found ourselves in: we have been
unable to table more substantial amendments on energy efficiency
because it is outside the scope of the Bill. It is wrong for the

things that need to be done, but it is not a kind of Christmas tree on
which we can hang every aspect of our energy or climate change
strategies. We have a good policy on aspects of energy efficiency. A
number of things are being developed that do not require legislative
cover. The purpose of a Bill is to reform the law and introduce new
laws where that is required. It is not an election manifesto. I will
not have anyone say&#151;well I will, of course, but I will not agree

						</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way
again so rapidly. Does he not feel that the refusal to address these
issues in the Bill will lead people to feel that the Government are
complacent about these subjects? We have an appalling lack of energy
efficiency in this country. Our homes are massively under-insulated.
There is a real crisis, and overcoming it would make a significant
difference to our ability to meet our carbon challenges, but the
Minister does not want to discuss the
issues.</div>

Wicks:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess, for that
ruling&#151;I was trying to resist that temptation. Certainly, we do
not believe currently that we need any additional primary legislation
beyond that set out in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>the Climate Change Bill, which is the powerful sister
Bill to the Energy Bill. The Climate Change Bill covers many elements
relating to energy efficiency, as I am sure that the hon. Member for
Wealden would
recognise.</div>
					<a name="08030654000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
remember that we are talking about a report&#151;a humble and
important report&#151;and I think that the Chairman is encouraging us
to discuss it. There may be more interesting things to talk
about&#151;Arsenal&#146;s victory over Milan, for
example&#151;but we are debating the clause. I have to be the
borehole and talk about it.</div>
					<a name="08030654000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of timing, we are
seeking to remove the requirement in section 1 of the Sustainable
Energy  Act 2003 to report by a certain period in a given year.
Our objective in doing that is to ensure that the
information that we produce is current and complements, where possible,
other key reporting requirements. At present, we publish various
reports at different times in the year, driven by timings currently set
out in statute, and sometimes when the most up-to-date data are not
always available. The proposals in the clause will allow us greater
flexibility in choosing the timing of our publication and adapting its
contents to reflect
priorities.</div>
					<a name="08030654000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
introduction of the Climate Change Bill, it is even more important that
we align the publication of the sustainable energy report with the
carbon budget reporting cycle proposed in that Bill. The idea that we
will choose the month to suit us&#151;one year, it might be February,
and another year, it might be November&#151;is incorrect. We will
still publish the reports annually, and we expect to do so around the
month of May. The reports will specify the period to which they
relate.</div>
					<a name="08030654000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will also enable the Government to include the most up-to-date data on
fuel poverty. When we have up-to-date data on fuel poverty, we publish
them. The data are available generally in about spring, after the
reporting period set out in the legislation  has
ended.</div>

						</b> The Minister&#146;s intentions sound good, so
will he confirm that he will maintain, for the sake of consistency and
ease of comparison, the reporting year that is set down by statute in
the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, when these reports are published,
whenever that is? Will he maintain that specific 12-month period in
future
reports?</div>

Wicks:
						</b> No, because I will come back to that, and if I need
the hon. Gentleman to provide clarity later, I will avail myself of it;
but if this helps, our intention is always to ensure that the report
covers progress made in the year since the last report, as well as
looking forward. I do not know whether that is the point that he is
making.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div>

							<a name="08030654000559"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> As I understand it, the current requirement is to
publish a report specifically on a whole year, with the year ending on
23 February. In the interest of all of us being able to compare like
with like and having a consistent pattern of reporting, will the
Minister confirm that, whatever clauses we pass, he will stick to that
specific reporting
year?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000560"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Let me make some progress and I will return to
that. I certainly see the need, as someone interested in these things,
for long-term data sets, but I will get some specific advice on
that.</div>
					<a name="08030654000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
reason for introducing the clause is to remove outdated or unnecessary
statutory reporting requirements. Since 2003, a number of reporting
requirements have been created on a variety of energy-related
issues.</div>
					<a name="08030654000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)
will repeal section 81 of the Energy Act 2004, which requires the
Secretary of State to report on specific energy sources and
technologies. Section 81 also includes a requirement to report on
scientific and engineering expertise in the UK, as well as energy
efficiency aims designated under the Sustainable Energy Act 2003. If
hon. Members will bear with me, I will explain why we believe that
those requirements are no longer
needed.</div>
					<a name="08030654000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
list of energy sources or technologies provided in section 81 is
over-prescriptive. In the Government&#146;s view, the annual energy
report should focus on the most important issues that affect the energy
sector. Those issues are likely to change as markets develop and as
technologies become more effective and new ones emerge. It would not be
right, therefore, to have a statutory requirement to report on a
specific list of technologies, irrespective of whether their state of
development continued to be a relevant consideration. We need reporting
to be sufficiently flexible to allow us to exclude less relevant
technologies and include more relevant ones, as developments dictate.
Our change will facilitate that.</div>
					<a name="08030654000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on energy sector
skills, we are already working with the sector skills network to
deliver a report on skills commissioned under the 2007 energy White
Paper. It is not right prescriptively to require the Government to
report annually on energy skills. The development of skills is a medium
to long-term issue, and the picture will not necessarily change
dramatically from year to year. My Department has managed relationships
with key sector skills councils&#151;Cogent and the National Skills
Academy for Nuclear&#151;and has close links with the oil, gas and
power industries. Those relationships will enable the Government to
gather intelligence and work with industry to guide policy action on
energy sector skills.</div>
					<a name="08030654000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">On energy efficiency, which has
understandably led to a great deal of interest, we aim to remove
duplication and
overlap.</div>
					<a name="08030654000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000561"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> On the point about the skills base, surely, the
concern is that the Government will liaise with academic establishments
and industry but that information will be private? If we want to ensure
that we have the necessary skills base for a new fleet of nuclear power
stations or for developing renewables or carbon capture and storage,
Members of Parliament 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>should have access to the Government&#146;s assessment of the skills
base and how any shortage is being met? We will be denied that
information, as a result of the changes that the Government are making
under the clause. Although the Government may have that information and
they will have those conversations, Members of Parliament will be
denied the opportunity to discuss that.</div>
					<a name="08030654000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000562"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> There is clearly great suspicion and cynicism about
our attempt to rationalise the reporting procedure to bring greater
clarity to Parliament and the public. Those suspicions are not
reasonable.</div>
					<a name="08030654000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman has not taken account of what I said: we are proposing to
deliver a report on skills that we commissioned under the energy White
Paper. Surely, that shows our keen interest. The launch of the National
Skills Academy for Nuclear also shows our keen interest. The fact that
the sector skills councils also report publicly shows that we have
nothing to hide. We should not be over-prescriptive about the report
that would be most useful to present to the public  and
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08030654000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
clause, we will remove the requirement imposed by the Sustainable
Energy Act 2003 to report on progress towards energy efficiency aims,
as there is overlap with that report and the requirement on energy
efficiency targets in residential accommodation under the Housing Act
2004. In addition, we produce the UK energy efficiency action plan,
which we will regularly update as required under the energy services
directorate. Therefore, there will be a regular report on energy
efficiency. We would also expect to capture energy efficiency issues as
part of our reporting on carbon emissions in the annual sustainable
energy report.</div>
					<a name="08030654000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1) will also remove the requirement under section 172 of the Energy
Act 2004 to report on the short and medium outlook for security of
supply. As for energy efficiency, we are already obliged under
Community legislation to report on issues that relate to the security
of supply of gas and electricity. Those obligations are fulfilled by
our new energy market outlook, which provides an update on the key
drivers of the security of energy supply and provides scenario-based
analysis of the future supply-demand balance. The energy market outlook
will be published annually. We therefore believe that section 172 is
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="08030654000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
discuss the new clauses, I should like to make it clear to hon. Members
that the clause will not remove our duty to report on the four key
energy goals. As part of the annual report, we will include progress on
key targets, such as the energy efficiency of residential
accommodation, the implementation of the microgeneration strategy and
promoting community energy projects. In addition, the annual
publication of the fuel poverty strategy will
continue.</div>
					<a name="08030654000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">With new
clause 5, the hon. Member for Wealden raises an interesting issue about
the need for increased gas storage capacity by 2020. By that time, it
is estimated that we will be importing between 50 and  80 per
cent. of our annual gas demand, because of declining production from
the UK CS in the North sea. He appears to be seeking to establish the
volume of gas storage that will be needed to secure our long-term
energy security and to ensure that the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 526</div>report annually on progress towards achieving
it.  In effect, the new clause states that they should propose
a target.</div>
					<a name="08030654000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that new clause 5 would interfere with the developing gas market by
specifying the appropriate volume of gas to be stored onshore within
the UK energy market. It is not for the Government to specify to what
extent one form of gas market flexibility is appropriate to help secure
energy supplies. Given the complexities of the energy system, companies
are far better placed to manage risks and to identify and deliver the
types of investment that are needed. In considering which investments
to make, companies must take account of a range of uncertainties,
including current and future fossil fuel prices, carbon prices and
energy demand. I believe that new clause 5 would send the wrong signal
to industry&#151;that there is an ideal amount of gas to be stored
and that it should be stored
onshore.</div>
				
					<a name="08030654000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000563"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> So is the Minister sanguine about the fact that
this country was down to two or three days&#146; gas supply or does
he feel that there is an amount that we should have
stored?</div>
					<a name="08030654000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000564"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am not at all sanguine. Historically, since the
mid-1960s, there has been a natural store in the UK CS in the North
sea. Given the decline in that and the need to import more gas, we need
more gas storage. We have made that clear. We believe, and I would have
thought that the hon. Gentleman believes, that it is best left to the
market to store the gas and to determine these matters. We are not
passive bystanders because, for example, we are taking action by
introducing a regulatory framework for gas storage under the Bill. Our
planning reforms will also facilitate the timely arrival of gas storage
facilities. I am not sure if the hon. Gentleman is saying that the
state should set a target or that the state should build such stores.
What is he
saying?</div>
					<a name="08030654000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000565"></a>Mr.
Swire:
						</b> I am very clear in what I am saying. Of course it
is up to the market to supply the gas. However, I find it extraordinary
that effectively the Minister is saying that the Government of the day
should have no view on how many days&#146; gas storage should be
available to the country at any one time. Is that what the Minister is
saying? Even in a private capacity as an individual, does he not have a
view whether two days or 20 days is acceptable, or 70 days, as in
France? I am not saying that that should be enshrined in law as it is
on the continent, but it is very worrying that the Minister and the
Government seem to be complacent about having an idea of what is
acceptable.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000566"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I do not think that we wish to be prescriptive
about how much gas storage is required. We will clearly need more in
the future. Our regulatory framework will enable that to come on
stream, as will our planning framework. I think that the hon. Gentleman
needs to look at this issue in wider terms. We are all concerned about
energy security and it is an aspect of a nation&#146;s security, but
we can achieve it in different ways. One is by having an appropriate
mix in terms of energy&#151;not all of our eggs in the gas basket, or
any other basket. Much of the Bill is enabling that to happen, with
more renewables and a future generation of nuclear power.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 527</div>
					<a name="08030654000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course in
terms of the gas that we need to import, the Government have been
active on many fronts with the commercial sector to help to bring on
the Langeled pipeline from Norway, for example, and to help to
facilitate liquefied natural gas capacity at this end; I am referring
to Milford Haven. The hon. Member for East Devon needs to see all of
that in the round. I am confident that the market will provide far
greater amounts of gas storage in
future.</div>

increased nuclear capacity is, as I think the Minister would concede,
some way off. Clearly, he is talking about the regulatory and planning

onshore gas
storage&#151;</div>

							<a name="08030654000570"></a>The

We are specifically talking about energy reports, so will the Minister
please direct his response to those
matters?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000571"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> Yes, tempting though it is. This may help the hon.
Member for East Devon. Companies may decide in some instances that it
is more cost- effective to store gas offshore than onshore. Equally,
they may prefer instead to enter into long-term contracts, as I was
implying, for liquefied natural gas, or to take steps to provide
non-gas back-up fuel, such as distillate, for gas-fired power stations
as a coal substitute. It is also interesting to note that, during that
difficult winter two years ago when gas prices were very high, there
was quite a move to coal by power stations. Whereas on an annual
average coal was accounting for perhaps a third of electricity, in
those few months of that winter, that rose to 50 per cent. I hope that
that makes my point about the need for a range of energy
sources.</div>
					<a name="08030654000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me assure
the hon. Gentleman that I very much want to ensure our long-term energy
supply, including sufficient supplies of natural gas. However, I
believe that the way to do that is to ensure that we maximise the
options available to companies to import and to store gas for the
British market. We have already discussed the proposals contained in
the Bill for a new licensing regime, which will enable offshore gas
storage and import projects to be built in future. The Energy Bill does
not itself deal with onshore gas storage, which is the subject of the
new clause. However, provisions to modernise and reform the planning
consents required for onshore gas storage are going forward in the
Planning Bill, and will similarly enable the market to respond to the
need for increased gas storage and import
facilities.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000572"></a>Martin
Horwood:
						</b> I do not think that any of us are questioning the
direction of travel of Government policy on energy
security&#151;indeed, we welcome it&#151;but how is he to judge the
success of the policy if there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div>no sense of what the benchmark is? At least the new clause deals with
the appropriate volume of onshore gas storage. The new clause is
actually fairly modest. It does not even suggest that an exact number
of days of supply should be specified. It simply asks about the volume
of storage capacity. The Minister cannot seriously be suggesting that
that is something that should be left up to the market. What if the
world market&#151;as does not seem entirely unlikely&#151;ends up
being dominated overwhelmingly by one company, such as Gazprom, that
might not be entirely friendly to our national interest? To leave that
entirely to the market is an extraordinary
proposition.</div>
					<a name="08030654000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000573"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> With respect, it is an exaggeration to say that one
company dominating the world gas market is a likely scenario. That is
extremely unlikely in my judgment. I have been trying to make the point
that the new clause relates only to onshore gas storage, and I have
said that companies may well decide that offshore gas storage, partly
because of the provisions of the Bill, might be a more commercially
sensible decision. It seems slightly foolish to be prescriptive about
one approach to energy security, and say that it has to be onshore, not
offshore.</div>
					<a name="08030654000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000574"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> The Minister misunderstands the issue here. The
clause has been phrased to be as flexible as possible, so that every
year the Minster can say, &#147;Actually, we think that we need a bit
more&#148; or, &#147;Now we need less, because we have more
offshore storage and pipelines and LNG terminals.&#148; It is not
prescriptive at all and simply means that he will have to come to
Parliament every year and say, &#147;Look, taking into account the
offshore storage, the LNG terminals and the pipelines, this is how much
we should be having for onshore storage.&#148; That is not
prescriptive and offers tremendous flexibility, and I think that it is
an incredible abdication of responsibility by the Government to leave
that to the market. The crisis occurred partly two years ago when the
Rough gas storage facility was damaged by fire, because overnight we
lost a huge proportion of our gas storage facility. The market could
not react to that and could not put it right, but this is one way of
trying to ensure that our energy security is
guaranteed.</div>
					<a name="08030654000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000575"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> I am enough of an amateur political scientist to
note with interest the call for greater statism from the Opposition
Benches and my advocacy of a market approach on these Benches, and I
understand the irony there. I do not want to repeat myself too much,
because we are talking about a report, but I think that the issues
about energy security, which I take extremely seriously, are much wider
than simply those relating to onshore gas storage. I repeat that we
want to see more gas storage in the future, as we have made clear. We
think that the market will bring that about, and we are facilitating
that through changes in this Bill and in planning.</div>
					<a name="08030654000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Data are important, and in the
Government&#146;s digest of UK energy statistics, which is of course
published annually, we cover a wide range of important energy
statistics, including energy consumption and oil and gas production.
That report also includes details of the projections and capacity of
existing and planned gas storage facilities, so I hope that the hon.
Gentleman is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column529" />Column number: 529</div>reassured that the data are available. It would be pedantic to say that
the data should be somewhere else, rather than there. It is out there
and available for public and parliamentary debate.</div>
					<a name="08030654000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, we are providing
clear and transparent information on energy supply and demand
generally, and that type of information is published in the energy
market outlook, which I mentioned earlier&#151;it seems a long time
ago because of the number of interventions. That is intended to provide
information and analysis to help potential investors and those with an
interest in the UK energy market to form a comprehensive overview of
the likely supply and demand balance in energy over the next decade or
so. I hope that I have explained why I do not think that the new clause
would be helpful. I might not have convinced everyone entirely and
still detect certain suspicions, but I have also explained the steps
that we are taking to encourage a solution. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not seek to press his new clause to a
vote.</div>
					<a name="08030654000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now turn
to new clause 25, which I will also ask the Committee to resist. The
new clause, which was proposed by the hon. Member for Wealden, relates
to the important issue of energy efficiency. Saving energy is a key
part of the Government&#146;s strategy to tackle climate change and
help ensure secure supplies of energy. For example, energy efficiency
can often be a cost-effective way of reducing carbon emissions.
Equally, saving energy can reduce the need for energy imports and the
level of overall new investment needed in large-scale electricity
generation, thereby reducing security of supply risks.</div>
					<a name="08030654000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once fully
implemented, the measures set out in the 2007 energy White Paper are
projected to deliver an additional 7 million to 12 million tonnes of
carbon savings, so no one can reasonably say that we do not take energy
efficiency seriously. Our policies include helping consumers make more
informed decisions about the energy that they use through improved
awareness, information and services, such as better billing, the
raising of standards for the products that we buy, and increasing the
energy performance of new homes and buildings. We have also increased
the obligation on energy suppliers to deliver carbon savings and energy
efficiency measures in domestic homes, including loft and cavity wall
insulation. For the largest industrial users of energy, the European
Union emissions trading scheme, together with the climate change levy
and climate change agreements, incentivises companies to improve their
energy efficiency and save energy. We will also announce a new
mechanism to drive energy and carbon savings in the large non-energy
intensive sectors such as banks and supermarkets. Although the hon.
Member for Wealden and I agree on the importance of energy efficiency,
I must sadly confirm that I cannot accept the new clause.</div>
					<a name="08030654000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already
compile the information that he suggests under the guise of other
reports. Information on energy consumption in the UK is contained in my
Department&#146;s digest of UK energy statistics which, as I said
earlier, is updated regularly and published annually. Under provisions
in the Climate Change Bill, the Secretary of State will also have a
duty to prepare and lay before Parliament an annual statement on
emissions. Similarly, the Climate Change Bill will mandate the
committee on climate change to assess and report on progress and
delivery of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>climate change policies annually, including on energy efficiency
measures. The Government will be  required to provide a
response to the report that it will lay before Parliament.</div>
					<a name="08030654000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted that the hon. Gentleman
opposite said that it was a great disappointment that there was nothing
about energy efficiency in the Bill. I have outlined a whole raft of
measures that we are taking on energy efficiency, and the million
tonnes of carbon that will be saved. However, I do not think that I
have yet heard from him any specific proposals or amendments to bring
forward energy efficiency measures in the Bill. He dealt with it in a
more general way, and I am sure that he will be satisfied that, through
the raft of other measures, we have a more than satisfactory strategy.
Perhaps on another occasion he could table a specific
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08030654000576"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am astonished by the Minister. He will have read
the opening sentence of the Bill where it says &#147;A Bill
to&#148;. Amendments can be tabled and are in order only if they
relate to the issues in the Bill. I would have thought that the
Minister was aware of that. If he wanted to have a discussion and give
us the opportunity to debate energy efficiency, he should have included
a reference to energy efficiency in the legislation. That is why we
have not been able to table the amendments, and why the Committee has
been denied the opportunity to speak about it&#151;it is due to the
way in which he has phrased the Bill.</div>

							<a name="08030654000577"></a>Malcolm

						</b> If the hon. Gentleman makes a technical point, I
accept that. However, he has been speaking about energy efficiency at
some length on a number of occasions&#151;I may have forgotten the
technical point, but I am not clear why he is not satisfied with the
ambitious energy efficiency strategy that we have in place.</div>
					<a name="08030654000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much as it pains me to bring
the debate and my speech to a conclusion, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will feel reassured that the Government take these issues and
their duty to report to Parliament seriously, and that he will not
press the new clause to a
vote.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000578"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am sorry. The Minister has managed to reassure
me on many occasions during the debates that we have had so
far&#151;it has been fairly good natured and worked well. On this
occasion, however, he has not reassured me at all. My concern about the
clause is fundamental. The Government are removing the requirement for
them to report to Parliament on certain factors, and the Minister asks
us to take that on trust. Everything that we see about this Government
shows that when the news is good, they like to announce it, and
reannounce it again and again, and hope that nobody notices that it is
just the same bit of good news. When the news is bad, they like to tuck
it away&#151;&#147;A good day for announcing bad news&#148;, as
one of the ministerial spin doctors told us in the past.</div>
					<a name="08030654000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that the Government
are moving away from reasonable reporting requirements without a good
reason for wanting to do so. I am suspicious about their motives
because it will be used in years to come&#151;not by the Minister who
I know is a decent, honourable man&#151;but by someone who could say,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>&#147;There&#146;s a general election coming up. I&#146;m not sure
that it will be useful to put those figures into the public domain at
this stage. Let us hold back the report for a little longer.&#148;
There will be a row about why the report is being held back&#151;lots
of technical reasons, lots of reasons for why it should not be put
forward at that time, but it means that the Government will be let off
the hook of being held accountable for the decisions that they
make.</div>
					<a name="08030654000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
the two new clauses, I am astonished that the Minister does not believe
that the Government have a responsibility to have a view on energy
security and on how many days of gas storage we should have. Yes, he
tells us that the data are available and published in other ways, but
the data do not include an assessment of need and that is what the new
clauses require. They would also enable us to monitor the progress
towards that goal, which the Minister would have set up. I find that
very disappointing, and it is an issue to which we will most certainly
return.</div>
					<a name="08030654000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08030654000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
energy efficiency, the Minister enjoyed a bit of knockabout. We would
have truly loved to use the Bill to discuss energy efficiency, and
members of his own party would have been keen to do so, too, as was
evident on Second Reading. However, we have been denied the opportunity
because of the narrow way in which the Bill is phrased. Similarly, we
have been denied the opportunity to discuss fuel poverty, which is
another matter of fundamental concern to people. Through the new
clauses, we are asking not that we try to change the world regarding
energy efficiency, but that we start to monitor our progress. The fact
that 40 per cent. of our homes are effectively insulated is not good
enough. We do not know the Minister&#146;s target by 2010 or 2015; it
is not available to us. However, every year, a report should be made
about energy consumption by business and in domestic homes, and about
the progress that is being made to improve energy efficiency. People
watching this debate would then feel that the Government were taking
the issue seriously.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000579"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:
						</b> But the hon. Gentleman would concede that we have
done something far more important, would he not? Namely, we have set a
long-term target that by 2050 we want at least a 60 per cent. reduction
in CO<span class="Sub">2</span> levels when compared with those in 1990. The Prime
Minister said that if we get representations from the new committee
that we are establishing under the chairmanship of Adair Turner, we may
consider a higher target&#151;an 80 per cent. target. That really is
the point&#151;</div>
					<a name="08030654000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000580"></a>The

						</b> Order. I hate to interrupt the Minister, but we
are being taken far wider and referring to matters that would be more
appropriately discussed under the Climate Change
Bill.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000581"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> I am obviously not grateful to the Minister for
that intervention, because it was out of order. However, the principal
objective of the two new clauses is that we want the Minister to have
to come to Parliament to tell us what is happening each year on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div>gas storage, what his assessment of need is, and the progress that is
being made on energy efficiency. His refusal to do so just means that
we must go away with the impression that he does not want to be
scrutinised properly on those matters. That is very unfortunate, and I
remain profoundly concerned about the inclusion of clause 78 in the
Bill. I hope that the Liberal Democrats will support us in trying to
remove it.</div>

						</b> The Liberal Democrat. The hon. Member for
Cheltenham will not be able to vote against himself on this occasion.
We hope that he will give us support, because this is a bad clause. The
clause represents the Government rowing away from their reporting
commitments; it is political rather than managerial, and it was very
misguided to include it.</div>

						</b> Perhaps the hon. Member for Wealden should not
push his luck in assuming my support, or even that of the whole Liberal
Democrat party. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon and I will both
be present when the new clauses come to a vote, probably next week, but
I might change my mind and choose to abstain, which I gather has been
the increasingly fashionable thing to do this week.</div>
					<a name="08030654000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall restrict my remarks to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clauses. I am still perfectly
supportive, and the Government have not produced adequate replies to
the question why the new clauses should not be included. In the case of
new clause 5 on energy security, the Government&#146;s replies were
quite alarming. I am more inclined to support the new clause now than I
was when we started.</div>
					<a name="08030654000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, like the hon. Gentleman, was
not reassured by the Minister&#146;s remarks on the clause stand part
debate. The Minister has gone to enormous lengths to assure us that the
Government have a great record on energy efficiency and are absolutely
committed to developing it. However, if that is true, and it is equally
true on renewable energy and microgeneration, I cannot see what
possible justification there is for removing the reporting requirements
from legislation. Surely the Government should leap at the opportunity
to report in a standardised format that none of us can criticise either
for inconsistency or for being presented in an obscure or difficult
way.</div>
					<a name="08030654000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
suggested that we were being suspicious, but his replies rather fuelled
that suspicion. He did not answer my question about how the reporting
requirements can possibly be outdated. What has changed since 2003 to
make them outdated? How could they have been appropriate then and
overly prescriptive only a few years later? If the list of technologies
specified in Sustainable Energy Act might become out of date in due
course&#151;I allow for that possibility&#151;why did the
Government not draft a proposal to allow for amendment of the list,
perhaps by secondary legislation? That would have been a perfectly
acceptable route. However, by not doing that and given his reluctance
to commit to the specific time scales by which he will be reporting in
a substitute format, the Minister has increased the fears of perhaps
more suspicious people than us that the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 533</div>might be tempted to take the opportunity to obscure bad news and
possibly repackage and represent good news to their own advantage. That
would be a shame. For all Governments, it should be right that we can
compare and contrast statistics on a reliable basis. That has been the
direction of much of the presentation of Government statistics during
recent years, and the clause seems a completely retrograde
step.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08030654000585"></a>Charles
Hendry:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is a matter
of frustration that sometimes when we ask a parliamentary question, we
receive the response that the data are not collected centrally? By
removing a requirement to report, there will be more areas about which
the Government say that they have not collected the data. At the
moment, they are required to do so and we know that the data are there.
It actually makes the job of parliamentary scrutiny more effective and
accountable.</div>

point. The net effect of the clause will make the whole issue of
reporting on such vital issues as energy efficiency, microgeneration
and the development of necessary expertise in new energy sources from
nuclear to tidal power more contentious and less of a discussion of
objectively presented statistics. I wish to press the clause to a

Hendry:
						</b> We are moving into an area where there will
continue to be issues of difference with the Government and we have now
reached the particular issue of smart meters. During our debates on
Second Reading, the evidence sessions and in Committee, there has been
huge support for smart metering. We are certainly in favour of its
introduction. The technology for smart metering is feasible. Industry
is ready to begin its installation throughout the country, but it
believes that we must have legislation to back it
up.</div>
					<a name="08030654000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Smart meters are
in operation in Sweden, Italy, Australia, the United States and Canada.
Italy has almost completed its programme to convert 30 million homes to
two-way smart meters. Sweden has plans to introduce 5.2 million meters
by 2009 and 5 million homes in Ontario, Canada will have smart meters
by 2010. It is widely accepted that it will take about 10 years to roll
out smart meters to all 45 million gas and electricity meters in the
United Kingdom with two to three years of planning and five to seven
years of
replacement.</div>
					<a name="08030654000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Smart
meters will achieve a number of things. They will cover both gas and
electricity and help to tackle fuel poverty directly, enabling
real-time information to be provided on the amount of gas and
electricity being used by any given household. That will bring an end
to the estimated bill, which will be widely welcomed by groups
campaigning on issues such as fuel poverty. Secondly, smart metering
will help to improve energy efficiency, because consumers will have a
technology enabling them to reproduce their consumption figures
readily&#151;they could see when they were going to be charged most.
There will be a whole range of tariffs available, at different times of
the day. If people notice that it will be cheaper to put their washing
machine on in the middle of the night, rather than at 6 o&#146;clock
in the evening, they will be encouraged to do so. They can choose which
sort of tariff suits them. That is good for consumption and for helping
tackle fuel poverty. Smart metering will also encourage new
technologies. Smart meters will support microgeneration technologies,
as they will allow individual homes to sell back to the grid when they
are in surplus.</div>
					<a name="08030654000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a significant amount of evidence in favour of smart meters. In
briefings to the Committee, there was a lot of backing from industry.

it would result either in a direct cost to the consumer at that point

small incremental cost to the individual&#146;s energy bill. One

The frustration is because, outside the House, there is overwhelming
endorsement for including them in the Bill. If it is going to happen,
it needs to be mandated to happen. We have suggested that there should
be a roll-out for it to happen within 10 years. There is overwhelming
agreement that that is a sensible time scale and it does not make a big
difference from where we are now. At the moment 8 per cent. of meters
are replaced or installed every year, so one would simply be moving
from 8 to 10 per cent. Industry and consumer groups believe that that
is achievable. The frustration which people feel is that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 541</div>Bill, which is the opportunity to make that happen, could go through
without it being included. While the fundamental disagreement is not
about whether smart meters can make a good contribution, what we are
saying is that the Bill must be used to try to take forward their
implementation and roll-out. However, from the Minister&#146;s

complex, would be expensive. Electricity display devices are simple and
might be a cheaper option, but they do not deliver the complex benefits
of the smart meters. They will prove a distraction, will cost in their
roll-out, and will be nothing other than an electricity
pedometer.</div>

will be required to make them available to everybody who wants one.
That cost has somewhere to be passed on to consumers as well. One
therefore ends up with consumers paying for something that is of no
benefit to people whatsoever. I hope that the Minister will be able to
give us some encouragement in his
response.</div>
					<a name="08030654000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three new clauses on smart meters. We have gone for a non-prescriptive
one, but we have said that implementation should be within 10 years
because all the evidence that we have heard and the advice that we have
been given suggests that that is a possible  time
scale.</div>
					<a name="08030654000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that although we want to have a debate about smart meters, it is right
that I should also introduce at this point the other two new clauses
that stand in my name. The Minister and the Committee will be glad to
know that I shall do that with great
brevity.</div>
					<a name="08030654000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
new clause 2, there has been a great deal of debate about whether the
energy companies should be required to do more to tackle fuel poverty,
and there are indications that the Chancellor might be planning to make
an announcement on that soon. In particular, Ofgem has suggested
looking at the benefits that the companies receive from the European
Union emission trading scheme. In his evidence to us, Alistair Buchanan
said that that should be considered. At the moment, there is
considerable mystery surrounding what allocations companies receive and
what the financial benefit is to them. It is ironic, perhaps, that at
the moment the greatest benefits from the EU ETS go to the greatest
polluters because they get the largest number of allocations. The new
clause would give us a much better understanding of the issue. It would
mean that the level and value of allocations received by companies from
the EU ETS would be shown and would have to be published in their
annual report. That would enable us to see what they have been
allocated for free, what they have had to pay for and how much they
have had to pay. The issue may go away as we move towards full
auctioning, and if the Minister felt that it was appropriate to build
in a sunset clause saying that the measures would expire over time
unless re-enacted by Parliament, we would certainly be happy to agree
to that. I hope that he is willing to agree to it in principle,
although I suspect that that is a vain
aspiration.</div>

					<a name="08030654000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
was stimulated by what Allan Asher and Alistair Buchanan told us in the
evidence sessions. People should know how much of their bill is going
towards supporting the Government&#146;s environmental aims. Alistair
Buchanan commented particularly on that issue in his contribution,
saying that he did not necessarily advocate it but certainly felt that
it should be considered. He
said:</div>
					<a name="08030654000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
&#163;80 of roughly &#163;1,000 dual fuel average household bill is
now a combination of ROC, which is about &#163;10, your energy
efficiency, which is about &#163;35 to &#163;36, and your European
Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which is around
&#163;30. So, it is very much part of your bill, and there is only
one way that that is going, and that is up. The ROC will go from
&#163;10...I am not saying whether it is a good or bad thing. This is
Government policy. I believe that consumers are starting to address
what they are paying for. Allan raises a very reasonable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div>issue, which is whether the companies start to put that on the
bill...Maybe its time has
come&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Energy Public Bill
Committee, </i>5 February 2008; c.
47.]</div>
					<a name="08030654000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
would build on those comments, as it would provide for electricity
bills to show what elements of the bill would go to ROCs, to the ETS
and to carbon emissions reduction targets, so that people could
understand how their money was being used. The issue is part of the
debate about openness. I think that we all desire that consumers should
be better 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>informed and able to make informed choices, and the new clause is a way
for us to help them achieve that. I cannot see a good argument against
it, unless the Government do not want people to realise what portion of
their bill relates to environmental issues and charges. I hope that the
Minister will have a chance to respond to those points in due
course.</div>
