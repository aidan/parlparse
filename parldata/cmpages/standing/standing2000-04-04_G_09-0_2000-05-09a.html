<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 53, line 11, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Firearms Act 1968 (c. 27)
<P>
. In section 52(1)(a) of the Firearms Act 1968 (forfeiture and disposal of firearms etc.), "in a young offender institution or" is omitted.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 177 to 180, Nos. 182 to 185, No. 187 and Government new clause 5--Abolition of sentences of detention in a young offender institution and custody for life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendment will abolish the sentence of detention in a young offenders institution--DYOI. Following abolition, all convicted defendants aged 18 or over at the time of conviction will be sentenced as adults.
<P>
Since the separate custodial sentence of DYOI is being abolished for 18 to 20-year olds, the need for a separate life sentence provision known as "custody for life" for this age group will no longer exist. The amendment will therefore also abolish that sentence. It is a technical change and will make no practical difference to the length of time served or to the arrangements for determining release. Following abolition, 18 to 20-year-olds will be subject to the same life sentence as adults--life imprisonment. We consulted on these proposals last year and there was broad agreement on their content.
<P>
The Criminal Justice Act 1982 currently provides that a court may pass a sentence of detention in a young offender institution on an offender aged 18, 19 or 20 when he or she is convicted of an offence which, in the case of a person aged 21 or over, would be punishable with imprisonment. Sentences of detention up to the maximum permitted period of imprisonment for an adult convicted of the offence in question may be passed in those circumstances.
<P>
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 modified the sentence of DYOI with the creation of the detention and training order for young offenders aged 10 to 17 whom the courts decide need a custodial sentence. Detention and training orders came into effect on 1 April 2000, and one effect of their introduction is the reduction in the number of young offenders who remain sentenced to DYOI--some 6,000 sentenced 18 to 20-year-olds as at 31 March 2000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> In a moment. DYOI was originally available for those under the age of majority. It seems to have been justified on the grounds of protection. There are good reasons why under-18s should not generally be mixed with older prisoners because there should be some boundary between children and adults, and 18 is now generally considered to be the age of majority in society at large. It is very different, Mr. Maxton, from the time when you and I reached our age of maiority--well, maybe not. At that time, 21 was regarded as the age of majority. However, a further division of 21 would be questionable. There is no research evidence to suggest that 18 to 20-year-olds are more susceptible to rehabilitation than, for example, 21 to 24-year-olds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am seeking from the Minister, even at this point, some clarification. Am I right in assuming that the effect of what the Government are proposing will be that a number of 18 to 21-year-olds will now serve their custodial sentences in adult prisons? Does not the Minister feel some concern about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I do not. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, who I am sure is as keen as we all are to proceed with matters, will wait a moment. To legislate for the abolition of DYOI will provide a number of benefits, which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) may like to take into account. It will enable the courts to sentence all adult offenders--those who have reached 18, the age of majority--to sentences of imprisonment. That will increase the Prison Service's flexibility to manage its estate and should make it easier both to provide constructive regimes for young adult offenders, such as those which best meet the individual needs of that age group, and to keep them closer to their homes, thereby helping to support work on reducing recidivism. There is the advantage for the hon. Gentleman: the Prison Service will have greater flexibility. It will be able to tailor the regimes more accurately to the needs of a wider range of younger people susceptible to rehabilitation and keep them near their families. That is much better than an artificial distinction between those up to the age of 18, those between 18 and 21 and those older than 21, which is simply not justifiable in this day and age. It is much more important to build on the evidence base, to find out what is appropriate and to make sure that it is received. The broader groupings will bring about more effective regimes, which will have the benefit of enabling us to deliver welfare to work programmes to increase young offenders' employability. It does not mean that 18 to 20-year-olds will be mixed indiscriminately with older offenders, as appears to be the concern of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. It is most likely that there will continue to be some separation for most offenders, but there will no longer be a rigid age divide.
<P>
We are also including powers--primarily in subsections (2) and (3)--providing for transitional arrangements. We will need to deal carefully with those offenders currently sentenced to DYOI and custody for life whose sentences will continue to run in the period immediately following implementation, while also ensuring that the flexibility flowing from abolition will have immediate impact. There is a balance to be struck, as I hope that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will appreciate.
<P>
The amendment makes careful provision for those who fall into that group. For example, in disciplinary matters they will not be disadvantaged by the change, as changes to be made to the prison rules will ensure that they will remain subject only to the maximum punishments that would otherwise have been available for their age group rather than those currently available in respect of prisoners aged 21 or over.
<P>
The other amendments in the group are purely consequential. Members of the Committee should be aware that some further minor amendments built around the measure will be taken at a later stage. I also assure hon. Members that we will address issues such as ensuring that vulnerable young adult prisoners will not be put at risk and that movement of young adult offenders between YOIs and prisons will take account of their regime needs before the changes are implemented. We are not rushing into this. We shall be in a position to ensure that the maximum benefits accrue to the young people at the earliest possible stage.
<P>
It is for those reasons and with those assurances that I hope that the Committee will give the new clause and its associated amendments a fair wind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am afraid that the Minister will be disappointed if he believes that his proposals will go through on the nod. We are concerned about what is suggested. We are surprised that the Government are being so cavalier after all the concern there has been about the number of suicides in young offender institutions. The Minister is well aware of the tragic cases in places like Feltham and of all the concerns about those put in adult prisons, such as Armley in Leeds. The Minister has read from his brief that it is "most likely" that there will continue to be some separation of those aged 18 to 21 and adult prisoners. That is not good enough. It is no reassurance for those who have particular concerns about the treatment of young adults who may still be vulnerable. The fact that they have committed offences serious enough to place them in custody suggests that they are people who will need some kind of intensive treatment while in custody. It is not simply the official Opposition who are expressing such concern; concern has been expressed by a large number of bodies. The Government are rushing in to this. The new clause that has been added during the passage of the Bill, and although the Minister has written to members of the Committee to set out the Government's views, we do not believe that it is a wise move. We believe that in a few years' time there will, sadly, be a number of further tragedies and many of those now sitting silently on the Government Back Benches will be expressing grave concerns and wondering why they were whipped into voting for this when it has proved to be wrong.
<P>
The Government will regret this new provision, which will receive much criticism from experts in the penal system in another place. There will probably be attacks upon it by bishops and Law Lords, as well as by peers of various parties and the Minister may even be in trouble again with his own Back Benchers in another place. He is far too casual about the proposals for separate treatment for young offenders, on which there needs to be a great deal more clarity and firmness. If 18-year-olds facing their first custodial sentence are dumped in an adult prison--whatever the Minister says about it being "most likely"--with no certainty about receiving any special treatment, it will be a recipe for disaster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's genuine concerns for young adult offenders, but does he not recognise that this is a crucial modernising step that will effectively remove children under 18 from the influence of those aged 18 and over within a prison establishment? Is he seriously saying, bearing in mind everything that the Government have proposed in the Bill and elsewhere about the role of rehabilitation in prisons and links with the probation and police services, that young adult offenders will simply be dumped in prison and left to get on with it? This is an entirely appropriate measure, drawing a clear demarcation line at 18 years and offering proper services to young adults in prison.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and I am grateful to him for recognising the seriousness with which we make these points. I know that he is being equally serious, but I am sure that he will know from his experience that there are 18-year-olds who are just as vulnerable. It is difficult to make a demarcation line at any age, but in the past we had young offender institutions, although I do not defend everything that happened in them. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) knows that there were many problems and I have referred to some. He says that those who are older should not influence those under 18 years, but the same problem can still arise when older prisoners in an adult prison influence 18 or 19-year-olds. The Government are rushing forward without thinking this through.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Cryer  </B>(Hornchurch): I take, in part, the hon. Gentleman's point about Armley Prison and the suicide rate there. However, he is arguing that there is a connection between vulnerability and age. If that is taken to its logical conclusion, 21-year-olds could be influenced by 25-year-olds, and 25-year-olds by 28-year-olds. What evidence is there of a connection between the age at which people commit suicide and the institutions they are in?
<P>
<B> Mr. Hawkins:</B> Once again, the hon. Gentleman makes a serious and thoughtful contribution. I recognise the accuracy of what he says--that somebody aged 22 can be vulnerable if they are still immature and no age would be perfect. I suggest that it has always been regarded by those, particularly from charities, who work on a voluntary basis in prisons, that the suicide rate is highest among younger offenders of any age.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath for giving way because he is making a powerful speech. Will he help me and other members of the Committee by telling us where he would draw the line and how he proposes that it should be put into effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am simply saying that it is wrong for those aged 18 to 21 to be dumped--I am happy to adopt the phrase used by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre--in adult prisons, which I fear might happen, particularly when one remembers that they would have been in young offender institutions when the upper age limit was 21. While the current system is by no means perfect, we fear that the Government's proposals will make it worse.
<P>
10.45 am
<P>
If the Government could guarantee that all 18 to 21-year-olds in a prison will automatically be in a unit completely separate from adult prisoners that might be different. However, like the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) I listened carefully to the Minister's words. He said that it is "most likely" that there will be some separation.  We have heard a couple of words that can have a multitude of meanings, one from the Minister and one from the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. The Minister talked about "flexibility" for the Prison Service; the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre talked about "modernisation". Those words can cover a multitude of sins, as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon will agree. The Government are always saying that want flexibility and modernisation, but this could be a backward step; it could be less flexible and certainly less modern. To say that it is now appropriate to put 18-year-olds in an adult prison when it has not been regarded as appropriate before, is potentially a recipe for disaster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if one is too prescriptive about this, it could be particularly damaging to young women prisoners, who are often located a long way from their homes because of the relative sparsity of female prison accommodation? Does he accept that the sort of flexibility that the Minister talked about would be appropriate in some of those cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I recognise that that could be right if we were talking about genuine flexibility and of prisoners--particularly females--being a bit closer to their homes. It maybe that, like me, the hon. Gentleman has had some professional connection in the past with the very small number of custodial centres for women. My experience was of a visit to Bullwood Hall prison, in an area not far from where I lived. There are undoubtedly specific issues in relation to women's prisons about which the hon. Gentleman and I no doubt share concerns, but I am not convinced that this is the right way to solve them. The measure has been rushed through and it provides no guarantee that after it becomes law, there will be flexibility. The danger is that, because of the constraints under which it operates, the Prison Service will decide that it cannot fit in with the Minister's statement that there will "most likely" be some separation. Cost factors or other things may result in 18-year-olds, whether male or female, being influenced by older prisoners in an adult prison. That would be a malign prospect.
<P>
I take the matter very seriously and we shall not be happy to accept the Government's new clause and amendments. Therefore, we propose to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I have some other concerns. I understand the problems facing Ministers when officials come along and say "By the way Minister, there are various other things that we should like to add to the Bill". This Bill is about a national probation service and a children and family court advisory service, not prisons. What opportunity has the Minister had to consult on the provision with organisations such as the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and the probation service?
<P>
I endorse the comment from Government Back Benchers about the need for prisoners to be rehabilitated, but all too often prisoner numbers overwhelm the best intentions of prison governors. I have not theological opposition to this, although I understand the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath, but the Committee will be reassured if the Minister will explain what consultation has taken place with organisations such as NACRO that usually have the welfare of young offenders at heart.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Not for the first time, I have great sympathy with the point made by the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry). Like him, I do not have a theological approach to the issue--that would be inappropriate. I am somewhat surprised--although maybe not, on reflection--by the rigidity that has been expressed by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. We need to look at what is best for vulnerable young people. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon has echoed points made by my hon. Friends that vulnerability in youth extends across a range: some young people of 19 are less vulnerable than some young people of 23, and it is absurd to have a rigid, fixed cut--off point at 21 for tailored special provision and regimes. We are not acting precipitantly as has been suggested. We issued a consultation document last August, which was well received by a range of organisations including those already mentioned in the Committee, and we have concluded that the best way to proceed is with this degree of flexibility.
<P>
Let me assure the Committee that the protection of the vulnerable will be a central theme of the work that the Prison Service is undertaking prior to implementation. There is no question of 18 to 20-year-olds being dumped to fend for themselves and left at the mercy of older, more predatory prisoners. Systems will need to take account of a prisoner's maturity and vulnerability, initially through allocation and through separation or supervision or a combination of both. The positive aspect of the proposals is that we shall be able to utilise the resources at our disposal much more effectively because the current rigidities are uneconomic and inefficient. They suck up resources that could otherwise be used in the development of constructive, rehabilitative regimes.
<P>
It is for those good reasons, having consulted fully on the issue, that I urge the Committee to support the amendments and new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Minister has gone some way to meeting some of the worthwhile points made by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. Will he give the Committee a little more comfort on the matter of assurance of protection of the vulnerable at first instance, before they go into prison?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We shall make sure that we issue guidance in prison rules on the treatment of vulnerable 18 to 20-year-olds in order to make sure that they do not suffer as a result of this change. It will be necessary to do some detailed work on the subject. It is clearly important that there should be proper assessment, drawing on the range of information potentially available to the service, as younger prisoners go into the system. Whether they are 19, 20, 22 or 23, the process of induction must be carefully managed. Based on the evidence that we have, I would argue that it is both before and after conviction, during the early stages of entry into the system, that the management of the prisoner, especially the younger prisoner, is so important on the issue of suicide. However, as has been said, one cannot make simple, crude correlations between age and suicide. We know that it can be of help to some younger prisoners to be placed in a cell with an older prisoner during those first few days and weeks of induction. It is not a simple issue.
<P>
The results of the consultation are for all to see in the Library of the House. As a result of the consultation and of the detailed work that is being done by the Prison Service with NACRO and with a range of voluntary organisations, we believe that this will be a positive benefit to younger, vulnerable prisoners right across the age group rather than the limited group who currently benefit from the inflexible and expensive arrangements that do not do what they were designed to do and do not achieve the outcome that I hope we share across the Committee. I urge the Committee to support the amendments and the new clause.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 105 to 109 and No. 103.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I can be brief, but we need a little explanation. We are talking about alterations to the provisions of the Education Reform Act 1988 in relation to the way in which the new regulation about misconduct involving children may arise. When we are talking about people's employment and about changes to an existing piece of legislation it is important that the Minister should set out for the guidance of those who look at our proceedings exactly how those changes will apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendments are straightforward. The Committee has already accepted the clauses of the Bill that help to provide for an integrated system that will prevent unsuitable people from working with children. The amendments, building on those provisions, are nothing more than consequential changes to enactments already made and are therefore changes to schedule 6. There are two exceptions. The first is amendment No. 103, which makes a slight addition to clause 63, dealing with territorial extent. However, it relates primarily to amendment No. 108, which also amends schedule 6. The second is amendment No. 109, an amendment to schedule 7, which repeals section 6 of the Protection of Children Act 1999. That section provides for appeals against prohibition or restriction of employment.
<P>
We have not done away with the procedure altogether. The amendment merely follows on from amendments Nos. 104 to 107, which effectively replace section 6 of the 1999 Act and appropriate references to it, thereby ensuring that such an appeal might still be made in appropriate circumstances. Otherwise the amendments ensure that the child protection provisions of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill and of other legislation mesh fully and consistently, providing the integrated system of child protection that we are seeking to establish. As the hon. Member for Surrey Heath has sais, the main thrust of the changes being made relates to education. For example, there are the arrangements making clear that existing regulation-making powers in section 218 of the Education Reform Act 1988, as amended by the Protection of Children Act 1999, extend to the making of regulations for appeals against the ban on employment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 186, 188 to 190, No. 175 and Government new clause 4--Life sentences: tariffs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The effect of new clause 4 is to bring our legislation into line with a key finding of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Thompson and Venables on the way tariffs are set in cases of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure. As the Home Secretary made clear in his statement to the House on 13 March, we are bound to give effect to that judgment, and the Bill provides an opportunity to make the necessary legislative changes.
<P>
The background to this issue was the appalling murder of James Bulger, a terrible crime that stunned and shocked us all. The series of judgments in the courts here and the proceedings before both the Commission and the European Court of Human Rights could not have made the grief of his parents and family any easier to bear. It would not be right to have any discussion on this issue without putting on record, I believe on behalf of the whole Committee, our profound sympathy for that family for all that they have had to endure.
<P>
The clause changes the way in which a tariff is set in cases where a young offender is sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure as a result of committing murder under the age of 18. That function is currently carried out by the Home Secretary, which the European Court of Human Rights has found to be in breach of article 6 of the European convention on human rights. In future, under the clause, that role will be performed by the sentencing court.
<P>
The clause is drafted so that provisions on tariff setting by courts will appear in the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Bill, the recent consolidation legislation on sentencing. The scheme of the new provision suggests that it should sit with other sentencing matters rather than with provisions dealing with release in the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.
<P>
Under new section 82A to the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Bill, a court will determine the period that must be served before the parole board can consider the offender's release in two sets of circumstances: first, when a court passes a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment or custody for life--that is, where the court is not required by law to pass a life sentence but where that is the maximum sentence for the crime--; or, secondly, when an offender is sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure.
<P>
In determining the minimum period to be served, the court will have regard to the seriousness of the offence, the effect of crediting time on remand if a determinate sentence had been imposed and the fact that long-term prisoners are entitled to be released on licence before they have served the full term of their sentence. This re-enacts the existing factors under the Crime (Sentences) Act.
<P>
The period set by the court will be capable of being appealed by the offender or referred by the Attorney-General on the grounds of undue leniency, as is currently the case with court-set tariffs.
<P>
The court must set a tariff unless it believes that life must mean life because of the seriousness of the offence. This reflects a practice direction issued by the Lord Chief Justice in 1993 in the context of the original version of these provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The Thompson and Venables judgment and others have underlined the importance of this principle for cases involving detention during Her Majesty's pleasure or a discretionary life sentence. It therefore seems sensible to make this explicit. Subsection (5) provides that, in the extremely unlikely event that a court considers that life must mean life, in the case of a person under 18 when they committed their offence, the Home Secretary will determine the period that must be served before the case can be referred to the parole board, which will determine release. That maintains the position under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.
<P>
The new clause has effect in relation to sentences passed after the coming into force of the clause. Arrangements have already been put in place to deal with those sentenced before its commencement and to review existing tariffs in cases of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure. Legislative change is, however, needed to allow courts to set tariffs under this sentence in future. The proposed clause will have that effect and will preserve current statutory arrangements for existing cases. This will enable tariffs in existing cases to be reviewed and, if necessary, re-set under the transitional arrangements announced by my night hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, in his statement to the House on 13 March.
<P>
I should like to add a few words about the provision made in paragraph 2 of the new clause. The Thompson and Venables judgment points strongly towards the sentence and consequent arrangements of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure applying to all those given a life sentence under the age of 18. This is underlined by the abolition of the separate sentence of custody for life, as we propose in new clause 5. The sort of case that might be covered by the amendment is highly theoretical--offences involving killing under the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Genocide Act 1969--but the possibility of a person receiving a mandatory life sentence for an offence other than murder and committed while they were under 18 cannot be excluded altogether.
<P>
I should make it absolutely clear, to avoid any doubt, that the clause does not affect the position of adults who commit murder. They will continue to receive a mandatory life sentence and the Home Secretary will continue to be responsible for both tariff and release decisions. Nothing in the Thompson and Venables judgment affects that position. The European Court of Human rights has drawn a distinction, which I am sure that the Committee would support, between the nature and purpose of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure and discretionary life sentences on the one hand, and the mandatory life sentence for murder committed by those over 18 on the other. In doing so, it has affirmed the compatibility with the ECHR of the role of the Home Secretary in setting tariffs and determining release where an adult has been convicted of murder.
<P>
The role of the Home Secretary in determining the minimum period to be served by an adult convicted of murder and the timing of their release, reflects the unique nature of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment imposed in the light of the particular severity of that offence. That role serves a useful function, underlining the distinct nature of this sentence, enabling the Home Secretary to bring his experience across all murder cases to bear in setting tariffs in individual cases and enabling the wider concerns of the public to be reflected in release decisions. We do not believe that that role should be removed.
<P>
The amendment to clause 63 relates to extent. New clause 4 will replace provisions currently in section 28 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, which extends to England and Wales and to courts martial. This amendment will ensure that the provisions in new clause 4 will have the same extent.
<P>
Amendments to schedule 6 provide for consequential amendments to be made to the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and to the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Bill in the light of new clause 4 dealing with court-set tariffs in life sentence cases. Amendments to schedule 7 make consequential changes to the repeal provisions of the Bill, in the light of the amendments to schedule 6.
<P>
An important feature of the amendments and repeals is that they will only have effect for those sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure after the provisions come into force. This follows the scheme adopted in new clause 4, for the reasons that I have already mentioned. Paragraph 7 to amendment No. 181 clarifies that the existing provision in chapter II of part II of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 applies where a life sentence has been passed by a court martial other than in England and Wales.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee will excuse the length at which I have introduced the amendments and new clause. They relate to a serious matter on which the Committee will wish our position to be made absolutely clear to the wider world, for the avoidance of all possible doubt as to our intentions and the effect of the provisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I begin by accepting that the Minister was right to take some time to set out the matter clearly. I echo entirely his expressions of continuing sympathy for the family of James Bulger. We will all have our own recollections of hearing the news of that appalling crime for the first time. There was a great deal of media interest and I was involved in a number of television debates, on one occasion with the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy). All parties were united in sympathy for James Bulger's family and I am sure that we remain so. The Minister was right to point out that the long running saga of the legal implications of the case must have made the grief of that family worse.
<P>
These are serious issues and we recognise that the Government had no choice but to address them. Concerns have been expressed by a variety of Members on both sides of the House that sometimes the European Court of Human Rights does not appear to understand the way in which the common law tradition applies in England and Wales. That has led to many of the problems in this and other cases. Nevertheless, the Government, having said that they would change the law in the light of the firm ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, had to do something and these provisions follow from that. I am grateful to the Minister for writing to me and to other members of the Committee setting out the thinking that lay behind the Govenirnent's proposals.
<P>
The Minister was right also to make it absolutely clear for the avoidance of doubt that the changes do not apply to adult prisoners. He will forgive me for saying--and once again I recognise that this was something that flowed from the European Court of Human Rights decision--that in the previous debate he said that we cannot have artificial distinctions at the age of 18. Here, with these very serious offences, we have precisely that--an exact distinction, as soon as someone is 18. Although I recognise that we are talking about the most serious category of offences, the fact that the Government are making the distinction between juvenile and adult offenders perhaps reinforces some of the points that I made in relation to the prison disposal of 18-year-olds.
<P>
Leaving that aside, we recognise that this is a matter of the utmost seriousness. The Minister presented it in a serious way and we shall not oppose the necessary  changes to our legislation that have arisen from the Thompson and Venables case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I join the Minister, the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and all members of the Committee in extending our deep sympathy to the Bulger family. These changes had to be made in order to comply with the convention and we support them.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government new clause 6--Transfer of staff in consequence of arrangements under Part I.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B>  The new clause is designed to protect the interests of staff whose jobs are transferred to a new employer under the contracting-out provisions for the National Probation Service set out in clauses 5 and 8 or for the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service in clause 13. It will also apply where such contracting-out arrangements end and the work returns to the original employer. It ensures that staff who transfer with their jobs in those circumstances can be given, through the setting up of a scheme by the appropriate Minister, the protection of their terms and conditions provided for in clause 21.
<P>
Amendment No. 174 provides that this provision, as with other schemes for the transfer of staff covered by the Bill, is not exercised through a statutory instrument. A scheme can be set up simply by order of the appropriate Minister--the Secretary of State in the case of the National Probation Service, and the Lord Chancellor for CAFCASS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I can be brief. The Government are again arranging powers for the Secretary of State to exercise by order, as the Minister made clear. Many unexpected problems arose from Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) schemes. Will the Minister clarify whether additional costs, in terms of taxpayers' money, are likely to arise from the transfers? There could well be unexpected costs, so the Minister should tell us in his response whether he has been advised about any cost implications. We are always concerned about the protection and safeguarding of taxpayers' money.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The amendments will ensure that measures providing for the protection of children properly extend to various parts of the country. They are entirely straightforward and relate specifically to the Jurisdiction of courts martial, rightly a matter of concern to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
Although there is no doubt that courts martial have UK-wide extent, it needs to be carried over clearly and explicitly into these provisions. Neither providing courts martial with a disqualification power wherever they sit, nor providing access to the review tribunal for those disqualified by them requires legislating in devolved areas. That presents no difficulty. The amendments do not change the effect of the Bill, but properly clarify its application to courts martial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification regarding devolved institutions. He is right to say that courts martial are important. I represent a military constituency and issues surrounding courts martial are often raised with me. The Minister's clarification was helpful, so there are no outstanding problems.

 Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. Under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, a disqualification order would presently mean that, while the order was in place, the underlying conviction could never be spent. The new clause will stop the disqualification order from exercising that effect. It is vital that those who have been identified as posing a risk to children are unable to work with them. That is what these measures are all about. However, such an offender should not be disadvantaged in seeking work in other occupations that do not involve working with children. It is important that the existence of the indefinite disqualification does not cause the conviction to remain indefinitely unspent.
<P>
The new clause will ensure that the conviction will be spent once the normal rehabilitation period for the sentence of detention is passed. The conviction and disqualification will always be available--and it is important to stress this point--to those entitled to ask exempted questions under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. That includes working with children as a key group.
<P>
The objective of the better protection of children, which is shared by every member of the Committee, will be served by the new clause. Another important objective--ensuring that employment is available as a tool of rehabilitation and as a tool against marginalisation--is also advanced. We all know that nothing poses a greater risk to children and other vulnerable persons than marginalising potential offenders, which would exert a negative effect on the Bill's purposes. I therefore urge the Committee to support the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We recognise that a balance has to be struck. The Minister is right about that. Every member of the Committee wishes to protect children from the potential depredations of child sex offenders. Equally, however, it is in no one's interests for sex offenders who are undergoing rehabilitation to be prevented from doing any sort of work. If an offender cannot find any job at all, it must work against rehabilitation. It is right for the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 to reflect the right balance.
<P>
The Minister has explained the new clause. He would concede that the new clause is complex and that its provisions will have to be used carefully in relation to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The right decisions must always be made and only those entitled to use the exemption to obtain the records of somebody who has committed a child sex offence will be able to do so.
<P>
We discussed how child sex offenders can be extremely devious. They try to play the system and disguise their past. Many of our debates have been about such behaviour, and we have supported some provisions that have been directed towards that problem.
<P>
I would like to hear the Minister say that he is confident that the provision will work properly and that safeguards will ensure that those who want to protect children do not face unacceptable obstacles to carrying out the checks that must be undertaken to combat the devious sex offender. However, a balance must be struck. We hope that the Government have got it right, and we seek reassurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am confident that we have fashioned the best legal framework that we could for the protection. Having worked on such matters in both the Department of Health and the Home Office, I am equally confident that good practice must always underpin legislative intent and context, to deliver the goods. It will be important to ensure that those responsible for the processes and for administering the procedure are alert to all the dangers that undoubtedly exist and to the need to strike the balance to which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and I have referred.
<P>
I am confident of the legislative effect of the proposal and I am clear about the need to ensure that there is focus and that a resolute and vigilant approach is taken by those responsible for administering the system and those seeking and taking out the necessary references. We are dealing with a guileful and dangerous cadre of people. They can be sufficiently contained and their risk can be reduced only by vigilance, and strong and effective legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause removes the requirement in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for reprimands and warnings to be delivered in a police station. The Crime and Disorder Act introduced reprimands and warnings to replace cautions for young offenders. Endless repeat cautions of young offenders who are making life an absolute misery for their victims have caused much exasperation on the part of not only the general public, but those working in this field. The final warning scheme is designed to end that practice and ensure a progressive and effective response to youth offending.
<P>
Experience has shown that the effect of a reprimand or warning can be significantly enhanced by delivering it as part of a restorative process involving the young offender, his or her parents and, where appropriate--and only where appropriate--the victim. The Home Office has recently issued guidance to the police encouraging such a restorative approach. Indeed, comment has been made in the course of our deliberations in Committee about the value of the scheme. Under current law, a reprimand or warning must be given in a police station, but this has proved unduly restrictive, particularly in cases where a restorative approach is taken. Police stations will often be unable to accommodate such an event and are not always accessible.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The intention of the amendments is to introduce some flexibility into the operation of the final warning scheme so as to allow reprimands and warnings to be given in the most appropriate and accessible location, and not necessarily on police station premises. It is intended that the Home Secretary will issue further guidance on appropriate locations for the delivery of reprimands and warnings following Royal Assent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> This is quite an interesting little provision, simply because of the history of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. I believe that this issue was debated during the Committee stage of that Act. I was a Back-Bench Member of that Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) spoke for the official Opposition. A great deal of concern was expressed about some of the implications of restorative justice. In moving the new clause today, the Minister said that the victim of a crime might be present when such a warning was given only "when appropriate". I believe that that is an example of where the Government, after reflecting on a Bill introduced only some two years ago, have decided that the Opposition were right. I recall that some of my hon. Friends were suggesting that the provisions in relation to reprimands and warnings were too restrictive as they stood. I do not recall offhand whether I made the point that is addressed here. Nevertheless, it is good that the Government have now seen fit--to use the Minister's own words--to become more flexible in this regard, to give the police wider powers. They have discovered, on reflection, that the warnings from the official Opposition that the original provisions were too restrictive have proved to be true. It is good that the Government have now extended the way in which reprimands and warnings can be given.
<P>
We still have some concerns about restorative justice. It is too early to say whether it will be a complete success everywhere. There have certainly been one or two cases, which I remember raising myself, not from my own area but from Thames Valley and involving some of my constituents, which have gone badly wrong. At that time, the Minister's predecessor recognised that there were times when restorative justice had been used inappropriately, but said that it was early days and that we should allow time for the system to settle down. Now, the Government have changed their mind somewhat, only in a minor respect, but it is welcome nevertheless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> They do tell 'em.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): Very well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It is one of the few crumbs of comfort for the Opposition--as some of us on the Government side of the Committee know--to be able to say, "I told you so." The hon. Gentleman has clearly scoured Hansard and, much as he would like to have claimed that he told us so, he thinks that a number of his hon. Friends might have told us so. We hear what he says and we take it in good heart.
<P>
There is no doubt that restorative justice is a process that has produced real and tangible benefits. However, we also know that it is a relatively new phenomenon in our jurisdiction and that it has been a leaming process for everybody, including the police. I have learned a good deal about it from the chief constable of Thames Valley, who has done some sterling work. We have learned that a greater degree of flexibility is needed in relation to venue than was originally envisaged and that is the reason for the new clause. It is necessary for us to build on the evidence of what works. We have done that, hence the new clause. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'. After paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 3 to the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (breach, revocation and amendment of certain community orders) there is inserted--
<P>
"(3) Where a summons issued under sub-paragraph (1)(a) requires an offender to appear before the Crown Court and the offender does not appear in answer to the summons, the Crown Court may issue a further summons requiring the offender to appear at the place and time specified in it.
<P>
(4) Where a summons issued under sub-paragraph (1)(a) or a further summons issued under sub-paragraph (3) requires an offender to appear before the Crown Court and the offender does not appear in answer to the summons, the Crown Court may issue a warrant for the arrest of the offender.".'.--[Mr. Boateng.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The amendment is a technical measure designed to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system. The Access to Justice Act 1999, consolidated in the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Bill, introduced powers to enable the Crown court to reserve to itself when imposing a community sentence all potential breach proceedings in respect of that sentence. That was a measure requested by the Council of Circuit Judges, who argued that judges would have greater confidence in community sentences if they knew that the Crown court would be able to deal with any breaches that ensued.
<P>
In order to expedite proceedings, the 1999 Act further provided that a case going to the Crown court in such a way should not first be heard in the magistrates' court. The summons would be obtained from the magistrates' court, but then the hearing would take place straight away in the Crown court.
<P>
However, if the offender falls to appear at the Crown court when summonsed, the Crown court has no power to issue a further summons or a warrant for his arrest. Instead, the probation service needs to apply to a magistrates court for such a further summons or warrant. The Government consider that there would be an advantage, in the interests of speeding up justice, in circumventing that to enable the Crown court to issue the further summons or warrant. The new clause provides those powers, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I welcome the fact that the Govenment have listened to the Council of Circuit Judges. I know--and the Minister will recall--that it has been a matter of considerable concern in the courts for some time. Although he is not a member of this Standing Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins), who sits as a full recorder, has mentioned it in debates in the House. It will be an extra weapon in the armoury of judges when they are dealing with breach proceedings. It is therefore entirely welcome and on this occasion we are glad that the Government have listened.
<P>
In the past I have raised the concern that people do not listen to the Council of Circuit Judges often enough, and the Minister confirms that he recalls my having done so. I make no criticism of the Minister, but in relation to the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Parliamentary Secretary will remember that I have tabled written questions and on one occasion raised in oral questions the concern that the Council of Circuit Judges did not always feel that it was fully appreciated by the Government. The Minister may wish to take this opportunity to reassure those who sit on the Council of Circuit Judges that this is a sign that the Government are now listening and will take their view into account seriously in the future.
<P>
Having said that, I welcome the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I do not think that there has ever been any doubt as to the wisdom that exists on the circuit bench. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who has direct ministerial responsibility for those issues with our right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chanceller, has always had, the utmost respect for the circuit bench and for what it has to contribute to our reflection and deliberation. We always take care to consult it. For my part, and that of my right. hon. Friend the Home Secretary, in our areas of responsibility, we place considerable reliance on our contact with the circuit bench, both formally and informally, and will continue to do so. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's endorsement of the new clause and I commend it to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The parenting order under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 provides a new means of supporting parents in exercising proper responsibility for their children's behaviour, especially when the child or young person has been convicted of an offence or when children do not attend school regularly. The order will be implemented nationally on 1 June 2000. One of our best debates in Committee was on parental responsibility; although we differed on some of the issues, there was a free and full exchange of views, which helped our work enormously.
<P>
The new clause extends the range of persons who may serve as a responsible officer under a parenting order. It is currently limited to a probation officer, a social worker of a local authority social services department or a member of a youth offending team. The new clause will allow local education authority staff working outside youth offending teams to serve as responsible officers under a parenting order. The additional flexibility will be useful when a parenting order is made in a case in which the local education authority is already working with the child and the family concerned to secure the child's regular attendance at school--we considered that issue earlier in our deliberations. In those circumstances it may be helpful for a member of staff of a local education authority already involved in the case to carry on his or her involvement by acting as a responsible officer under the parenting order. In so doing, he or she can support the parent in complying with and benefiting from the order and helping to ensure that the child attends school. The Committee will recall that the thrust of our earlier discussion was how best to avoid a situation in which the parent failed to carry out those responsibilities and the full rigour of the law was invoked. The new clause makes it easier to work effectively with the parents of children who fail to attend school. I commend the proposal to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I agree with the Minister that we had a good debate earlier on parenting issues, but I have reservations about how the new clause may operate. Although the vast majority of those who work for local education authorities are dedicated people, independent inquiries reveal that individual officers are sometimes criticised for things that they did under pressure of work. Not everyone who works in a local authority bureaucracy is of the same high calibre as the best.
<P>
The Minister talked about flexibility, and, as hon. Members said earlier, that word can cover a multitude of sins. The power in the new clause may be too wide, and I hope when the Minister responds, under the doctrine of Pepper v. Hart, he will say something that clarifies the limit under which chief education officers may operate when it comes to whom they appoint. We are discussing a very serious matter--taking parenting responsibility under parenting orders--and we need to be absolutely certain that the people concerned have the right qualifications, experience and ability. It would be helpful, therefore, at the very least, for the Minister to say how the Government envisage the categories of people working for local education authorities will be included within the proposal. Do the Government intend to issue guidance notes on the matter before the Bill is enacted?
<P>
In practice, in years to come, we may find that the measure gives too wide a discretion. I do not suggest that the Government are mistaken in introducing some discretion, which may be welcome, but they may wish to consider expanding the proposals, perhaps in another place or on Report, or providing further clarification in the Bill, so that the power is not completely unrestricted.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will undertake to think about the matter further, as he has done on previous occasions, and perhaps to consult chief education officers about whether further clarification is needed.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> In my constituency the Government have been kind enough to fund for two years a pilot project with a charity called ACE, which uses members of the community who are highly regarded for their work with young people to work closely with the chief education officer in reducing truancy and other behaviour disorders. I am grateful that the charity works especially on primary school truanting.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath asked which employees of the local education authority would be involved. The wider provisions of the clause will enable us to utilise the community's resources; retired people, for example who have the capacity to take an interest in young people's welfare. Many education authorities are interested in the experiment, which I hope interests the hon. Gentleman; the flexibility in the clause will make participation easier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am grateful for the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter), which highlights what can be done by those with a range of skills, experience and expertise. We seek sufficient flexibility to be able to tap in to those qualities. For example, we can utilise the experience and expertise of a local authority's education welfare officer or educational psychologist, who may have formed a relationship with a group such as ACE. At present, such persons cannot be responsible officers under the Act, but in future they will be able to take that responsibility.
<P>
As a former social services Minister, I understand what motivates the anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. However, at present, any local authority social worker can be appointed; it is not limited to a small cadre of specially qualified or trained social workers. Any social worker working alongside a probation officer or a member of a youth offending team can currently be appointed to serve as a responsible officer. The hon. Gentleman will understand that the best safeguard lies in ensuring that not only is the range of skills available, as I believe is the case, but that the expertise and knowledge of the management and staff at local YOT level can be tapped into to identify the best person to take the role of responsible officer. Let us not forget that, ultimately, the court will specify the responsible officer when making the order. The court, not the chief education officer or any other chief officer--although their input, where relevant, will be welcome--will finally decide who is a suitable professional to carry out the role. The decision will lie with the court, which will have in mind the task of making sure that the responsible person is just that--a person suited by virtue of experience, knowledge and qualification to carry out the role. With that assurance, with full understanding of the spirit in which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath made the point and bearing in mind the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead, I hope that the Committee will give new clause 9 a fair wind.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> At this happy stage, Mr. Maxton, it is my pleasurable duty to express the genuine sense of gratitude that the Committee has, first and foremost, to you. We expected great things, and were not disappointed. Nevertheless, perhaps we did not fully appreciate the extent to which the burden would fall upon your shoulders almost alone. I do not deprecate the<P>
important contribution of Sir David, to whom we also express thanks, but as the order of the days has worked out, the burden has fallen on  you, Mr. Maxton, and we are enormously grateful for the way in which you have enabled us to reflect on this important Bill.
<P>
This has been a good Bill Committee. There have been some hard-hitting exchanges with blows taken and exchanged--most of them above the belt. There has been some good robust discussion and expressions of views from all parts of the Committee. I am grateful to my hon. Friends, those who have spoken and those who have not, for their presence and contributions. I am grateful to the hon. Members for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) and for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), who spoke for the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
I conclude with a few words to two people who have said hardly a word. One said nothing; the other always uttered welcome words, but few of them. These are the largely silent ones, and all too often unsung. I refer specifically to my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) and the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff), without whose careful attention the Committee's progress would not have proceeded as it did. Silent, unsung, but not unloved. On that happy note I end with a special word of thanks to all those who have served us. I thank those who have been extremely helpful in what they have sent forward, largely through the agency of my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith), to whom I am enormously grateful, and those who have recorded our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> It is with great pleasure that I echo the Minister's thanks to you, Mr. Maxton, to all those who have served the Committee, to Hansard and to the Clerk. The Minister is right to say that this has been a good Committee. He started off with his characterisation of some of the individuals and where they stood. We are sad that Miss Goody-two-shoes cannot be with us this morning. Nevertheless, to use another of the Minister's descriptions and one of mine, the hard man and the clever dick have carried the battle.
<P>
The Minister was mistaken in one regard, however. He was not present when we debated probation hostels and so it was the Parliamentary Secretary who benefited from the wise contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire. I echo the Minister's comment that the usual channels are often unsung. They nevertheless<P>
perform effectively on both sides of the Committee. We have managed the sittings very well. On one occastion last week Mr. Maxton, you gave hon. Gentlemen permission to remove their jackets, and you said that, for the first time in your experience, only you did so. That is certainly one unique feature of this Committee.
<P>
We have had good debates, which I hope will benefit those who look at the Bill as it proceeds. The legislation has received careful scrutiny, which is the purpose of a Standing Committee. I end, Mr. Maxton, by thanking you and Sir David  for your chairmanship and all those who have served the Committee in their various capacities.

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I, too, should like to congratulate you, Mr. Maxton, and Sir David on the patient and deft chairing of the Committee. I should like to put on record my thanks to the Committee support staff, the Clerks and those who record our proceedings for their unfailing courtesy and efficiency. I regret that I have not spent as much time on this Committee as I should have liked, as I am involved in the Finance Bill. However, I am aware of the excellent work done by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton, Miss Goody-two-shoes. Her expertise and efforts will have been appreciated by all members of the Committee. The bits of the Committee that I have managed to attend have been excellent. It has been an impressive Committee on both sides. The Finance Bill is not always as constructive and conciliatory, and it is back to the white heat of that Bill for us gluttons for punishment. I end by thanking you again, Mr. Maxton. Please pass on our thanks to Sir David.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My thanks go to all those who uttered kind words to me and Sir David. The balance of work had nothing to do with us, but was entirely down to those two unsung heroes, the Whips, without whom, I am tempted to say, we should have been finished three weeks earlier. I add my thanks to the Clerks without whom no Chairman can operate--well this one can but the rest cannot. Our thanks also go to all those members of staff who have served us, not all of whom are present today: Hansard, the doormen, the police and so on. It is up to the civil servants to thank those people on my right who, as far as I am concerned, do not exist.
