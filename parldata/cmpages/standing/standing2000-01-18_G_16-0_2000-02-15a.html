<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 83, line 4, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except for employees of approved international institutions, where for ``20 years'' there shall be substituted ``the whole of their period of employment with an approved international institution''.
<P>
(2) For the purpose of subsection (1) an approved international institution shall be any organisation set up pursuant to any treaty or convention of which the United Kingdom is for the time being a signatory.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also consider new clause 3—Extension of franchise for employees of international organisations—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) Subsection (1) of section 14 (Service qualification) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 is amended in accordance with this section.
<P>
(2) In paragraph (c) the words ``or an international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member'' are inserted after the words ``British Council''.
<P>
(3) After paragraph (e) the words ``(f) is a person under the age of 25 who is with a parent qualifying under any of paragraphs (a) to (e) above,'' are inserted.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> We return to slightly more domestic surroundings than those in which we found ourselves yesterday when the Bill was being considered in the House.
<P>
Perhaps we should start by considering what the clause is about and what the outcome of our discussion should be. From my perspective, the original provision to extend a 20-year qualification to remain on the United Kingdom voters register to those living overseas was introduced for straightforward party political advantage. Those who introduced the provision intended to enfranchise a large number of expatriate United Kingdom citizens because it was their expectation that they would vote Conservative; but that piece of gerrymandering did not work. Nothing like as many people registered as the Conservatives had hoped and, although the details have been kept secret, there is little evidence that the legislation affected the results in any UK constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): If one removes the phobic element from the hon. Gentleman's remarks, it could equally easily be said that a measure was introduced and taken up by a small group of people: those, one might assume, who were genuinely keen to participate in UK politics. Since that time, those people have quietly exercised that right, and there is no suggestion that any distortion of the electoral process has occurred as a result. Therefore, it was a commendable measure. It is not for Governments or political parties to try to judge how those living overseas might vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am not sure, Mrs. Michie, how far you would allow me to explore the argument about the motivation behind the original provision. My understanding is that a typical constituency contains no more than a handful of such voters. That contrasts with what Conservative Home Secretaries said at the time about the several million people who were disenfranchised and should be included in the electoral roll. However, my purpose was not to establish blame or even motivation for the legislation, but simply to say that, at the time, the measure seemed designed to serve a particular political purpose. It clearly has not done so because, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) just said, it has been of value to only a few people who are highly engaged in the UK political system. The Bill will reduce the period of qualification.
<P>
The purpose behind the amendment is to ensure that, in limiting what I regard as a scam, we do not throw away one of the beneficial side effects of the legislation. The amendment would allow employees of approved international institutions to remain on the electoral roll for the whole of their employment with that institution, and defines a process for establishing which institutions shall be counted for that purpose.
<P>
Let me draw a parallel with service voters. The amendment deals with employees of international institutions, who are very often in place because of quota systems ensuring the employment of a specified number of United Kingdom nationals. Such people often have a dedicated interest in the United Kingdom and in the political process in general. Their position is equivalent to service in the armed forces. Were such people employed in the armed forces, they would be able to stay on the register as service voters, notwithstanding the fact that they might spend longer even than 20 years overseas on various international postings.
<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure that cutting the privilege currently offered in all circumstances to UK nationals living overseas does not also prune out a group of people who are serving the UK in international institutions, who have a clear and direct connection with the UK political system and who often have a firm interest in it. The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) has made parallel proposals in the new clause, which covers the same ground as the amendment. I shall listen carefully to his remarks on the new clause, but the two proposals march together. Collectively, they are an attempt to ensure that we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): I am pleased that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) is thinking along the same lines as my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and myself in trying to solve the difficult matter with which the new clause deals. Our proposal is slightly tighter than his in the definitions that it would insert into section 14 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. New section 14(1)(c) would enfranchise by deliberate decision employees of the British Council who are outside Great Britain. The new clause would make the logical change of ensuring that the legislation covers people who are closer to the Crown but who are not necessarily directly employed by it. The final phrase of the amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any organisation set up pursuant to any treaty or convention of which the United Kingdom is for the time being a signatory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new clause uses similar words. It proposes the insertion of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an international organisation of which the United Kingdom is a member''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after the provision relating to the British Council. However, it goes slightly further than the amendment to clarify the provisions in relation to a minuscule group among the children of public servants working in the various relevant institutions, about which I shall say a little more in a moment. Such young people may be disenfranchised by virtue of their residence with their parents, who will have travelled outside the United Kingdom. It is an anomaly to include the spouses of such people but not their children. However, ``children'' could include people aged 40 or 50, although 25 is probably an appropriate limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument; indeed, I hope that he realises that I support it. However, I am not quite clear how that provision rides with the provision for a 10-year qualification. Would not such people be so qualified in any case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is a more expert draftsman than me, I am happy to have that pointed out. However, we seek to ensure that people who come of age while living overseas with their parents, who work in the service of the Crown, the British Council or the other institutions referred to in new clause 3(2) would obtain protection through their parents' previous residential qualification in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): The Representation of the People Bill covers that point. Paragraph 1(4)(b) of schedule 2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he was by reason only of his age incapable of being included in any register of parliamentary electors . . . on the last day on which he was resident in the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording is designed to ensure that people who leave the UK as minors and who reach the qualifying age of 18 while living abroad can still qualify for the overseas vote if they can prove that they were resident in the UK when they left.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for clarifying that point. I thought that it was covered in legislation, but I was not certain.
<P>
Finally, I shall cite some examples of why the change is appropriate. We want to have British citizens working for institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the United Nations and the European Commission. Due to the nature of their work, we want to ensure that Britain had its fair share of nationals engaged behind the scenes in administration and policy development, and if we are to treat them as full citizens, we should ensure that they have the opportunity to vote in our elections. I know that it is not appropriate to move the new clause yet, Mrs. Michie, but I have spoken in favour of new clause 3 and rest my case. I welcome the spirit of the observations made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> This is a fascinating debate. I find myself wholly in sympathy with the idea behind the amendment and the comments of hon. Members, but I see a certain illogicality in their approach. The criticism that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove makes of those who have enjoyed the 20-year overseas franchise rule is that they leave the United Kingdom to work abroad, perhaps not intending to return, yet continue to dabble in United Kingdom politics in a way that he finds offensive. He feels that it is wrong and should be stopped. Comments by the hon. Member for Battersea were in a similar vein. However, as the hon. Member for Hazel Grove knows, I am more relaxed about that.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Now that there is an intention to reduce the time to five years rather than 10, we need to consider alternatives for those who work for international organisations—such organisations to be approved—so that they may continue to vote while they are away. I do not find that idea more objectionable than new clause 3, but if what is important is the time that a person spends working abroad for an international organisation, why are we not extending the same right and courtesy to individuals who are abroad working for a foreign company? Where is the logical distinction between the two categories? The only difference that I can see is that one group belongs to the apparat.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I shall try to explain the logical difference. New clause 3 would extend the right to vote to people who are required to work for international organisations by virtue of treaties to which Britain is party. It is in Britain's interest for those employees to play an active part in those institutions and retain their links with Britain. That is entirely different from the voluntary sector or a commercial company.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> This is where the hon. Gentleman and I part company. Let me give an example. One of my closest friends worked for the Department of Trade and Industry when he came down from university. He was seconded to the European Union in Brussels, where he remained for a number of years before swapping horses and working for the European Commission. He has a job that gives him considerable status and in which, no doubt, he does good work. He is married to another Commission employee who is a foreign national; they met during the course of their employment. I have not got a clue whether he will return to the United Kingdom at the end of his career. He may do so, but it is equally possible that he may not.
<P>
The rules that have been formulated by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) would mean that so long as my friend works for the European Commission, to which we are bound by treaty, he keeps his right to vote. I am comfortable with that. I see the logic of it and it does not bother me in the least. To that extent, I support what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve. I infer that he has chosen the cut-off date as the day when my friend gives up his employment with the European Commission because that is when a choice will have to be made. Either my friend finishes his career working abroad for an international organisation and comes home or, if he chooses to remain abroad, the guillotine—perhaps I should say the portcullis—comes down, lowered by this House.
<P>
In terms of fairness, I am unable to distinguish that example from that of a person who decides at the age of 25 to work for a British company. After three years, the company sends him to the United States of America to work for one of its major subsidiaries. He remains there for the rest of his working life, with the intention of returning to the United Kingdom on retirement. Neither his return, nor that of my university pal once he finishes at the European Commission, can be guaranteed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; I hope that I can be helpful. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston spoke of treaty obligations on behalf of British nationals. Surely, if my hon. Friend is right, those working for British companies overseas in the European Union are exploiting the EU's treaties. If they are working in the United States, obligations under the general agreement on tariffs and trade might apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The flavour that emerges from the amendments is the favouring of apparatchiks—those working in the state system who belong to organisations that have been given the stamp of approval by the Government. I like the spirit of the amendments—they are a halfway house for what I would like to achieve—but they would create a manifest unfairness and an illogicality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I direct the hon. Gentleman to section 14(1)(c) of the 1983 Act, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is employed by the British Council in a post outside the United Kingdom''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He should realise that people currently fall into the same category as his university friend. I wonder whether we have a mutual friend, because—worryingly—his friend's description fits that of one of mine exceedingly well. Someone who works for the British Council and moves on to work for Save the Children Fund can still be trapped by the constraints of section 14. What is new?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> What is new is that the hon. Gentleman wants to extend the categories. The existing categories are narrow—
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Yes, I agree. We might want to go down that road, although there might be a problem administering it. The logical conclusion of the hon. Gentleman's proposal is that anybody working abroad for a British or a foreign company, and who has an intention, which cannot be disproved, of returning after the work has been completed should be entitled to vote in a United Kingdom election.
<P>
Why should working for a foreign institution such as the European Commission confer an advantage? That institution has much to commend it. I have visited it and spent time there as an unofficial parliamentary private secretary to one of the Commissioners, acting as a link to this place. There is no logical reason for extending rights. The way into a job at the Commission is often through having been a civil servant in this country first. Once a person has been taken on, having passed the competition, he works for an institution to which the United Kingdom is a treaty signatory. British nationality is a precondition for working there, as it is necessary to be a national of one of the European countries. Nevertheless, logically, there is no further link with the British Government. Indeed, people who work there must make the point that they are independent of them. They are the servants of the Commission and the European institutions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seeks to extend the category, but that results in something illogical and unfair; it discriminates against those who happen to work, say, for British companies abroad. With what distinction, value or rationale can he justify that? I do not see any. In fact, I suggest the measure will be another fertile area for challenge under the Human Rights Act 1998. I keep invoking that measure as I am looking forward to its coming into operation. A plethora of complicated cases will be brought. If I worked for ICI, for instance, and had been sent to work in France and intended to come back, why should I be denied the vote, while someone working for the European Commission was allowed it? That would be the consequence.
<P>
There is a distinction between what I have described and the present arrangements, because the British Council has always been seen effectively as a British governmental organisation abroad. It is wholly funded by the United Kingdom taxpayer. That case is clearly distinct from that of a civil servant abroad—and of course from those who work abroad in the armed forces, who are covered by a different regime. I can see the logic of the existing distinction, but I cannot, however much I welcome the extension of the franchise to people abroad, understand the distinction between the specified categories and people working overseas with foreign or British companies. That makes me reluctant to support the measure, because fairness should underpin our approach to the franchise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Let me have one last try. The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer and I am not, but does he agree that his example of ICI, which he compared with the EC or NATO in Brussels, is false? It would be illegal for ICI to specify that a worker in France or Brussels had to be British, whereas under the treaties some of the employees of European institutions must be British.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> That is the high point of the hon. Gentleman's argument and I accept the point. That is about as far as it can go. However, I have another example—international defence contracts operated abroad and paid for by governmental link-up. In a very big project in Saudi Arabia, large numbers of British Aerospace employees, and others, spend long periods abroad working on defence agreements. They are not Government employees. They are the employees of the companies for whom they work. They will not fall within the category. Is that right?
<P>
Despite what the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston says about deciding where one works, in reality if people want to get on in their careers they often have to make difficult choices about going abroad. There are many types of employment in which saying at the initial interview, ``I will not go abroad'' means not getting the job. Choices in this sphere are inevitably limited. The hon. Gentleman is being creative, and his last point was his best, but it is still not good enough. I am not prepared to support discriminatory moves that give advantages to those working in the state machine.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The inconsistencies perceived by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield need last only a few minutes. I shall not test your patience, Mrs. Michie, by referring to the arguments for new clause 1, except to point out that it deals with the cases that he described. There are two ways of qualifying for an overseas vote: first, by virtue of one's job—until now that has applied to people who work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the civil service, the armed services or the British Council—and, secondly, by means of a time qualification of 20 years. New clause 1 will add a different way of qualifying which would include all the categories that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. If I am pushing at an open door, I hope that the Minister will let me know and I can save my breath.
<P>
I want to make the case for people working for international institutions. Like many other members of the Committee, the Minister may have received a letter from four senior European Union officials—Marion Dewar, Jacqueline Minor, Sarah Lambert and Tobias Mackie—one of whom is from a well-known political family, giving reasons why the present categories of the civil service, the British Council and armed services should be extended. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Firstly, we are public servants working to serve the public in Britain as well as in other member states. Secondly, we work for a trans-national organisation of which Britain is a member and which represents Britain's interests. Thirdly, it is Government policy to try to increase the representation of British nationals in Brussels on the basis that it is in the national interest to have as many British nationals as possible working in the EU, so these institutions can better reflect our culture and attitudes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter concludes with the following relevant point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We believe that this aim is reinforced by ensuring that those working inside EU institutions retain their connection with Britain. Disenfranchisement severs this link with British political life and risks weakening their ties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The demands of equality and the national interest do not always coincide in such a way. The letter calls for equality of treatment with domestic civil servants for those working for international organisations and it is in the national interest of this country that they should retain a strong sense of identity with the United Kingdom when they are working abroad. It would be unjust and counter-productive not to make concessions to their case as they would thus not only be disfranchised, but would feel disenchanted and disaffected with their mother country.
<P>
I have two further points: first, many people have accepted jobs since 1989 expecting that their voting rights would be safeguarded for 20 years. Although it is within the powers of Parliament to amend legislation as it sees fit, many people were recruited on that understanding. The only thing that might prevent the Minister from accepting my proposal is that he may wonder whether the definition of international organisations is sufficiently clear to avoid creating confusion or inviting argument. The organisations involved are those of which the United Kingdom is a member; they include all European Union institutions, NATO, the United Nations and its daughter organisations, the Council of Europe and the Western European Union.
<P>
We are a long way from the days when the only representatives of Britain abroad were diplomats or soldiers. In these days of globalisation, it is time that we recognise that there are far more people who fly the flag in other countries. Given that they represent their country abroad, it is not asking too much that they should be guaranteed a say in how it is run.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman's argument about keeping ties with this country apply equally to those who go abroad to work in business?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I take the point. I do not want to anticipate the next amendment, but there are two avenues by which one can qualify for an overseas vote. It is right to give an automatic qualification to people who work for international organisations because of their representative capacity. Equally, for people who do not work for organisations which themselves are representative or who are called upon to act in a representative way, there should be another form of qualification. Whether that should be simply a matter of time or decided on a use it or lose it basis is something that I hope will be resolved in our discussions on the next amendment. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield failed to argue that there are many individuals who work for British companies, voluntary organisations or charities overseas. I have lived in a European capital; I know that the expatriate community contains—
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> London is a European capital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I have lived in a foreign capital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he had lived in a European capital; he lives in a European capital now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; I cannot deny that London is a European capital. I know the expatriate community; one expects it to be full of diplomats, but many people living in other European capitals retain a strong link with Britain and, by any standard, they should be just as entitled to a vote as we are. Of the 8 million or 9 million people who would qualify on grounds of citizenship for an overseas vote in this country, they account for only a small proportion. Although we can all cite examples of deserving cases, many people who qualify under the 20-year rule have a distant connection with this country. I cannot cite cases, but I can give the Committee examples of the types of categories. Many people have dual nationality; many Indian citizens would also qualify for a vote in Britain should they want to claim it. Many people move abroad because they have a foreign spouse; they may still have a British passport but they are also entitled to a passport from the country where they live and they may take an active part in its politics.
<P>
The number of those people who retain a strong link with Britain and intend to return here is only an infinitesimal part of the total number of people who qualify under the 20-year rule. That is why it is important to create two different avenues for qualification: that of jobs, which the proposal would extend, and that of a continuing link with Britain, which we hope to explore in the next amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I prefer new clause 3 to amendment No. 110, which hangs on clause 130, the substance of which we might challenge in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
In clause 130, the Government want to limit the franchise by halving the qualifying period; these amendments and the next three on the selection list would turn it back again, for legitimate reasons. I know what my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said about those working for British companies overseas, and the fact that, as I said in an intervention, many of them might be working overseas as a result of treaties that have been entered into by the United Kingdom. However, that is not what is before us; the amendment would extend the franchise to those working not as Crown servants but as direct employees of overseas institutions in which the United Kingdom is a participant. The most obvious examples are the European Commission and other institutions of the European Union, but the Bank for International Settlements and United Nations agencies and organisations, which are located principally in Switzerland, although some are in Rome, are also relevant, as are many others that are outside the European Union. I have a great deal of sympathy with amending the Representation of the People Act 1983 to bring people who work for those bodies within the scope of the rules that apply to Crown servants. That would help to ensure that genuine British subjects who live overseas and work in the interests of the UK are not disfranchised while they give allegiance to the UK.
<P>
Recent developments to extend the franchise in this country are intriguing. EU citizens who are resident in the UK are allowed to vote in elections tor UK Members of the European Parliament. Historically, that franchise has been extended to citizens of Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland. Many countries, especially those in the EU, have encompassed into domestic law similar provisions for European parliamentary elections. Some have even done that for local government elections. However, we are discussing elections to national Parliaments, in particular to this place, and I am comfortable in supporting new clause 3, which is a step in the right direction
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove gave us the history of the subject. Although I shall not go so far back, I remind the Committee that the Select Committee on Home Affairs, of which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea is an influential and hard-working member, considered the matter last year and recommended—I think unanimously—reducing the qualifying period from 20 years to five years. The Government considered its report and decided that the move from 20 years to five, although a step in the right direction, would go too far. The reduction to 10 years strikes the right balance.
<P>
Amendment No. 110 and new clause 3 have similar purposes. They would single out people who work for an institution that is linked to the Crown and allow them to vote for a longer period. Although their approach is slightly different, the effect is largely the same. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove and my hon. Friends the Members for Battersea and for Ellesmere Port and Neston have developed a case. There is strength in the argument that people who work for bodies such as the European Commission, NATO and the United Nations have a similar claim. We have heard that the RPA makes special provision for the registration of Crown servants who work abroad. That provision covers mainly soldiers and diplomats who work in overseas embassies. In that context, there was a romantic feel to some of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, as there is to the notion of—dare I say it—our people going abroad to start, solve or negotiate wars. We have a long and chequered history in such matters and I can see the parallels that could be drawn.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Committee has acknowledged that the provisions are narrowly drawn. I have listened carefully to the debate, and we must reflect on what has been said. We have accepted that some problems arise from the amendment and new clause, which attempt to define Crown bodies in different ways. I do not think that those problems are major or insuperable, however, and I guess that a way round them can be found.
<P>
I was struck by the remarks made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. There appeared to be some tension between his comments and those of the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter). There is a legitimate argument for asking what differentiates people who work in Brussels, Washington or Strasbourg from people who pursue the United Kingdom's interests abroad. For example, many people in the energy sector, which is opening up throughout the country, work abroad. People with energy backgrounds in coal and electricity are working throughout the world and pursuing the British interest. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield described the Bill's treatment of such people as manifestly unfair and illogical. I would not use such language, but I accept the problem. The more we explore the matter, the more we can see a problem regarding non-governmental organisations. It is conceivable that somebody working for the Save the Children Fund could occupy a specific post that was funded by the Government. Such a person could spend more than 10 years in a worthwhile job of working in Africa to relieve poverty, but would not be covered by either the amendment or the new clause. There is a philosophical difficulty in defining why the Bill should cover public servants, but not people in the voluntary or private sectors who are also pursuing British interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): In fact, there is a strong argument that many people in the private and voluntary sectors should be allowed to vote here if they are paying taxes here. Many people who work in the public sector abroad, especially in organisations such as the European Community, do not pay British taxes and, therefore, could have less entitlement to vote in Britain than people in other categories.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) reminds me of the Committee's earlier discussion about the definition of impermissible foreign donations. One of the questions explored was whether people who paid taxes in Britain should be allowed to donate to political parties here. The Government take the view that the practical solution to that difficulty—and perhaps to the difficulty under discussion—is that registration should be the telling test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> We are perhaps dangerously near to prejudging debate on the next clause, but the new clause is specifically concerned with tidying tip section 14 of the Representation of the People Act. That section contains an illogicality, according to which someone who works for the British Council may vote, but someone who works for NATO cannot. That is manifestly unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I understand the intention behind the new clause. It might be a tidying up exercise, but it still leaves ragged edges. If we tidy up the issue, the person who works for Save the Children Fund and the person who pursues British interests abroad in the private sector will feel that there is an argument that they should be included. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea said that some people had taken up posts since 1981 secure in the knowledge that they would be entitled to take advantage of the 20-year period. The new clause will not come into effect until after the next general election and we do not intend to implement the provision until rolling registration is in operation. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove will know, it can take up to 15 months to have one's name put back on the register. If we move to rolling registration, people who return from abroad will be able to have their names put back on the register in, perhaps, six weeks. I hope that provides some succour to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the arguments that I have heard in Committee today and have not dismissed them. However, I want to consider the matter further. I intend to have discussions with ministerial colleagues at the Home Office and at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have been taking an interest in the issue. There are real problems, which cannot easily be resolved. The argument was well put by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield: why should people in the listed categories be treated differently from people who work in the private sector? However, if we make a concession to one group of people, might there not be arguments for making concessions elsewhere? I give an undertaking to the Committee and to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that further discussions on the matter will take place. However, I am not in a position to give the Committee an undertaking this morning that the Government will table amendments at a subsequent stage of the Bill to deal with the issue. I have seen the letter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea referred and we shall seriously consider the problem. Other meetings are scheduled in the House with interested parties and we shall consult further. I acknowledge that there is some strength in the arguments put forward in Committee today.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister but, reading between the lines, his response was disappointing. I want to make one point that I should perhaps have made at the outset. I have close relatives who would not benefit either from the proposal or any alternative proposal, who lived and worked in Switzerland and the United States of America for a long time. Therefore, I am familiar with the sense of disenfranchisement, but I want to make it clear that nothing I have said would affect their status.
<P>
The arguments that have been advanced in opposition to amendment No. 110 and new clause 3 overlook a crucial point that I have made and the hon. Members for Battersea and for Ellesmere Port and Neston have also emphasised. We are discussing situations in which the United Kingdom has a treaty obligation to participate in an organisation. In practically all the cases that I can think of, there is a direct commitment to supply UK nationals to make the body work. Such a commitment to NATO is clearly different from one to ICI to promote its export trade in China—the straightforward distinction will be evident to the public and to employees of NATO and ICI. It is disingenuous to stir mud into the water of the argument by suggesting that the situations are parallels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks of muddying the waters, but the waters of several international organisations in which we participate would be muddied by his amendment. Eutelsat, based in Paris, is an international organisation to which the UK is a signatory. However, all the UK nationals working for it are employees of British Telecom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> There are two responses. First, I invite the hon. Gentleman to consider carefully the definition of approved international institutions given in the second half of the amendment. There are many trade treaties that, by no stretch of the imagination, have created approved international institutions to which people would be recruited. Such is the mud dropped in the water to which I referred.
<P>
Secondly, there is the case of the Saudi Arabian arms contract. I would have to consider several issues—including family and education—if I was weighing up whether to accept a job on contract, aside from issues about the contract itself. As a teetotaller, I need not worry about the alcohol issue. The preservation of my vote in the United Kingdom might be a long way down the list of issues, to be truthful.
<P>
Hard cases can be made and marginal situations can be described. A process of making anomalies begins once the vote is granted to anyone who lives outside the United Kingdom: soldiers—yes; members of the diplomatic service—yes; Members of the British Council—yes. All such people are included currently and are considered to be mainstream.
<P>
The amendment would regularise the situation for a string of new international institutions. The hon. Member for Battersea referred to globalisation, but there is more internationalisation than globalisation with NATO and Europe. Those who drafted the original legislation did not have in mind institutions that now provide significant places in which UK citizens employed there rightly promote the UK public interest.
<P>
It is important to understand the direction of my amendment and of new clause 3. They would update the list of situations in which UK citizens working overseas may continue to vote. The aim is not primarily to help them but to help the UK—there is a public interest, rather than a voter interest, argument. I hope that during further consideration, the Minister and the Privy Council will join the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Trade and Industry to see what might be in Britain's best interests.
<P>
A number of analogies were drawn and examples given. I could deal with them in detail, but I shall not take the Committee's time. The Minister said plainly that he will offer talks and not much else. I say plainly to the Minister that I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, but I want those talks to be substantive and to produce an outcome. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I support clause 130. Indeed, I may have helped persuade the Home Secretary to include its provisions in the Bill. I certainly pressed the recommendation of the Home Affairs Committee, to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred. The Committee may therefore wonder why I want to replace clause 130 with the new clauses.
<P>
Life is never straightforward, one sometimes aims for a target and hits another. I was aiming for the tax exile. I did not want those who had little connection with the United Kingdom, especially those who left to avoid paying tax, still being able to fund British political parties. Clause 130 achieves that end; if Mr. Ashcroft had not already announced his intention to return to Britain, it would certainly have stopped him funding the Conservative party while living in Belize. It would also make it much more difficult to use overseas voters as a conduit tor overseas funding—it would close the loophole on the ban on overseas funding, which is a central part of the Bill.
<P>
We can achieve all that we want without disfranchising the small but dedicated band of existing overseas voters. That circle can be squared by the ingenious amendment—it was dreamed up by the coordinating committee of branches of Labour International, with a little help from the British Conservative Association of Switzerland—known as ``Use it or lose it'', which is the basis of the new clauses. The clauses make use of the fact that the majority of overseas British, who number between four million and eight million—I have been unable to find a more specific estimate of their number—cannot be bothered to register as voters. Many of them have dual nationality, and although they have lived here, many have little remaining interest in the country. However, a tiny minority of 13,000, which is between one third of one per cent. and one sixth of one per cent., are determined to maintain their link with Britain, and the vote is living proof of that link.
<P>
Amendment No. 34 acted as a holding operation while we consulted overseas voter organisations, such as Labour International. Those organisations came up with the idea for new clause 1, which would allow United Kingdom citizens living overseas to register at any time up to five years—that is the provisional recommendation of the Home Affairs Committee—but which provides that they can remain registered thereafter only if they renew their registration every year. If they fail to register, they will lose it for good. They must renew it or lose it. Once those people return to the United Kingdom, they can register again, which will be a relatively quick exercise under the rolling register. New clause 2 makes the same provisions as new clause 1, but applies to peers.
<P>
Those provisions are a happy compromise, and I pay tribute to the constructive work of the international organisations of both parties. I found their arguments persuasive. Overseas voters deserve some certainty in their lives. Overseas voting was not allowed until 1985. It was limited to five years until 1989, when it was increased to 20 years. Now the Home Affairs Committee has called for a return to five years. The Home Secretary has suggested 10. We need to know where we are.
<P>
I have, as I mentioned before, lived in another European capital—Helsinki. Although I was there for only a short time, I know that an expatriate community comprises disparate people who are there for all kinds of reasons. For reasons elaborated on by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on the previous amendment, it would be invidious to suggest that civil servants and employees of international organisations—who should, I agree, have the vote as of right—should be the only or main group entitled to it. Many people live abroad, for a host of reasons, and it is not for us to judge or try to prescribe or delimit approved reasons.
<P>
Many people nowadays teach English as a foreign language. In every European capital as well as London there is quite a community of English teachers. Many, for obvious reasons, retain strong links with this country. If those people live in the European Union, the Maastricht treaty guarantees them the right to vote in local or European elections. Indeed, a British citizen living in Helsinki or Athens can stand as a local councillor and a Member of the European Parliament. For national elections only, it is assumed that one votes in one's own country.
<P>
It is fair enough to provide, as the new clause does, that a person who is not a dual national and who is determined to keep the vote should have that chance. The cost of that should be willingness to renew it each year. The ``use it or lose it'' nature of the concession would ensure that it would not be used by the half-hearted, by tax exiles or dual nationals—who are specifically excluded—or by rootless people who live in no particular place. It would, however, be used and appreciated by the small group of people who live abroad but remain committed to this country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I feel able to support the amendment and new clauses in this group as a means of achieving the Opposition's aim that genuine British subjects working abroad—and, as the hon. Member for Battersea said, it is perhaps not for us to delve into their reasons for working abroad and continuing to hold allegiance to the United Kingdom—should be able to preserve their right to vote. The current voting rights provisions are a fairly blunt instrument. The period of 20 years was a compromise, being an increase on the earlier one of five years. I believe that the Home Secretary at the time had originally proposed 25 years.
<P>
If I understand what is being proposed, it is an open-ended commitment that people who re-register each year will continue to be able to vote. A grandfather clause, under amendment No. 34, will cover those on the register when the measure comes into force. A further provision will allow people five years from taking up residence outside the United Kingdom to declare themselves United Kingdom electors and continue to register annually. I should be happy with that alternative to the rather stark provisions of clause 130, reducing the voting period from 20 years to 10 years. I shall be interested in the Minister's comments, and I support the excellent amendment and new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Like my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, I spent several years abroad—not in a European capital, but on the tiny island of Malta. I spent nine years there. My late father was a civil servant linked to the Ministry of Defence and of course we mixed closely with the expatriate community. I suspect that my experience was more militarily oriented than was my hon. Friend's time in Helsinki, but—and perhaps this was a feature of Malta's strong links with the United Kingdom, particularly in the immediate post-war period—British people working on the island retained more than a cursory link with the United Kingdom. It was not just the occasional Christmas card to granny at home. The links were strong even at a time when it was extremely difficult to communicate with the United Kingdom.
<P>
Things have changed and it is now easy for people to stay in contact and retain strong links with this country. I accept the observation by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about the previous group of amendments, and the specific groups of people concerned. The amendment and new clauses broaden the scope and take into account the kinds of people to whom he and my hon. Friend the Minister referred in the previous debate. The principle involved should be considered. It would require the voter concerned to maintain a continual, deliberate link and to take action to maintain the right to vote. That might give us a route out of a complicated dilemma, with which the Government—and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, in the Home Affairs Committee—have struggled for a long time.
<P>
Wherever we draw a line, there will be losers on the wrong side of it. Whatever categories of persons we include, we shall end by excluding some. My hon. Friend and I want to ensure some seeming fairness in the principle, through basing the entitlement on a continued deliberate action by the voter.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston will perhaps not be surprised to learn that I find the amendment and new clauses extremely satisfactory. I share all the views expressed by him and the hon. Member for Battersea. The measures seem to provide a better framework than the existing one for identifying people who, despite living overseas, want to participate in this country's political life.
<P>
I am the first to accept that one could be critical of an arrangement whereby somebody who left the United Kingdom 18 years ago, but appears to have shown no interest in United Kingdom politics can suddenly decide to register. I agree that continuity is important and that demonstration by an individual that he has an abiding interest in what is going on in Britain is a good indicator of entitlement to vote. I pressed that issue in earlier debates and during consideration of the Representation of the People Bill, as many people who go abroad wish to maintain their links with this country.
<P>
The amendment and new clauses seek to identify what a person should do in order to maintain such a connection. If arrangements such as those proposed will solve or help to solve disputes about how long people should retain the vote, they are a sensible route forward that is not so much a compromise as an agreement that satisfies everybody. I have always been anxious that the proposed 10-year period will not be sufficient in many cases. The reality of modern life is that people go abroad to work for long periods with every intention of returning. People who are prepared to go to the trouble of fulfilling the requirements set out in the new clauses should be entitled to have their vote.
<P>
I do not want to take up more of the Committee's time. The amendment and new clauses are commendable, and I hope that the Minister will respond to them directly and comment on their possible knock-on effect on the period for which United Kingdom citizens who have moved abroad are given an overseas vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The intention of the proposals is sound and meets the residual arguments against the previous group of amendments. I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the comments that were made or them when he has further discussions, as he undertook to do. His response remains to be seen. If he feels that the proposed mechanism, which has a number of merits, is worth while, it will perhaps draw the teeth of the principle objection to amendment No. 110, which we discussed earlier.
<P>
I should like to make a more light-hearted remark. I hope that the voluntary re-registration mechanism is not used in the United Kingdom, as we could finish up with very small electorates in a number of constituencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I listened carefully to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. As I have said before, he is an influential and hard-working member of the Home Affairs Committee. We are considering a reduction of the qualifying period to 10 years in response to the Select Committee report. My hon. Friend suggested that he had aimed for one target in the report and had hit another. He has changed his mind in some respects, as he was concerned initially with the restriction of overseas funding. However, the Select Committee report showed that some thousands of people would be disfranchised. My hon. Friend told the Committee that he supported clause 130—I carefully noted his remarks. With your indulgence, Mrs. Michie, I draw the Committee's attention to the Amendment Paper. Amendment No. 129, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea—it was not selected—would omit clause 130. It is another example of a moving target. I know that my hon. Friend is to have further discussions with interested parties; Ministers, too, will have further discussions with interested parties and among themselves.
<P>
My hon. Friend described amendment No. 34 as a holding amendment. In a sense, it is another moving target; he was advised to table new clause 1—and new clause 2, which applies to peers—because it might do a better job. In deciding to implement the Bill's provisions over a 10-year period, the Government were not driven by a desire to exclude foreign donations. The Bill will do that in other ways. As the hon. Member for Hazel Grove told us, people go to Saudi Arabia for different reasons, and different considerations are at work, one of which is whether they should have a vote.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset described the defining of that period as using a blunt instrument, and said that after 25, 20, 10 or even five years people will be out of touch with the political system. The Government must at some point take the view that a line must be drawn to ensure that people who are out of touch with the system should no longer have the vote. The debate is about how long that time should be.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to the remark by the hon. Member for North Dorset about the provision being a blunt instrument. He said that whatever line we take, some will lose as a result, and that it might seem unfair. If we accept the new clauses, it is possible that people who have lived overseas for all their working lives could register annually for the right to vote—perhaps even after 40 years abroad. The Government believe that there should be a cut-off point; we believe that people should take a conscious decision on the matter.
<P>
In our debate on the previous amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea pointed out that those who made that choice in 1989 did so not knowing that it might all change. I said earlier that the provisions will not come into force until after the next general election, when a rolling register will be in operation. People returning to the UK will then be able to re-register perhaps after only six months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I intervene to qualify something that I said earlier. I welcomed the amendment and the new clauses, but I failed to notice the provisions of new clause 1(4), and I should be glad to hear the Minister's view. I have serious reservations about it, because the United Kingdom has always extended rights of dual nationality to everybody. To restrict the franchise, as suggested in subsection (4) would be a serious departure from normal practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to that problem, and I shall consider the matter closely. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea made it clear that he had in mind people with dual nationality, but subsection (4) seems to preclude those with dual nationality taking advantage of the provision. I shall consider the matter and write to hon. Members.
<P>
The Committee must remember that the question of deciding the right cut-off period has been before the House on many occasions. What is the right cut-off period? Should there be one, or should we have a more sophisticated device? The new clauses are a more sophisticated device under which people will ``use it or lose it''. People must show their intent by registering within a prescribed time and then continue to register annually. If they do not register, they will lose the vote. The argument is that those who make the effort want to keep in touch with the political system.
<P>
The contrary argument is clear: a cut-off should operate for people who choose to live abroad for a long time, perhaps for 20, 30 or 40 years. That is the Government's view. I have listened to the debate. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove recognises that my commitment to discuss the previous group of amendments with ministerial colleagues in the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office cannot be taken in isolation from amendment No. 34 and the new clauses. He was not enamoured with my response to the previous group of amendments, but this debate will inform our thinking.
<P>
I am less inclined now to have any sympathy for amendment No. 34 and the new clauses than I was in respect of the previous group. Nevertheless, I shall ensure that the Committee's views are taken into account during those discussions, but a balance must be sought on the question of how long people living abroad should maintain their involvement with the British system. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea has strong views on the matter. It will be possible to return to it at a later stage, but I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The notion that one must draw the line somewhere always appeals to Ministers. In many cases one must, but a different approach can sometimes be better. Through the amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and I sought to satisfy the concerns of the Home Affairs Committee and of the overseas voter—concerns that I share.
<P>
I make no bones about the fact that new clause 1 would replace clause 130. The clause is a compromise between the current provision of 20 years and the Home Affairs Committee's suggestion of five years. New clause 1 is better than a compromise. It creates a new approach, much closer to satisfying the five-year qualifying period suggested by the Home Affairs Committee, for the one third of 1 per cent. of people who should be eligible to register because no one can doubt their strong link with Britain.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister knows that I would prefer to have made a change to clause 48, the tax exile clause, so that people can give funds to British political parties only if they are registered to vote in the United Kingdom and resident here. This discussion is necessary because I was unable to persuade my hon. Friend the Minister to accept that amendment.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The mischief that I am trying to remedy is that people who live abroad because they are tax exiles or have left the UK for no other reason than to escape their obligations should not be able to influence elections by funding political parties. If we had been successful in achieving that, no one would have pressed the measure, and the main reason for pursuing the alternative approach—the Home Secretary was clear that it is an alternative approach—of reducing the qualifying period for overseas voters, would have disappeared, although there would still have been arguments about it.
<P>
I favour the clause 48 approach, but given that the word ``resident'' will not be included in clause 48, we must find a way of dealing with the qualifying period for overseas voters that satisfies both our desire to prevent people who have little connection with the UK or who are tax exiles from funding British politics and the need to ensure that people who have a genuine link with this country may exercise their right to vote. New clause 1 would achieve that. I do not claim credit for devising the new clause, and neither does my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, but we both recognise that it comes close to squaring the circle.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister said that if people go to live abroad, that is their choice. That has a note of finality and a ring of decisiveness to it, but life is often more complicated than that. We have heard that the father of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was a Ministry of Defence official in Malta. I do not know what age he was when he lived there, but one can imagine all sorts of circumstances in which people find themselves living abroad. My father was chaplain to the British embassy in Helsinki—not that I was of voting age at the time. I do not think that he qualified for a vote because he was not actually employed by the British embassy and he was not a foreign servant. Although he was, effectively, chaplain to the entire expatriate community, that did not entitle him to vote—neither would it under the Bill. Even the few hon. Members who are here know of circumstances in which people have worked abroad, not by choice or because they do not have a connection with the UK, but for reasons that are too unpredictable and complicated to codify in law. None the less, such reasons should be taken into account.
<P>
Other hon. Members have connections with Switzerland and France and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred to dual nationals. It is my experience that when one speaks to a group of 10 or 15 British people whom one believes to be British through and through it is common to find that several of them have lived abroad or have relations who live abroad—people who have strong continuing connections with this country, which they want to preserve.
<P>
I do not deny that the amendment is not perfect. I can imagine circumstances in which it could be used by tax exiles or people who feel no connection with the UK to get around the law and provide a conduit for overseas funding, although that is unlikely. Such people would need to be very determined to re-register every year and find a proxy voter in this country to vote on their behalf. It is very unlikely that people would do that unless they were motivated by a desire to keep their link with their mother country alive and were concerned primarily with their right to vote rather than the opportunity to fund political parties. I am happy to pursue the amendment because it comes as close as anything will to satisfying both sides of the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It is perhaps my fault for not picking it up earlier, but I raised a question about the declaration that one is not a citizen of any country other than the United Kingdom. I think that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but the truth is that people often acquire dual nationality by birth rather than by choice. It is possible for someone to be a dual national of, for example, Britain and Spain, but to work in the United States, have no connection with Spain and wish to maintain a connection with Britain. Such a person would be disfranchised by new clause 1. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would like to reconsider the final paragraph, which is the most difficult and contentious part of what is otherwise a sensible proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I confess that I do not fully understand the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman describes. If the principle for European and local elections is that one has the right to cast one's vote anywhere in Europe where one happens to live, and if the principle for national elections is that voting follows from nationality, we should not enable people to cast two votes in national elections, one in each country for which they hold a passport, any more than people should be able to vote twice in European elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not like it, but it happens all the time. My late mother regularly cast votes both in United Kingdom elections and in French presidential elections when she felt motivated to do so. That rule has always been accepted in this country and has never been considered a problem. I should add that I have never cast a vote in a foreign election, as I am only a British national.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> We must agree to differ on that. My late mother, although a dual national, did not exercise the right to vote in two countries at the same time. It was probably her feeling that one should plump for one or the other.
<P>
I understand my hon. Friend the Minister's reservations; he said that he would reflect further, and I hope that the force of argument will persuade him in due course, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> As we have not yet succeeded in persuading the Minister to amend the Bill, I feel justified in rising to urge the Committee to vote against the clause because it will restrict the voting rights of British nationals overseas and, by implication, restrict their ability to make donations to British political parties.
<P>
The argument for a qualifying period of 20, 10, 25 or five years is subjective. I am intrigued that the evidence given to the Select Committee on Home Affairs by the Labour party suggested:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is clear that the present rules—with so few persons actually registering—cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and, for the Labour Party, Mr. Gardner indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue . . . The Home Office reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for the twenty year period to be lowered but from people who had been resident overseas for more than twenty years arguing for it to be increased.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That returns me to the original arguments of the then Home Secretary, now Lord Hurd of Westwell, who initially set a 25-year limit, which was amended to 20 years. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Bill proposes a limit of 25 years, which would enfranchise citizens working on longer-term contracts abroad who intend, as many do, to retire to the United Kingdom. The Bill will include, by and large, citizens who, encouraged by successive Governments, have gone abroad to work for international and world development organisations, to advance British economic interests as private business men or to pursue careers in European Community institutions. It will recognise the rights of thousands of British citizens across the globe who, through modern communications, cheaper air fares and a genuine affection for their country, maintain strong links with the United Kingdom. Many of them have family and friends, property, children at school and are often liable for the payment of taxes here. They may be business men, journalists, teachers or officials, voluntary workers, missionaries or church workers.''—[Official Report, 29 June 1989; Vol. 155, c. 1142.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I propose the same cause for maintaining the 20-year provision in the Representation of the People Act 1985. I was encouraged by some of the amendments, and by the Minister's suggestion that he might feel inclined to consider them. I sensed that he was not completely convinced by the arguments in favour of creating an alternative system to cover people who work outside the United Kingdom for international institutions, for British companies or in the voluntary sector, or who live and maintain a home overseas for other reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Neither my colleagues nor I are convinced, but we understand that issues are raised, such as those read by the hon. Gentleman into the record. I wish to be fair to the Committee, and do not want to give the impression, which is sometimes given, that an undertaking to consider a matter guarantees that an amendment will be tabled. I want the Committee to know that there will be further discussions—there is an open mind on the subject—but there is no guarantee that the Government will table their own amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for clarifying that there is no guarantee; that is why I should continue my comments, in support of which I quoted at length the then Home Secretary, Lord Hurd, and the Labour party's evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee.
<P>
Those who leave the United Kingdom for up to 20 years maintain links with this country. We were intrigued by other hon. Member's amendments, but I am cognisant of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has not guaranteed to return on Report with an amendment to incorporate either the ideas expressed or our opposition to changing the 20-year rule back to 10 years. The Committee should consider seriously not allowing the clause to stand part.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I, too, rise to argue that the clause should not stand part. We have had an interesting discussion about alternatives, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Battersea and to others for proposing interesting amendments.
<P>
There has been a sense of a danger of which I was warned when I became a barrister. I was told that there is nothing worse than ad hominem legislation— legislation designed to deal with a specific matter or, worse still, to penalise an individual rather than to have regard to the general interest.
<P>
It is difficult to escape the conclusion, especially when listening to some of the arguments for the amendments and the contortions that have resulted, that the hon. Member for Battersea has had a bee in his bonnet about funding by overseas donors who might be tax exiles—as if there was a connection between that and the right to vote—and the possible status of the treasurer of the Conservative party, who appears to be another target on which he has set his sights. The question of whether amendments would enable the treasurer to slip through the net has crept into his comments. That is a bad approach to legislation.
<P>
There is an underlying curiosity. We should leave aside the amendments and concentrate on the simple change that clause 130 will introduce. The period for overseas voters will be reduced from 20 years to 10 years. No one, during the debate on the clause and amendments, has come up with a good reason for doing that. It has been accepted that the number of people who register is so small that there can be no anxiety that overseas voters might massively distort the UK electorate. It has been accepted that people who register probably have an abiding interest in political activity here and probably intend to return.
<P>
No valid reason has been given why a period of 20 years is inferior to one of 10 years, which is what will be introduced. The period in the 1970s was five years, which everybody thought was too short. It has been generally acknowledged that people nowadays go overseas for longer, with more valid reasons, intending to return. We live in a more global society, and jobs and other factors are likely to take people away from a country, but they will still want to return.
<P>
Despite that, we are tinkering with the 20-year rule. I am forced to conclude that the reasons behind the tinkering to reduce the period to 10 years are based on the narrow and partisan viewpoint of several hon. Members. We are creating ad hominem legislation. Perhaps the amendment should go down in history as the Ashcroft amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Under such provocation, I feel obliged to make a short point. Neither the issue of overseas voters nor Michael Ashcroft has ever been the bee in my bonnet—overseas funding has been. Whether the hon. Member for Beaconsfield likes it or not—indeed, he may not even remember it because his active involvement in politics dates from April 1997—there was a long period in which overseas millionaires, many of whom were not British, gave huge sums of money to the Conservative party. That compromised the integrity of British foreign policy and the Government machine. C. K. Ma gave money at the same time as he lobbied on behalf of his father—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I have to admit that I was trying to wind up the hon. Gentleman. There are wider issues, but I am not challenging the principle that funding should be provided by registered voters. We got into convolutions by debating the status of a person who had been registered for the previous five years, but I take no exception to the fact that funders should be registered voters. The hon. Gentleman accepts that overseas voters will continue to be able fund parties if they are UK nationals on the register, even when they are out of the country for 10 years. I am comfortable with that.
<P>
If a person has a continuing interest, it is incidental that he or she lives abroad and benefits from a better tax regime. The hon. Gentleman gets hot under the collar about that, but I cannot get excited. It is a fundamental difference of opinion. What concerns me is disfranchising someone for no good reason, which I would regret. The 20-year period is fair. It accurately reflects a substantial period that a person might spend working abroad, but it is also a good cut-off point if he decides to live abroad for most of his life.
<P>
I cannot support the clause because 20 years is better than 10. No argument has persuaded me that it is not. We discussed alternative approaches. The hon. Member for Battersea suggested continuous registration, which has much to commend it. I have grave reservations about dual nationality because we have never discriminated against that. Indeed, people can be triple or quadruple nationals without altering or influencing the way in which allegiance is owed. I strongly believe that we should never discriminate in that way. We are sticking to the narrow approach of reducing the period from 20 years to 10 and, as a conservative with a small ``c'', I need to be persuaded that a compelling benefit will flow from it. That has not happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Yes, well, there we go. In the case of the hon. Gentleman, it is not so much the Ashcroft amendment as the Marie Antoinette amendment—learnt nothing, forgotten nothing. Legislation corrects abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Member for Battersea described a number of categories of individuals who had provided funds. I do not know about their eligibility, but I suspect that some were not British nationals. I am happy to get rid of such funding. The Bill does that, but it is not necessary to tinker with overseas voters' rights by changing the number of years in which they can vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Okay, that is a point of view. However, from the beginning, the 20-year rule was intended to have a particular effect. It is an accident that it did not. Had the then Home Secretary's predictions been fulfilled, it would have constituted a major abuse of the British democratic system. As it turned out, overseas voters are even more apathetic than UK voters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman take that further and suggest that the Home Secretary wanted to use the overseas vote to legitimise overseas fundraising, which was precisely what Conservative central office proceeded to do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Absolutely. As I understand it, significant efforts were made in southern Spain to round up potential Conservative supporters to persuade them to sign up to the register and make financial donations. When a provision is in legislation, there is nothing improper with a political party setting out to use it, but the hon. Member for Beaconsfield can hardly use its failure as an excuse for not altering the legislation so that it does not succeed in future. On that logic, the bank robbery failed, so we do not make bank robbery illegal because it does not happen often. It is not a good argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> We have altered the legislation. The Bill prohibits foreign nationals who live overseas from making donations to UK parties. That is a clear principle—it commands widespread acceptance—but that is not what we are discussing. The clause restricts the time in which overseas British nationals can vote to 10 years. Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> There is an argument for reducing the period to five years. I would be content with that. I would be more content if it were five years with a rolling extension. That would allow people who were genuinely interested in politics to register.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he is content with five years and a rolling registration. The person on the rolling registration could as easily be a donor as someone who qualified under the 20-year rule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> That is a risk we have to take. There are two fundamental choices: either no one overseas can register and make a donation, or some people can register and make a donation. People's qualifications, skills or work must be taken into account. Cases were made in previous debates for granting relief to some categories of people, but we are discussing the ceiling that provides a long stop, a safety net or fire curtain to prevent the situation from getting out of control. The provisions are sensible.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield did not mention the largest group by far that was expected to register but did not. It did not comprise people who worked for international institutions, such as ICI or British Aerospace in Saudi Arabia, but people who had retired from Britain and who had every intention of staying overseas. Those people, who might have been absent for 15, 20 or 30 years, would be excluded unless they took part in a re-registration process from the moment they went overseas—or five years from when they went overseas, had new clause 1 been accepted.
<P>
The issue is settled because the Government will not drop the clause, but it is right and proper to express my view that as 20 years was originally intended to be a loophole, the Bill should close it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 83, line 14, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, save with the consent of the Scottish Parliament'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 The amendment brings me back to a traditional matter of discussion. I will not take up much of the Committee's time, as we discussed the matter yesterday and the Minister's response was helpful, but it is another matter on which it might be of use for the Scottish Parliament to be able to opt in if it wants. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the commission to have the general function of monitoring compliance with this part of the Bill if the Scottish Parliament wants it to. It would not affect the Scottish Parliament's autonomy but, as we discussed yesterday, the Scottish Parliament and the Executive may consider that opting in and making use of all the Bill, rather than just certain parts of it, would be of value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I have no objection to the spirit of this rather neat amendment, which turns one of the subsections round. unfortunately, it does not quite do the job that the hon. Gentleman wants it to do, because these matters are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. It would not be appropriate for the Scottish Parliament to make a request about a reserved matter. Thus, in that sense, the amendment does not do what is required. The Scottish Executive are actively considering the matter and I suspect that an enabling vehicle of the kind proposed will be needed. Amendments that serve that purpose will be tabled at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not have a bevy of officials at my disposal to help me to draft amendments, thus my proposals are always slightly unguided missiles, but I hope that they flag up important matters as we go along. I am grateful to the Minister and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 131 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 132</center></H4>
<H4><center>Supervisory powers of Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 83, line 33, after `may', insert `by notice'.
<P>
The clause relates to the commission's supervisory powers. I was slightly perturbed that subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person authorised in writing by the Commission may, for the purposes of the carrying out by the Commission of their functions, enter at any reasonable time premises occupied by a supervised organisation or individual and having entered any such premises may—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>inspect any books'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
look at the computer, or do whatever that person wants to do to inspect the documents and electronic matter held by the organisation or individual. That seems a rather draconian power, similar to the power that Customs and Excise might have in investigating VAT fraud, for example. The matters to which the clause relates are not of the same magnitude; it relates to large and small political parties, to small third parties, to permitted participants in a referendum campaign and, in terms of the supervisory role, to individuals. For the commission just to turn up on someone's doorstep, bang on the door and say, ``We're coming in, because this is a reasonable time to come and look through the books,'' is a draconian power and I am not sure that such a power should be vested in the commission.
<P>
Although it is reasonable that officers of the commission should be able to inspect the books, documents, records and computer files at a reasonable time it is reasonable, too, that the commission should give notice that it wishes to carry out an inspection. Its officers should not simply turn up at the home address of an individual at a time when it may be inconvenient or when he may have other pressing business which, a court might say, is a reasonable prior engagement. If the commission felt that the individual was concealing information, it would have redress elsewhere in the Bill if that concealment took place after the notice had been given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The amendment raises an interesting issue about what the powers of the commission are designed or intended to be. It does not have policemen's powers; it does not have a right of entry and it does not have to get a warrant in order to enter premises. Therefore I should expect its officers' arrival at premises usually to be on notice, which is the reason for the amendment. There may be arguments that that need not be so. Under health and safety legislation, inspectors have powers to enter, but in practice I have never known any to do so other than on notice. They usually ring up and say, ``I am coming round to pick up documents,'' or they write asking ``Could you please supply me with the following documents?'' To take another analogy, should the relevant powers be different from those of the Inland Revenue, which usually succeeds in getting information by repeated written requests—certainly not by going round with a snatch squad to lay hands on books and documents?
<P>
How, in practice, does the Minister envisage the arrangement will work? Any right to enter premises is potentially a breach of civil liberties. We need to examine the matter critically before we decide how best to give the relevant powers. The Bill makes it clear that powers akin to those of the police are not intended. How are the powers derived, and on what precedents has the Minister relied in drafting the provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I want to reassure the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that the commission is intended to have a positive image and will normally visit premises by invitation or agreement. We are keen to raise standards and ensure that the benefits of the commission's work are available to everyone and that everyone accepts them. I was struck by the phrase used by the hon. Member for North Dorset about being frightened of people banging on the door at any time. As he acknowledged, clause 132 makes it clear that any visit under the relevant powers should take place ``at any reasonable time''. The knock on the door at the stroke of midnight will not happen. I do not think that the commission will be keen to be seen in a similar light to Customs and Excise.
<P>
I think that Committee members acknowledge that the commission should have powers to tackle avoidance and evasion. Potentially—I shall put it no more strongly than that—for some organisations, in extreme circumstances, to conceal and destroy documents. That is the reason for the provision, which I do not believe will be misused or used often, for the commission to arrive unannounced.
<P>
There are precedents for such a power. The Gaming Board for Great Britain visits casinos regularly, unannounced. I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman about the role, purpose and practice of the commission, but it must have the power to arrive unannounced if avoidance and evasion are genuinely thought to be happening and it is thought that documents are being concealed or destroyed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am a little reassured by the Minister's comments. I had not thought of the comparison with the gaming board. I am unhappy, but I am willing to accept the Minister's reassurance and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 86, line 10, after `he', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`knowingly'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with another perennial topic of the Committee. The question is whether we should insert the word ``knowingly'' into the clause. This occasion may be slightly different from previous ones. For once, the word ``knowingly'' may be the correct one to insert. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person commits an offence if he—
<P>
(a) alters, suppresses, conceals or destroys, or
<P>
(b) causes or permits the alteration, suppression, concealment or destruction of, any document or other record relating to the financial affairs or transactions''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of a relevant organisation or individual. It is possible to destroy a document unknowingly. The clause provides a reasonable excuse defence for failure to supply a document, but there is no defence for a person who innocently destroys or alters a document. I accept that suppressing a document appears to require active mens rea, but destruction of a document can be done innocently. The clause needs to be re-examined, to ascertain whether the offences under clause 134(1) should remain absolute offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thoroughly support my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. The amendment is essential. These days, with so much documentation held in electronic form, it is sometimes difficult for me to find my own files, which I have not knowingly concealed. To make it an offence for a person who might not be as computer literate as some others to have unknowingly concealed a document when he might simply have forgotten how to find it, is to tread on dangerous ground. The clause should include the word ``knowingly''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am delighted that at least one other member of the Committee admits to problems with new technology. I confess that in a few minutes I shall go and sharpen my quill pen.
<P>
<B>Ms Candy Atherton </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): How sad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It may be sad, but it is good fun. One can let a lot of frustration out while sharpening a quill pen.
<P>
I am grateful for the continuing efforts by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield to provide defences under the Bill. I have already said that at the end of the Committee's proceedings—sooner rather than later, I hope—I shall have several meetings with officials to consider the whole Bill and to ensure that consistent and comprehensive defences are included in it. However, I am not at all sure that the amendment would improve the Bill, which already includes a defence. I draw the Committee's attention to the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the intention of falsifying the document or record or enabling that organisation or individual to evade any of the provisions of this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those actions require conscious effort. Intention, which presumes knowledge, would have to be proved. I am fairly confident that the amendment is unnecessary and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. I do not believe that the Bill needs to be changed, but during our comprehensive review of defence clauses, we will reconsider the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I think he is right. I fear that my antennae have become so sensitive to any clause that creates an absolute offence that I have started to leap before looking. I accept that the intention of falsifying in order to evade properly encompasses those activities targeted by criminalising the acts in paragraphs (a) and (b). The word ``knowingly'' would not defeat the object of the exercise, but it might be, as lawyers say, otiose, and I am a great believer in trying to keep the wording of statutes simple. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Inspection of Commission's registers etc.</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> The Minister may not be surprised that I rise to speak on the question of public access to the register. In introducing transparency into our political affairs, it is key to the legislation that, at all stages, the registers and other documents held by the commission should be available for public inspection. Therefore, I want to seek more guidance and information from the Minister on the details of how the commission will make registers available.
<P>
Clause 135(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission shall make a copy of the register available for public inspection during ordinary office hours, either at the Commission's offices or at some convenient place appointed by them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am interested to know what is envisaged by the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``some convenient place appointed by them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission may make other arrangements for members of the public to have access to the contents of the register''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If requested to do so by any person, the Commission shall supply him with a copy of the register or any part of it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause goes on to state that the commission may charge such reasonable fee as it may determine.
<P>
My concern is that the commission should be seen to be making the documents to members of the public available in the easiest and most accessible way. Although there have been indications that it will have offices in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast, as well as in London, I want to know whether the commission will think it necessary to make hard copies of the register available in major reference libraries, for example, or in other places such as the Library of the House of Commons. I am also minded to ask whether the contents of the register will be available to members of the public in public libraries, by e-mail or over the internet, if the commission has a website containing the register of various political parties.
<P>
If the registers can be inspected, does the Minister envisage the protection of names on the register as cited during discussions on access to the electoral register in the Representation of the People Bill? The names of donors to political patties might be useful to commercial or charitable organisations looking for people who might have a little money to spare. If the lists were freely available on the internet, it might lead to abuse.
<P>
I seek the Minister's clarification of the points that I have made on the method of inspection and the use to which the information acquired can be put.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises important matters, some of which will be dealt with by the commission when it is set up. I reassure him, first, that the commission will have offices throughout the United Kingdom, in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast, which will make documents more readily available. It will make hard copies available and circulate them, for a fee. It is highly probably that hard copies will be available through its officers, but that is a matter for the commission. It is also probable—again, it is a matter for the commission—that the material will be available on the internet. The commission picks up the work of the registrar of political parties, based at Companies house; that material is already available on the internet. I confess to having difficulties in that respect but I understand that it is a growing technology.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked how we can safeguard the information available. The name of the donor, the amount and the date on which the sum was given go on the register. In the interests of confidentiality, the addresses will not be on the register. Those with unusual names who wish to make donations may be identifiable, but it is unlikely that there will be invasion of privacy provided that just date, name and amount are on the list. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
