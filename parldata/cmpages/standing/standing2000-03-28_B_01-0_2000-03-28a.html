<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am pleased that you, Mr. Stevenson, will be chairing our deliberations; you will be ably assisted by your co-Chairman, Mr. Malins. I know that many members of the Committee participated on Second Reading, which was a rather good debate. It was thoughtful and constructive, which I hope bodes well for our deliberations during the forthcoming weeks.
<P>
The sittings motion sets the times and days for our discussion, and I hope that the Committee will agree with those arrangements. They are clearly demanding of our time, but they will provide us with the opportunity to give this significant Bill a proper and detailed scrutiny. I hope that they are acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I echo the first remark of Minister for the Environment; the Opposition, too, welcome the prospect of serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson, and under that of your co-Chairman, Mr. Malins.
<P>
I am happy to assure the Minister and the Committee that the Opposition will seek to make constructive improvements to the Bill. On Second Reading, which the Minister described as a constructive and thoughtful debate, he said that this portmanteau Bill brings together various policy areas that could do with being improved. That was an honest and straightforward admission, and we shall seek to help the Minister achieve that aim.
<P>
I was slightly bemused to read in one of this morning's newspapers that the act of seeking to amend a Bill in Committee is tantamount to trying to wreck it. I assure the Committee that that could not be further from the truth. Parliamentary democracy demands that the Committee should consider Bills in a detailed and careful manner, and that the Opposition should seek to table amendments to improve them. Our amendments are designed either to improve the Bill or to probe the various uncertainties that the Minister accepts still remain.
<P>
I am sure that Labour Members will admit that the committee needs to address some genuine concerns. The Minister will have read in The Times that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The right-to-roam element of the Bill bears all the hallmarks of what it is—an ill-conceived afterthought to sensible conservation legislation, devised as a sop to the disgruntled Labour heartlands. The decision to offer no compensation may also breach the European Convention on Human Rights.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This flawed Bill adds weight to the charge that Labour is indifferent to rural affairs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister, I know, will dispute that—at length, given the chance. However, it is a legitimate concern; many detailed elements of the Bill will emphasise the problems identified by The Times.
<P>
We all know that walking—it seems sensible to deal with part I first—is Britain's most popular leisure activity. The Countryside Agency found that 1.3 billion visits were made to the English countryside in 1996. For many decades, there has been discussion about whether a voluntary or statutory approach is the most appropriate way of improving access to the countryside. The Government have decided that the statutory approach is best. We can argue with that decision, but the time for such argument is past. We accept that the Bill has received its Second Reading and that the provisions must now be made as appropriate as possible for the country's needs, for people who walk in the countryside and enjoy it and for people who want to preserve and enhance our wildlife heritage.
<P>
As ever, it is instructive to read the excellent Library background notes to the Bill and to consider the international comparisons to which they refer. It stands out starkly that access to the countryside is preserved in different ways in each of the European countries. Each country has a different approach as each has its own traditions, but more basic factors also apply, as each country has its own land mass and open space. Therefore, an approach that is appropriate for Germany will not be appropriate for the Netherlands. We must learn a lesson from that and use the Committee to develop a system that is completely appropriate for Britain.
<P>
The Minister will know that many issues will arise during discussion of the first couple of clauses and schedules, which are at the heart of the access provisions and which deserve detailed analysis. For instance, power to extend the right of access to coastal land by order is slipped into the provisions. As the Minister knows, many people are worried about putting such power into ministerial hands. The provisions also give the Countryside Agency the job of mapping all registered common land and open country. That is a major task, whose practicalities also deserve detailed exploration.
<P>
Other important issues will be considered in relation to enforcement and protection on access land. The Bill allows district councils to appoint wardens, but contains no detailed or specific provisions about the cost and practicalities involved. It allows landowners to exclude or restrict access for any reason for up to 28 days a year without permission. The Minister will be aware that that period is already the subject of energetic and lively debate. He said that landowners or tenants can seek further exclusion for land management reasons, but the Bill goes no further than that and the Committee should explore what is meant by the land management reasons to which it refers. The Countryside Agency or the Countryside Council for Wales will be able to approve the exclusions and restrictions; similarly, it is worth exploring how permanent such measures can or should be. The Minister will know about the debate on whether provisions for restrictions on dogs on access land will be adequate for the protection of farm livestock and of nesting birds and other wildlife.
<P>
The Countryside Council for Wales makes an important point, which we will need to explore in Committee, about whether the Bill's aspirations run ahead of its practical proposals. Its particular concern is the amount of money made available to implement the Bill's provisions. The Council welcomes the Bill in principle, but it has been allocated only £100,000 to take forward its proposals having bid for £2 million. It says that it will be able to take forward the work in only one or two demonstration areas. I arm sure that the Minister will agree that, if that applies in England and the resources are not made available either to the nationwide countryside agencies or to local authorities to implement the Bill properly, it will be a disappointment, particularly to its strongest supporters.
<P>
There are other areas of concern in part 1, not least the problem of level playing fields; some who offend against the Bill will be criminalised, while others will not. It will be interesting to explore the thinking behind that part of the Bill. There is also deep concern over liability for injury caused by natural or non-natural features of the landscape. Only natural features are covered. All will be aware that features ranging from iron age forts to simple barbed wire can cause injury or accident. Landowners reasonably feel that such features should be included in the same provisions as natural features. Drystone walls are perhaps the starkest example. The Countryside Agency estimated that in 1994 25 per cent. of drytone walls were derelict and, given the nature of drystone walls, they could be dangerous. If they are not included because they are not natural features, there will be some unfairness in the allocation of liability for any injury caused by them.
<P>
I appreciate the Minister saying on Second Reading that part II on rights of way could be improved I acknowledge that this is a difficult area; finding the right balance between the various interests, especially given the historical build up of the various rights of way in this country, will not be easy. It is noteworthy that we have spent half a century attempting to provide a sensible, coherent and fully mapped out rights of way network, but so far only modest progress has been made. Only 29 per cent. Of local authorities—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful to the hon. Member for mapping out his approach to the Bill, but I should be grateful if he would return to the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was saying that the Bill will require detailed consideration, and, partly to help the Minister, I was trying to set out the particular concerns that will need to be addressed, some of which the Minister will be aware of. Outlining some of these areas is relevant to the sittings motion.
<P>
The Countryside Agency has said that there are few, if any, statutory duties which local government carries out so poorly as enforcing rights of way. The Countryside Agency makes the point that that is not the fault of local authorities, rather the resources are not available. We shall need to spend time changing that aspect of the Bill, which the Ramblers Association describes as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>completely lacking in any bold and imaginative proposals which will genuinely improve public rights of way for all concerned.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that the Committee is not divided on the desire to have a more coherent and sensible rights of way network. We have a once in a generation opportunity to achieve that. It would be unfortunate if we concluded our business without producing a clear map of how we might achieve a better rights of way network that balances the interests of walkers, riders, cyclists and other groups, such as carriage drivers, who are bombarding me and, no doubt, the Minister with letters.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The final and substantive part of the Bill covers wildlife protection. We have been saying for months that we are delighted that the Government want to update the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Indeed, we would prefer the Bill to deal purely with wildlife protection because that would be a more coherent approach. We intend to explore and improve several aspects of the Bill, especially as it affects land outside sites of special scientific interest. The Minister said that he will review planning policy guidance note 9 which will improve natural protection outside the SSSI network. So that we can have a more informed discussion on part III, it would help us to know when that will be complete and how much of it will be made public. The Minister will be aware that the Wildlife Trusts has urged the acceptance of three measures—greater recognition of important wildlife-rich areas outside SSSIs, improved protection of rare species wherever they occur and legal underpinning of the biodiversity action plan process. We could usefully discuss those in depth, but not, I hope, at inordinate length.
<P>
I wish that the Government had not confused the issues of access and wildlife protection in one Bill, but there are many matters to discuss. A peculiar article in The Guardian this morning quotes me as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We want to make the bill practicable. We accept that the government will get the bill through We want to get rid of the worst wrinkles.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will be the purpose and cause of our approach.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I, too, welcome you and, in due course, your colleague to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. I know that it will be a pleasure to have you in control because I have served under you before. We look forward to this being an excellent Committee. The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) made an extensive speech that was better than the one made by his hon. Friend the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman) on Second Reading.
<P>
We are concentrating on the sittings motion. The Minister is right to say that the Bill is extensive. We have a tough programme to consider, and I hope that we will give equal weight to all three parts. It would be wrong to concentrate on the right to roam—I am not sure that what is encapsulated in the Bill fits that description—because that is headline catching, and ignore rights of way and environmental protection, which are equally important. This is a portmanteau Bill. It covers a wide range of interests. We shall want to examine its contents closely and try to improve it by introducing new proposals.
<P>
I also read the article in The Guardian this morning, and was surprised at the views expressed. I have no idea whether Conservative Members wish to wreck the Bill—I hope that they do not; their spokesman clearly asserted this morning that they did not. I assert without equivocation that there will be many amendments; some of us will table amendments because we seek to improve the Bill. I have already tabled many amendments with one intent—to make the presence of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) redundant. He will forgive my saying that, because I seek to disapply the Bill to Wales—the matter should be part of the devolved responsibilities of the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>
As the Minister knows, we addressed the serious matters of definition in, part I on Second Reading. Some of us will be seeking to avoid dispute. If we are unclear about the legal position—the terms and the practicalities—and give doubt to those who wish to use access land and to those who own or control it, we shall open the doors to much unhappiness and, possibly, to litigation. We shall need to spend much time on the issue.
<P>
An incomplete job has been done on, part II, which deals with rights of way. The Minister hinted on Second Reading that the Government recognised that there might still be work to be done on the part. I make a plea to the Minister: if he is to produce a swathe of Government amendments, let us have them in good time so that we might do them justice in Committee. Let us not have them at the end of the Committee to consider or, worse, have them foisted on us on Report when they will get less serious consideration than we can give them here.
<P>
With regard to part III, some of us shall seek to strengthen the treatment of many aspects of environmental protection. It will be difficult in Committee to address properly the matter of resources, which will arise repeatedly in the consideration of amendments. I should say in the gentlest terms that I still await a reply from the Minister to a letter sent by me and a colleague on 1 March. A reply might have answered questions that must otherwise be asked in Committee. I shall continue to press the Minister on that.
<P>
The common thread running through the Bill, and the key to our consideration, is the balancing of competing pressures on precious countryside, so that we might increase access in a way that recognises the correlation between use and sustainability. If we can do that and improve environmental protection, the Committee will have done a good job and the Bill will be in fine shape to go for further consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): It is unusual for two members of the Opposition Front Bench to speak. However, for transparency I should, first, put on the record an interest that need not be declared but which it is important that I state. I am a member of the Game Conservancy, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and of the National Farmers Union, all of which obviously have interests in the Bill. Secondly, I wish also to make it clear that I have no interest in land that is, or could be, the subject of part I. We need to start the Committee with transparency and sincerity, and I endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) because we believe that the Bill raises many issues. We have no desire to prevaricate, delay or wreck the Bill—wrecking amendments are a pointless exercise, which serve only to delay proceedings because the Government get their way in the end. I have no intention of rehearsing the arguments that were made on Second Reading, but the Minister and Under-Secretary will know that many points of concern were raised in that debate, not all of which were answered. Therefore, many of our amendments will be designed to extract clearer answers about the import of certain parts of the Bill.
<P>
I make no apology for the fact that some amendments will show that our primary purpose is to improve the Bill's conservation aspects, including part I. Several outside bodies have already said that they are concerned about an apparent conflict between part I and the tightening up of measures relating to sites of special scientific interest. Other amendments will defend the interests of land users, where they have not been fully considered. The most important point—something that I feel strongly about—is that the legislation must be workable; it must have sufficient clarity to enable the ordinary person to understand it, and it must be enforceable. Many of our amendments will try to make the Bill clearer and more informative.
<P>
The Government said repeatedly that they have tried to strike a balance. On Second Reading, the Minister was emollient and tried to explain how the Government had reached certain decisions, many of which need to be probed. The Minister's response will show the sincerity of the attempt to strike a balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Following my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), I also declare an interest as a trustee of the Game Conservancy. Like my hon. Friend, I have no declarable interest in any land that could come within the ambit of the Bill. However, I agree with the Minister that we had a good debate on Second Reading. Considering that the Bill is in some ways contentious—although in other ways it is not—the general spirit that flowed through that debate was conducive to achieving a good, sensible and, above all, workable and practical Bill. Therefore, I was astonished to read the article in The Guardian this morning, although rather less astonished when I saw the provenance of the remarks, which made the ignorance understandable.
<P>
We shall table many amendments to the Bill because, although the Government will not feel the need or inclination to alter it in principle, I am sure that the Minister will agree that some details need to be tidied up and there is scope for improvement. Any amendments tabled by myself or by my right hon. and hon. Friends will be purely to that end. I very much look forward to serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I add my words of welcome to you, Mr. Stevenson, and to your co-Chairman. I withdraw unreservedly all the things that I said to you during the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, on which we had the honour of serving together. I look forward to being recognised by you on as many occasions as possible.
<P>
I want to declare several interests, none of which are directly relevant to the Bill. I am not a landowner of any sort, although I own a flat in London. However, there will be no right to roam through that, as far as I understand. I am a member of the National Farmers Union, the Countryside Alliance, the Country Landowners Association and the Royal Artillery Foxhounds, which hunt across Salisbury plain—which is, I think, exempt from the Bill, although one never knows what may happen.
<P>
Like my Front-Bench colleagues I was in essence pleased about the Bill and thought the principle behind it was a good one. All Opposition Members love the countryside and are keen to encourage as much access to it as possible and, among other aspects of the Bill, to improve nature conservation. Improving on the network of rights of way, byways open to all traffic and roads used as public paths—I come from an area criss-crossed with them—will benefit those who want to use them and the landowners who have the good fortune or misfortune to have them crossing their land.
<P>
After my initial enthusiasm, I was severely disappointed on reading the detail of the Bill. I therefore welcome the proposed four sittings a week, despite the fact that that will bring my weekly Committee sittings to 11. At an average of three hours a sitting I will have 33 hours in Committee before I do anything else, but we are rather short of Back Benchers on our side so I am delighted to have that opportunity. Some detailed aspects of the Bill are wrong. It is badly drafted in many ways, and it is important to give it due consideration.
<P>
The Minister said on Second Reading that he would be ready to listen to reason on many detailed aspects of the Bill. I hope that he will accept Opposition amendments, or the spirit in which they are drafted, and table Government amendments too. If the Bill reaches the statute book in its current, flawed form, neither the Government nor the Opposition will be able to take pride in it. It needs a lot of work to improve it.
<P>
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford in deeply resenting at least the headline in The Guardian this morning that suggested that tabling about 130 amendments was somehow an attempt to wreck the Bill. How can that claim be made by a newspaper that supported the Government in tabling more than 1,000 amendments to the Greater London Authority Bill and 600 or 700 amendments to the Transport Bill, on the Committee for which I am also serving?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I sense hon. Members' anxiety to start considering the amendments. I become worried when other Bills are discussed. I am sure that the hon. Member will want to assist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall certainly assist, but I thought it worth mentioning the number of amendments in passing.
<P>
I hope that we shall pay extensive and detailed attention to some of the particularly badly-drafted or ill-conceived aspects of the Bill. Business managers of both sides always aim for all due efficacy and speed in Committee and my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will be pleased that I intend to assist with that. None the less, the Bill is detailed and needs detailed consideration. Those hon. Members who live in and love the countryside will want to consider several aspects very carefully.
<P>
Part I deals with the right to roam—a term that I use advisedly, though the Government try to steer away from it. The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), who is no longer in his place, has tabled amendments to include in the right to roam not only on moor and open land, but grazing, grassland and other areas that we would consider farmland, and therefore exempt. There appears to be more ideological determination to go ahead with the right to roam than careful consideration of how to put it into practice.
<P>
I was disturbed by the language employed by the Minister on Second Reading, which clearly showed the purpose of the right to roam provisions. He said the purpose of the Bill was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>full rights of access to the beauties of our countryside to which we are all heir.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It finally brings to reality the dream of Lloyd George that nobody should be a trespasser in the land of their birth.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c.720.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He ignored the fact that that must refer to Wales. What he said shows the reality the Bill. It is nothing to do with improving sensible access to the countryside; according to the Minister, it is about returning the land to which we are all heirs to the people, who ought to be allowed to walk on it.
<P>
In that context, we should give full consideration to a number of detailed amendments. [Interruption.] Labour Members do not seem to like the notion, but, none the less, it is true. One of the most important aspects of the right-to-roam provisions must be access to SSSIs. It seems a curiously double-headed Bill. On the one hand, it tries to find ways to improve SSSIs, but on the other hand it could wreck them by allowing walkers and people with dogs access to them. The problem with dogs, as was pointed out by the NFU, is that we have not given due consideration to the lambing season, and there is no cash to allow for an effective warden system. If such access is allowed, that is necessary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am becoming increasingly concerned. A list of amendments seek to redefine or alter the definition of access. All hon. Members will have ample opportunity to express their views in detail. I am sure that the Committee is anxious to deal with the sittings motion, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to confine his remarks to that and not to speak in detail about access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I shall do that, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
The purpose of my remarks is twofold. First, I welcome the fact that we shall have a relatively extensive number of sittings. Secondly, I must point out to the Government that we are not a rubber-stamping Committee. We must consider the Bill carefully and in detail, and the Government should be ready to accept amendments. I gain the impression, not least from the article in The Guardian referred to earlier by my hon. Friends, that the Committee is expected to rubber-stamp the Bill. However, those who have read it—I pray in aid the NFU, the Country Landowners Association, the Countryside Alliance and umpteen other organisations, including the Ramblers Association—believe that substantial parts of it are wrong. I thought that it might be useful, Mr. Stevenson, to refer to some of them. However, I shall curtail my remarks a little.
<P>
The right-to-roam provisions contain a significant number of errors, but the right-of-way provision is perhaps the most important. When I was a special adviser at the Department of the Environment, we considered the law as it applied to BOATs, RUPPs, rights of way and so on. It is a most complicated, abstruse and obscure area of English law, and we concluded that it was rather too difficult to sort it out. The Opposition welcome the fact that the Government are taking the first steps in that difficult process.
<P>
Most rights of way were developed not for ramblers or walkers but to allow access from farm cottages to the fields, which is why so many of them lead in strange directions. I welcome the fact that the Bill starts to address that problem, but it does not go far enough. It does not get to grips with the technicalities and complexities of the existing law, and I hope, as we speak, that the Government and their advisers will have started redrafting those provisions. We want a network of rights of way that allows excellent access to the countryside for townsfolk but that preserves the rights and interests of farmers, sportsmen and others. That is an important but badly drafted part of the Bill.
<P>
The same applies, but to a lesser degree, to the provisions for SSSIs. In passing, I regret that areas of outstanding natural beauty are not protected in the Bill as many hoped they would be. If the Countryside Agency briefing is right, the Government had originally planned to include AONBs. They may consider including them, perhaps in the miscellaneous provisions, which would be welcomed by a number of observers. That is another badly drafted part of the Bill, although the provisions give greater protection to SSSIs, which is greatly to be welcomed.
<P>
I appreciate your remarks, Mr. Stevenson; I have made a reasonably long contribution to our discussion of the sittings motion. However, it is worth putting down a marker: many of us who care about the countryside believe that the Bill and its underlying principles are fundamentally good, but that it is, in detail, badly flawed and inadequate. I hope that the Minister will use the four weekly sittings—which I hope will be extensive and last until the summer—to take account of Opposition Members' concerns and to find ways of redrafting what is currently a rather inadequate Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): I wish to make a short declaration of interest, although I do not think that it will come within the Bill remit. I am the co-owner of a smallholding situated in northern England. The property is extremely small and consists of six acres of land with one farm and some outbuildings. I thought that it was important to put that on record before we began discussing the Bill.
<P>
I do not wish to add anything to my hon. Friends' comments on the motion, but I should say that I look forward to serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson. I hope that you are not getting a complex, as I have followed you from the European Parliament to the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, and now here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Stalking!
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I shall humbly enjoy serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
I want to speak briefly about a worrying development to which I hope the Minister and the Government will give adequate consideration. The problem occurs in the Vale of York and throughout north Yorkshire, and my hon. Friends have sought to address it by tabling amendments. I am speaking of the use of lurchers in the middle of the night to kill deer. The lurchers are often controlled by only two people—usually men—with spotlights. Recently, such people have been stalking deer—not in the same way that I stalk you, Mr. Stevenson—in the night, cutting them open and leaving them to die in tragic circumstances. Police are thin on the ground in north Yorkshire, and I hope that the Government will give due attention to the problem, which is being addressed sensibly by residents in the Vale of York, through a Vale-watch scheme, and elsewhere in north Yorkshire. My constituents are concerned that the Bill will provide more scope for such activities, and I hope that we will have proper time to discuss them.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including those which may be reached during an afternoon sitting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following Order: Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clause 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 3 to 8, Schedule 3, Clauses 9 to 42, Schedule 4, Clauses 43 to 47, Schedule 5, Clauses 48 to 50, Schedule 6, Clause 51, Schedule 7, Clauses 52 to 59, Schedule 8, Clauses 60 to 62, Schedule 9, Clause 63, Schedule 10, Clauses 64 to 67, Schedule 11, Clauses 68 to 72, Schedule 12, Clauses 73 and 74, new Clauses, new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see that you intend to deploy your considerable powers of expedition, Mr. Stevenson, in proceeding with the Bill. I had prepared a speech that was not lengthy but which dealt with the matter properly and fully. However, I am sure that you are right and that it is much better for those points to be attended to as we consider each separate provision in the Bill.
<P>
I was pleased by the positive tone in which Opposition Front-Bench Members and other hon. Members spoke, which was different from that in which the initial response was made a year ago. As was said many years ago, by their deeds shall we know them. I hope that Opposition Members will respond as they say they will; I shall be glad to respond similarly.

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Knowing you, Mr. Stevenson, I should prefer to comply with your request to proceed with the order of consideration.
<P>
The order of consideration provides a straightforward way of discussing the clauses on access and their related schedules, the rights of way provisions and their schedules, SSSIs and their schedules and the clause on wildlife and its schedule, and general points on the purposes of the Bill. I hope that is agreeable with the Committee. We will consider the Bill in the order proposed. It is sensible to follow the natural order of the Bill and it is practical to discuss clauses and their related schedules together as the details are closely linked. I hope that that is agreeable.

<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I beg to move amendment No.2, in page 1, line 10, at beginning insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`In this Part ``access land'' means any land which is shown as access land on a map in conclusive form issued by the appropriate countryside body for the purpose of this Part.
<P>
( ) Land may be shown as access land on such a map if—
<P>
(a) it is open country; or
<P>
(b) it is registered common land
<P>
but does not (in any of those cases) include excepted land or land which is treated by section 15(1) as being accessible to the public apart from this Act.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 1, in page 1, line 10, leave out subsection (l).
<P>
No. 140, in page 1, line 11, leave out from beginning to `excepted' in line 20 and insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> We now come to the meat of the Bill. All the amendments we have tabled are designed to improve the Bill or to probe the Government's intentions. Amendments Nos 2 and 1 go together because amendment No. 2 removes a significant part of the start of clause 1, amendment No. 2 replaces it and amendment No. 140 is an alternative form of words. The Bill needs to be clear. Clarity for everybody affected by this legislation is essential if they are to understand their relative rights and responsibilities. Each of the parties will then be able to plan their activities accordingly. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the mapping exercise is comprehensive. At present, the Bill does not provide for maps showing all the access land in detail. Clause 4(4) says that the map
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>need not distinguish between different categories of open country.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows that the Bill does not provide for the comprehensive mapping that is necessary if everybody is to understand the situation in any one area. The mapping exercise covers registered common land and open country, it does not cover excepted land as defined in schedule 1, part 1. That may be surrounded by open country or common land, but is not as we understand to be included in the mapping exercise.
<P>
The Bill should provide for a full mapping of the access land, which would give walkers, farmers, landowners and public bodies certainty as to the situation in their location. Walkers would know precisely where they can and cannot go. The curtilage of buildings—an issue to which we will probably return later—would be clearly laid out on a map. Farmers and landowners would know what land was subject to access, reducing the chance of mistakes being made and of disputes about notices, restrictions, obstructions and other issues that are covered later in the Bill. They would know precisely to which land it applies. Under the Bill, if there is a genuine dispute over land being excepted or not—the interpretation of schedule 1, paragraph 1—the only way of establishing the facts would be to pursue a criminal prosecution through the magistrate's court. That would be a lengthy and unnecessary process and the matter would be better dealt with through the mapping exercise. That would also reduce the prospect of appeals relating to the mapping of open country. At present, the maps will not exclude excepted land, so farmers or landowners who are concerned about the proposals can only dispute the open country designation, whereas if the mapping exercise were more comprehensive, it might be possible to assuage their concerns, or at least to address in more detail the specific points that worry them.
<P>
On Second Reading, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), the Minister said that mountains over 600m would not automatically be accessible. I should be grateful if he would explain precisely the intention behind the provision and say whether he envisages that such land will come within the mapping exercise or be excluded from it. The amendments are designed to clarify precisely what land is to be mapped and to make it easier for those who will be affected by the Bill to understand where their rights and responsibilities begin and end.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, given the spirit in which it is tabled, or at least explain what the mapping exercise will entail. At present, the mapping exercise is insufficiently clear and will not necessarily cover excepted land. Therefore, there will be plenty of room for dispute between walkers, owners, tenants and people with sporting rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I support these sensible amendments, which probe the situation and require a detailed response. It is plain that there is a need for balance between the rights of individuals to walk and the rights of people who own or farm the land, so we need clarity, which the amendments try to achieve.
<P>
The Minister referred to the initial planning when he announced the White Paper. He said that all land that was extensively, as opposed to intensively, grazed would come within the Bill. In response, I made the point that that land is under the greatest ecological and environmental pressure—not that I am in any way against increasing access, but I am in favour of sustainable and balanced access. Like the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, I am unclear about the situation regarding land above 600m. That land is under greatest pressure and should have the greatest protection for various reasons, including the flora and fauna. It is extremely important that the matter should be clarified and the amendments make a useful start to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Again, I echo the views that have been expressed. Clarity is essential. The amendments help the Minister to explain what he has in mind. If we do not get the essential elements—the mapping definitions—right, there will be confusion about what is access land. The definitions display an impatience with the mapping process. It may be a worthy intention to make the Bill effective in providing access prior to the completion of mapping, but the mapping exercise is crucial and must be comprehensive. What will fall outside the mapped process? I want there to be access to land above 600m, but I was slightly confused by what the Minister said about that on Second Reading.
<P>
Finally, is inner London defined in statute? Given that many statutes on London have been repealed and replaced, I hope that we are not using an expression that is not defined in law.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that amendment No. 9 relates to land above 600m. Time spent discussing it now may have to be taken into account when the amendment is moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> This is the first of several amendments that attempt to elucidate the meaning of various provisions. Part I gives effect to our manifesto commitment to give people increased access to open countryside. To ensure that there is greater certainty and clarity, we have provided that the countryside bodies should draw up maps of open country and registered common land to show where people may walk. The process of drawing up and consulting on maps will take time, although some land has been mapped or is clearly defined in maps that are available to the general public—I refer to registered common land and land that is more than 600m above sea level. Later amendments relate to how that is calculated—what we might call the Newlyn point.
<P>
Existing common land registers that are held by the registration authorities provide sufficient certainty to allow the right of access to be brought into effect ahead of the publication of conclusive maps by the countryside bodies. Common land registers are not always easy to use, and we shall look to the countryside bodies to provide early information to the public about registered land. We also recognise that the owners of registered common land, and others who are interested in it, should have an opportunity to put in place closures or restrictions before the right of access comes into effect on the land. We shall allow sufficient time for applications under chapter II to be made and determined and, where necessary, for appeals to be considered before commencing the right of access on registered common land.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 2 and 140 would remove the opportunity for the public to have earlier access both to registered common land and to land over 600m. I presume that that effect was intended. More surprisingly, land voluntarily dedicated to public access under clause 16 would also be removed from the definition of access land, putting it outside the scope of the public right of access. I am disappointed that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire seeks to undermine the part of the Bill that I should have expected him to support most—the provision for landowners voluntarily to dedicate their land for public access. That would make all the difference in the world from his perspective. I am surprised that he would seek to exclude land voluntarily put into the public domain from the rights of public access. We would not wish to do that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why there was no differentiation between mountain, moorland, heathland and downland on maps. A dispute about categorisation of land would be pointless—the issue is whether the land constitutes open country and whether there is a right of open access. On appeal, I accept that countryside bodies will need to justify their decisions to include land on maps, including whether they think that it is mountain, moorland, heathland or downland.
<P>
Amendment No. 140 would go further than amendment No. 2 and would require the countryside bodies not to show excepted land as access land. I understand the motive. However, the maps to be prepared under clause 4 will be of open country and of registered common land. That is the key point. Excepted land will generally not be mountain, moorland, heathland, downland or registered common land, so we would not normally expect the countryside bodies to show excepted land on the maps.
<P>
The status of excepted land might relate to very small parcels of land that it would be difficult to identify and remove from the countryside bodies' statutory maps. For example, an isolated barn or a water company's pumping station might be on excepted land, but it would not be necessary for them to be marked as excepted on the statutory maps. Further, the status of land as excepted land might change from year to year as land use changes. It would not be practicable for the statutory maps to be revised continually to identify every possible parcel of excepted land at all times.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Minister consider two points and let me have an answer, either now or later? Will water be included as excepted land if it was above 600ft? Will fertile valleys in mountain areas, which might be cultivated, be included?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Water will not be excepted land—we shall consider the matter when we discuss a later amendment, when I shall explain that it would be anomalous and bizarre to exclude a small stream in the middle of open country. The hon. Gentleman's use of the word ``cultivated'' suggested that the land would not be open country and so would be outside the definition of access land.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy asked about extensive grazing. The countryside bodies will assess whether land is mountain, moorland, heathland or downland. They will be expected to include only agricultural land used for extensive grazing, not that used for more intensive agriculture. That is the key point. Only grazing used for rough grazing, where the stock density was low because of the poor productivity of the land, would be included.
<P>
The amendments seek to delay the public's right of access to registered common land and to land over 600m. Amendment No. 140 would impose an unacceptable burden of unnecessary detail on the countryside bodies in drawing up their access maps. I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that it would be unwise to pursue the proposals and I hope that he will withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I thank the Minister for his response. I take slight umbrage at the suggestion that the motive is to delay access to land. That is not the intention, although I accept that that would be an effect of the amendments. We sought to achieve clarity regarding what land is to be involved. The Minister also chastised me for apparently removing voluntary dedication. I contend strongly that we intend no such thing. The amendment would remove that from the definition of access to land in part I, but it would remain as an opportunity in clauses 15 and 16. With your understanding, Mr. Stevenson, I refer the Minister to clause 16, which clearly says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Subject to the provisions of this section, a person owning the fee simple absolute in possession in any land . . . may, by taking such steps as may be prescribed, dedicate the land as access land for the purposes of this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A landowner would clearly still have the right and opportunity to dedicate land. I support the voluntary approach and believe it to be desirable, as the Minister rightly stated.
<P>
The Minister's examples of possible situations, such as an individual barn, a pumping station, a sheep-gathering area and sheep-dipping facilities, which often occur in the hills, were accurate. However, although they might be difficult to reproduce in detail on a map, that should not be a reason for not including them. I have witnessed situations in which a farmer has gathered his sheep and held them in pens, usually alongside a barn or other building, and in which there is the risk of walkers coming close and disturbing the sheep. We shall discuss the curtilage of such buildings. However, unless they are clearly shown on maps, farmers and walkers might have a verbal confrontation about where they should or should not walk. As I have said, the only solution is through the magistrates court. I cannot believe that the Minister seriously advocates that every such dispute should go to court. We need to pay much more careful attention to the detail of what land, located in or surrounded by access land, would be excepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will my hon. Friend press the Minister on another aspect? Not only will the farmer want to protect his lambing station, and the water authority its pumping station, but, as a matter of safety, people out walking should keep clear of those installations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. We shall later discuss amendments intended to reduce hazards for people using rights under the Bill, but that consideration is also relevant in the example that I have given. I do not know whether the Minister wants to respond to my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am only too pleased to respond to the hon. Gentleman. I take it from his comments on amendments Nos. 2 and 140 that he does not intend to remove voluntarily dedicated land from access, but simply that that could not be commenced until conclusive maps of access land had been issued by the countryside body. My point is that the existing maps, both of registered common land and of land above 600m, are sufficiently accurate to give reasonable certainty about what is included under the fast-tracking procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall deal with the point made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, who is keen to receive a reply. Perhaps that will be related to what the hon. Member for North Wiltshire wants to say. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire argued that all excepted land should be excluded from access land on maps, and that there should be precision about that to avoid either civil or criminal action in magistrates courts. Excepted land, whether buildings, gardens, or other land, is readily identifiable. It is impractical to insist that countryside bodies identify every instance of excepted land, for the reason I have given. That must be flexible. Land will become excepted land after maps have been confirmed. They could not always represent the current status of the land. There must be some reliance on landowners and users to interpret the current position.
<P>
My general point is that excepted land will be relatively easily identified. There can be no doubt about whether land is occupied by a building, a garden or a quarry. Constant land use changes mean that we cannot insist that the information be included on all statutory maps.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Before the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome contributes, I shall answer the question he put earlier—although it is relevant to a later amendment—about whether inner London is defined in legislation. It is defined in clause 41 of the Bill as inner London boroughs, the City of London and Inner and Middle Temples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I want to ask the Minister something different: I can ask later about the definition of an inner London borough. The right hon. Gentleman said that it is easy to identify a quarry, but I live in the Mendips, and I am not convinced that one can identify a quarry, nor its extent. Will he reflect on the difficulties of identifying what constitutes the edge of a quarry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I bow to the hon. Gentleman's experience in seeking to identify quarries in the Mendips. He has more experience of that than I do, and I take his point that it is not necessarily immediately obvious. I shall try to help. We shall explain further how those exceptions will work when we debate the amendments to schedule 1. We shall consider the points made in this our first debate, and if we think that further clarification is justified, including on the identification of quarries, we shall return to the matter on amendments to schedule 1.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I wish to press the Minister on a point that I raised on Second Reading and that was mentioned this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, to which the right hon. Gentleman has not properly responded. We understand that land over 600m that is already mapped is therefore easily known. The same applies to registered common land, although we shall soon debate whether non-registered common land comes in that category.
<P>
The Minister has not said how soon walkers would have access to areas over 600m. Will it be from the date of Royal Assent, which will be before the maps are available? If so, walkers in various parts of the country may know that they have the right to walk on areas above 600m but have no means of knowing how to get there.
<P>
Many such areas have no roads leading up to the 600m mark, or no known means of access to that point, and some of the land that surrounds mountains may or may not become access land under the Bill. However, ramblers will naturally assume that it is access land—or, more probably, they will assume that they have the right to approach land over 600m by any means.
<P>
Is the Minister prepared to consider delaying access to land above 600m until such time as the maps have been prepared? That will allow proper access to those areas without upsetting the farmers in the lower surrounding land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I take that point. I do not propose that fast-track access to mountains higher than 600m should be postponed until the maps of all the surrounding territory are available. However, some mountains in excess of 600m will be surrounded by inaccessible land, or there may be some other question about access. In those circumstances, there will be no access to such mountains until there is certainty. However, that does not apply to a number of mountains over 600m, and I see no reason why the fast-track access should not operate in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In making my first substantive contribution, rather than an intervention, I wish to declare an interest. The Register of Members' Interests shows that I have farmland in Gloucestershire and Norfolk and woodland in Scotland. I am also a member of a number of clubs and societies, although, I regret to say, not on a pecuniary basis. More particularly, I am one of only two Members of Parliament who are chartered surveyors. I am used to dealing with property transactions in my professional career. Maps form an important part of such transactions, and I am used to having to be very precise with them.
<P>
It seems that the Minister has not properly considered the matter. We shall have endless arguments about what is excepted land, particularly when we come to schedule 1. Paragraph 2 of schedule 1 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Land covered by buildings and the curtilage of such land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There will be huge arguments about what land is associated with the features that will classify it as exempt. Will the Minister reconsider the provision? It should be the received expectation that excepted land will be mapped. I accept the Minister's assertion that particular installations such as those associated with sheep penning and dipping will have to be moved now and again for land management reasons, but installations such as water pumping stations will not need to be moved and many associated works could fall within their curtilage. The maps should make clear the nature of such sites. Precise awareness of accessibility is not only in the interests of utility operators and of the farmers with responsibility for maintaining the buildings, but for the convenience and safety of walkers themselves. I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter and to ensure that people can expect such sites to be shown on the map and to be left out only when their inclusion is impractical.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have already said that we will reconsider these matters during debate of schedule 1. I am not convinced by the hon. Gentleman's arguments, as all buildings are excepted and are not part of a right of access. It is not necessary to mark a building, such as a water pumping station, on a map for walkers to know that they do not have access to it. Walkers need to know with certainty about open country. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that long-standing buildings such as water pumping stations should be clearly shown on maps is not relevant to the exercise under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to reconsider the matter when we debate schedule 1, which is a step forward. I did not entirely agree with all his points, which were sincere but which did not address my concerns as I wanted them to be addressed.
<P>
One of the problems involved is public perception. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire made an important point about access to mountain land. Plenty of anecdotes show that, since the Government announced their intention to legislate, many members of the public have thought that that has happened and that the Government announcement was sufficient. I know a number of landowners who have stopped people walking in woods or open land but who have been given the response, ``I thought that we now had right to roam'', or words to that effect. That perception may be wholly wrong and based on a misunderstanding of parliamentary procedure, but it is genuine nevertheless. Picking up my hon. Friend's point, people may think ``I'm allowed to go on that mountain, so crossing this bit of grass to get to it is perfectly acceptable'' because they believe that a right is in place to enable them to do so. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that when we consider schedule 1. In the light of his constructive agreement to reconsider our concerns in relation to schedule 1, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> This is an extensive group of amendments. For the purposes of coherence and simplicity, I shall address them in two parts. Some of the amendments are relatively technical attempts to probe the Government and to clarify their thinking on common land. Others deal with the size of area that should be permitted and give rise to points of practical application that I hope the Minister will address.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 3, 5, 25 and 26 probe the application of access to common land. The Bill gives a right of access over registered common land, but the amendments relate to common land that is not registrable and parts of common land that are not common land for the purposes of the Commons Registration Act 1965. I know that that sounds arcane, but the exceptions include common land in the New forest, Epping forest and the Forest of Dean—areas where access is treasured, valued and used. There could be confusion about that land. Common land that is subject to highway rights is also relevant. Why is such land excluded from access rights? It is often not registered as common land because it is not registrable. As it would be peculiar to exclude such land, does that exclusion reflect a drafting problem?
<P>
Amendment No. 7 provides that a right of access to common land should arise only when mapping has occurred, which it would achieve by deleting subsection (1)(c). We have touched on whether it would be safe and sensible to allow access straight away—I accept that there are arguments in favour of getting on with it—or whether we should wait until a decent set of maps has been prepared. It is necessary to balance the interests of expanding access with those of safety and certainty. The amendment tackles that knotty problem. We will listen with interest if the Minister says that, in principle, he is gung-ho about providing as much access as possible. However, he should recognise that there are points of practicality.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 is a probing amendment. It relates to access land in inner London. Thanks to Minister's reply to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. David Heath), we know what is meant by inner London.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> No, we do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that he still does not know the location of inner London. He and the Minister will have to get together in private to discuss that important issue.
<P>
The explanatory notes do not explain why inner London is excluded. Will the Minister clarify that peculiarity? It is possible that section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925 provides a right of access for air and exercise to common land in areas including inner London. If that is the case, it appears to be duplicated in the proviso to clause 1(1), which refers to land that is ``treated by section 15(1)'' and therefore to land that is subject rights of access under section 193. The amendment attempts to clear up the confusion between the two clauses and to tackle the exclusion of access to an important part of the country. The second part of the grouping, amendments Nos. 4 and 8, or 150 and 151, raises serious issues. This is an attempt to make the Minister explain why other access land and common land are treated differently in different parts of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government recognise in clause 4 that areas of open country may be so small that access should not be required. The amendments apply the point made in clause 4 to common land as well as to open country in the interests of consistency. The same arguments about practicality—that the trouble caused in providing access would outweigh its value to walkers—apply. The Minister can see from the amendments that we are not seeking to impose our own de minimis level. The amendments give the options of either 50 hectares or 10 hectares as the size below which access should not apply. We would be happy for the Minister to come up with his own proposal, which could be either of those or neither of them. An important principle is at stake here for three separate, but equally strong, reasons. A de minimis area is needed to avoid the necessity of taking decisions on whether small parcels of land fit the definition of mountain, moor, heath, down or common land. We want to have them treated as common land. We want to ensure that the provision of access is targeted on substantial areas of land that offer public benefit since clearly the right to roam—to use the popular terminology—is of less use on a small parcel of land. Also, we want to minimise the costs of mapping and consultation, which will rise dramatically as smaller and smaller areas have to be mapped for access purposes. It would be useful if the Minister were to address that group of amendments separately. It seems inconsistent with other parts of the Bill that common land will be subject to the Bill however small the area is, whereas other newly created access land will not be. Perhaps the Minister can explain why that is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The amendments raise some interesting issues concerning definition. I do not agree entirely with the hon. Member for Ashford. For instance, I do not think there is a problem with small parcels of registered land becoming subject to an argument about definition—either they are registered or they are not. If they are registered, there is no dispute over whether they fall within the present wording of the Bill. Where I do agree with him is that there appears to be an inconsistency in the approach adopted under clause 1 on the de minimis provision for registered common land and that adopted in clause 4 where for open countryside there is a capacity for the agency to ignore for the purposes of mapping small parcels of land which serve no useful purpose. I am not sure if I am happy to go along with the precise terms of the amendment proposed by the hon. Gentleman. There are circumstances where a piece of registered common land may be contained within or be contiguous with open land as defined in the Bill, so it would be nonsense for it to be left out of the Bill and the mapping procedure simply because of its size. But I can envisage other circumstances where it might be inappropriate. For instance, a very small piece of registered common land could be omitted for practical purposes from mapping and access. How did the Government reach the view that different criteria should apply in clauses 1 and 4?
<P>
With respect to amendment No. 6 and the question about inner London, I do not want to be a complete bore—I know perfectly well where inner London is—I just want the definition enshrined in law. The Minister helpfully referred me to clause 41, which defines inner London as comprising the inner London boroughs, the City of London and the Inner and Middle Temples. How does one define inner London as distinct from outer London boroughs? Is there a definition in statute of an inner London borough? At one time it was easy. The Inner London education authority and other bodies provided definitions. However, there has been a great deal of revision of legislation on London. I am certainly no expert on statutes affecting London, but we should be sure that the words we include in a Bill mean what we intend them to.

<P>

<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I want to press the Minister on the question of registrable land, with respect to the question why common land in north Yorkshire should be deemed registrable. What is exceptional about the New forest, Epping forest or the Forest of Dean? That will raise questions in my part of the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister will know that the Commons Registration Act 1965 gave rise to a long, drawn-out procedure to determine what was or was not registered common land. Does the Minister envisage that debate being reopened? Will there be claims for further registration? Alternatively, will only currently registered land have to be mapped?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Amendments Nos. 3, 5, 25 and 26 would reopen the question of the status of common land, which the Commons Registration Act 1965 was intended to settle. I understand that the Act has been widely criticised for some inadequacies, but it has done much to clarify and codify the extent of common land in England and Wales and the rights of common over that land. As hon. Members will know, a couple of months ago I published a consultation paper entitled ``Greater Protection and Better Management of Common Land in England and Wales'', setting out our proposals for reform. However, until we can bring about common land reform— which is complicated and contentious—the common land registers provide the best assurance of what is or is not common land. To revisit the registration of every common would be a prolonged and costly procedure. I am glad to see the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy strongly indicating assent.
<P>
Some common land may mistakenly have been registered under the 1965 Act, but schedule 1 provides that land that is built on or land in one of several other categories will be treated as excepted and not subject to the statutory right of access. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.
<P>
I shall respond briefly to the points that were raised about the New forest and Epping forest. Common land that is not registered under the 1965 Act is effectively lost as common land by virtue of the failure to register it. Therefore, if the land is mountain, moorland, heathland or downland, it will be mapped as access land, but if it is not, it will not be access land. We do not intend to re-open the question of registration in this legislation. We have published a consultation paper on that and intend to deal with the matter through that channel. The New forest was not registrable under the 1965 Act, but historic laws provided for the management of common rights, so there has always been free access to the New forest.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 would extend provision for fast track access to registered commons in inner London. I am told—it is always useful to have information brought to one's attention by e-commerce—that inner London boroughs are defined in the Local Government Act 1972. If the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome wishes for further clarification once he has considered that Act, we can return to the subject at a later date. However, I do not believe that there are any such commons in inner London. I think it was the hon. Member for Ashford who mentioned that, for the avoidance of doubt, we have removed the obligation on the Countryside Agency to consider whether there is any open country or registered common land to be mapped in inner London. Clause 4 makes that provision. Therefore, we believe that we should put it beyond doubt that access on a fast track should not be granted to registered common land within inner London, as the Countryside Agency would never be able to issue maps showing such land as access land. It is a fairly abstruse point, which we should not pursue any further. In practice, I should add that all such land, if registered, would, in any event, almost certainly be subject to an existing right of access as metropolitan common land under the Law of Property Act 1925. However, the key point is that I do not believe that there is any such land.
<P>
I now turn to the issue of the de minimis threshold, raised in amendments Nos. 4 and 8. At one stroke, amendments Nos. 4 and 8 would remove from the right of access all commons of less than 50 hectares in size. I remind the Committee that 50 hectares is 120 acres, which is a substantial area. Amendments Nos. 150 and 151 would have the same effect, but in relation to a more modest threshold of 10 hectares, which is about 25 acres. Hon. Members might take the view that an area of less than 10 hectares is not worth having for the purposes of access, but I would disagree because 10 hectares is the equivalent of about 15 football pitches. Indeed, many such commons in lowland England are the only areas of uncultivated, unenclosed land within areas of intensive agriculture. That is important, and I certainly wish to retain it. We therefore intend to ensure that they are not forgotten.
<P>
The amendments seek to delay and reduce the public's right of access to registered common land. For the reasons that I have given, I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I have a simple question. I am sorry to bore the Minister with the subject, but it is about inner London. I am sorry also to steal some of the thunder of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. Are the commons at Clapham, Wandsworth and Streatham within inner London; and are they registered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I have a map showing Clapham, Streatham and Wandsworth commons and I am looking also at the definitions in the Local Government Act 1972. My expectation is that they are within inner London. However—I am happy to receive advice—they are not registered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have not taken advice but I seem to recall that, under the Commons Registration Act 1965, certain commons are registered that give rights in common to certain restricted groups of people. It seems that the Bill will give a general right of access to such common lands. If so, it will widen the definition of common land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My immediate reaction, without receiving advice, is that the Bill is intended to have that effect. If I am wrong, I shall ensure that the Committee is informed of the fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am sure that other members of the Committee are struck, as I am, by how much time we have spent discussing inner London, and Clapham and Wandsworth commons. I did not expect to discuss such matters at length during our first sitting. However, I am happy to have received the Minister's assurance. I certainly have no desire to spend time debating theoretical rights over non-existent commons in inner London—wherever that may be.
<P>
I press the Minister on other points that were raised this morning. I understand his response to the amendments. I hope that I understood him correctly when he said that non-registered land would be excluded, but that it was worth doing because registering the land would be complicated, which would delay the process. At the simple, practical level, I understand that some areas of land may seem like one piece of land to the people walking across them, but that some parts may be registered common and other parts may not be. Those people will have access to some parts but not others, and they may therefore blunder into unwitting trespass. I am sure that the Minister agrees that that would not be satisfactory. Has he considered the practical implications of that—on the ground, as it were—for instance, on signage?
<P>
I was rather disappointed with the Minister's response to the amendment. He carefully discussed our proposals for a de minimis procedure without dealing with the principle. Does he agree that it is legitimate to want to include a de minimis principle, whereby small parcels of land would not be registered under the Bill because the balance of cost and advantage would fall on the wrong side? Indeed, since he appears to believe that it is right in other parts of the Bill, why is it not right for common land? Does he think that there is something special about such land? Fifty hectares or 10 hectares might be too big, but there will be an appropriate figure. Is he saying that, as a matter of principle, he would always reject a de minimis principle for common land? That approach would be wrong and impractical. I would be interested if he responded to that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I said that if land was—perhaps mistakenly—not registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965, it would be lost for the purposes of immediate or fast-track access to registered common land. If it were mountain, moorland, heathland or downland, it would be mapped and duly brought into access land.
<P>
I am not suggesting that a de minimis threshold will always be inappropriate when we consider the mapping of access land. An area might be so small that it would be appropriate to have such a threshold. However, we are discussing the different issue of common land registered under the 1965 Act. The hon. Gentleman is proposing that, despite the use of land under the Act for the past 35 years, we should now impose a de minimis threshold. That is neither necessary nor desirable, which is why I am excluding it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation. I do not find it entirely satisfactory, but we can return to the issues behind it at later stages, and so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I shall start with a point that I referred to earlier. The Minister just used the phrase ``the amendment is seeking to delay''. I wish to emphasise that there is no desire to delay, although there is a desire to get things right. I hope that he will reconsider the use of the phrase. It suggests that we are being obstructive, but we are not. To illustrate the point, I am pleased to introduce the third group of amendments less than two hours after we commenced consideration.
<P>
The group falls into two sections dealing with different extremes—one with sea level and the other with mountains more than 600m above sea level. Amendments Nos. 9 and 12 are intended to remove the right of access to mountains until they are mapped and would delete subsection (l)(d).
<P>
Many of the arguments were made during the debate on the first group of amendments, but we should repeat some and reflect on the implications. If access is to work, it must be able to adjust to local circumstances. Byelaws might have to be made; access points—to which we shall come—and signage might be required. The appointment and training of wardens must also be addressed. If the right were introduced precipitately before those matters were properly considered, there would be a serious risk of misunderstandings and ill feeling among those who misinterpreted the law.
<P>
The perception of the legislation could be damaged by its operation. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire the Minister did not say that access to mountain land over 600m would be available immediately. He said that the land is easily mapped, but one must take accessibility into account. The Bill as drafted provides for access to mountain land without its having been mapped. My hon. Friend's point is right: there are many parts of this country where the only access to mountains is either over cultivated land, which is excepted, or over land about which there may be some debate.
<P>
One of the difficulties that we face is that there is so much interaction between different parts of the Bill and that the different amendments that we have tabled come in at different stages but all interact. The issues of intensive or extensive grassland and the existence or otherwise of stone walls or other forms of fencing or containment all impinge on the amendments.
<P>
There are places in the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy's constituency, in the rest of Snowdonia and in other parts of the country where mountains can be accessed in theory, but it would mean walking over large grass fields. Those may seem uncultivated to the uninitiated and they may therefore think that it is perfectly acceptable to walk over them, but the farmer has not only to look after sheep there but to manage the grassland. Grassland is as much a crop to be managed and husbanded as is wheat or any other crop. My concern is that by allowing immediate access to mountains people will be lulled into feeling that it is perfectly permissible to walk over grassland to reach them, even though that is not what the law provides for. In the meantime, until this is sorted out and the mapping is completed, individuals could have some justification for being confused on the subject.
<P>
The first group of amendments concerns the wisdom—or unwisdom, as we would say—of allowing immediate or almost immediate access to mountains. If the Minister did not mean by what he said on Second Reading that access to mountains would be available immediately, perhaps he can tell us when he thinks that it will.
<P>
The other group of amendments—my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford and I tabled most of them, but I am conscious that one of the amendments was tabled by the hon. Member for Pendle—relates to the measurement of 600m above sea level. In my constituency the issue of sea level is of importance, not because of land that is 600m above but because parts of it are below sea level. Indeed, my own house is only about 6 ft above sea level. Although the odd foot or two may not matter at 600m, it certainly matters if you are 4 or 5ft above or below sea level.
<P>
The amendments are perfectly straightforward and hardly need an introduction. They would write into the Bill precisely what measurement system we are using in measuring 600m. I understand that it is the Ordnance Survey's practice to take the sea level at Newlyn as the base. The Minister cannot say that the purpose of the amendments is to delay, as they would simply write into the Bill a definition of sea level that has in any case been assumed in it.
<P>
Our two clusters of amendments tackle two separate issues. I hope that the Minister will respond to them. We are especially concerned about access to mountains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): The British Mountaineering Council is worried about the definition of a mountain as being land that is above the 600m contour. That would capture only the upper reaches of land in the lake district and Snowdonia and a few isolated summits in my area of the Pennines.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The British Mountaineering Council believes that the definition is arbitrary. It would like it to be more robust. A great deal of rugged terrain is at lower levels.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman help me by explaining why we need amendment No. 143? Does not the definition of open country, which includes mountain, resolve the problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> It should do. Although I am sure that the Countryside Agency will map rugged areas below that level, mountaineers have expressed reservations. There are isolated areas, perhaps falling within what Opposition Members would consider to be de minimis, that mountaineers love to climb over. For example, on a summer evening, the Kilnsey crags near Kettlewell in the Yorkshire dales crawl with climbers. I assume that that land will be hoovered up and mapped by the Countryside Agency, but I thought it right to raise the concerns of the British Mountaineering Council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I support what the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said about cultivated land in Snowdonia and other parts of the United Kingdom that borders the 600m contour. Silage is often collected two or three times a year. It is a vital source of nutrition for animals during the winter months. Unless there is some order, there will be chaos and, even worse, a great deal of falling out. The overriding principle is to achieve the all-important balance between the right to roam and the rights of the occupier. That source of potential conflict should be considered. I do not know whether the solution is to provide signage or to allow linear access over parcels of land up to the 600m level. It is a grey area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Our previous debate related to the preparation of maps for registered common land. This debate concentrates on mountains. Just as we have allowed for fast-track access to registered common land, so clause 1(1) allows for fast-track access to land that is more than 600m above sea level. In the consultation document ``Access to the Open Countryside in England and Wales'' we said that a mountain could be regarded as including all land above 600m, which is approximately 2,000ft. That amounts to about 500 sq km or 200 square miles and is about 3 per cent. of the estimated total extent of open countryside. However, most of the land is already open to access, either by right or by tolerance, which reflects the difficulty of keeping people off such remote land, or historic traditions of access, or the absence of any productive use and, I would add, widespread ownership by the National Trust and other organisations that are favourably disposed to public access.
<P>
Provision for the new right to embrace such land will ensure that a right of access is quickly secured for land above 600m. However, I understand the points about certainty that have been raised. Ordnance Survey maps clearly show the extent of land above 600m, which should provide sufficient certainty to allow the right of access to be brought into effect ahead of the publication of conclusive maps by the countryside bodies. There are three caveats or qualifications in relation to the accessibility of mountains. First, much such land is already accessible by rights of way and roads or by existing permissive access. There is unlikely to be a problem with access over farmland, as has been suggested, because land anywhere close to 600m is not usually cultivated.
<P>
The second point is that, as on registered common land, we shall allow time for owners of land above 600m to apply, where necessary, for closures and other restrictions before the right of access is brought into force on that land—that is my answer to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. That could easily take one or two years. The process will not be rushed and there will be plenty of opportunity for it to be undertaken in an orderly and proper way.
<P>
In answer to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, and to pick up on the point that I made on Second Reading, we accept that there might be some land over 600m to which the public will not be able to gain access until the right becomes exercisable over open country, but we believe that there will be some areas in which the early introduction of the right—not immediate but early introduction—will provide valuable new rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I always give way to the hon. Gentleman because he makes such good points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for giving way and I am sorry to bang on about this particular point, but when I raised the issue on Second Reading, he said that land over 600m would be accessible soon because it is most easily mapped. In saying that, he misinterprets the Bill because the whole purpose of the provision is to ensure that access to the land will be available, whether or not it is mapped. Therefore, the ease with which an area is mapped is irrelevant.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. It was a slip of the tongue and I meant to say most easily identified, rather than mapped.
<P>
I come now to amendments Nos. 10 and 11 and the points raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. We all noted with concern and solicitude that his house is only 6ft above sea level. I am glad to recruit the hon. Gentleman to the group of persons who strongly support the climate change levy, which is designed to reduce global warming and, therefore, the rise in sea level. As I have said, Ordnance Survey maps show land above 600m and that is sufficient for present purposes. It is correct that height above sea level is generally measured by reference to the mean height measured at Newlyn. Apparently—I did not know this—Newlyn is the site at which the mean level of the sea was calculated from hourly readings recorded on an automatic tide gauge from 1915 to 1921. Hands up those who knew that. However, there is no need to define sea level further as the amendments would require. All the land will in due course be mapped by the countryside bodies.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 would restrict the definition of mountain in clause 1(2) to land more than 600m high. We think that some land under that height has the characteristics of mountains. Mountains do not suddenly start at 2,000ft. The amendment would mean that such land could not be mapped as open country by the countryside bodies unless it fell within one of the other categories such as moor or heath. Amendment No. 21 would go even further by removing mountain from the right of access entirely.
<P>
With respect to amendment No. 143, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was correct in his intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> As this will be a long Committee I should mention the right way to pronounce Frome, otherwise I might find things difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I unequivocally apologise. I once went on television to discuss a part of my constituency where there had been some trouble, which I referred to as Glodwick. About a week later I met the chief superintendent of police at a reception. He said, ``I have lived here all my life and never heard of Glodwick. Did you mean `Glodick'?''
<P>
Amendment No. 143 would define mountain to include land below 600m as specified by the countryside body. However, clause 1(2) defines mountain to include any land over 600m, but does not exclude all land below that height. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle will accept that the Bill already encompasses the purpose of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister's comments do not entirely allay my concerns. First, he said, rightly, that much mountain land over 600m is already available for public access through various bodies such as the National Trust. That is fine and nothing that we propose would put a stop to it. In some ways that negates the rest of the Minister's argument. If the land is open anyway, there seems to be less advantage in rushing to deal with the remaining areas of mountain prior to mapping. We are concerned that people will assume that all mountain is immediately open, whether or not there is legitimate access to it. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy supported that point when I made it earlier.
<P>
I fear that in saying that land close to 600m tends not to be cultivated the Minister showed a lack of understanding. As I said, cultivation does not necessarily mean ploughing, rolling and drilling. Grassland, even permanent grassland, is a crop. It is often fertilised and sprayed, and it may even be harrowed—all activities that the agriculture industry strongly contends to be forms of cultivation. Those activities are important in order to maximise the yield of grass, whether it is used for silage, as suggested by the hon. Member for Meiriommydd Nant Conwy, for grazing or for making hay. They are just as important for growing grass as for cultivating wheat or potatoes, and they most certainly can take place up to 600m. I fear that the Minister is working under a misunderstanding about the precise form of cultivation that can take place in those hills and mountains.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We must consider not only what the law says but the public's perception of the law. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire, the Minister said that he accepted that some land might not be available until the access issue was clarified. We may agree about that, but I am not sure that the general public will accept it. Access to mountains will be considered a general right. Bearing in mind the fact that much mountain land is accessible, I do not see what is to be gained by enshrining that in law fairly immediately—in any event prior to mapping. There is much to be lost, however, including good will between the farming community and those who want to walk on the mountains. Indeed, the public will find themselves operating under misunderstandings that could be exacerbated by opening up the rest of the mountain land in this country before the other access issues are dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend highlights a curious logical inconsistency in the Minister's argument. The Minister correctly said that much land over 600m is open because of rights of way. The only land that is not open will therefore be land currently surrounded by land that is not access land, so the Bill refers specifically to land that currently is not otherwise accessible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely right. I hope that the Minister has taken the point on board, as it supports my case.
<P>
I am not satisfied with the Minister's response. I do not know whether he wants to try again to satisfy me about cultivation and about the public's perception of what may be open to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I may complicate matters slightly. Silage crops cannot be gathered and hay cannot be cut if they have been walked upon. I urge the Minister, through the hon. Gentleman, to consider again the option of allowing only linear access across such land for some time, possibly with appropriate signage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right, which shows that Opposition Members may have a slightly wider understanding than Government Members of all aspects of agriculture, including the fact that grass is as much a crop as anything else. Footpaths across grassland, official or otherwise, can seriously damage the farmers' ability to harvest it for silage or hay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for North Wiltshire make two points. First, they say that there is already sufficient access to mountains and that there is little to be gained from extending access to areas above 600m where there is not already a historic right of access. I do not know how much land is involved, but I believe that it is worth extending access to land that is above 600m even though some of it—but I suspect not most of it—may already be subject to access.
<P>
The issue of cultivated land and silage, which the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned, is more controversial and requires further thought. Cultivated land appears in schedule 1. It would be better to discuss the interpretation of cultivated land and its use when we reach that debate. I have, however, listened to the reasonable points that were raised. There is no question of access over hay fields or silage grass in the first place. We would not expect such land to be mapped as open country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Does the Minister accept that the basis of the argument is not whether land over 600m should be open to access, but whether it should be open to access in advance of the mapping process and there being a satisfactory means of access? It is sheer nonsense to suggest that land is open to access when there is no way of reaching it because it is surrounded by cultivated land, which is often the case in Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. We are discussing the fast-track process. Land that is surrounded by open country may be inaccessible, and that will limit the application of the process. My single point—I do not want to stress this too strongly—is that it is worthwhile to fast track access to some land that is above 600m to which there is no historic right of access, but which is not surrounded by cultivated land. That is what we are proposing. I am not persuaded that it would be better to exclude that land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister has tried to convince us, but I do not agree with him. He is right to say that we can deal with the issue of cultivation when we debate schedule 1, and I suspect that our discussion on that will be wide ranging. However, he did not properly respond to the problem of public perception. Large areas of grass, which are often surrounded by a stone wall or fence, are cultivated, but many people will think that they are suitable for walking over. Once the public are told that all mountain areas are open, they could feel justified in walking to them. That is why the matter is so important.
