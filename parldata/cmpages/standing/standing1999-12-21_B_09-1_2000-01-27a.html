<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 18, line 16, leave out from `if' to end of line 21 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`its disclosure would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion, including:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 136, in page 18, line 24, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) In seeking to claim an exemption under subsection (1) the public authority must at all times have regard to the overriding public interest in the publication of facts and analysis of the facts which the Government considers relevant and important in framing major policy proposals and decisions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 137, in page 18, leave out lines 27 to 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Committee must seriously consider three issues in the clause, which is inadequate as drafted. In terms of marshalling thinking, the first issue is the exemption of the formulation of Government policy under subsection (1), which is too widely drawn. Amendments Nos. 134 and 137 would improve the clause considerably.
<P>
The second issue, with which we shall deal further in the next debate, is that the exemption needs a harm or prejudice test. It is implicit in amendment No. 134 that such a harm test would be included. In other words, it is not an either or situation, although either option would be better than the present drafting. Thirdly, we must include a public interest test for the release of facts that is stronger than that in clause 13(5), which we have already debated.
<P>
The Bill will provide a class exemption for policy formulation. That means that any information in that category will be covered by the exemption whether or not its release would be harmful. As public authorities or Ministers ultimately decide whether the release of exempt information is in the public interest, the exemption would mean that access to such information could be severely limited.
<P>
It is especially important that subsection (1) rows back from provisions in the code of practice and the White Paper. Under subsection (1), Ministers will effectively be given carte blanche to deny access to innocuous and non-controversial information. That could mean that information that is available now would be made secret. That is unacceptable. In fact, the Government's proposals will end the right to that category of information, rather than provide it.
<P>
The proposed wording of the code in amendment No. 134 is more limited. For example, subsection (1)(d) includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the operation of any Ministerial private office''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in the absolute exemption, with no harm test. That is a scandalous proposal, given that there is no prejudice test. That point will be made more forcefully when we come to the relevant amendments.
<P>
Our key point is that information currently available under the code will become secret under the Bill. Subsection (l)(d) is a classic example of that. The code does not exclude the operation of a Minister's private office, and it exempts only confidential communications between Departments and Ministers. I stress the word confidential. There is no confidential nature to subsection (1)(b), which simply refers to ``Ministerial communications'', so any communications between Ministers will be covered by that blanket exemption with no prejudice test.
<P>
Worse still, a Minister's decision under the code not to release information that it suggests ought to have been released could be reviewed by the parliamentary ombudsman. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that no Minister would relish the ombudsman's finding that some matter that related to information about the development of Government policy had been withheld when it should have been released.
<P>
In spite of it critics, the code has teeth. No one suggests that it is perfect, and we shall soon discuss how enforcement provisions should be structured. As there is no prejudice test in the clause and because the exemption is so wide, the Minister will decide whether to release information. There is no enforcement of any kind. Under the code, one can at least tell the parliamentary ombudsman that the code has been breached. There is no obligation on the Minister to release information, partly because of the prejudice test but, in relation to the amendment, especially because the exemption is far too widely drawn.
<P>
Many organisations have criticised the Bill's drafting. Under an amendment to clause 13 that was linked to an amendment to this clause, we discussed the need to provide for the release of information that advises Ministers on the formulation or development of policy, rather than of the advice itself.
<P>
The facts and figures or dates on which decisions were taken, which are freely available under the code, should be available under the Bill.
<P>
To try to rectify that shortfall and criticism, the Government included in clause 13(5) a requirement for a public authority to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have regard to the desirability of communicating to the applicant factual information which has been used, or is intended to be used, to provide an informed background to decision-taking.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress the word desirability—for whom? ``That is not a prejudice test; nor is it a public interest test. Amendment No. 136 seeks to add an additional caveat on the exercise of that provision. Its overriding public interest in the publication and release of such information is far stronger than the provisions of subsection (5), which talks only of desirability.
<P>
I want to keep our proceedings strictly in line with the order of consideration, so I shall not stray any further into arguments about section 33 requiring a prejudice test. Our primary objective is to narrow the material caught under that exemption to that caught under the code. The Government have widened that provision considerably, which is not acceptable.
<P>
Our debate on amendment No. 136 enables us to speak of a public interest test on the release of factual information that has informed decision taking, rather than relying on the rather weak provisions that the Government introduced at a late stage. Indeed, we believe that those provisions are in the wrong clause. The Bill should allow a public interest test, not only a test of desirability.
<P>
Finally, just for the sake of tidiness, amendment No. 137 would omit the definitions of law officers, ministerial communications and so on. That provision is consequential on subsection (1). Because our amendments do not refer to them, such definitions are unnecessary. The clause does not progress the cause of freedom of information. On the contrary, it is possibly the most glaring example in the Bill of the extent to which the proposed statutory framework rows back from the provisions of the code.
<P>
The clause makes more information secret, but it is information at the heart of Government, not in many of the more peripheral public authorities caught under the Bill. This is a fundamental matter. We are entitled to some give from the Minister. I have tried to be concise, and not to detain the Committee unnecessarily, but the Minister and his officials should recognise that our concerns are justified, and it is time that we saw some movement. We have moved a sensible amendment that would achieve what the Government say they want: the freeing of more information—not making it more secret, as clause 33 does.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I rise briefly to support the views expressed by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). He is absolutely right: this is a critical clause, and a critical test of the Government's intentions. We shall come later to a more substantive debate on the prejudice test and its application to clause 33. It would be out of order to stray into that debate now, but at the very least the provisions of the Bill should meet the present requirements of the code of practice.
<P>
I share the hon. Gentleman's view that the Bill does not yet meet such requirements; I share his view that the provisions of clause 33 should be strengthened; and I share his view that the Government should make clear to the Information Commissioner that the clause should be interpreted in the public interest. I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply. I hope that he will respond slightly more helpfully than we have become used to. He must recognise the Committee's concerns that the Bill needs improvement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): Like the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. David Heath), I shall be brief. Most of my concerns should properly be raised under an amendment of mine, and I hope that we shall have the opportunity to discuss it later this afternoon. However, I do not want to burden the Committee with a tedious repetition of the general points that arise under both amendments.
<P>
It may not necessarily be helpful to the Parliamentary Secretary, but he ought to know before he replies to the debate that the concerns that were raised by the hon. Member for Ryedale and supported by the Liberal Democrats are more widely shared. I certainly share them all. This is one of the most problematic and misconceived parts of the Bill, and a part that will have to be changed. I do not know whether opening the door to such change will be in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief, which I am sure will be headed, ``Resist: a difficult area.'' However, he ought to be aware of the widespread concerns both in Committee and outside.
<P>
The clause is unnecessarily restrictive. Everybody shares the Government's ambition that interministerial discussions, analyses, debates and options, and advice from civil servants, should be exempt. Of course they should be exempt; government cannot continue unless it is exempt. ``However, the Bill catches so much else. If we are to widen public understanding of how Governments make decisions and to further the Government's proper ambitions for greater participation in our political processes, it is not only desirable but necessary to make such information public.
<P>
I hope to return to these matters under a later amendment, but I thought it wise to put down a marker, so that when he replies, the Parliamentary Secretary will know that although the Committee is not hostile, our great concern will not go away—unless, of course, he opens the door to conciliation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> It is a pleasure to be under your chairmanship, Dr. Clark. I have been asked by several hon. Members to recognise the concerns raised in the debate. I readily do so. As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, amendments Nos. 134 and 137 would draw on the wording of the present non-statutory code of practice for access to Government information. They would require a prejudice-based test for disclosure that is based on such wording, in place of the class exemption that the Government believe is right for such information.
<P>
I draw the attention of members of the Committee to what is and, by implication, what is not within the terms of the clause. Class exemption refers only to information that relates to the formulation or development of Government policy, ministerial communications, provision of advice by any of the Law Officers or any request for the provision of such advice, or the operation of any ministerial private office.
<P>
We have rehearsed such issues many times in Committee, when considering the recommendations following pre-legislative scrutiny, and in the general debate on the Bill and its underlying principles. It may be helpful if I refer first to the extent of discussion as a sign of the Government's commitment to free and open debate. The thorough and detailed pre-legislative scrutiny process shows precisely the type of open government that will occur for the first time under this Government—and I hope that all members of the Committee consider that it has produced a better Bill.
<P>
We have listened to what has been said and we have responded to the criticisms that we have heard. That is why information that does not relate directly to the core issues set out in the clause, but which none the less has an impact on the conduct of public affairs, is subject to a prejudice-based exemption rather than a class exemption. I have no doubt that we shall be discussing clause 34 at some length, so I shall not say anything more about that part of the Bill now, but concentrate instead on the class exemption under clause 33.
<P>
Clause 33 deals only with material that is at the centre of the formulation or development of Government policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Where in the clause is the interesting provision that refers only to information at the centre? I do not accept that the provision is drafted in anything like as constrained a way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing attention to that. I shall explain. The formulation or development of Government policy clearly happens at the core. That is the purpose of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> It is an intriguing notion that such formulation or development happens only at the core. It seems that the words are infinitely expandable on a ministerial say-so. I do not understand why the Minister says that the Bill means what it clearly does not mean.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Let me give the hon. Gentleman an example. The formulation or development of Government policy is clearly different from the management issues that arise when that policy has been agreed to by Parliament and brought into effect. The well publicised problems of the Child Support Agency that we inherited were substantial management, structural and legislative difficulties. Any information or documents concerned with the working out of practical, legislative and administrative problems associated with the Child Support Agency would be outside the clause.
<P>
There is an interministerial debate on the correct way of restructuring policy in order to introduce legislation that would cure such problems in a reformed CSA. Clearly, that is an area of policy development in which a Government need to consider, test advice, go from one Department to another and formulate policy in private. When policy is clearly formulated, it can be published as a Green Paper or a White Paper, for example. So there is a difference between the management difficulties of the existing CSA, which will come outside the scope of the clause, and the important discussions, which by their nature must be private, that the Government have held to attempt to devise a better system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Minister has chosen an interesting example. I do not see the clarity on which he insists. From the moment that the Government announced a review of the arrangements for the CSA and Baroness Hollis started gathering information, all the information that had previously been available could conceivably—not necessarily—have been said to fall within the definition of exempt information, and the Minister could do nothing to stop that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to correct some misconceptions. I know, as do all hon. Members, where their local CSA is situated and what it undertakes. I have no doubt that the management information and the analysis of case work umdertaken at the Dudley centre which my constituents use would continue to be defined as that not covered by clause 33. However, if the management at Dudley, based on its knowledge of its own operations, were asked to submit a report or recommendations to the review team led by my right Friend Baroness Hollis, that information would, from that time, stop being management information and information on the day-to-day working of the previous system of child support, and become advice to Ministers, which would, rightly, come within the structure of policy advice to Ministers and therefore within clause 33(1)(a). The fact that a piece of management information may be included in that submission—perhaps as an appendix—would not mean that a previously available free-standing piece of information would suddenly be cloaked in secrecy. It plainly would not. However, documents or information that arise specifically in connection with the development and the formulation of policy are rightly within that cloak of secrecy, to allow space for the Government to develop their policy. I hope that that provides the hon. Gentleman with the reassurance that he needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Not remotely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have listened with interest to the Minister and I am as gobsmacked by what he has said as the hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and for Somerton and Frome. He is inviting members of the Committee to conclude that his analysis of even the title of the clause ``Formulation of Government policy''—on which I did not concentrate earlier is wholly different to what most people think it means. The Government may have decided on their policy on the Child Support Agency, but is the hon. Gentleman saying that there will be no further discussion on changes to that policy? The previous Government changed the structure of the CSA, so the allowances also changed. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that is simply part of the management? Surely the Government should continue to monitor and review the performance of their policy.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Let me give an example that is slightly closer to home. Various issues have been raised in Committee, and either I or my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary have agreed that there may be some merit in the arguments, so we have undertaken to consider whether to table amendments on Third Reading to meet those concerns. Our statements have been welcomed by the Committee. It will not be an enormous surprise if I say that the practical consequence of such undertakings is that civil servants rightly prepare policy advice and look at the options. There is ministerial correspondence, instructions to parliamentary draftsmen, returned drafts from parliamentary draftsmen and, no doubt, further advice will be sought. Through that process, a decision is reached and amendments will be tabled on Third Reading.
<P>
I suggest that that process is rightly concerned with policy development and should be secret. It would not be appropriate if, when one Minister or Department raised concerns, which were then overruled by another Department, for that information to become public. When policy is developed, as can happen in Committee, it will be carried out within the terms of the class exemption. That must be right.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said many times that he accepts that there is a case for further consideration of background facts, which are associated with policy development, and has said that he will consider whether there is room for further amendment. That work is continuing as a consequence of my hon. Friend's statement. It would not be right for the people outside the cloak of Government to have access to all the different views and advice that is given following a ministerial statement that a matter will be considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister is, inadvertently, I am sure, answering a completely different point. He is referring to the process of government, rather than the information that leads to all those different areas. Nobody with any experience of how these things work wants the process of discussions—either inter-ministerial or between Minister and civil servant—to be opened. That would make government impossible, or so fraught as to drive everything further underground. No other regime in the world gives access to such matters.
<P>
The data—the factual information on which decisions are made—are a completely different matter. The Minister refutes a suggestion that has not been made by the hon. Member for Ryedale in his amendments. He has not said that the process should be open but has confined himself to the information on the raw material. I know that it is difficult to distinguish one from the other, but it is by no means impossible. Unless we so distinguish, the Bill will turn out to be hopelessly wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend and hear what he says. It is of course right that in many cases, based on factual information, the Government will continue to work on policy. If they do so, it is right that the information relating to policy development will be covered by the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is, exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend's point, but I am not in a position to give an undertaking today. If the Bill were already enacted and I was asked whether there were documents relating to the issue, I would invoke section 33(2), saying that I was not required to answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I want to make a brief intervention now, but I shall try to catch your eye again, Dr. Clark.
<P>
If there are documents in the Home Office that are being used to formulate further amendments to the Bill, I should not have thought that the Minister would have much difficulty in arguing the public interest case. He can ensure that the Government frames legislation properly, while protecting the publication of those documents until such time as we have finished our proceedings. I entirely understand the Minister's concerns, but they are covered by both my amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> We are straying a little from the amendment, but let me put down a marker. The Bill is about information. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) sought disclosure of background information. There is a danger that disclosure of information in isolation might undermine the process of policy development in some cases. The distinction between background information and policy development might be clear in theory but impossible to make in practice because of the structure of Government documents, which mix the two concepts. It may not be possible to draw the distinction in such a way that would lead to the disclosure of large amounts of useful information. However, I have heard what my hon. Friend has said and I am prepared to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is gracious of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary. He makes a fine point in saying that it could undermine the process and that the distinction is hard, or even impossible, to make in practice. I agree that this is not an easy area, which is precisely why my amendment, which we shall come to later, would insert a harm test to sift one from the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I accept my hon. Friend's point and I will return to it when we debate the amendment.
<P>
The White Paper acknowledged that the integrity of decision making and policy advice in government requires greater protection than other interests, and proposed a simple harm test. Amendment No. 134 seeks to establish that, using the form of words currently applied in the non-statutory code of practice for access to Government information. However, it is necessary to examine dispassionately the effect of introducing a harm test for that core information.
<P>
It is generally acknowledged that the Government must have time and space to evaluate policy options. That view is shared by all Committee members. The premature disclosure of information in those areas can only hamper and, in some—perhaps even most—instances, prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. It follows that, for a significant proportion of the information falling into that category, disclosure will never be justifiable, even under a harm test. It would be dishonest to pretend otherwise.
<P>
The amendment would delete from the Bill specific reference to information relating to the provision of advice by law officers and the operation of a ministerial private office, the latter being concerned with ministerial activity and policy determination. As a result, it is not clear whether such information would be afforded protection. It is important to retain protection for that information. That would not be so under amendment No. 134, so we cannot accept it.
<P>
On amendment No. 136, the Government have recognised the concern that factual and background information relating to policy decisions should, in some instances, be disclosed. Amendment No. 136 would provide for public authorities to have regard to the overriding public interest in the publication of such material. However, the Government expect that most information of that kind will be disclosed under the Bill. I remind Committee members that clause 13(5) refers to the desirability of disclosing factual information that has been used, or is intended to be used, to provide an informed background to decision making. We believe that it is appropriate to refer to the public interest in subsection (5). Indeed, clause 13 applies to clause 33. As I said, we are considering whether clause 13 can be improved so that it addresses the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, which I accept, are genuine.
<P>
Let me draw another matter to the attention of Committee members. The hon. Member for Ryedale asked whether I agreed that criticism from the Information Commissioner would be likely to affect ministerial activity. I agree entirely: indeed, it is the present position under the non-statutory code and compliance is ensured by the knowledge that a Minister would not readily accept criticism from the parliamentary ombudsman. The hon. Gentleman's comments demonstrate that an official, independent body putting pressure on Government or Ministers may, by the power of criticism, ensure that the right thing is done.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for a statutory Information Commissioner who has the power of recommendation and is in a position to give recommendations. The hon. Gentleman said that the parliamentary ombudsman's criticism has a powerful effect. What he said suggests the right procedure to follow, and I am grateful for his support.
<P>
As I have said many times, the amendments would be unhelpful to the day-today work of Government. Not only would they put at risk the effective discharge of public affairs, they would add nothing to the public domain that would not be disclosed under the Bill. Indeed, they could be counterproductive. If the amendments were accepted, discussion of policy might be conducted orally to avoid the disclosure of information under the Bill, with the resulting loss of an audit trail. We must be practical and sensible if we want the Government to develop good policy and to ensure the maximum openness. As I said, we believe that we must frame exemptions in a way that instils confidence in those against whom they will be applied, but at the same time we must not lose sight of the Bill's purpose: to open up Government to the maximum practical extent.
<P>
In the light of those observations—particularly my assurance that we are considering factual information—I encourage the hon. Member for Ryedale to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Not for the first time, the Parliamentary Secretary says that he recognises our strength of feeling; the Under-Secretary, who sadly cannot be with us, has often said the same thing. I get the impression that although the door is not locked shut to an amendment, no sooner do we turn the handle, open the door and peep inside than it is closed again. I am not sure that we have made much progress towards the commitment that we wanted, despite graciously expressing our desire. While these are issues about which we profoundly disagree, we are still managing to conduct our affairs in as friendly a way as possible.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that the wording of our amendment, which is in the code, would make this class of exemption too narrow. I hear what he says. I would not be too upset if he came back with an amendment that was similar to amendment No. 134 but which included advice by Law Officers. I did not even refer to that aspect of subsection (1), so perhaps we should have drafted our amendment a little more carefully. However, two extremely important differences between the code and the Bill are still hanging in the air. I shall set aside the harm test issue for a moment.
<P>
First, while subsection (1) refers to ``Ministerial communications'', amendment No. 134 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``confidential communications between departments, public bodies and regulatory bodies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps I may cite two examples. During the early part of 1996 there were—to my knowledge as a humble parliamentary private secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—a number of communications circulated between the Department of Health and MAFF relating to BSE. Some may have needed to be confidential and perhaps should have been caught, but I cannot believe that all those communications deserve the protection of this blanket exemption.
<P>
Let me provide a more recent example. When the President of China visited London not long ago—some would say in the previous century, but it was certainly last year—some demonstrators were arrested by the police. Several questions were asked on the Floor of the House of Commons and in written questions about what advice was given to the Metropolitan police. I would like to think that if there were any ministerial communications between the Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, information about them would be released to a Member of this House of Commons—unless it was reasonable to claim that the information should be kept confidential. However, whether it is confidential is not caught by the clause, which refers only to ministerial communications. We charge that that is too wide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman accept that the key issue in his example is less Government discussions than instructions, advice or pressure on the police? Under clause 33, communications between the Home Secretary and the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis would not fall under the class exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I do accept that, but I am sure that another exemption could be found somewhere in the Bill. I part company with the Minister over our amendments, especially on the code, which are better than his Bill because they allow for confidential communications between the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
<P>
They do so because they allow for confidential communication between Departments, public bodies and regulatory bodies.
<P>
They have been thought through more sensibly, which is why the accent is on the word confidential.
<P>
We do not wish to detain the Committee unnecessarily, and we shall continue debating some of the issues in the next group of amendments, but before we wind up the present debate, will the Minister clarify whether adding ``confidential'' would be an improvement? He spoke about management as an example of what is not caught by the exemption. I understand his point, but it can be construed in many different ways, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome observed.
<P>

which the Minister suggested would catch only confidential discussion of work in a Minister's private office. However, that phrase is open to much wider interpretation: it could include the management of the Minister's private office, embracing private advisers and others employed by the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman touches on an important point. I wonder whether he shares my view that, at one point, the Minister saw beyond his brief and recognised points from both sides of the Room. The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is exempt information if it relates to''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
open to interpretation. It is not the proper, narrow construction that he was required to put to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is precisely the conclusion that I have drawn, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider management as part of the operation issues and to accept that that goes beyond his explanation of why the provision is necessary.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary talked about pre-legislative scrutiny, but we should consider the force of the Public Administration Committee's argument. In its first report of this Session—its follow-up to the publication of the Bill—it expressed grave disappointment that the information, facts and analysis that inform Government policy will not be more freely available than is likely under the Bill.
<P>
The annexe to the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Committee recommended a reduction in the protection given to information on the formulation or development of Government policy. The Government has not accepted this.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could not be more clear.
<P>
In fairness, we are talking essentially about two issues. I did not mean to discuss the harm test in this debate, although the amendment would introduce such a test. We wanted to raise two issues, the first of which is the wording used to define the classes of material that will be exempt. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that that needs fresh thinking and fine tuning. I can be more charitable about the second point. I am grateful to him for confirming that strengthening the public interest test is at least being considered, perhaps so that the facts, data and information that have informed Government policy, rather than information relating to the formulation of that policy, can be released. A clear distinction can be drawn between those types of information. On Second Reading, the Home Secretary suggested that such a distinction could not be drawn, but several experienced people, including Lord Burns, have commented that it would be perfectly possible to do so if that brief was given to officials.
<P>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will think again about the scope of the exemption. We are grateful that he is thinking again about the public interest test on the availability of information that has informed policy. I am also grateful that he is willing to respond now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> My ministerial colleagues and I will read the report of this afternoon's debate and reflect on it, but I give no undertaking as to where those reflections will lead. However, we do not accept that clause 33(1) is as widely drawn as has been suggested. For example, contrary to what has been said, subsection (1)(d) will not cover special advisers, because advisers are not provided by Departments and will, therefore, not come under the exemption. Only matters that relate to such advisers that also relate to the work of a ministerial private office will be covered. Advisers are not paid for from the ministerial private office and will therefore not be covered by subsection (1)(d). Only the activities of Government advisers in giving advice to Ministers through the private office would be so covered, not their terms of engagement or what they do in other aspects of their work for the Minister.
<P>
I have heard what hon. Member for Ryedale has said, and we shall reflect on it. At present, however, we are not persuaded that the scope of the class exemption is wide than is reasonably necessary, Nevertheless, we shall reflect carefully on the matter, and on that basis I invite him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It was worth pressing the matter further, and I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for that explanation. We, too, will consider the matter. I am tempted to say that, fairly soon, unless the Government table their own amendment, they will have to introduce a provision that is pretty close to one that we shall have tabled, because we shall run out of ideas about how to achieve what we need. I suspect that the ninth of 10 is about to come up in the next group. To be as charitable as possible, I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for saying that he will reflect on the debate. He has added to the expectation that some concession will have to be made on Report, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 18, line 16, leave out `it relates to' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 147, in page 18, line 16, leave out `it relates to', and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`its disclosure under this Act would, or would be likely to, harm'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 60, in page 18, line 24, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if its disclosure under this Act would or would be likely to, prejudice any of the matters referred to in that subsection.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The last word of the amendment, ``prejudice'', is at its crux. The amendment would introduce a harm test into each of the class exemptions that remove the right of access to all information that relates to the formulation and development of Government policy, ministerial communications, the provision of advice by any of the Law Officers or a request for the provision of such advice, and the operation of a ministerial private office.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary may have gained the impression from the previous debate that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee believe that the clause is badly drafted. I sometimes think that it is symptomatic of the Government's attitude to the Bill to give access reluctantly or so cautiously as to be almost selfdefeating and, when in doubt about how much to give, to restrict access as far as is possible and consistent with fulfilling their manifesto pledge to legislate on freedom of information—a commitment that, I sense, the Government, and especially No. 10 Downing street, wish had never been made and that will be redeemed in only the most minimal and cautious way. I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on that last point, but that is how I view the situation.
<P>
The amendment would make access to information subject to a harm test. A harm test will be a great deal easier to prove for some exemptions than for others. In many instances, it will be fairly easy to demonstrate by a harm test that the disclosure of information that relates to the formulation of Government policy would not prejudice good government. In terms of ministerial communications, it would be easy to show by a harm test that good government probably would be prejudiced. Although one could imagine certain forms of communication between Ministers that would pass a harm test and to which access would be granted, that would be quite a small class of information. It would be hard to prove that the public should have access to most ministerial communications. The same applies to the operation of any ministerial private office. So much of what takes place in a private office should, of course, be confidential so that the Government can work.
<P>
For both matters, the Bill's drafting, in catching the properly sensitive and private communications between Ministers and civil servants, would catch totally anodyne ones. We would be back in the nonsensical days of the Government's secrecy about matters such as the number of private secretaries in a Minister's private office or the length of time taken to deal with correspondence. That is not in any sense vulnerable or sensitive information, but relates to day-to-day, routine matters. It ought to be public knowledge in most circumstances, subject to a harm test, but would be caught by the exemption.
<P>
With that slight proviso about anodyne information, I agree with the Minister that such matters should be exempt. Few applications would pass a harm test. Subsection (1)(c),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provision of advice by . . . Law Officers'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is altogether more difficult. That subject is arguably often sensitive, and I have great sympathy with Governments who are always cautious about letting their legal advice be seen—not least because it is usually given only when the Government have to negotiate their way through something. Release of such information would be prejudicial to Government, and so would not be released even if a harm test were in place.
<P>
There have been a few painful times for Governments—I can think of only three or four during my 17 years in the House—when legal advice is important to satisfy the House and the public that the Government are acting legally. Release of such advice ought to have a chance of passing a harm test, so there should not be as blanket an exemption as at present. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) will remember the question of whether the takeover of The Times should have been referred to an inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry. That must have been 10 years ago. The Conservative Government resisted an inquiry but a debate on it was led on the Floor of the House by the late John Smith, who was then Member for Monklands, East. We, in the then official Opposition, and the Liberal Democrats, agreed that we needed to see the legal advice on which the Government rejected an inquiry. We all doubted whether it was strong or conclusive, but the fact that we could not get at it was frustrating.
<P>
I am not sure that the then Government behaved properly or well in that instance. The Times was such am important and powerful national newspaper that, in the public interest, we should have been satisfied that the Government had good legal reasons and solid advice on which to base their rejection, even of an inquiry. On such occasions, legal advice can be desirable, hence the harm test, but the release of legal advice will probably fail most harm tests due to the relationship of that advice to negotiations and other matters.
<P>
I should stress to the Minister—this relates to my intervention on the previous group of amendments—that no question arises about information. As the Bill is drafted, no information in any of the four categories would have to be disclosed. If the Bill passes unamended, there would be no presumption in favour of openness; on the contrary, it would be in favour of secrecy. Ministers would not need to show that disclosure would be harmful. They would not have to meet any test other than show that the information fell within one of the four classes. Between them, the exemptions permit the development of policy to take place behind closed doors, in total secrecy.
<P>
Do the Government, committed, as they say they are, to opening up government and improving its quality, really want legislation that provides that everything to do with policy and its development, and even the information on which it is based, be totally secret unless we say that it should not be? I cannot believe that that is the Parliamentary Secretary's intention. I suspect that, when he drifts off his brief and allows his own reasonableness, charm and intelligence to play on the subject and guide him instead—as with clause 13, almost always he slides into sympathy, if not absolute agreement, with those of us who want to amend the Bill, which makes him a charming person to deal with, although I am not disarmed by his charm—he will, as invariably he does, allow himself to come up with the right commonsense approach, which of course is not as black and white or categoric as the Bill's wording allows. I cannot invite the Minister to stray along those lines: while complimenting him with one part of that remark I reprimand him with the other. Understandably, at the moment, he is sticking far too closely to a misguided brief.
<P>
If we leave the clause as it is, the only basis on which disclosure might take place would be discretionary, on public interest grounds—by reference, as he said, to clause 13(5). It was interesting that during discussion of that clause, there was another good example of the Minister going off message—off his brief—and coming to a sensible conclusion about the relationship between clauses 13 and 21, but then deciding that perhaps he had gone a little too far in amending the Bill himself and, the following day, graciously recanting of his reasonable intelligence. That illustrates the point, but I shall not go back over that debate.
<P>
The provisions do not target civil service advice, let alone sensitive advice. Nothing that crosses the desks of Ministers or their advisers in connection with policy formulation would have to be disclosed. Even after decisions had been taken they would all be subject to a harm test. That is both sensible and right; it is the only reasonable way to proceed. If an applicant did not have a sufficiently good case to pass the scrutiny of a prejudice or harm test, it would be desirable to go along with the exemption. The harm test at least allows greater flexibility, as well as the sieving of distinctions between simple and anodyne information and information whose release would be genuinely prejudicial to good government, which is precisely the Parliamentary Secretary's point.
<P>
The Minister has accepted that there are widespread anxieties about the implications of clause 33. Factual information on which decisions are based, scientific advice and, I suspect, modest exchanges between of officials on minor matters—or most of them—would be edited out by a harm test, as would submissions from lobbyists, who would be covered by the provision. So it is not a question of hard factual information alone. The latter are anodyne matters and it ought to be within our wit to distinguish between them and genuinely prejudicial information and advice.
<P>
The implies that any public insight into the workings of Government is by definition likely to be damaging. The Minister, as a reasonable man, will realise that that sentence does not bear scrutiny. It cannot be true that every glimpse of what happens in Government is damaging, but that is what the clause now says. It takes no account of the fact that such insights might lead to better, more informed debate and better understanding of complex decisions, or might reassure the public that issues are being thoroughly examined and weaknesses in the Government's thinking or legislation exposed. The Government themselves are committed to improving the quality of government. The White Paper ``Modernising Government'' proposes a completely new approach towards government It urges
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``more new ideas, more willingness to question inherited ways of doing things, better use of evidence and research''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in policy making, but it is possible to demonstrate those things only if the clause is amended with the harm test. If it is not, this clause and clause 13 will introduce an absolute blanket prohibition that will undermine the admirable intentions set out in ``Modernising Government''. It goes against all our experience of what happens when Ministers use their discretion and allow information to go out.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us remember what the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done to transform the way that we look at matters that previously were not only incredibly sensitive in the development of macro-economic policy but led to Ministers having to resign. Now, the Chancellor, to his great credit, has opened up discussions: between them, my right hon. Friend and the previous Chancellor, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) have opened up the whole process of debate and discussion between the Bank of England and the Government, surely to the benefit of us all. There has been no weakening of the Government's case, nor, according to Mr. George, any inhibiting of the bank's actions. It has all been for the better understanding of Government policy. It is interesting that, even allowing for the pressure on the Government—although admittedly in the fairly calm international waters, touch wood, that we have had for the past two years or so—the pressure on macroeconomic policy has been far less acute than at any time that I can recall. Although it is not the clinching argument, the openness with which the bank and the Government operate in this area has contributed substantially. It has confirmed that the perceived dangers that lie behind the Government's timid and worried approach in their phrasing of the clause are wholly misconceived.
<P>
We have often had reason to refer to the Select Committee on Public Administration. I remind the Minister of what the Chairman of that Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I do not think that the House will think that that is the proper way to proceed. The barricades have gone up with a vengeance. Nobody denies that the Government need a thinking, deliberating space. They need a confidential arena in which policy discussions can take place and policy decisions be made. However, nobody should deny that there is equally a public interest in knowing the background information that shapes those policies. That is the key distinction which the Bill fails to recognise.''—[Official Report, 7 December 1999; Vol. 340, c.752.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister will be fair enough to recognise that the Home Secretary has been impressed with, and complimentary about, the responsible way in which the Chairman of the Select Committee approached the issue. I hope, following the Home Secretary's blanket compliment to my hon. Friend, that the Minister and his team will examine the detailed points that the Chairman of the Select Committee made, especially that one.
<P>
One has only to think about other key people who have a great deal of experience of the issue, who are by no means all well-known dangerous radicals. For instance, Lord Butler, the former Cabinet Secretary, told the House of Lords Select Committee that he had satisfied himself that a harm test was feasible. Indeed, the code of practice for open government already requires Departments to publish the facts and an analysis of the facts that underlie decisions. For all its weaknesses, that is another area in which the code of practice is right The Government are in danger of rowing back from that, through a timidity that does not stand up to inspection.
<P>
The second approach is the harm test, which is what we propose. I concede that some advice will need to be protected. It may not help to force untested and new ideas on to the public, particularly if those involved have not had time to consider whether proposals are desirable or feasible. Much Government work needs to mature before it is exposed to the public, but the information and the data on which decisions are made should be disclosed. One can distinguish one from the other—that which is properly disclosed and that which cannot be disclosed—by a harm test.
<P>
The Irish and the New Zealand freedom of information laws show that such an approach is practicable. I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary has used that word often, but from his reading of our debates when he was not able to be here, he will know that the Under-Secretary put great stress on the fact that the Bill must work. That is what we all want. We do not want it to be theoretical; we do not want it to satisfy only academics; we want it to be practical. The Irish and New Zealand laws show that simple words work. As far as I know, neither of those Governments have had problems in operating those laws. We would not know whether that was so if the Bill was enacted unamended, but I suspect that the Government have no evidence that New Zealand and Ireland have had terrible problems.
<P>
Indeed, according to a former New Zealand ombudsman, Nadja Tollemache, the New Zealand approach is 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to recognise that at certain stages of the policy making process information must be protected for the sake of the process. Those withholding provisions protect the process rather than the information''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a distinction that I made earlier. He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``But once the process has been completed it no longer requires confidentiality''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at least not to the same extent. He concluded by saying that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``then the emphasis frequently changes in favour of disclosure''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary must by now have got the point. He is a quick and intelligent man. Judging by our debate on the previous amendment, he understands where we are coming from and what we want to achieve. I have considerable sympathy for him, because he is constrained by his brief, but if he allows himself to think for himself he will see the good sense of what we propose.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has a poor case; I am sure that he will make great play of clause 13(5), and I welcome the fact that that provision is included in the Bill. Its relationship to clause 21 is non-existent; it relates only to clause 33. However, before he responds—before he elaborates on putting the two clauses together—I point out that the commissioner would be required to consider clause 33 and, under Pepper v. Hart, the Minister's reply to this and the previous debate. The commissioner will thus be forced to admit that that there is an exemption, and the onus of proof on which the commissioner would have to satisfy herself would be much higher. 
<P>
She would effectively have to overrule clause 33. She undoubtedly has the power, but no more, to recommend that under clause 13. It would be difficult for her to do so, and it would be necessary only in the most extreme examples. That is a far harder test and an unsatisfactory one.
<P>
If the commissioner made such a decision, the decision, ironically, would have to be made by Ministers who had decided that there should be a blanket exemption when they drafted the Bill. There is a hole in the bucket. It is a circular argument that exactly illustrates debate that we have had and will have again: the weak powers of the commissioner in difficult cases and her need to rely on Ministers is the wrong way to protect free information. I think that the Minister has my general drifting. I recommend it to his personal common sense rather than to the tender mercies of his brief, which I suspect says, ``Resist''.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): This is an important amendment to a rather pernicious clause. In the middle ages, the sovereign, from whom Government decisions flowed, would no doubt have regarded as lese-majesty a request to know the considerations that lay behind a Government decision. One has a sense of the middle ages projecting into our world when one hears the Government's arguments on the clause. They seem to be arguing in Norman French: le roy le veult. That is good enough for the public.
<P>
I believed that we have moved on a little. I thought that the Labour party had moved on a little and that it recognised that Government was for the people and by the people. I thought we had reached a point in the development of our democracy in which it is reasonable for people to participate in Government decision making. The Government should make decisions on the basis of the consideration of all the relevant facts. They should enjoy specialist advice, from people who are dedicated to giving advice, but they should also bear in mind the views of those in whose interests they purport to govern.
<P>
The reality is that, sadly, by closing the door to information about that process of government, the Government diminish the scope and value of the advice that can be tendered by the public. It is wrong to do that in a modern democracy. We hear a great deal from the Government about modernisation. In truth, they are perpetuating extraordinarily old-fashioned ways of taking decisions. There is nothing modern about categorising information that relates to the formulation and development of Government policy, as exempt under the Bill. This is not a modern provision. Indeed, it is very backward looking.
<P>
The idea that ministerial communications must automatically be regarded as exempt information and that what Ministers say to each other is not a matter that the public have any right to know about, however trivial it may be, smacks of the mediaeval court When the Ministers reflect on this, they will see that it is quite nonsensical so to fence themselves with protection that they elevate themselves to a position where their every thought and action is kept from public scrutiny. That is my philosophical objection to the clause and why I support the amendment, which adopts the rational and modern method of assessing the need for protection against the harm that it might do to release the information.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept that Government decision making cannot be conducted in a goldfish bowl, with every shift and turn in discussion being simultaneously disclosed. That plainly does not make sense but the effect of the clause goes far beyond the necessary protections of privacy of discussion. It goes far beyond what the Government thought necessary at an earlier stage of our deliberations on the Bill. At one stage, the exemption of these categories was not thought necessary at all. It was thought that a harm test would be sufficient. It is the strangest and most worrying example of how the Bill has been attenuated in its purpose and effect.
<P>
We are not making much progress, however, in prizing open the Government's thinking, I do not think that it has much to do with the force of the arguments that are being deployed. I would not want to exaggerate, but I have not heard many voices raised on the other side of the argument. Labour Members' quiescence, with the honourable and notable exception of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, has suggested not a modern but a timorous approach to legislation.
<P>
If the Minister does not have any decent arguments but has no discretion to move, we would all make much more rapid progress if he began by saying, ``I'm sorry, my instructions are clear. I'm going to do nothing about it and I have to tell you that you're whistling in the wind.'' That is how it has seemed as we have developed our arguments. I can remember many occasions when the advice of the Law Officers would have been of immense importance in helping decisions to be made about public policy and helping to explain why particular stands were being taken The provision in clause 33(1)(c) is most retrograde to our needs. The Law Officers are public officers. They sometimes even claim not to be acting in a partisan way but to be giving objective advice.
<P>
There is a famous story. I cannot vouch that it is true, but it was told to me by the late Mr. John Smith, the former Member of Parliament for Monklands, East, about whom the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central spoke. It concerned the time when he was travelling on an aeroplane from Glasgow to London with the newly appointed Lord Advocate, subsequently Lord Mackay of Clashfern, a Law Officer of the Crown. The then hon. Member for Monklands, East said, ``My good friend, I had no idea that you were a Conservative,'' to which Lord Mackay replied, ``Well, as a matter of fact, I am not.'' John Smith said, ``That is beyond credence. You are a member of the Government.'' Lord Mackay replied, ``But I am not a member of the Government; I am simply the Lord Advocate.''
<P>
John Smith riposted, ``You are not so naïve, James, that you do not understand that the Lord Advocate is, indeed, a Minister of the Crown.'' James Mackay said, ``Well, I hadn't really thought of it that way because it is an independent role.'' His view developed and, as he prospered under the aegis of Mrs. Thatcher and progressed into the Cabinet, there was less doubt in his mind about the nature of the beast. That is a telling reflection on the attitudes of Law Officers. They play the role of sometimes being genuinely independent and sometimes being members of the Adminstration, bound by the language of legislation such as the Bill to have sealed lips so that they cannot even reveal the advice that they have received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Surely the right hon. Gentleman will agree that, even when he reached the elevated heights of the Cabinet, Lord Mackay always retained an ironic and delightful independence. I would not want the right hon. Gentleman's words to be interpreted by anyone in the Committee to mean that Lord Mackey had ever been a party puppet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Unless Lord Mackay's irony is a secret to the state, I am not sure how it can be relevant to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I have to admit, Dr. Clark, that I have been trying out a different line of argument on the amendment to see if we can open up the Government's thinking.
<P>
Many officers of the Crown claim to give independent advice, yet they will have to operate under the rubric of the clause—the public will not be entitled to see what they say. Indeed, the public are debarred from seeing it. Such a position is untenable and we shall have to look again at the role of the Law Officers. If they are just becoming kept dogs to bark in the way required by the Government, the duality of their role will disappear entirely. I hope that such a development will be seen as retrograde.
<P>
Clause 33(1)(d) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the operation of any Ministerial private office''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was nonplussed by what the Parliamentary Secretary said about special advisers. If they do not have contact with ministerial private offices, with whom do they have contact? Do they float around Departments? I do not imagine that they are all that welcome in other less ministerially dominated parts. Rivalling the civil servants for the affections of the permanent secretary seems an improbable role for the special adviser. So much goes on in the ministerial private office. When the Parliamentary Secretary is in a frolicsome frame of mind, he might decide to visit my constituency, although that is unlikely because his writ does not run there. None the less, if he paid a ministerial visit to Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, I dare say that he, or his private secretary, would observe the usual courtesies by informing the sitting Member of Parliament of his intentions—but the disclosure of his plans and his time of arrival would be exempt information. It is preposterous that the law has to be as exclusive as that, and that we are not being allowed to consider definitions that would enable serious discussion and consideration on drawing lines between information that is damaging and prejudicial and that which anyone should be able to invite.
<P>
I hope that whoever is calling the shots in the debate is deliberating on those matters and that we will have second and better thoughts. The matters will undoubtedly be reconsidered later in the Bill. I cannot believe that they will go without comment in another place, but I would profoundly prefer it if the required changes are made by the elected House—and, indeed, by the Committee. I do not have much confidence that he will do so, but I hope that the Minister will surprise us all on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I will not even begin to attempt to match the eloquence of the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and the entertaining way in which he has, I hope, discomfited the Parliamentary Secretary and the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> Amused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> They say they were amused; they ought to be discomfited.
<P>
The point that the right hon. Gentleman made with which I agree most is that it will not be good enough for Ministers to conclude our deliberations—in Committee, if not on the Floor of the House—and send to the other place a Bill to be determined virtually in its entirety, thus expecting their lordships to do the job that Ministers should have done in this place.
<P>
I have said to the Committee on numerous occasions that expectations are being raised. The force of argument in favour of some of the changes that we are discussing is overwhelming. We have not been unkind to Ministers. We could have given them a much harder time, but in the spirit in which we have conducted the debate, we have chosen not to do so in the belief, more than just the hope, that something will be done to repay our courtesy and charity when the Bill reaches to the Floor of the House. As I said at the beginning of our sitting, it is essential that the clause be changed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central said that his amendment introduced a harm test to the clause. Our amendment No. 147 does precisely that and is identical to the hon. Gentleman's amendment in all but one respect: we use the word ``harm'' whereas he uses the word ``prejudice''—I dare say that he does so in deference to the Minister's preference for ``prejudice'', and having accepted that only ``prejudice'' will be acceptable in the amendments, because ``harm'' is out of the question. Be that as it may, for the purpose of imparting some sense to the clause, purpose of imparting some sense to the clause, either word would do and either would bring about a great improvement.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central also suggested that the Information Commissioner's powers in clause 33 were far from formidable. He said that, because of the blanket exemption, there is a hole in the bucket of the commissioner's powers. However, our reading is that the whole thing is a hole: there is no point in having a bucket. What on earth can any Information Commissioner do to challenge a decision by the Government to claim an exemption under clause 33?
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister will say that that is not one of the exemptions listed in clause 13 as outwith the commissioner's purview. However, without any harm test, the Information Commissioner will be virtually powerless to challenge a decision by a Minister in respect of clause 33(1). Clause 13(5) deals with the desirability of releasing information and facts, but that is only a tiny provision in relation to this great matter. It should be obvious to both Ministers present that something must change.
<P>
I would make one further observation. The Minister might find some scope for change in further narrowing the issues to which the absolute exemption is applicable. In other words, if the Minister cannot accept that a harm test should apply to all the matters covered by clause 33(1), he should reflect on whether a harm test could apply to some or part of the exemptions. I cannot imagine that a harm test would be prejudicial to the Government if it were applied to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the formulation and development of Government policy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Introducing a harm test only in respect of subsection (1)(a) would allow much more information to be released because it would not prevent access to relevant factual information and data. Our amendments are intended to secure such access.
<P>
Some redrafting is in order and the Minister must be in no doubt that we shall return to the issues and propose further changes later.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I note that it is now 3.34 pm. We were going to have a tea break at four o'clock; however, I have taken some soundings from members of the Committee and I think that we could make a little more progress if we took our tea break at 4.30 pm. Should there be another Division in the House between now and then, I propose that we run the tea break and the Division together and return after that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross castigated our proceedings as medieval, which makes me a medieval Government serf tied to my red boxes by the red tape which used to be tied around my briefs in my previous job. I am probably expected to address the Committee in Norman French but with your leave, Dr. Clark, I shall stick to English.
<P>
I was interested in the observations made by hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central when he opened the debate. He drew from the briefing of the Campaign for Freedom of Information and suggested that there could be some tension in respect of definition. I was the focus of a deluge of tributes to my reasonableness, for which I was extremely grateful but which made me immensely suspicious—I am always concerned when someone seeks to praise me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Though I am a great lover of the work of William Shakespeare and an admirer, albeit slightly less passionately, of ``Julius Caesar'', there was nothing of the Mark Antony in what I said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> As a former Minister for Arts and one of the most cultured Members of the House, my hon. Friend knows his Shakespeare much better than I. I am grateful for his assurance that there was no malice in his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central was really saying that he had come to bury my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, not to praise him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I was just coming to that. I hope that he will neither bury nor praise me. I perceived in my hon. Friend's argument a certain tension between the views of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, which would open everything to inspection, and his own experience as a Minister. He recognised that some matters of policy development should rightly be kept secret if the Government are to operate with anything like efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
I took careful note of my hon. Friend's observations. He accepted that very few applications under a harm test would succeed in prising open the exemptions under clause 33(1). Although he said that it might be interesting and, indeed, useful for commentators against the Government to look at the advice from Law Officers, he accepted that in the vast majority of cases, the prejudice test would stop that advice being made public.
<P>
The Government's view is that we need time and space to develop policy. That need is recognised in freedom of information legislation throughout the world. We believe that the disclosure of certain categories of information will always be prejudicial to the effective conduct of public affairs; it is simply not appropriate to pretend that large categories of Government information about the development of policy could properly be made public if there were a harm test. The way forward is to accept that as a reality and not to go through the charade of attempting to put up a prejudice test that will always be satisfied. Any judgment should be founded on the public interest, which is why the public interest test in clause 13(4) and 13(5)—which anticipates clause 33(1)(a)—is the proper place for the balance of interest. That balance applies to the public interest, not a harm test.
<P>
Will my hon. Friend tell me which issues and documents would not pass a harm test, but which should be rightly disclosed in the public interest? What documents not disclosed by a proper application of the public interest test would be disclosed by a harm test?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> My question may not necessarily refer to the kind of document that the Parliamentary Secretary asks the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central to clarify. However, does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that a harm test would mean that documents consisting of only information and facts that have informed Government policy would be more likely to be made available?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> No, I do not accept that analysis of the clause. I have already said that this discrete area may benefit from further thought. However, the only example to have come up in debate is the number of private secretaries in a Minister's office. I have two private secretaries. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to know how many private secretaries there are in a private office, he can look in the ``Civil Service Yearbook''.
<P>
That illustrates an important aspect of our debate. It is frequently suggested that information theoretically within the ambit of the exemption will be kept secret. That is not correct. A large amount of information theoretically within the ambit of clause 33(1) is, and will continue to be, made public. That may be because a Minister decides to make such information public: there is nothing in the Bill requiring information which is prima facie an exemption to be kept secret. Alternatively, it may be right to make such information public as a result of properly applying the balance of public interest test in clause 13. Consequently, that information will be made public by Departments, Ministers and other public authorities.
<P>
The question of legal advice coming from Law Officers focuses on the need for a class exemption. All legal advice is, prima facie, confidential. The nature of requests for legal advice is that the people making them are frank, clear and assume the worst case against themselves. The legal advice given in difficult cases is a balance of interests, influences and legal opinion posited against the Department.
<P>
The imposition of a prejudice test would mean that those questions would not be asked so often, and if they were, the legal advice would be less frank and clear, and would be hedged around with more caveats, simply because the advice could be made public subsequently, at a time when that would not be in the public interest. It would affect the mechanism, circumstances and frankness with which the advice was sought and received. That is precisely why, in the limited category of case that we are considering, a general exemption rather than a harm test is the way to achieve the right balance between good government and open government.
<P>
Even the Law Officers' advice will be subject to a public interest test under clause 13, although, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central will accept, given the way in which Law Officers advise, it will be important to maintain the confidentiality for some time, so that the advice continues to be frank and appropriate.
<P>
I listened carefully to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. He spoke eloquently and wittily, and entertained us, but I failed to discern substance in his complaints or a hard core of argument about why a class exemption in this case would not be appropriate, subject to a public interest test. I understand that those who are not, and are very unlikely to be, in government, would want the maximum openness. However, Law Officers' advice, for example, requires a general exemption rather than one subject to a harm test.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I did say that.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale who, on reflection, made that concession.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend would accept the way in which the public interest test in clause 13 is to be applied—with the desirability of publication whenever that is genuinely in the public interest. I hope that he would also accept that there are some spheres which, even on his own analysis, would not be appropriate for a harm test. I am thinking particularly of the Law Officers' advice. With respect to factual information giving rise to policy advice, I refer him to what I said earlier about further consideration.
<P>
Given those assurances, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was interested in what my hon. Friend said, and rather hoped that he would be more accommodating. I am surprised by the brevity of his comments and the blank wall that he erected. He said that he detected some tension between the Freedom of Information Campaign brief, for which I am extremely grateful because of its expertise, and the case that I made. There is no tension between the two. The briefs are excellent and are very helpful to Committee members who are, of necessity, lay people in such matters. It would be foolish not to rely on expert advice and not to be open about doing so. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has access to the briefs. He could learn from them as I have, and doing so would be a good analogy with which to illustrate the value of the openness that we all seek. I am delighted that the advice on which I rely for my work in the Committee is open to all of its members and to the Government, although, sadly, they sometimes resist the case that it makes.
<P>
Hon. Members discuss public matters and use their judgment; that is what we are sent here to do. The more open that we can be, the better. I am delighted to share my advice with my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary. I am not interested in tricking him, tripping him up or producing clever arguments to which he cannot respond. One lives in hope that he will be educated and convinced by information that we share with him, although for the moment I suspect that that will not be the case.
<P>
Of course, distinctions should be drawn. I used my own judgment about the briefs: I do not always think that the Campaign for Freedom of Information briefs that I receive contain the right balance. My hon. Friend rightly said that my spin on and interpretation of its brief on the clause is cautious. He may put that down to my brief experience as a Minister. However, the hon. Member for Ryedale, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, myself, the Campaign for Freedom of Information and others agree on the central thrust of the case that has been advanced. The others to whom I referred are important, as my hon. Friend will look in vain at the evidence heard in the Select Committee, in the House or in the other place, to find anybody who agreed with his view rather than the more modest, cautious and conservative view that I take on Government information—I refer to information and not to process. He will not find anybody in the press who agrees, and I will be amazed if a single hon. Member stands up on the Floor of the House on Report and supports him. An hon. Member might conceivably stand if he or she is anxious to become his next parliamentary private secretary, which I am sure would be a delightful job. Perhaps one or two hon. Members could be persuaded to support him, but I very much doubt it. I doubt also whether any noble Lords will speak in support of him in the other place. The Lords include some very distinguished and experienced former Ministers from both sides of the House. My hon. Friend may argue that when one ceases to be a Minister, one becomes relaxed about playing fast and loose with openness in government, but it is not that simple.
<P>
My hon. Friend will detest the challenge of finding hon. Members from either side of either House or people from bodies outside the House who have thought about the matter and who support the Government's position as it appears in the Bill, and he would do well to consider that. Someone may be out of step with the whole of a brigade, but he is nevertheless right; the aberrant voice will sometimes be correct. However, if the Government have the aberrant voice and every member of the public—whom the Government serve—says something different, it is well for them to ponder. They should ask, ``Are we really right in being so at odds with public opinion?''

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Parliamentary Secretary sought in his answer to alter the burden of proof? He chided some of us for not having discharged the burden of proof concerning our amendments. However, we tabled them in order to hear the Government's case for specifying an exemption and for drafting provisions that run counter to their alleged policy on openness. The Parliamentary Secretary failed to advance any positive, never mind detailed arguments in respect of the four particular circumstances to which the amendments relate. He should be dealing with those circumstances, and he has the onus of discharging the burden of proof on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, which will come as an amazing surprise. The Parliamentary Secretary said—I noted his words carefully because they shocked me; I suspect that Hansard will bear me out—that all categories of information would prejudice the formulation of Government policy. Does he really mean all categories of information which, in itself, is neutral and factual?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure my hon. Friend that if I said that all categories of information prejudiced the effective conduct of public affairs, that was not my intention. I meant to say that certain categories of information will always prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. Those categories are listed in clause 33(1)(a) to (d).
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary did say all categories but, even allowing for all categories of information that come into those four paragraphs, he cannot be serious. As soon as he corrected himself and said ``certain categories'', he conceded my argument because he admitted that there is a distinction between all and certain. It is precisely that distinction which a harm test would sieve out. It would distinguish between ``all'', which is a blanket exemption and ban, and ``certain'', which undoubtedly exists and which has to be distinguished from the ``all'' class. The Government have conceded my argument and made the case for a harm test.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary challenged me to identify information that would not harm or be prejudicial. There are so many instances that it would be almost impossible to list them. He sets an easy challenge; it is a hurdle that is an inch and a half off the ground. I refer him to a hypothetical case. The Ministry of Defence, one of the most difficult Departments to satisfy freedom of information requirements, wants to secure extra land for exercises or to divest itself of such land, which could be on Salisbury plain. The Minister who is to make that decision would rightly call for the facts. He would examine the proposal, which could have been produced by a policy adviser, prodded into being by the Treasury in the comprehensive spending review or suggested by civil servants with responsibility for running MoD estates. How would he make his decision?
<P>
The Minister would refer to the facts: what land does he have; how often is it used; when is it necessary, what is the range of values of the land; what is the cost of making it safe; what about access; do we need it; what is the unit cost of using the land? A sensible Minister would want to be informed about those matters. He would discuss them with his officials before reaching a decision that he would bring to the House. That is factual information.
<P>
My contention is that the public would also want those facts when they consider the advisability of the Government's decision to dispose of or keep the land. To have a proper debate on whether the land is necessary and being well used requires a knowledge of the facts. We are sent here to scrutinise Government action on behalf of our constituents. We must decide whether we are getting good value. To do that, we need facts. It is hard to question what is such an obvious contention. The clause would exempt all that information unless the Government decided to give it to the public.
<P>
I did not produce that hypothetical case at random. When I worked on my Right to Know Bill, I came across a case from Australia in which the Government were looking into the purchase of some land and had made a firm decision to buy it at the rather large cost at the time of more than 200 million Australian pounds. There was a public debate about it and, under the Australian freedom of information legislation, the matter was taken to the Lord Chief Justice Kirby, who overturned the decision and said that the information should be released. Once the shutters were open and the light of fact was allowed to play on the decision, it was quite clear that the case for buying the land was not very good and that the purchase was not necessary. The Government withdrew from the sale and saved themselves 200 million Australian pounds, which improved the quality of government. That is a good and succinct example of open access improving policy-making.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I pursue that example? Does my hon. Friend agree that the primary information concerning the operation of Salisbury plain—such as how much it costs to fence it, how many sheep are there, what rent is paid, and so on—is information that is held by the Ministry of Defence and, if sought, would be sought under clause 34(2), not clause 33(1)? The advice to the Minister will be covered by clause 33(1), but the primary factor information will come under clause 34(2). Any such information that is held by the Minister will come squarely within clause 13(5), which expresses the desirability of making that information public. Is not the regime that my hon. Friend calls for precisely what is provided for in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We have discussed the different interpretations and the reasons why my view of security and usefulness are very different. I shall not weary the Committee by going over them again, but I do not have the confidence of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary that clause 13(5) will overrule clause 33, especially as it says categorically that all information will be exempt.
<P>
The commissioner will be obliged to consider the legislation as a whole, and it will clearly say that the information that the Minister has called for is exempt. She would, therefore, need persuasive reasons under 13(5) to overrule that. Even if she did overrule it, she would only be recommending disclosure and, ironically—I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept this crucial point—that recommendation would be passed to precisely the Minister who had resisted the release of information in the first place. Therefore, the Minister who resists the release of the information, even if recommended under clause 13(5) to release it, would be the one who had also previously resisted it? It would be an interesting Minister who said, ``This should be exempt. I really believe that'', but, at the commissioner's request then said, ``Let's release it after all.''
<P>
If the Parliamentary Secretary is looking for an idea of what is happening, given that the Government's wish is to be as cautious as possible, the Bill time and again gives him belt, braces and then another pair of braces to hold up anything that will prevent information that the Government do not want disclosed from being disclosed. The Government have plenty of securities in the Bill, but, by making everything exempt, they are saying that not only do they need belt, braces and another pair of braces, but a bathing hut, so that everything can be behind closed doors.
<P>
Bathing huts are a thing of the past. The Government have plenty of security and the likelihood of the Bill ripping away veils of Government secrecy and information that properly should not be released is almost nil. All the weight of the Bill is in favour of not disclosing information when the Government do not want to disclose it. However, they must give way on the central point of my amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary asked me to withdraw my amendment, but both he and the Under-Secretary will have noted that I have not sought to press previous amendments to a Division, not least because I can count and I know that the Government will win.
<P>
However, this amendment is very important and it goes to the heart not only of the Bill, but of why we are here as Members of Parliament, which to ask for information on behalf of our constituents and to expect to receive it, as of right, not at the discretion of Ministers. The clause is so misguided that, without any great confidence in trusting the fate of my amendment to my hon. Friends, I shall resist the temptation to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am disappointed that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central feels that it is necessary to press the amendment to a Division. The structure of his argument seems to relate to the provision of a harm test, but he accepts that the majority of information will not be within the facts disclosed under that harm test. Any information that would have been disclosed as a result of the test will in all likelihood be disclosed under the public interest test in clause 13.
<P>
I appreciate that my hon. Friend is concerned that, by structuring the clause without a harm test, Ministers may not change their minds and may refuse to disclose information despite a recommendation from the Information Commissioner in favour of disclosure. Under the current code, a Minister could face the wrath of public opinion and say, ``I simply refuse to disclose the information even though the Information Commissioner has looked at it and applied the public interest test under clause 13, considered whether it comes within clause 33(1)(a), which concerns
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the formulation or development of government policy'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and decided that it should not be kept secret, despite the provisions of clause 13(5).'' I do not want to revisit that clause, but it is worth bearing in mind that there have been several responses to the Government's consultation document.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): Does my hon. Friend agree that clause 13(5) can be read either way, in that the authority having regard to the desirability could lead to a result in either direction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. I do not wish to go back over debates on clause 13(5), but that is not my understanding of the position. I can do no better than refer my hon. Friend to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. If there is any lingering doubt—the hon. Member for Ryedale said that he had similar concerns—I am prepared to continue to reflect on the matter as part of our consideration of the wider matter of the communication of factual information that forms the basis of policy decisions.
<P>
I was referring to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central as to whether Ministers would risk the wrath of public opinion by deciding not to release information, even though the Information Commissioner had recommended its release. It is an unreal concern, because Ministers, as public servants, are accountable through Parliament to the electorate. It would be extremely unlikely in practice, just as it has been unprecedented through the offices of the parliamentary ombudsman.
<P>
That is the right amount of pressure. I have no doubt that a Minister who took that view would have to answer for it in the public domain—probably to Parliament. His decision would be questioned and defended within an effective, democratic process. Only in the most extreme circumstances, and under the most pressing need, would a Minister be prepared to gainsay the opinion of the Information Commissioner, knowing that he would have to defend his opinion in a public forum. The sanction of recommendation is strong. If my hon. Friend wishes to press the amendment to a Division, I cannot stop him, but I hope that he will accept that it is not appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I hope that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central will press the amendment to a Division, because, even though there has been significant unanimity, for the first time we have tabled an amendment that, in all but one word, is identical to the hon. Gentleman's. When we discussed the matter earlier, the Minister told us that those words have the same meaning in law. To that extent there is no difference between our amendments.
<P>
It is right that we should register our view through a Division for two reasons. First, because there is a blanket exemption, I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's surmise that the Information Commissioner will have much, if any, say in how clause 33 is interpreted by Ministers. It is rather like the hole in the bucket: there is no bucket. It is not tenable for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the Information Commissioner has a strong power to intervene. I take it from his expression when the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central agrees. Secondly, the provisions of clause 13(5) remain so unsatisfactory that the Committee should express a view.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I shall respond briefly to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks. He made a good case for the pressure of human interest in the press and on the Floor of the House leading a Minister to accept the commissioner's advice and recommendation, even though, 10 days earlier, he or she believed certain facts to be prejudicial and not in the public interest.
<P>
That is common sense. However, if we were guided by that attitude, the Bill would not be needed at all. Ministers release information all the time, and when they refuse to do so, they are subject to the opprobrium of the press and the House. Indeed, they are often called to account on the Floor of the House, when they say that there is nothing to force them to release that information. A Minister may stand at the Dispatch Box and say: ``You simply must trust me as a Minister. I know the facts of the matter, and it would prejudice the Government. It would not be in the interests of good government. I may get flak today, but you must trust me as I am in full possession of the facts.''
<P>
That is the current position, which the Parliamentary Secretary is adopting. Of course, a Minister who refuses to concur with the commissioner may well be called to the House. However, if he or she has good reason for standing by an unamended Bill, he or she will continue to do so. We do not want Ministers who are easily blown around. If a Minister believes that releasing information would prejudice good government, he or she will say, ``I am sorry, the commissioner is not a politician, but I am. I am elected and accountable, so I am taking a decision that this matter would prejudice good government.'' It is perfectly reasonable for a strong, independent-minded Minister to say, ``It would be wrong for the commissioner to intelligently and responsibly apply the test to a matter that I wish to include in the Bill.''
<P>
I shall press the amendment, albeit with huge reluctance, as the Bill contains so much good, especially in relation to information that will help individuals gain control over their lives and the provision in schedule 1 for greater access to a very long and impressive list of public bodies. We can argue about constraints, as we have done and will continue to do, but the Bill contains a lot of good. However, when it comes to the Government, which is at the heart of our concerns and the reason why we are elected to this House, the shutters come down and there is a blanket exemption. That goes against the spirit of the Bill, so, in no great confidence of the result, I shall press the amendment to a vote.

However, the clause goes further than that by introducing two tests, which I wish to explore through the amendments.
<P>
First, there is the test of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable opinion of a qualified person'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause goes on to list, at length, those who would be deemed qualified in that respect. Secondly, there is test of whether something
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would otherwise prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That definition is capable of considerable extension by those who would want it to apply to material that Ministers or those who drafted the Bill may not have intended to incorporate. Something that is harmful to public affairs at large requires a rather more serious attempt at a definition than we have here.
<P>
That exemption may be derived from a similar provision in the New Zealand Official Information Act 1982, which allows information to be withheld to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``maintain the effective conduct of public affairs''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a substantial difference, however, between the New Zealand legislation and this Bill. In the former, that phrase is qualified by four separate provisions. First, it applies only if the damage to the conduct of public affairs would result from harm to the frank expression of opinions or by exposing officials to improper pressure. Thus, there is a definition of what that harm might be.
<P>
Secondly—this is an extremely important point—objective evidence of such harm is required. In other words, the authorities cannot simply offer an opinion that it is harmful to the conduct of public affairs; it has to be shown to be harmful. Yet, under the Bill, opinions are going to be made by people who are inevitably parti pris and inevitably interested in whether disclosure is made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument as closely as I can, but I want to be clear. If the qualified person is removed, could not any public servant take the decision? The consequence is retrogressive. We suggest that a qualified person should take the decision, but the hon. Gentleman is removing that and allowing any public servant to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary refers to a separate part of the provision. I am dealing with the test of effective conduct of public affairs and the qualifications in the New Zealand legislation. I shall get to the Under-Secretary's point later, but I wish to finish my discussion of the opinion as such, as opposed to whether it should be qualified.
<P>
The test here is the assertion of opinion by a person who may or may not be qualified. The qualification is evident under the Bill. However, persons such as Ministers of the Crown also have an interest in the outcome. Depending on who is elected as the new mayor of London, strong opinions on various matters can be expected. Such people are inevitably, as I said, subjective rather than objective in their opinions.
<P>
The third test in the New Zealand legislation requires it to be ``necessary'' to withhold information—a stricter test than under the Bill. Fourthly, it requires that the information be disclosed if the harm is outweighed by the public interest, which is legally binding—unlike in the Bill.
<P>
The fundamental problem is that a shield is erected against the commissioner applying her judgment. She is required to apply a judicial review test on the reasonableness of the opinion or view taken. As we know from judicial proceedings over a wide area of public affairs, a reasonable test is a fairly substantial obstacle in challenging a decision. A decision has to be shown to be extraordinary, irrational, outrageous, in defiance of logic or verging on the absurd before it can be held to be unreasonable. If there is a scintilla of reasonableness in the opinion—it might be based on a misjudgment or a small ancillary factor—that could bring a qualified person reasonably to formulate such a conclusion, irrespective of whether it is right or wrong, the test will have been satisfied. That is a serious flaw in the Bill. It puts an obstacle between the commissioner and the correct decision, which is an objective assessment of whether material should be exempt. That issue lies at the heart of the amendments.
<P>
The Under-Secretary questioned whether leaving out the provision about a qualified person would make the test apply to anyone. He was right that to take one amendment in the absence of the other would be unsatisfactory. If we replaced the provision in the Bill for an objective test, there would be no reason to have a person's opinion, however well qualified he or she was, as that would no longer be a test of reasonableness.
<P>
I am not alone in feeling that that is a problem. The Public Administration Committee called for the reasonable opinion test to be dropped. I will not quote its findings at length, as I suspect that the Under-Secretary will be aware of them.
