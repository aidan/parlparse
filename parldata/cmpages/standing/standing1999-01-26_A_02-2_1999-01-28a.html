On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 148, line 36, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) After subsection (2) (transmission of election expenses return) there shall be inserted&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(2A) In the case of elections to the Greater London Authority, the return shall include all expenses incurred from the day on which a person declares himself or herself to be a prospective candidate in the election.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before our short break, we discussed election expenses, which we agreed were important. When I mentioned that mayoral elections are in many ways different from the other elections under consideration following the Neill report commissioned by the Home Office, the Minister nodded his head in agreement. I hope that, in that spirit of agreement, he will consider this probing amendment and reflect on the issues that we are about to discuss.
<P>
We are worried that in such novel circumstances it would be easy for a candidate to steal a march before the election limits are set. Moreover, the traditional rules that guide when election expenses are triggered are rather difficult to interpret and have been the subject of many court cases. Perhaps, therefore, in this sort of election we need to be clearer about the time period that should govern election expenses&#151;when someone becomes a candidate and from when election expenses limits apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's line of argument. Is he saying that if the paragraph were added to the Bill, it would be retrospective and would apply to all those who have already announced themselves to be candidates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That is not our desire. It is important that future candidates' expenses count towards the expenses limit. It is not our intention, but we want to ensure that the Government take account of our argument for such elections. Mayoral elections are different. People are already campaigning, and we must introduce such rules with great urgency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It may help the Committee if the hon. Gentleman were to clarify whether we should interpret the amendment as referring to a prospective candidate or nomination for the role of being a candidate in the election, or to someone who has already been adopted by a party to do so. Without that definition, we shall be in some difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> As I am sure the right hon. Gentleman knows, at the moment, no date has been set after which expenses must be recorded, which is the perceived understanding of election law. Indeed, the date of selection as a candidate is not strictly relevant. The same rules in election law apply to independent candidates. The date at which someone becomes a candidate is not currently specified in election law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If I may, I shall use my experience of arriving in the House. Mr. Tugendhat announced that he was going to become a Commissioner in Brussels. My association wanted to adopt a candidate in the month before Mr Tugendhat disappeared. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the moment I signed a piece of paper that said that I wanted to be among 250 people who would be candidates for the nomination for the seat as the Conservative candidate, I became a prospective candidate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was referring to the received understanding of existing election law, under which someone becomes a candidate when he starts acting as a candidate. That is the advice that I have received from the Library. It is related not to nomination papers, approval processes or selection, but to when someone starts behaving like a candidate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> That is interesting. In the past six months, I have seen three or four television programmes on which representatives of different parties, including the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, gave the impression of being and were introduced as ``the candidate''. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is already a candidate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No, I am not.
<P>
Hon. Members: Ah!
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee must allow the hon. Gentleman to have his say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman should have listened to the many answers that my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has given to that direct question. He has made it clear that he is not a candidate at the moment. [Hon. Members: ``Ah!'']
<P>
The case law is clear about the actions that people take which trigger their being deemed a candidate. I presume that many of us would have been concerned about triggering our election expenses before the election and probably went a long way to ensure that we did not do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): It might help the Committee if the hon. Gentleman were to explain what he means by the word ``declares''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Our amendment is totally in line with current understanding of election law. I am not trying to redefine election law; I want to probe the Government on their thinking on this key issue. The Government are proposing a new position&#151;that of mayor&#151;and it is clear, from the way in which people are behaving to try to gain that office that we might need to think differently about election candidates and election expenses. What are the Minister's views on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I was interested that the Minister nodded when I made that point before the Committee suspended. It is clear, from the comments that have been made from sedentary positions, that many Labour Members think that people have started their election campaigns. If they think that, surely the Government must give an indication of what they think will trigger the election expenses.
<P>
Let me give an example of the various people who seem to be campaigning. We know that Lord Archer has set up the Greater London Forum, which has a website&#151;www.london-forum.co.uk. Hon. Members might want to know its full address so that they can visit it tonight, so I am more than happy to give it to them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No. If hon. Members were to visit that website, they would see that Lord Archer is showing that he is very keen on the post. He has a large organisation behind him, if an article in The Sunday Telegraph is to be believed. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Lord Archer has already established a formidable 100-strong team of campaign volunteers, including a full-time press officer''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that the hon. Member for Harrow, East might be especially interested in that website because of a hyperlink on one of the pages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall give way in a minute. If the hon. Gentleman were to select that hyperlink, it would take him to another, connected web page and he would see a picture of Lord Archer. Behind that picture, is the word that, I think, the hon. Member for Uxbridge used of the hon. Member for Harrow, East.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that that is wrong? Is the purpose of the amendment to outlaw that activity? Does the Liberal Democrat party believe that people should not be campaigning in a similar way to Lord Archer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Liberal Democrats want to know when the election limit that was the subject of the Government's amendment and which we discussed earlier will be started. We believe that that starting point should be soon. People are spending a great deal of money trying to garner support throughout London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Many of us in Committee are frequently being educated by the Liberal Democrats, for which we are always grateful. I have a slight problem, however, because the definition offered by the hon. Gentleman is extremely vague and amorphous. He used the expression ``to act like a candidate''. I have reliable information that the hon. Gentleman was acting like a candidate when he was in the playpen, and that he wore a Liberal Democratic rosette on his way to primary school&#151;which was about 10 years ago. Will he explain what he means by the expression ``to act like a candidate''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) has brought schoolyard jokes into the Committee, because that is what we have come to expect from some Labour Members&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not know how much interest members of the Committee have in what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I am extremely interested in it and I should be grateful if members would allow me to listen to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for that ruling. Perhaps I should address my remarks to you, Mr. Stevenson, given that you are the only person paying attention to what I am saying.
<P>
In response to other interventions, I have already said that our amendment is in line with current election law, which sets out various ways, from the Representation of the Peoples Act 1983 and case law, what actions trigger that starting point. We tabled the amendment to provoke such a debate because we want to know whether the Government are happy with the provision in the Bill or whether they believe that other rules should apply to mayoral elections.
<P>
Over the past few months, we have clearly seen people acting as candidates. We know that Lord Archer has just sold his extensive collection of works by Andy Warhol and raised &#163;20 million from the sale of 42 oils and 328 acrylic works by that artist. If we see a posse of people who have decided to stand for the post collecting that amount of potential election funds, given the Minister' comments and concerns about people using their personal wealth to gain that office, the Government should be acting quickly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The hon. Gentleman explained that he wants the Government to clarify their position. Many of us would find it easier if the message that he is giving to the Government could itself be clarified. Equally, it would be easier for us to understand the meaning of his argument if we concentrated on his party. I had the great good fortune to meet the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey outside the Committee Room, when I was on my way to read what he said on Second Reading. The hon. Gentleman said that he said in the debate that he may be a candidate. I have no difficulty in accepting his word, but the phrase ``I may be a candidate'' could be interpreted as his being a prospective candidate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Under current election rules, that phrase does not trigger candidacy. That is the point that we are making. We want to know&#151;so that we can clarify the point for the right hon. Gentleman&#151;what the Government believe the criteria for candidacy of the mayoral elections should be. Those elections will be different from any others that we have had in this country.&#151;[Interruption.] I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) has arrived.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee much longer because I have made my main point. I am grateful for the interventions because they have enabled me to clarify it. I hope that the Minister shares my concern that people are already using their personal fortunes to make their pitch for the post of mayor and agrees that the sooner the Government give us the precise figures and definitions of election expenses, the better.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman. The bulk of his remarks seemed to concern the office of mayor&#151;indeed, he referred to Lord Archer. However, the amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the case of elections to the Greater London Authority, the return shall include all expenses incurred from the day on which a person declares himself or herself to be a prospective candidate in the election.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment refers not exclusively to the function of mayor, but to everyone who presents himself for election to the GLA.
<P>
Furthermore, as I understand the amendment it seeks to define the period during which an expense should be regarded as an election expense for the purpose of the return of such expenses. However, it would have the opposite effect to that which the hon. Gentleman intends. Setting a limit to the date from which expenses need to be declared would allow unscrupulous candidates, by delaying a statement of their intentions, to avoid declaring expenditure that should otherwise be returned. The hon. Gentleman will know that the question of whether an expense is an election expense that must be returned is one of fact which must be determined by reference to the purpose for which the expense was incurred, not to the time at which it was incurred. The courts have noted that the provision does not prescribe a time at which the election begins for the purposes of defining expenses because that would enable the expenses limit to be avoided. Given those circumstances, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take my comment in the spirit in which it is intended&#151;because I seek to comfort him about his concerns, particularly in regard to the activities of the Lord Archer&#151;if I say that a fool and his money are soon parted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall respond quickly to the Minister's specific point. The amendment to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke so ably is clear in requiring the Government to do what they have so far not done&#151;I am not criticising the Minister personally. My noble Friend Baroness Hamwee wrote to Ministers some time ago asking that the Government set down a regime of election expenses for those who have declared that they will follow their interest in becoming a candidate by seeking selection from their party. Into that category fall Lord Archer and the hon. Member for Brent, East&#151; [Hon. Members: ``And?``]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the point that hon. Members are trying to make, but this is not the forum in which hon. Members should declare whether they are candidates. It is a fair line of argument, but let us avoid it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was not even thinking of making such a declaration.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members may have made it for the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No one could do that for one.
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, the drafting of the amendment may make it unclear whether all the money spent by someone who has declared himself a candidate would be classed as election expenses. Without naming names, if someone wants to be a candidate, employ six or a hundred people and set up a website, the time must come for the Government, in the interests of fairness, say that that person's election expenses have begun. The Government must have a view about that. I could understand Ministers accepting that, and saying, perfectly properly, that such rules cannot apply until the Bill takes effect because it should be the vehicle for delivering them. The election will, however, be the first direct personal election of its kind in the country&#151;unless Lewisham council elects a mayor. I understand that it might beat the GLA to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> Tonight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> There we are.
<P>
We are discussing the first personally elected candidate of this kind. The Minister implicitly envisages a timetable: we must wait until the Bill is enacted and the election period will be triggered later. The Government must consider whether that timetable is sufficient. If they intend to wait until the Bill becomes law perhaps in July or October, and if they do not bring the guillotine down from such a date, they may not just fail to prevent the expenses already incurred&#151;which will not be insignificant, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbition said&#151;but they may even be starting the expenses rule after the selection processes have happened&#151;after one, two, three or more parties have chosen their candidates. So there may well be a period before choice of candidate, let along declaration of interests in candidature.
<P>
Will the Minister give a bit more comfort to my hon. Friend? I do not think that my hon. Friend wants to conclude the debate before finding out where we stand.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Our politics is becoming more and more Americanised, for good or ill. How would the hon. Gentleman cater for the fact that the outcome of most American presidential campaigns becomes certain when the man at stake says ``I am not a candidate?''
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a good question. I know that the issues are tricky. The Neill committee&#151;or the Nolan committee, as it became&#151;found it difficult to get into the matter or to come up with answers. We Liberal Democrats would have been happy for such a body to lay down the rules. Our view has always been that an independent and objective body should specify such rules, as was said earlier. We are not suggesting that they should be determined either by individuals or by press interpretations. Somebody has to set rules, and the Bill introduces a new ball game. We are simply saying to Ministers that it may be in their interests&#151;and even in the personal interest of the Minister for Transport in London&#151;to set the rules sooner rather than later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I want to draw to the Committee's attention to a point that I failed to make in my opening remarks. A concern has been expressed that private companies will nominate candidates for the mayoral position, and the use the free post for free advertising. On 26 October 1998, The Guardian reported that Ministers were concerned about such abuse of the free post and the electoral process. I should be happy for the Minister to put The Guardian right.
<P>
The report was written by David Hencke and suggests that Ministers sent a memorandum to the Neill committee. A source close to Lord Neill told The Guardian:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It was a highly complex request and frankly came far too late for us to consider . . . So we did not even look at it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is directly aimed at the problem, about which Ministers are extremely concerned, if The Guardian is to be believed. There has been no proper public debate about the matter. This runs parallel to my earlier arguments about other candidates. It is not good enough for Ministers not to take this opportunity to clarify their thoughts and give us all an indication of when and how they will deal with the specific difficulty that arises from this unique election process.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I have to say that my specific difficulty is maintaining patience. The hon. Gentleman is critical of the Government, but his amendment would not produce the desired result. It mentions elections to the assembly, but the only office of the Greater London authority to which his speeches and those of his hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred, is the office of mayor.
<P>
I repeat: whether an expense is an election expense is a fact to be determined by the court with direct reference to the purpose for which, not the time when, the expense was incurred. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was not in Committee when the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster pointed out another glaring gap in the proposed amendment&#151;the significant failure of the Liberal Democrats to define what they mean by ``candidate''.
<P>
It would be extremely difficult to establish that expenditure being made now is campaign expenditure when the legislation to establish the mayor and assembly has not even been passed by Parliament. I repeat my request that the hon. Gentleman withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I hope that Ministers have heard the arguments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I have just a one-line question for the Minister. Will he put on the record the Government's estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of holding these elections? We support the return of democratic government to London and believe that the cost of elections pales into insignificance compared with the cost of the body that currently runs London, which is the Government office for London. It would, however, be helpful to know the Government's estimate of the true cost, so that there is no misrepresentation outside this place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are considering that with representatives of London returning officers and the London boroughs. On the basis of the figures from previous general elections, it would be reasonable to assume that the eventual cost of what is a significantly more complex pattern of elections may be in the order of &#163;8 million to &#163;10 million, but those are fairly broad estimates as yet. We will be able to refine them only when we have discussed the matter further with all those who are affected. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman and that the Committee will support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> There may be relevant provisions elsewhere in the Bill, but will the Minister remind us how the returning officer will be determined? Does he know, as a result of his conversations with the returning officers of London, whether the returning officer will emerge in the way that the leader of the Tory party used once to emerge, or whether a more formal or more modern method will be used?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The provisions will be for individual constituencies to declare their figures. There will be a returning officer for each constituency and, of course, there will be a returning officer for the whole of London because it is a London-wide election. The precise way in which that will be determined has not yet been decided. We will submit arrangements after discussions with representatives of local government.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Qualification to be the Mayor or an Assembly member</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. As clause 19 refers to the qualifications of the mayor, can you guide us as to whether it would be appropriate for members of the Committee who might be candidates for mayor to declare an interest or withdraw while the matter is being considered? Would it be proper for someone who might be a candidate for mayor&#151;the names of at least five Members in the Committee have been mentioned in that connection&#151;to deliberate on the mayor's qualifications when he might one day be measured against them?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There could be many more such people, of course. That is an important point of order, but declarations of interest are not a matter for me: they are for individual members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I am actively seeking the Labour nomination to stand, which is a bloody sight more difficult than actually getting elected mayor. I shall proceed on that basis.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I assume that the hon. Gentleman would have liked that put at the beginning of, rather than half way through, our deliberations. I do not know whether the Clerks can manage that, but we will see. It is up to individual members of the Committee to make declarations of interest. It is not part of the Chairman's duties to urge or provoke them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 10, line 42, leave out `21' and insert `18'.
<P>
This is a short amendment, which reduces the age of consent&#151;[Laughter.] I knew that I would do that one day. Let me rewind and start again. The amendment reduces the age at which a person can stand as a candidate for election to the office of mayor or to the assembly from 21 to 18. This is an important point, which we feel needs to be debated.
<P>
At the age of 18, people can fight for their country vote, drive, marry and do all the other things that an adult can do, but they cannot stand to represent their community in the assembly or as mayor. We should take the opportunity offered by this new Bill, which introduces a new institution, to align ourselves with other European countries and bring the age at which people can stand for office into line with the age at which they can vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I did not intend to say anything about the amendment, but I have been provoked by the reference that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made to other European countries. It always strikes me as odd to justify an argument by saying that we must do something because other European countries do, as if that were a clinching argument. Notwithstanding our membership of the European Union of even of the Council of Europe and the European convention on human rights, I do not see why we should do something simply because other European countries do.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a Freudian slip and started talking about the age of consent. The Secretary of State told us in the debate on the age of consent that that varied in European countries from&#151;if my memory serves me right&#151;as low as 12 to as high as 18. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman would therefore say that we should rush to emulate whichever European countries have an age of consent of 12, but that is where that argument leads us. I hope that we will hear less of such an argument and more arguments&#151;which, in fairness, the hon. Gentleman used and which have some validity&#151;about the kind of thing that people may do at the age of 18.
<P>
I always took the view that lowering the age of voting to 18 was probably a big mistake. If I thought a bit more about it, I would seek to raise the voting age to 21 rather than do what the amendment seeks to do.
<P>
<B>Ms Linda Perham (Ilford, North):</B> When I heard the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam say that the mayor would be like the British Prime Minister, I wondered whether those hon. Members who had tabled the amendment thought that someone who had just reached the age at which he or she could vote would have enough experience of life, or even public standing, to be a credible candidate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> [Who will speak next?] Everybody seems so reticent&#151;they stand up nice and slowly.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> It is generosity, Mr Stevenson, in case any of our colleagues wish to speak.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to allow persons who have attained the age of 18 to stand for the posts of mayor and assembly member. The issue has arisen in the past, most recently during a debate in another place in December last year. In response to a question put by Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, my noble Friend Lord Williams made it clear that the Government believe that there is an arguable case that there is a difference between the capacity and suitability required of a voter, and that required of a representative. That point was congently made. The case for reducing the age at which a person can stand for election has not been fully made. However, our approach is not dogmatic, and we are keeping an open mind.
<P>
The working party of electoral procedures, chaired by the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth)&#151;the Minister responsible for electoral matters&#151;is reviewing a wide range of electoral practice. This may be a suitable question for the working party to consider. It would be premature to include a measure of that magnitude in the Bill before it had been carefully researched and the Home Secretary had had the opportunity to consider it fully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Will the Minister tell us about the timetable to which the working party is working, so that we have an idea of when it will report on this and other issues?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It is my understanding that the working party will report back before the end of the Session. However, the proposals have wide implications for every election throughout the United Kingdom. Surely the decision should not be made exclusively by the Government. There will be a need to consult across the whole country. I should have thought that there would be many differing views on the issue. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) has placed on the record his opinion of any possible change.
<P>
The Government do not have a closed mind on the issue. It is possible that the working party will address it, but given the profound change that it would mean in so many areas of the country&#151;and the doubt whether the country would decide to proceed in that way&#151;I think it highly unlikely that there would be a definite decision in the report that the working party will deliver. In the light of those remarks, I again ask the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her comments. It is helpful to learn that the Government still have an open mind, and I welcome the fact that there is a working party looking at this issue.
<P>
It has been questioned in this short debate whether someone of 18 necessarily has the experience to take on the position of mayor. That may be a view that many in this Room&#151;and, indeed, many in London&#151;hold. However, it is for the electorate to judge when it comes to considering the candidates who offer themselves for election. People can vote at 18, die for their country at 18, fill in a tax return and pay their taxes at 18&#151;all things which involve being responsible. It is important that the scope is extended to ensure that the assembly, in particular, represents as wide and diverse a community as possible&#151;and that includes young people. For that reason, we feel strongly about the matter, but we welcome the Minister's comments. On that basis, and in the hope that we shall hear further about the issue later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 229, in page 10, line 42, at end insert&#151;

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 230, in page 10, line 42, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3B) The person must have been elected under a selection and approval process which has been approved by the Greater London returning officer to ensure fairness to all prospective candidates.
<P>
 (3C) Each registered political party which intends to submit candidates for election must publish details of the process at least six months before the ordinary election.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 143, in page 11, line 10, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) A mayoral candidate of any registered political party cannot be returned as mayor unless, no later than the time of his nomination as candidate, the registered leader of that party has delivered to the Greater London Returning Officer, and has made publicly available&#151;
<P>
(a) a sworn declaration describing fully that party's procedures for the selection of its candidate as mayor, and
<P>
(b) a certificate declaring that all persons participating in the selection process derived their authority solely from elective processes in which al the members of that party in Greater London, or in any part of it, were entitled to participate at all stages.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It is unusual for Acts of Parliament to legislate about selection procedures of political parties.
<P>
Our process stands in marked contrast to that of the other political parties, especially the Labour party. If I get the history of the selection process debate in the Labour party wrong, I hope that Labour Members will put me right, because I should not like the record of the Committee to be inaccurate. My understanding is that the process began in June 1998, when the Labour London regional conference decided, without opposition, that anyone receiving more than 10 constituency Labour party nominations should automatically be shortlisted for mayor. I have a copy of the motion to which the London Labour party agreed, and it makes very interesting reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Read it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman asks me to read it out. I shall. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Regional Conference welcomes the Government's speedy action on the General Election pledge of democratic government for London and congratulates them and the Party in London on the successful outcome of the Mayor and Assembly referendum, which overwhelmingly affirmed Londoners' desire for the restoration of their own political voice.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far, I would vote for that. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The London Labour Party looks forward to the democratic selection of a Labour candidate for mayor. We believe that Labour's candidate must be selected democratically on the basis of a One Member One Vote Ballot of the Greater London Labour Party membership in London.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill incorporates into British law two electoral systems that are unusual in comparison with previous legislation. A closed-list system will operate for the election of assembly members; the electorate will not be able to choose between individual candidates. We have had that debate before. Liberal Democrat Members are not happy with closed lists, but we believe that that we should try to make the selection process for the lists as open and democratic as possible.
<P>
The other unique aspect of the authority is the position of mayor. The mayoral election, too, ought to be as open and democratic as possible on the part of the political parties that contest it. That is why amendments Nos. 229 and 230 seek to introduce that requirement.
<P>
In September last year, the Liberal Democrats published rules for the selection of Liberal Democrat assembly and mayoral candidates. When the proposals were put before the London executive and debated in the party, it was made clear that they might have to be amended if the Greater London Authority Bill changed the systems as it passed through Parliament. We wanted to put the matter to our London members as early as possible so that people could seek approval and so that the largest possible number of candidates could come forward for advice about whether they would be suitable. We wanted to ensure that our processes opened up the closed list system, at least within our own party, and opened up the prospect of a variety of people trying to get the Liberal Democrat mayoral nomination.
<P>
That sounds rather similar to our amendment. It will be interesting to see whether Labour Members vote for that amendment, as it is in line with a motion that they passed at their own regional conference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> So that hon. Members are under no illusion I must tell them that the amendment is not merely similar. It was drafted in the knowledge of that particular resolution. So as to be helpful to the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick), who was not only present but powerfully present at the relevant meeting; he was chairing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> As always, my hon. Friend makes a powerful point. The motion continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe any member of the Greater London Labour Party should be entitled to seek nomination, and we support the following simple and democratic system for selection:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Labour's selection should be made by eligible Labour Party members in London through a One Member One Vote ballot
<P>
2. All candidates who are nominated by a minimum of 12.5 per cent. of London CLPs (that is 10 CLPs) will automatically be shortlisted so that their names will appear on the ballot papers to select Labour's candidate.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The motion continues&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can see the relevance of the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make, but if hon. Members are going to read out party manifestos in Committee, we shall be here into the wee small hours. The hon. Gentleman has made his point, and he can reinforce it with other arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davy:</B> You intervened at an appropriate point, Mr. Stevenson, because the rest of the motion was not quite as relevant to the debate. As you say, I had made my point.
<P>
Having passed that motion at the London Labour regional conference in November 1998, the Greater London Labour party regional board was not quite so sure about it, and agreed without opposition that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a system of self nomination''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall take a break for the assistance of the Hansard reporters, because it is important that those points are recorded in Hansard so that all the people reading&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whatever happens, the hon. Member has a right to be heard.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I was reading what the Greater London Labour party regional board agreed, which was that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a system of self-nomination by potential candidates for inclusion on a panel of candidates for mayor and assembly''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
was the way forward, and that a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``selection board is established to consider candidates''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a recommendation that contradicted the democratically passed motion. The London Labour party regional board did not want democracy entering the process, as our amendment proposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): I have a small point of clarification, as the London regional board is being challenged over its democratic integrity. The resolution was passed at the conference before the Labour party, nationally and regionally, had evolved procedures to select candidates for the mayor and assembly. The London Labour party board was elected by the conference to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Procedures are entirely consistent and democratic, and the board has made its pronouncements about how we choose our candidates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That clarification is fantastic. I might want to invite the hon. Member for Brent, East to intervene to provide the counterpoint, but before he does so, I wonder whether the recommendations passed by the regional board have gone back to the members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> That is none of your business.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to be as patient as possible, because the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton obviously wants to make a point about the internal mechanisms of different political parties. However, the point has been well made, and we should move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I understand that we must move on, but I want to clarify why what I was saying is so important in the context of the Bill. In dealing with closed-list systems and the new position of mayor, it is more important than ever that the systems of selection and approval be as open as possible.
<P>
In the Evening Standard of 21 January, a Labour Member is quoted as having said that the procedures adopted by the regional board would ensure that the primary candidates selected would work with the Labour Government and would not be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``continually at loggerheads with it''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the Labour regional board is desperately trying to prevent candidates who oppose the Government from being selected; it is control-freakery.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan (Enfield, North)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Ah, another defender of the status quo.
<P>
<B>Ms Ryan:</B> I should like to make a correction. The hon. Gentleman quotes the Evening Standard, which misquotes me. When asked on the television programme ``On the Record'' where that quote came from, I said that the Labour party had the right to select a candidate who did not have to be in complete agreement with the Government or the Prime Minister on every issue, but that I would expect to be supporting a candidate who, for the interest of Londoners, could work co-operatively with the Government and not continually be at loggerheads with them. That is what I said. That the Evening Standard misquoted my words does not surprise me; what does surprise me is that the hon. Gentleman did not bother to check that statement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am doing the hon. Lady a great service by enabling her to set the record straight. The amendments were tabled to help the Labour party sort out the mess into which it has got itself. It dreamed up the system of a mayor with all that power and now it is trying to control the selection of a candidate. The Government are trying desperately to bring control back to the centre&#151;as happened in the selection process for the Welsh Assembly.

<P>

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman needs to have his fun; after all, he does not get out much. Whatever the worst criticisms are of the internal processes of any party in the Room, is he seriously suggesting that the state, by law, should determine the internal, democratic mechanisms of any party in the country? Not even Stalin or Mussolini managed to do that&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is not about internal mechanisms of political parties. I should be grateful if the Committee would concern itself with the priciples contained in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. With the greatest respect, amendments Nos. 229, 230 and 143 go to the heart of internal party mechanisms and democracy; they are not about wider selection processes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comment, but I am sure that my point has been well taken by the Committee and I should appreciate his being guided by it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I agree with the point of order made by hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East, but he suggested earlier that the state should be legislating for the selection processes. Amendment No. 230 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The person must have been elected under a selection and approval process which has been approved by the Greater London returning officer to ensure fairness to all prospective candidates.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That enables several processes to be undertaken. Initially, I set out the rationale for my argument but, because we shall have different types of electoral systems and posts, the Committee must consider whether we need to intervene in the selection approval process of political parties. Such a debate is fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I wish to pick up a point made by the hon. Member for Harrow, East. It is often necessary for rules to be set by the state to guarantee fairness. A great deal of legislation has been passed by the state and supported by the Labour party on non-discrimination against women, race, gender, age and so on. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton agrees that we tabled the amendment so that the Bill would be consistent with that approach to ensure that elections are non-discriminatory and that people are not put outside the frame because of their views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My hon. Friend is right. That argument is germane, particularly to the elections introduced under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> In a minute. The Labour party is trying to stop the candidacy of one or two of its more controversial members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> Who is the other one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to answer that question, although I have one or two thoughts about who those controversial members are. Last November, we heard reports that Labour party headquarters had been compiling a dossier on a Labour Member of Parliament to discredit him and expose his record when he was elected as a Labour representative on the Greater London council. That appalling development in British politics shows the problems of the mayoral system.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am delighted to give way to the hon. Member for Harrow, East.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that the state should legislate for a shortlist of five? Is he suggesting internal party mechanisms which mean that people cannot come forward unless they are on a party shortlist of five?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to Millbank. If the people at Millbank have not got dossiers on 57 London Labour Members of Parliament, they are not doing their job properly. I hope that they have a dossier on me and everyone else in this Room, except my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith). I accept that some dossiers might be fatter than others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> In our amendment, we propose the election processes that we have in the Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall not give way at the moment. If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I will let him intervene, but I want to deal with the points that other Labour Members have made.
<P>
We are trying to help the other parties by suggesting one member, one vote; we are trying to persuade them to be more democratic.&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that we shall make more progress if the hon. Gentleman can be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Member for Harrow, East is welcome to vote against our amendment, but he should consider it because we are proposing a democratic process. He is happy that Millbank holds a dossier on him, but I advise him to talk to the hon. Member for Brent, East and find out whether he is pleased that such a dossier is held on him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, East has suggested that his only defence&#151;he can do nothing in law&#151;against being squeezed out of being approved and selected as a mayoral candidate for the Labour party is an American-style write-in campaign. Perhaps we should legislate to protect the rights of our fellow Members of Parliament when they are squeezed out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman were to have his way and the amendment were to be agreed to, which is very unlikely, both the major parties would have no difficulty finding five excellent candidates for a shortlist, but does he expect us to believe that the Liberal Democrats could find five excellent candidates? Or will the Liberal Democrats have one favourite candidate and four patsies, perhaps including the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am surprised only that it has taken so long for Labour Members to make that point. A huge number of prospective candidates will put themselves forward.&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Who?''] I advise Labour Members to wait to see the richness of talents that will come from the London Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that a few years ago the Nigerian state rigged an election by allowing only two candidates from two particular parties? The state determined the basis of those parties, how they chose their candidates and how the primary elections were run, and it prevented many opinions from being expressed.
<P>
Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that for a long time in central and eastern Europe it was impossible for people to stand for election unless they did so for one of the official parties? Is he also not aware that what he is proposing is rank Stalinism? In fact, it is outrageous that his party, which is hostile to the Labour party, should have the pretension to tell us whom our candidates should be.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was catching on but he has not quite understood the point. The point of our amendments is to try to make that separation between party and government. He may not have realised it, but his Government are trying to stop members of his party winning the nomination. That is the point of having the debate. I am surprised that he is not leaping to the defence of his hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East against the appalling Stalinist tactics, to use his phrase, that have been used.
<P>
<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> As someone with some understanding of and respect for the Second International, may I bring us back to the serious point. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises has now been well rehearsed. The argument from my hon. Friends the Members for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) and for Harrow, East has been about state intervention on political parties. I can fully understand and appreciate their concerns. The way forward may be to seek some form of informal agreement between parties about the transparency of the process by which candidates are selected, which can therefore add validity in due course to the institution of the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Hon. Gentleman has a valid suggestion. If he can persuade his hon. Friend on the Front Bench and possibly his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to take up that suggestion, I am sure that my hon. Friends and Conservative Members will be happy to take up that offer. If the Minister takes the hon. Gentleman's bait, we will certainly withdraw the amendments.
<P>
I have spent quite a lot of time talking&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Yes.'']&#151;about how the amendments would affect the Labour party. Let me just reflect for a second how they might affect the Conservative party. We were interested in the Conservative party's selection processes and so we rang central office and asked about its rules. They have not been published formally, as will be required in our amendment, but they have been leaked to the press. I am pleased to say that they are moving in the right direction.
<P>
The rules say that every Tory party member in London will be entitled to take part in a primary election to choose the candidates. I welcome and praise the Conservative party's move to modernise but, I also suspect its motives. It has decided not to try to prevent Lord Archer from standing. According to a report in The Guardian on 12 January, it appears that the Conservatives now think that there is nothing they can do to stop him, so they may as well give in and allow a democratic process. That is to be welcomed. I wonder whether they will put any election limits on their internal party elections to ensure that there is a fair selection process.
<P>
There have been some illuminating interventions in the debate. It is clear that many Labour Members are quite ashamed about what is happening in the London Labour party. They are very uncomfortable, and so they ought to be. I hope that the Minister will take up the suggestion of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell).
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If richness of talent is a criterion to be a Liberal candidate for mayor, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton will not be on the short list.
<P>
If I can bring the debate back to a more serious point, amendment No. 143 is much more focused. It provides quite simply that all those participating in the selection process should derive their authority solely from the elective processes in which all the members of that party in Greater London or in any part of it were entitled to participate at all stages. In other words, no one has a vote at any stage in the selection process other than through membership of the Greater London party. That is simple, right, fair and democratic.
<P>
The Conservative party was prompted to table the amendment by the report that Professor Dunleavy and Dr. Helen Margetts prepared for the Government office for London under the heading ``Electing the London Mayor and the London Assembly''. It was published in January 1997, and I am sure that the Minister is aware of it. I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 4.10 of the recommendations to the Government, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It will be particularly important for the success of the London Mayor how the political parties go about making their candidate selection. If all the established parties follow OMOV''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
one member, one vote&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``procedures in picking candidates the eventual general election will seem much more legitimate to most people, and the chance of there being dissident candidates from established parties will be reduced. If parties internal procedures seem less legitimate then the election may not command such high levels of public support: dissident candidates would be more likely to stand against the official party nominees and more independent candidates could also stand so the numbers of viable candidates would tend to grow. Given the importance of candidate selection procedures inside the parties for the direct election to an executive position there is a case for the government to require parties to follow OMOV procedures internally which might require the registration of parties intending to offer Mayoral candidates also.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The recommendation that the Government should play the game fairly could not be put more clearly.That is a critical point and it should be borne in mind. We should not have a situation such as that described in The Guardian yesterday, and in plenty of other places. The paper said that the national executive committee carried out a pre-screening role to exclude candidates from the short list that the members of the London Labour party would have to consider.
<P>
It is important that the views of the membership of the Greater London Labour party, which continues to send me reports of its meetings, are put on the record. Here are the words of the latest report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Tony Blair has made clear his intention to exclude Ken Livingstone from Labour's one member one vote ballot for London Mayor. At LLB's AGM Ken declared he would fight this battle `to the wire'. His determination was warmly welcomed, as it will be among tens of thousands of Labour activists and millions of London voters.
<P>
 Using screening panels for the Mayor of London . . . is indefensible. The panels are wrong in principle, produce arbitrary results, restrict members' choice, function in secret, their members are unaccountable and their criteria subjective.
<P>
 Blair and his followers peddle the line that `no one has the right to a seat', which is true but irrelevant. The issue here is the right of Party members to put themselves forward for selection as candidates for public office and choose freely from a wide range of candidates. It's not just Ken Livingstone's rights being infringed, but those of every Party member in London.
<P>
 The importance of this issue extends far beyond the confines of the Labour Party. LLB has often noted that the struggle for democracy inside the Labour Party is a key aspect of the broader struggle for a more democratic society. Pre-screening panels reach back into the womb of political choice, fundamentally skewing that choice in favour of the prevailing elites.''

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> If the hon. Gentleman's point is that the role of screening panels is so heinous and evil, why are the Conservatives using them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was coming to the Tory party's selection process. The Tory party is not having any pre-screening panels. In the first round the executive of the greater London area, all of whom are voluntary members of the party and derive their authority from having been elected by the membership in London&#151;there are no appointments to that board whatever&#151;will do a paper sift of candidates&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Screening.''] If there are 50 candidates, they will reduce the number to, say, 20&#151;[Hon. Members: Ah!'']
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has a clear loud voice, but I am having difficulty in hearing him. Perhaps we can allow Committee members to speak and be heard.
<P>
<B>Ms Karen Buck </B>(Regents Park and Kensington, North): Will the hon. Gentleman explain how he intends to reduce the number of applicants from 50 to 20 without going through a selection process?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is a selection process.
<P>
<B>Ms Buck:</B> You said it wasn't.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The difference between the Conservative party and the Labour party is that in the Labour party, the initial process will be conducted by members of the national executive committee, who do not derive their authority from the membership of the Greater London Labour party. In the Conservative party, everey member will derive his or her authority from voluntary workers in the London Conservative party. The Labour party cannot say that the first round of its selection process will be carried out only by voluntary members who have been elected in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fitzpatrick:</B> Pehaps I can give an outline. The procedure endorsed by the London board, which is elected by the London annual conference, was submitted to the national executive. That is entirely in keeping with the selection procedures for a range of other elections held, or to be held, over the past six or the next 18 months. It is also entirely in keeping with our constituency and is supported by the London Labour party. Thus we are entirely in tune with our membership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is saying that the first round of the Labour party's process derives its authority solely from the support of the London membership by an electoral process, I am sure that Labour Members will vote for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Because that is what the amendment says. The authority to have a vote at any stage of the selection process must be derived from membership of the London Labour party. The hon. Gentleman knows that I am right, because of the system that the Labour party is introducing in an attempt to stop the hon. Member for Brent, East being a candidate. The hon. Member for Harrow, East knows full well that if the Labour party used a genuine one member, one vote basis, the hon. Member for Brent, East would be its candidate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I appreciate the fact that the hon. Gentleman has responded to several interventions, but could he return to the description of the Conservative party's selection process so that we can hear what his euphemism for the second screening panel is?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Yes. The second stage of the process is the assembly of an electoral college which comprises one member from each of the parliamentary constituencies in London, of which there are 72&#151;[Interruption]&#151;74; I beg the Committee's pardon. There will therefore be 74 members on that committee, all of whom will almost certainly be the chairmen of their Conservative party associations, who have been elected by a free democratic process. They will reduce the number of candidates from, say, six to two, three or four.
<P>
I should not think that anyone would want to select the hon. Member for Harrow, East for anything. But whatever the selection process, it needs to reduce the number of applicants in each round. That is the way in which the Conservative party has operated for the past 200 years, and I hope that it will go on in that way for the next 200 years.
<P>
The next round will be a public meeting with the final three or four candidates. It will be open to the media and every voluntary paid-up member of the Conservative party in London will be entitled to attend it and vote. They will reduce the number to two and there will be a run-off by postal ballot.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Every stage of that process is genuinely based on the one member, one vote system. The Opposition are prepared to accept the recommendations of the report. We urge the Government to accept them, and to agree to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall paraphrase the words with which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton began his remarks a very long time ago. He said something like, ``It is unusual for legislation to prescribe the way in which political parties select their candidates''. It is not only unusual, it is undesirable and potentially dangerous. That is a slippery slope that leads only too easily to a system in which the state determines who is eligible to stand and who is not. Such a process creates abuses of democracy and, ultimately, abuses of human rights in countries that allow it to occur. I sincerely hope that we will not adopt that dangerous approach.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Liberal Democrats have spoken at inordinate length, and I shall say a little more before giving way to any hon. Member.
<P>
I hope that it will be a long time before we contemplate taking the slippery path about which I was speaking. The amendments would require political parties to adopt internal selection procedures specified by the state in legislation. No one will be surprised, therefore, to hear that I will not and cannot accept the amendments. The procedure that a party adopts for selecting its candidates for any election must remain a matter for that party. If the electors do not like it, they have a suitable remedy. Those who do not like the way in which a political party operates are entirely free to reject any candidate that it proposes.
<P>
The alternative route suggested by Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members is not only offensive and wrong, but also totally impractical. How would the amendments apply to smaller parties, which could not go through all the complexities required to hold elections in the prescribed way? How would they apply to individual independent candidates? How could an independent candidate satisfy the obligations that would be set by the amendments? If it is not appropriate to apply the proposed rules to an independent candidate, why is it appropriate to apply them to a political party? If an independent candidate can stand on his or her say-so, why cannot a party determine by its own rules the way in which its candidates stand?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister's point is weaker than any other that he has made. Why do the Government favour independent scrutiny, independent rules governing party funding, monitoring who gives money to parties and so on? Individuals are entirely different from a political party, and are entitled to fund and to organise themselves. Political parties, however, have to conform to specific standards expected by the people. The Government have signed up to do that in every other respect. It is embarrassing for the Minister that they are not willing to sign up to introducing independently agreed electoral processes, as recommended by the Dunleavy report, which his Department commissioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> On the contrary, we believe absolutely that it is right to uphold principles of probity and propriety, especially in respect of financial matters. The process by which a political party selects its candidates is properly a matter for that party, not for the state. Anybody who thinks and reflects seriously on the matter will defend that principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Why does not the Minister accept the recommendations of Professor Dunleavy and Dr. Margetts?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the hon. Gentleman had been listening for the past five minutes, he would realise that I believe that those people's recommendations are wrong. I saw them, and I chose not to accept them. That is an entirely appropriate course of action. Advisers advise; Ministers decide&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Oppositions oppose.'']&#151;and Oppositions oppose. Hon. Members' contributions to the debate have demonstrated only too clearly the danger of going down the route that they are proposing.
<P>
The Liberal Democrat proposal is bizarre. It would give the Greater London returning officer responsibility for monitoring the way in which individual parties adopt their candidates. It cannot be right for a returning officer to be expected to pry into the activities of political parties in that way.
<P>
As far as Conservative Members are concerned, we heard an amazing contribution from the hon. Member for Croydon, South. He seemed to be trying to work out how many angels can dance on the head of a pin as he attempted to determine when a screening panel is not a screening panel and when two screening panels are somehow more satisfactory than one screening panel. It is precisely that kind of absurd, tortuous argument which discredits the entire case that has been put forward by Opposition Members.
<P>
The truth of the matter, as my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town made clear as Chair of the Greater London Labour party, is that the Labour party will choose a method of selecting its candidate that ensures a process of nomination, a process of screening and an one member, one vote final selection process. We will stand by that principle, which we believe to be proper and democratic. The suggestion from a party that has two screening processes that there is something defective in that&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Four, actually.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The number is growing by the minute, There are now four screening processes rather than the two that the hon. Gentleman described. It is offensive for Conservative Members to suggest that our selection process is somehow inferior to theirs. It is an indication of exactly how dangerous it is to go down that route.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I happily give way to the hon. Gentleman on that note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is the Minister who is arguing against democracy. He knows full well that he is misleading the Committee. The first round of the Labour party's selection process will not be democratic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town is better placed than I am to speak about the matter. However, my understanding is that the first round, as recommended by the London Labour party board to the national executive committee, involves self-nomination to encourage any individual who believes that they are suitable to put themselves forward. That is open, proper and right, and it in no way conforms with the hon. Gentleman's absurd caricature.
<P>
We have strayed for far too long into the area of political parties' candidate selection procedures. The amendments are objectionable and wrong, and I ask members of the Committee to reject the amendment if it is put to the vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I do not think that it will be possible for me to contain my remarks to less than several hours.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that it will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> I shall make an effort.
<P>
The lesson that emerges for the Labour party is this: the idea that any interference in the selection process will be a two or three-day wonder is woefully misplaced. If we do anything that we should not do in the selection of our candidates, Opposition parties will run with the issue up until polling day.
<P>
The debate has been good fun. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister that it is not the returning officer's role to manage political parties. If there were to be an abuse of natural justice, it would be for the courts to intervene. I suspect that if there is such an abuse, the matter will end up under a different arm of the state from the one about which members of the Committee have been talking today. Any London Labour party member, out of 69,000, would have the right to go to court. I will not go to court&#151;I can assure hon. Members of that&#151;but given the range of human richness of character and eccentricity among London Labour party members, I suspect that someone may do so.
<P>
I should like to make another point. It would make the situation so much simpler, and could defuse the issue, if the leaders or our party would make an early statement about precisely how Labour candidates are to be selected. The reality is that it has been put off and off and off. The national executive committee will not even discuss it until the end of March. As long as that runs on, our enemies will make hay with it. It is a daily drip, drip, drip, which damages the Labour party and will be an albatross round the neck if whoever is selected.
<P>
That is all I intend to say on this. I just wanted to explain, in case anyone did not understand, why I will be voting with my party when it seems that so many Opposition Members are concerned for my health.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> I oppose the amendments, which are mischievous in the extreme. As has been said, common law protection already exists in the form of natural justice. Under the amendments, prescriptive rules for political parties would apply. They would be far too narrow, for all the reasons that have already been given. But if the rules were wide, lawyers would have a field day&#151;as a solicitor, I can say that&#151;if every time members of political parties thought that there was a breach, they rushed to the courts. It would make the whole thing a laughing stock, and for that reason the amendments should be opposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> This has been an interesting debate. We have teased out many issues that have been enlightening to all members of the Committee. We have heard about the Conservatives' selection process. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey suggests that it should be known as the filtration process, it is so complex and byzantine. It certainly does not seem to meet the ``one man one vote'' requirements.
<P>
The Minister went slightly over the top in his response when he suggested that if the amendment were accepted we would be on the slippery slope to the abuse of human rights. I thought that this Parliament had passed legislation to protect human rights. I also thought that the Labour party's modernisation proposals were designed to tighten the law regarding political parties. We discussed the Neill report earlier today. The election commission, if it is set up, will have a major impact on the internal workings of political parties.
<P>
Legislation has already gone through the House&#151;I am not sure whether it is on the statute book yet&#151;to register political parties. These proposals would mean legislation for how political parties should operate. To suggest that our amendments would result in the abuse of human rights was over the top.
<P>
I shall not demean myself by suggesting that the speech of the hon. Member for Croydon, South was not worthy. That would be churlish. He did make one valuable point&#151;he referred to the Dunleavy report, commissioned by the Government. When he referred to it again, the Minister simply said that he had seen the report and had not agreed with its findings. We question the Minister's motives for declining the Dunleavy report's recommendations. We all know that No. 10 and many people in the London Labour party are desperate to stop the hon. Member for Brent, East standing for election. That consideration may well have been&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Although the hon. Gentleman, and anyone else, is entitled to speak to the amendments, questioning the motives of hon. Members is pushing things a little too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am sorry if I was straying, Mr. Stevenson, but I was replying to an answer that the Minister had given.
<P>
In conclusion&#151;[hon. Members: ``Hurrah!''] I hope that hon. Members who were present at the London Labour party regional conference and did not oppose that motion might consider joining us later in the Committee's proceedings when we hope to return to this issue. We do not intend to press the amendment tonight. [hon. Members: ``Shame.''] We hope that the Government will go away and reflect on the debate. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The more interventions that are made from sedentary positions, the greater the temptation for hon. Members to repeat what they have already said. We should not put that temptation in front of anybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I propose that Ministers go away and reflect on the issue. They said earlier that they were looking forward to the establishment of the election commission. Would not it be a proper way forward to suggest that the commission's remit be extended to cover issues such as those that we are discussing? The Minister shakes his head, but I hope that he will go away and consider the point. We certainly intend to return to it at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Both Houses are entitled to some comment on the issue. Under the circumstances, we would withdraw our amendment and return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> At this stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 231, in page 11, line 10, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) The person elected as Mayor must continue to reside in Greater London during the period of his or her office.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall be brief, for which I am sure that many hon. Members will be grateful. Under amendment No. 210, candidates who stand for election to the assembly or as the mayor should have resided in London for at least 12 months prior to their nomination. Under amendment No. 231, they must continue to live in London after their election.
<P>
That is an important point in terms of the authority for London. People who are elected to it should live in London now and in the future. We should ensure that that is the case through the amendments. If we do not amend the Bill in the way suggested in the amendments, London could conceivably elect someone who does not, never has and never will live here. That is unacceptable. We therefore urge the Committee to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The purpose of amendments Nos. 140 to 142 is to remove an anomaly. Candidates who qualify to stand for mayor or for the assembly by virtue of being on the electoral register are required to remain on it throughout their term of office. There is no comparable requirement if the same candidates qualify by virture of their place of work or by occupying property as owner or tenant. We propose to level the playing field by making the qualification on owning property or working in the area apply throughout the term of office.
<P>
<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> My reason for speaking is that I accept that the amendments need to be taken into account in considering other legislation and the reform of electoral practices.
<P>
I must protest about the property qualification remaining in legislation such as the Bill. It is an anachronism, which dates from the time when the Government alternated between propertied classes. The qualification should not be property, but shared life experiences. People should live within the community that they seek to represent. Although it could not be contained within the remit of the Bill, the message to the Government should be that there must be a review. We cannot continue to contaminate new democratic legislation with property-based democracy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I echo the sentiments that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell) expressed, although I might not use expressions such as ``shared life experiences,'' which are very un-Uxbridge. Not only are such qualifications an anachronism, but they are open to great abuse. The Bill does not specify any size of tenure. That is a very doubtful aspect of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I should like to touch on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington and the hon. Member for Uxbridge. I listened to their arguments closely and understand them, but, as I am sure they both know, these are not the exclusive requirements that would enable someone to stand either for mayor or for assembly member. There are four conditions and it is necessary that at least one should be met. The requirement to be a property owner is not central.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> According to my reading of the Bill&#151;I should be grateful for clarification&#151;the person must satisfy ``at least one'' and only one of the conditions. If the only qualification was that he had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``during the whole of the twelve months preceding that day, occupied as owner or tenant any land or other premises in Greater London'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>that is the one requirement. I may be wrong&#151;I hope that the Minister will tell me that I am.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> A candidate must satisfy at least one of four conditions&#151;that was my point.
<P>
I should like to deal with the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which relate to the criteria by which an individual is qualified to stand as mayor or assembly member. Despite what has been said, they appear to be unnecessary. Clause 19 already requires a candidate to satisfy at least one of four conditions:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) on the relevant day he . . . continues to be, a local government elector for Greater London;
<P>
(b) he has, during the whole of the twelve months preceding that day, occupied as owner or tenant any land or other premises in Greater London;
<P>
(c) his principal or only place of work during that twelve months has been in Greater London;
<P>
(d) he has during the whole of that twelve months resided in Greater London.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those conditions are consistent with those imposed in other local elections, including London borough elections, and I remain unconvinced by the arguments that I have so far heard that elections to the GLA should be treated differently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In a moment. The personal circumstances of candidates may change during their periods of office in such a way as to make it impossible for them to reside within the boundaries of Greater London. That would, of course, mean that they could not register to vote, but it does not mean that they could not continue to carry out their responsibilities and duties either as mayor or as an assembly member.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the Minister's argument. She says that that is the current law for local government. However, is she happy to go on record, on behalf of the Government, as saying that it is entirely satisfactory that the person who is elected mayor of London might never have lived in London, never live in London and never have any intention of living in London? Is that seriously the Government's position? If she resists our amendment, that is what she is saying.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I counter with a question. Is the hon. Gentleman really proposing that people who have always worked in London and will conitnue to work in London should have no say in who is elected to be mayor and to the assembly, and no right&#151;although they have given their working lives to London&#151;to put themselves forward as candidates for mayor or for the assembly? I find his argument absolutely untenable.
<P>
<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> Under the clause&#151;I accept that we are not going to amend it today&#151;someone who had made his money from writing sordid novels and owned small properties in cities where mayoralties were being introduced could stand in every city in the land, just because he owned property. The whole point of our party was to get away from that property qualification, yet we restore it time and again when we try to democratise our system. The issue is not really for consideration with the amendments, but perhaps it should be reviewed in another place.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am sorry that my hon. Friend did not hear my first reply to him. I said that I had heard his point and understood it. I also agree that this is not the proper arena for the kind of debate that he wants.
<P>
A candidate elected to the office of mayor will certainly be expected to be doing a full-time job and that will probably also be the case for assembly members. They will all be paid salaries. In the majority of cases, therefore, they will continue to qualify under clause 19(4)(c).
<P>
Amendment No. 210 would restrict eligibility to stand for election to the offices of mayor or assembly member to people who have lived in Greater London either from the date on which the Bill is given Royal Assent or for the 12 months before the first ordinary elections. It would exclude from standing people who work in London, as I said in response to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
As I said, it is usual in local government elections for people to be qualified to stand for election if they reside in the area in question or if their principal place of work is in that same area. I can see no sensible reason why that qualification should not extend to candidates for the Greater London authority, either as candidates for the office of mayor or of assembly member. I do not propose to accept the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will ask leave to withdraw it in the light of my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I wonder when the Government will table an amendment to reintroduce the business franchise, after hearing their last few arguments. It is extraordinary that they are using exactly the same arguments as those used in support of the franchise to defend the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> No, not at this point. I shall carry on.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. the hon. Gentleman should be allowed to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I apologise, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries from a sedentary position to make points that are not relevant to the debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Member for Harrow, East please refrain from making comments from a sedentary position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We are talking about legislating for a new institution and for a matter that is before us for the first time. Examples involving other institutions may be relevant to the debate, and if the hon. Member for Harrow, East wants to speak about them he should make a speech.
<P>
I was making the point that the Minister's arguments are exactly those that could be deployed to support the reintroduction of the business franchise. They are, therefore, an unsound, unsafe and unreliable means of considering the Bill. The Liberal Democrats believe strongly that the five million people who form the London electorate are a large enough pool to ensure good-quality candidates for all of the offices. Why on earth is it argued that we have to set up the rules in a way that will deny to Londoners the fact that the Bill introduces London government, whose institution should include people who reside here and not people from elsewhere? The point made about property by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington is right. Because of that, and because the Minister's arguments are unconvincing, we shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> In brief, we shall vote against the clause for two reasons. First, we strongly believe that Londoners will be extremely unhappy if people who do not live here and have never lived here can stand for election. Secondly, there is the Minister's unwillingness, demonstrated in the debate introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton, to contemplate having an independent external adjudicator to ensure fairness in the way in which the political parties go about these elections. Because of that unwillingness to ensure that this is a Londoner's election, conducted according to local, fair and accountable government, we shall press the matter to the vote when the time comes and vote against it, in the hope that we can achieve a better set of rules and a better new clause which we shall be happy to see reintroduced on Report.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am also very unhappy about the contents of the clause, particularly the provisions stating that to be elected, a person must be a Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or a relevant citizen of the Union. This is presumably a pathetic attempt to be inclusive&#151;one of the buzz words of the moment. Are the citizens of London entitled to vote in Dublin or Harare or Helsinki? It seems odd to say the least.
<P>
I do not expect the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to agree, but I echo the sense of the Liberal Democrat Members' reservations. We could be in the bizarre situation in which a stray citizen of the Commonwealth or remote part of the European Union would qualify to vote on the basis of that part of the clause and also on the basis of their principal place of work&#151;not their sole place of work&#151;being in London. I suppose that one would define that as the place of work at which they spend the majority of their time&#151;that is, just over half.
<P>
There is the prospect of someone from a far distant place&#151;[Hon. Members: ``Scotland.''] Hon. Members are getting very excited about my Scottish origins. They might want to talk to one of their hon. Friends sitting behind them before pushing that argument too far. That person and I may share the distinction of being the only two in the Committee who will not be candidates for the mayor's job. I certainly will not be, anyway.
<P>
I will vote against the clause because it strikes me as unacceptable. The Government are suggesting that someone who is not a national of this country, and who has such a tenuous link with London that only their principal place of work is here, will be entitled to stand for election to the assembly for mayor. That flies in the face of all that we have been told about this great, bold political experiment. I suspect that this is something that the people of London have not yet realised but when they do, they will be pretty horrified.

There is a xenophobic approach to people such as British Asians, married to people who still retain an Indian or Pakistani passport. In that way, they can travel freely with their families to India or Pakistan. Otherwise they have difficulties with the immigration authorities, as I know from those who come to me with those difficulties. Many of my constituents and other black and Asian Londoners will not take kindly to the remarks that we have just heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I should make it clear that this clause and the following clauses that cover qualification and disqualification rules are based on the provisions of part V of the Local Government Act 1972 which applies to local authority membership. It would be quite wrong to adopt different criteria for people standing for the Greater London authority to those which apply for people standing for election in the London boroughs.
<P>
My hon. Friends have raised certain issues. I am perfectly happy that they should be discussed, but they must be discussed in the round rather than leading to individual changes in the electoral arrangements for one particular authority. It would therefore be inappropriate to adopt any other criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Livingstone:</B> We should recall the long-standing anger that was aroused in London Labour party members by Sir Horace Cutler, who ruled County hall for four years and yet had had no link in decades with London in terms of where he lived. He lived in Gerrards Cross and made a fortune from a massive compensation award when the Government built a motorway nearby. The only link that allowed him to qualify was that he was renting from London Transport, contrary to the rules, a flat that was supposed to be for primary occupation only. That cannot be right. My hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London spoke with passion about those people who have given a lifetime's commitment to London. One accepts that, but the abuse of the law by the rich, such as Horace Cutler, turns my stomach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a perfectly fair point. I do not intend to rush to the defence of Horace Cutler. However, I believe that the right response is for the electorate to take such matters into account in deciding who they want to have as their major. It would not be appropriate to substitute in the legislation different rules of qualification for standing to those that apply to London boroughs.
