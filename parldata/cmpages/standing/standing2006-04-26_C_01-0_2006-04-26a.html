of a second sitting, I do not intend to call starred

amendments.</div><a name="06042626000013"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000174"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take

amendments Nos. 17, 19, 21 and

22.</div><a name="06042626000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042626000175"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Alan Williams</b> (Swansea, West) (Lab): I shall be opposing

clause 1, because I have tabled an amendment proposing its deletion.

Before I speak to that proposal, however, it may be helpful in

expediting our discussion of the individual amendments to come if I

provide an update on what has happened since Second

Reading.</div><a name="06042626000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I anticipated

that there would be a considerable number of amendments, partly

because, as I said on Second Reading, in my laziness I picked up an Act

from Scotland that had already been passed to save me the tedium of

drafting. That Act was geared to Scottish law, however, so some of the

amendments are technical amendments, reflecting the fact that the legal

background to the Bill that I originally proposed is different in

England and Wales from in Scotland.</div>

<a name="06042626000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second factor contributing

to the number of amendments is that, in order to achieve passage of

this important Bill, which is much wanted by the fire services

especially, I have agreed with the Government to make certain changes.

Discussions have enabled us to agree that, as was mentioned on Second

Reading, the Bill will focus not on the whole range of assault and

impeding offences, as in Scotland, but on the offence of impeding

emergency workers who are going about their duties. That has meant that

the parts of the Bill dealing with assault have been

dropped.</div><a name="06042626000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that

respect, the Government anticipated the mood of the House better than I

did when I proposed the Bill. The mood of the House is that existing

legislation and law can be used, and that the shortcomings are not in

the law, but in enforcement. That was the clear mood on both sides of

the House on Second Reading, so I had no problem in dropping 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>the provision that related to assault and in focusing on impeding of

services. The Bill in its revised format has been welcomed by the fire

service.</div> <a name="06042626000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has

been one important development since Second Reading. At that stage the

Minister indicated that it might be appropriate for the fine level to

be set at a maximum of &#163;1,000, whereas I had suggested a fine up

to level 5, which is &#163;5,000. I am glad to say that she has since

agreed to come into line with the original proposal, so we have made an

advance on sentencing since Second Reading, and I thank her for that

positive

response.</div><a name="06042626000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another part

of the deal that I suspect will require discussion is a restriction on

coverage, because the Scottish Bill was very wide-ranging, and the

Government believe that it is more wide-ranging than is appropriate. I

am sure that the Minister will understand my asking her to expand on

their thinking.</div><a name="06042626000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before

we complain about what we have not got, it is important to remember

what the Bill will still cover if we agree to the amendments today. It

will cover firefighters, ambulance workers, coastguards, lifeboat

crews, air ambulances, people transporting blood, organs and medical

equipment in an emergency, and volunteers and voluntary organisations

running ambulance services. Even in its reduced form, the

Billis a measure that we should all be proud to be associated

with.</div>

<a name="06042626000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042626000176"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Andrew Dismore</b> (Hendon) (Lab): My right hon. Friend

downplays his achievement in introducing the Bill. I see the amendments

not as a downgrading, but as an expansion of the original Bill to deal

with a much wider problem than it countenanced. We know from Second

Reading that the original Bill dealt with a narrow but important issue

that can be dealt with by other means. The matters now contained in my

right hon. Friend&#146;s Bill cannot be dealt with by other means,

and he is to be congratulated on what he has achieved so far in

bringing forward a measure that will be of great importance to all

those engaged in emergency services. I am very pleased to be part of

the Committee in order to give the Bill my support, as I did on Second

Reading, and to welcome what he has

achieved.</div><a name="06042626000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000177"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his kindness. I have

survived for 41 years in this House of Commons by possessing a surfeit

of humility, but I am thankful for his kind comments. Since I am now

ready to accept his plaudits, I shall add that an important safeguard

has been built in to the Bill. Through new clause 1, the Minister will

have time to think again in the light of experience and of whatever

happens, which is important in our current troubled environment. The

new clause will give her order-making powers that will allow her to add

to or remove from the list of persons

covered.</div><a name="06042626000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased

to say that our endeavours have even come to the attention of our

colleagues in Northern Ireland. I understand from a Minister that

Northern Ireland, whose fire services are already protected, would like

its ambulance services to be included in the Bill. I think that we have

done a wider service than we at first anticipated. I believe that we

can deliver a worthwhile Act, and I appreciate finding out that I am

not the only one who thinks so.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="06042626000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">In opposing clause 1, I can

provide a counterbalance of succinctness. I do not support the clause

because it is just not needed. The amendments will in effect merge

clauses 1 and 2 and tidy up and shorten the Bill

considerably.</div><a name="06042626000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

divert for a minute to another amendmentin the group.

Amendment No. 21 applies to false information, and it may have been

tabled because the situation is different in Scotland; I do not know.

In any case, the Department has assured me that the amendment is not

strictly necessary, because hoax calls are already an offence in their

own right, and deliberate misinformation on the site or during the

course of an emergency falls within the &#147;impeding&#148; terms

of the Bill. On that basis, I urge my colleagues not to support the

clause.</div><a name="06042626000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042626000178"></a><b class="B">Nick

Herbert</b> (Arundel and South Downs) (Con): I repeat to the

right hon. Member for Swansea, West the congratulations on introducing

the Bill that the official Opposition extended when we supported it on

Second Reading. We very much hope that it reaches the statute

book.</div> <a name="06042626000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We understand

why it is necessary for the right hon. Gentleman to reach an agreement

with the Government about the parts of the Bill that they do not like.

Legislation is the art of the possible, and it is better to have a

measure on the statute book than no measure at all. Nevertheless, I

expressed on Second Reading some scepticism about the

Government&#146;s arguments for dropping the assault provisions from

the Bill, which is the effect of the amendments.</div>

<a name="06042626000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s

arguments fell into a number of categories. The first and most

substantial was that they preferred to rely on the operation of the

Sentencing Guidelines Council. They believed that that would enable a

signal to be sent to offenders, and, importantly, to the courts, that

there should be stiffer sentences for assaults on emergency workers. We

will of course support the sending of that signal. Will the Minister

clarify what arrangements she will make for publicity, so that the same

type of signal that would be sent by the creation of a specific offence

can be sent by the Home Office in publishing the revised sentencing

guidelines?</div><a name="06042626000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government said that a specific offence was unnecessary because of the

existence of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, and on Second Reading

the Minister stated that the situation was different in Scotland

because the sentencing guidelines mechanism does not exist there. That

is not an entirely fair representation of the situation. The Law

Society of Scotland listened to the debate in the Scottish Parliament

on the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Bill, and in a news release that it

published on 26 May 2004, it made this

observation:</div><a name="06042626000146"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some

time ago, the Lord Advocate issued guidance for procurators fiscal on

the prosecution of emergency workers. The Society understands that the

guidelines are working well in

practice.&#148;</div><a name="06042626000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">It appears

that in Scotland, guidelines similar to those that the Government have

suggested requesting from the Sentencing Guidelines Council already

existed, urging courts to give stiffer sentences for assaults on

emergency workers. Despite that fact, Members of the Scottish

Parliament took the view that it was a good 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>idea to have a separate offence. I am therefore not sure that it is

sufficient to argue that the work of the Sentencing Guidelines Council

stands in place of an aggravated

offence.</div><a name="06042626000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, as

I pointed out on Second Reading, the Government said in their manifesto

at the last election

that</div><a name="06042626000147"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we will introduce

tougher sentences for carrying replica guns, for those involved in

serious knife crimes and for those convicted of assaulting workers

serving the public.&#148;</div><a name="06042626000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

manifesto was issued just a year ago. I am sure that the Minister will

say, &#147;Well, what we meant was that tougher sentences will take

the form of a different arrangement with the Sentencing Guidelines

Council.&#148; But that was not what the Government meant in relation

to the other crimes for which they promised to introduce tougher

sentences.</div> <a name="06042626000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

penalty for carrying replica guns is being increased under clause 37 of

the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which has been through its stages in

this House and begins its Committee stage in the other place today. In

relation to that offence, the Government meant that increased sentences

would be introduced, but on the offence of assaulting workers serving

the public, they say that tougher sentences mean different sentencing

guidelines. They therefore cannot rely on the argument that reference

to the Sentencing Guidelines Council was what they meant in their

manifesto just a year ago. If the Government make a manifesto promise

that they will introduce tougher sentences, they should stick by

it.</div><a name="06042626000152"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

pm</div><a name="06042626000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third

argument adduced by the Government is that a specific offence would be

difficult to prove. That is an odd argument to make. It does not seem

remotely problematic to add to an offence the additional burden of

proving that the victim was an emergency worker. Surely it would take a

competent prosecutor a matter of minutes to establish that. I cannot

see why it should present a real impediment to proving such an

offence.</div><a name="06042626000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth

justification on which the Government relied is that racially

aggravated offences are different. The Minister explained on Second

Reading that that is the case because the purpose of those offences is

to deal with situations in which people other than the victim might be

caused fear. That argument could apply equally to emergency service

workers, and it ignores the real reason for the introduction of

racially motivated offences: Parliament wished to send a clear signal

that that type of assault was particularly egregious and was

unacceptable.</div><a name="06042626000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

conclusion, I return to the point with which I began my remarks. Hon.

Members of all parties felt on Second Reading that a particularly

important reason for the legislation was that Parliament needed to send

a signal that assaults on emergency service workers, which have

increased substantially, are totally unacceptable. That is why the

Scottish Parliament introduced similar legislation. We have not had the

opportunity to study its impact, but I have no reason to believe that

it is not working perfectly adequately. I am concerned that by removing

the specified provisions from the Bill, we are weakening that signal.

By relying on the Sentencing Guidelines Council, we are not sending the

tough signal that we would send by 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>introducing a specific offence. I understand the Minister&#146;s

arguments for not wishing to do so, but I think on balance that we

should have stuck to the original proposals.</div>

<a name="06042626000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister will no doubt

respond to my points. We shall not press the matter, because we wish

the Bill to pass and we respect the reasons of the right hon. Member

for Swansea, West for tabling his amendments, but it is a pity that

just one year after the Government made their manifesto commitment to

deal with the problem, they have effectively reneged on

it.</div><a name="06042626000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042626000179"></a><b class="B">Richard

Younger-Ross</b> (Teignbridge) (LD): I congratulate the right

hon. Member for Swansea, West on promoting the Bill and on his success

in getting this far. His previous ministerial experience has obviously

stood him well in negotiating with the Government to get us where we

are today&#151;a point at which, we hope, the Bill will become

legislation.</div><a name="06042626000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will

not repeat everything that the Conservative spokesman has said. I agree

entirely with his points and I echo the regrets that he has expressed.

It is a great shame that the Bill is only half the Bill that it could

be&#151;but half a Bill is better than no Bill, so we are happy to

support it. Out of respect to the right hon. Member for Swansea, West,

who has negotiated us to where we are now, we shall not press any of

the clauses to a vote.</div>

<a name="06042626000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, I hope that the

Minister will tell us why we are losing what should be a clear signal

about the protection of emergency workers. During the last Parliament,

I tabled an early-day motion that received broad support across the

House proposing that assault on an emergency worker should be a summary

conviction. That was different from what is now proposed. The offence,

which under sentencing guidelines is just an assault, would have been

put on par with assault on a police officer. A nurse, doctor or

fireman, or any other emergency worker going about their duty, deserves

the protection of the law in the same way that police officers do in

going about their duty. Recent times have seen an increase not only in

hindrance to fire and other emergency services, but in assaults on

them.</div> <a name="06042626000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the national

health service, there has been progress in prosecuting for assaults on

medical staff, but I feel strongly that the likelihood of assaults will

be reduced only if the Government send a clear signal to the people who

offend to make it clear that such action is not acceptable. Those in

the emergency services are trying to protect and save the lives of

others. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the points that have

been made. If she has conceded on the penalties, as the right hon.

Gentleman said, she could talk to her Department about whether it would

really be a problem for assault on an emergency worker to become a

summary

conviction.</div><a name="06042626000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other

sadness is the categories of emergency worker that have been taken out

of the Bill. As I understand it, the amendments will mean that social

workers no longer receive the protection that other workers do. If I am

wrong, I hope that the Minister will intervene. She has not intervened,

so I take it my interpretation is correct. I should be grateful if she

could clarify that.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="06042626000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause on social workers was

inserted as an amendment to the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005.

The Labour party in Scotland accepted the amendment on the grounds that

it felt that emergency workers included social workers who undertook

certain categories of work, because there were times, especially when

dealing with child orders, that stresses and the risk of assault were

high in that role. If social workers are doing child intervention work,

emotions can run very high in the affected families. Indications point

to an increasing number of assaults on people doing such work. It would

be a great shame if they were singled out and did not receive the same

sort of protection as other emergency workers will receive under the

Bill. Will the Minister explain why those exceptions and deletions are

being made in the Bill?</div>

<a name="06042626000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate the right hon.

Gentleman again on getting this far. I wish him every success with the

Bill, and I look forward to its receiving Royal Assent within this

Parliament, as I hope it will. We will not oppose it, but we would like

further explanation from the Government as to why they are cutting it

in

half.</div><a name="06042626000056"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000180"></a>The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Fiona

Mactaggart):</b> It is a pleasure to support this private

Member&#146;s Bill under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton.</div>

<a name="06042626000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are having something like a

mini-Second Reading debate on a non-stand part debate for clause 1. I

wish to deal with the points that hon. Members have made, because they

go to the heart of what we are trying to achieve in the Bill. We are

trying to get rid of a very particular and serious wrong that often

leads to further wrongs&#151;the often wilful obstruction

ofblue-light emergency workers in the course of their duty of

trying to protect members of the public. Frankly, such activity is

unacceptable and outrageous, which is precisely why we made the

commitments on these matters set out in our election manifesto. I am

glad to have the opportunity to describe how we are delivering on those

commitments, and how the Bill will help us to do so.</div>

<a name="06042626000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members have

referred to provisions for racially aggravated assaults. That mechanism

was rightly adduced by the Government before we had a process such as

the Sentencing Guidelines Council. The council gives us a tool to be

used in any area where an aggravating factor exists in respect of a

particular offence. Given that we have such a tool, it is wrong not to

use it for the whole range of aggravating factors, including one

already acknowledged in an initial guideline involving people who are

serving the public. The sentencing guidelines formulation on violent

crime that is due to be made available shortly will deal with assault,

and I hope that it will not only deal clearly with someone who is

serving the public, but specifically highlight emergency

workers.</div><a name="06042626000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) mentioned social workers.

They are a precise example that goes beyond the main case that we are

dealing with in the Bill and relates not to blue-light type

emergencies, as it were, but to situations thatare full of

the tension, anger and anxiety of anemergency-type

intervention in a family&#146;s life that could put a social worker

at risk. Such situations would be covered by the offence of assaulting

an individual, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>which would be aggravated by the fact that the person was serving the

public at the time when they were

assaulted.</div><a name="06042626000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

very important difference regarding the advice given to procurators

fiscal. That advice sends out a signal of the sort that Opposition

Members mentioned, but it does not have the force of the Sentencing

Guidelines Council, which does much more than send a signal or give

advice. Courts are obliged specifically under law to follow the

guidelines, and if they do not, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides

that they must state publicly in court why they have not. We therefore

have a powerful mechanism to ensure that the status of sentencing

guidelines is much more significant that anything that exists in

Scotland or which has existed previously. That is the appropriate way

in which to deal with aggravation and the fact that the person who has

been assaulted was serving the

public.</div><a name="06042626000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) rightly asked how we

will make sure that the signal is heard and how it will be publicised.

Hon. Members will be aware of the Government&#146;s respect campaign.

Such matters are at the heart of that campaign. We shall not just

announce Sentencing Guidelines Council matters in the usual way. It is

right we have an open, consultative process, but the problem is that

the point at which the newspapers will report a matter is when we have

a draft guideline and they want to suggest things that we might wish to

change. I see hon. Friends nodding their heads. Perhaps they are

thinking about the recent proposed draft

guidelines.</div><a name="06042626000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such

issues do not receive sufficient publicity after they have been through

the processes of comment and discussion by the Home Affairs Committee

and elsewhere. We need to beef up the publicity. I am happy to give the

Committee an absolute commitment not only that we will build such

matters into the respect campaign, but that when the guideline is

published, we will, probably working with trade unions, other workers

in the field and employers, put energy into ensuring proper public

awareness.</div> <a name="06042626000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall

deliver our manifesto commitment for tougher sentences not only by

sending signals, but by putting in place a tough mechanism that courts

have a duty to follow. Comments were made in the Chamber earlier today

about the Home Office over-legislating. When we can create sensible

arrangements in order to deliver the will of the House and the public,

as they expect when they vote in a general election, without primary

legislation, it is right and proper to do so. That will do more than

send a clear signal; it will ensure that things

happen.</div><a name="06042626000153"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30

pm</div><a name="06042626000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like

to join in the praise bayed by Members on both sides of the Committee

of my right hon. Friend not only for his determination&#151;we have

had some robust conversations&#151;but for his flexibility. As a

consequence, we can fill a lacuna in legislation. People have been able

to obstruct workers, including ambulance workers in particular, with

impunity, and his Bill gives us an opportunity to provide better public

protection. I am grateful to him for co-operating with the Government

in order to make the Bill simpler, and more effective and flexible. If

it becomes clear that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>categories of public employees should be added, we will have the

capacity to add them in future without further primary

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000181"></a>Nick

Herbert:</b><b class="B"> </b>I thank the Minister for her explanation

of some of the differences between Scotland, and England and Wales.

Will she respond to my point about the Labour party manifesto promises

of tougher sentences for certain crimes and about where such sentences

were introduced? I mentioned the carrying of replica guns. Clause 37 of

the Violent Crime Reduction Bill increases the sentence for that

offence from six to 12 months. Why was the Sentencing Guidelines

Council not sufficient in relation to that

offence?</div><a name="06042626000066"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000182"></a>Fiona

Mactaggart:</b> We are talking here about a single offence,

not a separate one. The hon. Gentleman is referring to offences that

are already on the statute book. The original version of my right hon.

Friend&#146;s legislation suggested a separate and new offence, not a

heavier sentence for an existing one. We have an existing offence of

assault and a mechanism that can produce a heavier sentence. We can

obtain that heavier sentence by using the sentencing guidelines tool.

In the cases to which the hon. Gentleman is referring, there is a

specific offence, such as that of carrying a

weapon.</div><a name="06042626000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000185"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> Amendment No. 2 is quite a useful shorthand

amendment in that it deals with the problem of inadvertence far more

subtly than did the Scottish drafting. I am assured by the Home Office

and legal advisers that the phrase &#147;without reasonable

excuse&#148; covers all that is required, and does so singularly

succinctly. I commend the amendment to the

Committee.</div><a name="06042626000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In effect,

we have already had the debate on assault, but I shall make one

observation: it is one thing to talk about what a Government Bill can

do, and another to talk about what is achievable with a private

Member&#146;s Bill. I do not wish to tweak the tail of

thehon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, but on his

Benches sits the scourge of the private Member&#146;s Bill, who

delights in sabotaging Bill after Bill, and does so with great ability.

He ominously stood up, early on, and made it clear to me that he would

not tolerate the inclusion of a new offence of assault. Since I like

him very much and admire him enormously&#151;at one time, I had a

similar job to his on the Front Bench, giving us a sort of union

compatibility&#151;I recognised that his 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>threat was not insignificant. It was more of a threat in some ways than

that of my hon. Friend the Minister, I think. As we shall have only one

day for Report, I responded not just to the pressures from my own

Benches, but to the formidable pressures from the Opposition

Benches.</div><a name="06042626000073"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000186"></a>Fiona

Mactaggart:</b> We covered the critical issues relevant to

this group of amendments in an earlier debate. The provision will

create a new offence covering ambulance and lifeboat crews and

coastguards and&#151;it will probably help Committee members if I

reassure them on this point&#151;it will be an anchor for early

interventions using some of the tools that I referred to on Second

Reading, such as acceptable behaviour contracts and so on.</div>

<a name="06042626000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simplifying the clause by means

of the phrase &#147;without reasonable excuse&#148; will enable us

to get something we all want&#151;success in prosecutions. One of our

initial anxieties about the structure of the original Bill was that it

was relatively laborious. Unfortunately, we have found that legislation

of that kind can be an unintended barrier to success in pursuing

prosecutions.</div>

Herbert:</b> I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I

wonder whether the right hon. Member for Swansea, West or the Minister

can answer a point that has just occurred to me. We have just agreed

amendments relating to protection for people who are employed by a

relevant NHS body to provide services. What is the position of St. John

Ambulance workers? They might not be employed by the NHS but they

provide important ambulance services for the public. I am sure that the

Committee would agree that they should be included in the protections

accorded by this Bill, and I shall be grateful for clarification as to

whether that is the case.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042626000194"></a>Mr.

generally, the air ambulance and volunteers and voluntary organisations

running ambulances. I hope that that satisfies the hon.

Williams:</b> I thank all my colleagues who have given their

time to this. I know that several of them are involved in pre-election

work outside the House and have come in specially to show their

support. I appreciate all the support I have had from colleagues,

including those opposite. I owe the hon. Member for Teignbridge special

gratitude for having drawn the Scottish Act to my attention when I was

deciding what to do in respect of this private Member&#146;s Bill. I

am indebted to him for that and for his further

support.</div><a name="06042626000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the

Minister for her co-operation and for the fact that at least I got an

anaesthetic before my arm was twisted. May I thank you, Mr. Benton, for

putting up with my incompetence in reading two amendments ahead,

time?</div><a name="06042626000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put
