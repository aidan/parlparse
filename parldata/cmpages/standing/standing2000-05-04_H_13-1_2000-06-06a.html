<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 279, line 25, leave out ``5%'' and insert ``a sum equal to the running costs of the intermediary.''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 170, in page 279, line 25, leave out ``5%'' and insert ``10%''.

<P>
No. 171, in page 279, line 25, after ``5%'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and, where the total amount of all such payments and other benefits is £40,000 or less, reduce that amount by an additional £1,000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 172, in page 279, line 25, after ``5%'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or £1,000, whichever produces the largest reduction.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment goes to the heart of one of our main complaints about schedule 12. Paragraph 7 in part II of the schedule sets out the method of calculating a deemed schedule E payment. There are nine steps to be taken to reach the final figure.

<P>
Step one allows for a deduction of 5 per cent. from the total amount received. That figure sits in isolation-the Bill does not say what it is for. We understand from Government press releases and statements that it relates to business expenses. However, it is not simply that: it is in lieu of the right to deduct the proper running costs for the intermediary. The amendment would replace that arbitrary figure of 5 per cent. with the genuine costs for the intermediary.

<P>
We are dealing with a sector that works extensively through intermediaries and private service companies, who incur substantial expenditure and disbursements in the course of their duties. There are accounting costs, legal costs, training costs, the cost of supplying support staff and, importantly, the cost of the equipment that will allow the worker to provide the services and maintain the necessary skills at home. There are travel costs, including the cost of motor cars. Those are the normal, day-to-day business expenses of the typical self-employed person. Imposing the figure of 5 per cent. may make the Inland Revenue's burden lighter, but it is grossly unfair on the individuals concerned.

<P>
The costs will, almost certainly, come to more than
5 per cent. The figure is inadequate, and people could be taxed on money that they have not received. It is taxation on earnings that do not exist. It is taxation on turnover, rather than income. It is taxation on those small companies that are vulnerable to this measure, but not on the big companies that will, by and large, be exempt.

<P>
The advantage that the large providers have is that they will continue to be taxed on company profits, while the small independent service providers caught by IR35 will pay tax on company income. There is a fundamental difference. I have no intention of dwelling on the point, but I want the Paymaster General to explain the arbitrary figure of 5 per cent. What about someone whose costs are more than 5 per cent? The Paymaster General should address the following situation: if she were running a shop in Bristol, selling cigarettes and the usual corner shop stuff, she would be allowed to make all the relevant deductions for her business. However, were she to set herself up as a consultant, in the manner that we are discussing, she would fall foul of the provisions. Why is it okay to sell things, but not knowledge? Such issues are at the heart of the measure.

<P>
In the Committee of the House, the Paymaster General was pressed on clause 59 three times by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed), but we did not get an answer. How was this figure arrived at, and why does it not equal the running costs of the intermediary?

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I want to reinforce the points made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) and support our amendments, which focus on the same points but advance different remedies. We, too, are concerned that this figure, which shows the inconsistency of the Government's position, has been plucked from the air with no particular rationale. If those who run personal service companies are employed, there is no case for a 5 per cent. figure, but if they are self-employed, 5 per cent. is almost certainly too low. As the hon. Gentleman said, many of the business costs that such people incur are far higher than 5 per cent. of turnover. When one takes account of the types of expenditure to which he referred, estimates range from a minimum of 10 per cent. to a maximum of 20 per cent. In IT, there are no one-off training courses and accreditations that last an entire career. Training in IT is on-going, and incurs much higher costs than in many other industries. Moreover, there are the equipment costs to which reference has been made. Therefore, the Paymaster General must give a better explanation of why the figure is only 5 per cent.

<P>
We have tabled amendments Nos. 171 and 172 in part because the 5 per cent. figure appears to work against the interests of the smaller business. Because it is a percentage of turnover, available reductions in tax due will be a low absolute amount. Our proposal, which draws on suggestions made by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, would enable the introduction of a de minimis figure, so that companies and individuals who earn little and experience relatively hard times would not be discriminated against.

<P>
I believe that there is a duty on the Paymaster General to explain not merely how the 5 per cent. figure was arrived at, but why such a figure-which, as I said, seems to have been plucked from the air-was adopted, given that it is not helpful to the smaller business. As was noted in previous debates, it is the smaller business that this legislation will hinder most, and I hope that the Paymaster General's response will enlighten us.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I want to add to the debate a particular case study, to which I have referred on the Floor of the House. A constituent of mine-one of the few in West Sussex who voted for the Labour party at the general election-is outraged. He is one of many people who worked for a major pan-European high-tech conglomerate, which encouraged all its high-tech staff to become self-employed. This individual had gross revenues of around £60,000 to £65,000 and bona fide expenses of between £11,000 and £14,000. The proposals will require him to find expenses from after-tax income on more than half his expenses-

<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): Does the hon. Gentleman think that it was right for the company that he mentioned to deal with so many of its staff in that way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am a realist, and in today's world that is what happens. The company required high-tech people to work on particular projects, but it did not want to have them on a permanent payroll-[
Interruption.] Let me deal with this point. It could not afford to employ them on a permanent basis. It had to choose between employing a smaller number of people on a permanent basis and a larger number of people on a different basis. Constructive dismissal was not involved-I am glad to say that the individuals concerned were bright enough, and that their lawyers and accountants have ways of dealing with this most unjust proposal. We should not bury our heads in the sand or misunderstand the parameters of the new economy-increasing numbers of people will become self-employed. The hon. Gentleman may or may not approve of that, but that is not the point. We need to live with the world as it is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman approve of the situation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That depends on whether it is justified. It is manifestly better to have an unemployment rate of around 5 per cent. under the new economy with self-employment than the rate that applies in the rest of continental Europe, which lacks the flexibility of such employment-its rate is around 20 per cent. It is infinitely better to be self-employed than unemployed.

<P>
I object to the Government's view that the self-employed are tax fiddlers-they are a crucial part of our economy. When the economy goes down, it is crucially important that people can easily become self-employed-in this country, they can do so-and there is a favourable tax regime, such as that which applies in the United States. It is not easy for people in continental Europe to become self-employed. One shoots oneself in the foot if one makes it unattractive to be self-employed.

<P>
I revert to the essential issue, which is that the rate of bona fide business expenses for the self-employed, who hire out their services to companies, will vary considerably, depending on, for example, what they do, how far they have to travel, what the skill requirements are and what physcial equipment is needed. The Chancellor allegedly makes fairness the key plank of his tax policy. Hundreds of thousands of high-tech people are more incensed about this issue than about any other. There is no justification for the approach, which should be changed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I apologise to you, Mr. Cook, and to Committee members, for being slightly late on parade. I had gone back to my office to seek out a letter that I referred to this morning. I did so slightly inaccurately-my memory played tricks on me.

<P>
The letter, which was from my constituent, Mr. Shearer, was addressed to the Paymaster General and is dated 19 November. I expect that during the interregnum she, too, may have sought out his letter-if she did, we shall both be able to refer to it. Mr. Shearer's views are typical of those that are held by personal service companies in my constituency, many of which have written to me. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General answered some of the questions that Mr. Shearer raised about the 5 per cent. allowance. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The facts in my own case are these: from earned fees averaging £55,000, I have incurred £10,000 as cost of sales (including significant investments in computers and in training) and around £6,500 in administration costs. You may notice that this latter figure is well in excess of the 5 per cent. maximum that will be allowed under the new IR35 rules. Averaged across the last four years, total tax and NI have amounted to £10,300, and retained profit to just £1,000-barely enough to carry the family over a two-month period in 1996 when the contract work simply dried up.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's illustration of the costs faced by his constituent seems to go to the heart of why the Government have got it wrong. When such a person talks about the cost of sales, that must involve marketing and trying to win contracts. An employee never faces such costs.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. That is a further distinguishing factor for personal service companies, and another reason why the hundreds of people who have corresponded on the matter feel strongly that they are being discriminated against.

<P>
In her earlier remarks, the Paymaster said that she could not understand why only those in the IT industry had rebelled. That is probably because IT people are able rapidly to communicate with each other and were quick off the blocks in organising themselves. Mr. Shearer is typical of the long-standing business man who will be disadvantaged by the proposal.

<P>
I hope that the Paymaster will be able to give us a detailed breakdown of how the 5 per cent. figure was arrived at. When, as happens in government, a figure is presented to a Minister and he asks where it came from, a glazed look often goes across the official's face as they think, ``Where did it come from?'' Usually, two and a half is a low number, seven or eight is a high number, and five magically happens to be in between. Mr. Shearer would be interested to know why 5 per cent. was chosen.

<P>
On the subject of the 5 per cent. figure, an accountancy company called Warr & Co.-which is not, perhaps, prompted by the forces and factors to which the Paymaster alluded in her earlier remarks-published on the internet an interview with Sarah Walker, assistant director of personal taxation at the Inland Revenue. She gave Mr. Warr some interesting answers about the implications of the 5 per cent. figure, and I would be grateful for the Paymaster's comments on them.

<P>
Mr. Warr began his first question on the subject as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many computer contractors arrange insurance policies for their companies. These are often combined policies and typically include professional indemnity insurance, employer's liability insurance, public liability insurance and equipment insurance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
His query was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Will premiums for such insurance be allowed in addition to the general 5 per cent. allowance?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Members of the Committee will be unsurprised to learn that, in her answer, Sarah Walker stuck rigidly to the official line, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only premiums that will be allowable in addition to the general 5 per cent. allowance will be those for professional indemnity insurance as these are in any case allowable schedule E deductions. Premiums for employers liability and public liability insurance will only be deductible as part of the 5 per cent. allowance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why did she give that answer?

<P>
Mr. Warr's next question was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So how will combined policies be dealt with?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He received the following answer:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the premium is broken down, the element relating to professional indemnity insurance will be allowable. If not, the whole premium will only be deductible as part of the general 5 per cent. allowance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I ask for an explanation of that answer.

<P>
Mr. Warr then asked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the computer industry work related training is almost always provided by employers. Computer contractors need to arrange their own training. Course fees, which are about £500 per day, will often quickly use up the 5 per cent. allowance. What is the reason for not allowing training costs as an expense in addition to the 5 per cent. general allowance in the same way as it is proposed to allow professional indemnity insurance?<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I would be interested to know the Paymaster General's view on that, bearing in mind the earlier clauses in the Bill that were designed to encourage the training of people who are employed. The Government have built on the advances made in that area by the previous Administration. It seems somewhat penny pinching to be quite so ``tight'' when it comes to the allowance for suitable training. Will the Paymaster General be kind enough to comment on these specific questions when she responds to the debate on the amendments?

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I shall try to deal specifically with the points that right hon. and hon. Members have raised. I shall take a lead from the hon. Member for Croydon, South in trying to be brief.

<P>
The points raised included the question of how we settled on the figure of 5 per cent. We did not pluck it out of the air, and I shall demonstrate to the hon. Gentleman how we arrived at it. I shall also deal with the point about small businesses made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and the point raised by the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack).

<P>
I shall start by addressing the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). The provisions are not about preventing people from being self-employed. On the contrary, they are designed to protect the status of the self-employed and to stop employees trying to access reliefs in the tax system that are designated either for small companies or for the self-employed. The tax rules for small companies were never meant to apply to employees. The discussions that we had this morning focused on the Government's position that the provision affects income only from engagements that would have constituted employment if the person in question had entered into a direct relationship with the client. The Bill seeks to ensure that people in that employee relationship have access only to tax reliefs to which other employees are entitled.

<P>
I shall come to the question of how the figure of 5 per cent. was settled on in a moment. However, I also want to point out that we are not saying that all service companies can have only 5 per cent. of their running costs taken into consideration. The 5 per cent. will apply to the proportion of a service company's contracts that relate to people in an employee relationship. Those contracts that clearly relate to self-employment-as determined by case law-will have access to the normal arrangements relating to the self-employed or to businesses.

<P>
I shall explain how we arrived at the figure of 5 per cent. The deduction that we propose is straightforward and fair. We have examined the way in which we allow for expenses in cases to which the legislation applies. Therefore, anyone who is self-employed or running a legitimate business will be entitled to operate within that category of the tax system. It is important that all right hon. and hon. Members keep firmly fixed in their minds the fact that the provisions apply only in circumstances that meet the accepted definition of employment, except in cases of the existence of an intermediary. We discussed that at some length this morning.

<P>
In calculating the deemed salary on which tax and class 1 national insurance contributions are to be paid, we shall allow people to deduct any expenses met by their intermediary that an employee of the client would be allowed to claim if he or she had incurred them personally. In fact, the rules for a service company worker are already more generous than for an employee in one important respect, even when such a worker's position is identical to an employee. This legislation will leave that situation untouched.

<P>
A worker who has a series of short employments with clients in different parts of the country will not normally be able to claim tax relief for the cost of travelling from home to work. Each engagement is a separate employment, and travel between home and work is not normally deductible under the rules for employees. However, a worker who is continuously employed by his service company, and undertakes contracts for clients of the service company in different places, can claim the costs of travelling to and from those clients' premises. That is because a client's premises can be treated as a temporary place of work, provided that the worker does not expect to work there for more than 40 per cent. of the time in a period exceeding 24 months. The legislation will allow this more generous treatment to continue, even where there is the same employee relationship.

<P>
The legislation will also allow workers to deduct premiums for professional indemnity insurance, pension contributions made by the intermediary for his or her benefit, and employer's national insurance contributions that are paid by the intermediary. The deductions are sufficient to put service company workers in the same position as employees who do the same job. We should remember that the legislation will apply only if the worker is doing the same job as an employee. In some cases, because of the travel rules that I have described, they will be better off than employees on similar short-term contracts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I first deal with the 5 per cent. figure?

<P>
However, we recognise that operating through a service company entails costs such as accountants' fees and Companies House registration charges. An Inland Revenue survey of the accounts of service companies that are logged with us found that, on average, they spend 2 per cent. of turnover on such associated costs. All Committee members will agree that, even if such companies have to spend a little more in future to ensure that they comply with the legislation, the 5 per cent. that we are allowing is well within their curent costs, and will allow further room for manoeuvre. The same service companies that are spending 2 per cent. of turnover are saying that the 5 per cent. that we propose to give them is not enough.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am closely following what the Paymaster General is saying, and I have firmly in mind her caution that the issue of employment, rather than self-employment, should be addressed, but two points arise. She mentioned that national insurance contributions from the intermediary will be deductible. Does she acknowledge that that is step seven, and the
5 per cent. will be deducted at step one? Secondly, she has still missed the big ones: training, support staff and equipment. Perhaps she can assure me that she will deal with those matters.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Indeed, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I was about to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am sorry, I thought that the Paymaster General had finished.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I have not finished. It is possible to make only one point at a time-I cannot speak in stereo.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Alas.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Alas, yes. The hon. Gentleman made the point that the 5 per cent. comes off first. [
Interruption.] Yes, precisely. We are giving people
5 per cent. straight away, and they can still deduct other expenses. It is a very generous formula.

<P>
We could have specified that service companies could deduct certain categories of expenses involving a long list of items to be argued about in Committee and elsewhere. A complicated procedure for making claims and for getting Revenue clearance would then ensue. Instead, we decided to make the process simple by allowing 5 per cent. of turnover in all cases. As I have said, that compares with evidence that companies are currently spending about 2 per cent. on average. We are being very generous in giving people who continue to work through service companies a fair reflection of their costs.

<P>
I was also asked about training costs. It is important to consider how employees and the self-employed are treated under the tax system in relation to training costs, and to consider who is entitled to deductions. The Bill seeks to ensure that an employee will get the same deductions as any other employee. For instance, employees can claim some deductions for training expenses, through fairly restrictive rules. Why should someone employed in a company who decides that they want to improve their position by taking a training course be treated differently?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The employers pay.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that the employers pay. Precisely. If a person has an employee relationship with their service company, that raises other issues. I am talking about a person who is employed by a client, and interposes the service company only for tax purposes so as to disguise his true employment status. I have a breakdown of the different reliefs available, depending on one's status and on whether one is an employee, self-employed or running one's own company. I have no objection to circulating those details to the Committee. The hon. Gentleman's amendment proposes a long list of unspecified deductions. We believe that it will be simpler to set a figure of 5 per cent. that does not require itemisation or incur administration costs.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 171 and 172 would give a greater allowance to service company workers on lower earnings, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton explained.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may just make this point on small business, I will then give way.

<P>
We believe that workers at the lower end of the income scale who use service companies tend to use umbrella companies set up by accountants. The fees for such companies tend to be quite small: they are advertised for as little as £100 a year. Indeed, I question whether there is any reason for people to continue to use these service companies as an employee, once the tax and national insurance loophole that has made them so attractive has been removed. I cannot remember the figure that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton quoted for small companies, but if their setting-up costs are in the region of £100, and we are giving them an allowance of 5 per cent. of turnover, that hardly constitutes discrimination against them.

<P>
It is reasonable to assume that the complexity of the task of running the service company, including duties such as assessing contracts and insurance costs, will be greater for companies with a larger turnover. None the less, I am satisfied that, in relation to the exact costs that smaller or larger companies currently face, the 5 per cent. allowance will be more generous.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was trying to intervene before the Paymaster General moved on to the Liberal Democrat amendments. Will she comment on the costs of equipment and support staff?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the relevant person is designated to be self-employed by IR35, the expenses for support staff and equipment will be covered by the current self-employment legislation, but if the person is an employee, he will not get a tax break for support staff or equipment because that is the nature of being an employee. [
Interruption.] With respect to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, that is not tough.

<P>
I return to the point that I was making earlier. The employment test contains specific requirements about the client's premises, the specified hours and tasks, the hourly rate and any equipment that is provided. The tax system does not give tax relief to the millions of employees who operate in that situation. If I were in the pay-as-you-earn system as an employee and I happened to require a computer, I should not be entitled to make an application or to claim that it constituted support. We are regularising the situation-employees will get what employees should get, and the self-employed will get what companies and the self-employed should get, namely, the reliefs to which hon. Members have referred.

<P>
That returns us to the heart of the matter. To answer the right hon. Member for Fylde, people who are legitimately self-employed will continue to be able to deduct the expenses that they are entitled to deduct on that basis. If they are employees, they come under the same tax regime as other employees.

<P>
Two concessions that are more generous than those that apply to employees will apply to those who run service companies. In view of all of the complaints that there have been, I am beginning to wonder why we made such concessions. We shall allow the 5 per cent. deduction, and, as I said earlier, there will be allowances for expenses and travel costs.

<P>
Yield would be increased if running costs and the reported accountancy charges for running a company were allowed instead of the 5 per cent. figure. That is another instance in which the 5 per cent. figure is shown to be generous.

<P>
Some amendments sought to raise the figure above 5 per cent., but there is no justification for doing so. We have gone through the matter logically-we have examined the current costs for companies, increased the amount that they pay and ensured that if employees are involved, they are taxed as such. If a company or a self-employed person is involved, they should be taxed as such, according to their status. On those grounds, I hope that Committee members will reject the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I have listened with care to the deliberate way in which the Paymaster General laid out her case. She accounted for 2 per cent. of the 5 per cent., but I should like to know what constitutes the remaining 3 per cent. I was intrigued by her meticulous approach to describing how 2 per cent. accounted for certain costs, but a degree of fuzziness entered her comments about the remaining 3 per cent.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Just a moment. I should like to make my point, then I shall be delighted to give way. Will she make public exactly what categories of costs were considered by the Inland Revenue, and the size of the sample?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The other 3 per cent. is generosity. It is intended to give people more than they are currently spending, or are likely to spend, in order to pave the way for the change. That is straightforward.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> It is wholly uncharacteristic of the Inland Revenue and the Treasury to exercise 3 per cent.'s worth of generosity. I do not want the Paymaster General to be hauled up before the Chancellor for having been over-generous.

<P>
An interesting selection of items seemed to be involved. I am intrigued to know exactly what categories were considered by the Inland Revenue, and why they would be limited only to those that the Paymaster General enunciated. The Treasury is not in the business of giving away money, and she must have been given a note justifying the additional 3 per cent. Was the 5 per cent. figure plucked out of the air? She has gone so far as to say that two fifths of it was not: it was the result of an exercise to examine a selection of accounts. If we are to decide whether 5 per cent. is the correct figure, it would be helpful to know what else was in the survey.

<P>
This is also important in terms of open government and information. In her remarks, the Paymaster General has gone to some lengths to try to clarify potential misunderstandings. People read what we say in Committee; it is clear from the internet quotations that we have drawn upon that by tomorrow, or the day after at the latest, our proceedings will be available for world access. Those people will be interested to know more about how the figure was justified. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would give the Committee a few more details, so that people who favour 5 per cent. will be able to judge whether she is being fair, and those who want a figure that is greater will know whether their concerns have been properly addressed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General's speech was that of someone who does not live in the real world, who has no experience of what it is like to be at the coalface of British industry and lacks any understanding of the problems of the IT sector. She had the gall to tell the Committee that she was being generous in giving away that extra 3 per cent. It is not generous if one is spending thousands of pounds on equipment, staff and training. The only reason that she can give us as to why that money is not exempt is that such people are now classed as employees, and, as employees do not get it, they cannot have it.

<P>
Three categories of people are involved: the employed, the self-employed and those who were self-employed and have been caught by the provision and classed as employed. It is the third group that is falling foul of the provision. Does she think that they are buying their computers with Scotch mist or paying their staff with vouchers? Does she think that they buy their equipment second hand in a car boot sale? Does she think that training courses are something that can be avoided? That expenditure has been properly incurred; to say that people are not entitled to that money displays a total lack of understanding of the way in which the British economy works.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I tend to agree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the idea that 5 per cent. is generous will be laughed at outside the House of Commons. People know what the real costs of doing business are, and 5 per cent. does not represent those costs.

<P>
Does the Paymaster General agree that some people who operate personal service companies will be working on one contract, for which the Inland Revenue will, under the new rules, deem them to be employees, while working simultaneously on another contract, for which the Inland Revenue will deem them to be self-employed or which allows them to operate a personal service company that does not fall under the terms of the Bill? How will the 5 per cent. rule operate in such circumstances, in tandem with the normal rules for setting off business costs?

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Am I right in believing that, in those circumstances-there will be a number of such cases, given the lack of clarity in the Bill-some people will be able to write off some of their training costs in respect of some of their contracts, but will operate under the 5 per cent. rule in respect of other contracts?

<P>
The Paymaster General seems to be indignant about the point made with respect to training. She seems to think that people who are running personal service companies and are deemed to be employees should have no write-down of those training costs.

<P>
Before I was elected to the House, I was a management consultant. My training in IT and other skills was paid for by my employer. There was no question of my having to pay for it. People who run personal service companies and who, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, previously thought that they were self-employed will be caught by the legislation and will have to meet their training costs. There is no way that the people who give out the contracts will decide, given the arrival of IR35, that they will pay the training costs. As the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, the Paymaster General is not living in the real world. Training costs are a fixed cost. That reality will not change just because the Paymaster General has changed the boundaries.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Lady will be more humble in her response than she was in her previous speech, and that she will at least be open-minded about changing her position.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Much as it pains me, I have to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. The entitlement of self-employed people to reliefs is contained within the system. There is no limit on the legitimate expenses that can be deducted for self-employed contracts, subject to the normal rules. If a person is deemed to be self-employed in the contracts that they have with their clients-and our consultation showed that they wanted the ability to decide that themselves-the relevant rules will apply.

<P>
The 5 per cent. figure covers the employed or employee type of income and is in addition to what people get on the contracts for which they are deemed to be self-employed. The arguments about support for the company, training costs or support costs apply to the category in which the contracts are deemed to be self-employed, as would normally be the case. If people deem that some of their contracts are employee contracts, they will be entitled only to the 5 per cent. figure, putting them in the same position-or a slightly more generous position-as employees. The 2 per cent. figure is an average costs. In allowing the 5 per cent. figure to apply in all cases, I took the view that that would allow for variations in circumstances, and that that was the reasonable thing to do. Opposition Members are getting worked up about the matter because they cannot quite grasp that the position of people who are self-employed, who will be unaffected by this legislation, differs from those in disguised employment, who will be caught by this legislation.

<P>
I think that I have answered as clearly as I can the points raised by the hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton and for Croydon, South. Employees in the tax system will be treated fairly, and the position of those who are self-employed will remain the same.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I want briefly to respond to the Paymaster General's comments on a personal service company that operates two contracts simultaneously: one for which it is deemed to be self-employed, and another for which it is deemed to be employed. How will the business costs be proportioned and ultimately written off? I realise that, under an employee contract, the 5 per cent. rule will apply, and the normal rules will apply to a self-employed contract. However, if a lot of money has been spent on training and computer hardware in a particular year, how will such costs be proportioned between the two contracts?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I thought that I was helping the Paymaster General by giving her the opportunity to explain in a little more detail where the 3 per cent. comes from. I have got the message about the different categories of employment, so I do not need to be lectured again on that, but there are some people whose real-world lives are affected by this allowance. I thought that that was what Committee members who have debated these amendments were probing?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Not probing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend says that he was not probing. He is clearly stirred to even greater heights than me, and I acknowledge that my approach is more moderate. I am just a humble seeker after truth.

<P>
I simply want to find out the reason for the 3 per cent., and ask the Paymaster General to shine a light on why this sudden rash of generosity has overcome her. She said that the 5 per cent. figure would cater for variation, but for some, variation will fall the other side of that figure. They would like to know why such company expenses may not be fully relieved, just as those with expenses of less than 5 per cent. will bask in the Paymaster General's generosity. So far, she has chosen not to answer that point in detail, but if a figure is in the public domain, we should know how it was reached.

<P>
 I am trying to save the Paymaster General money. If she does not provide an answer, I shall have to table parliamentary questions, which will cost a lot of money. Even then, she may choose not to answer them, and I would have to table further questions. In the interests of economy, I ask her to describe the categories that make up the other 3 per cent. I can then sit down and be quiet, knowing that I have found out the truth.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Far be it from me even to try to prevent the right hon. Gentleman from tabling parliamentary questions and seeking the truth, although I am not sure which truth he is seeking.

<P>
The 5 per cent. figure will operate only in respect of people who are employees. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked about apportionment and training costs, but there will be no apportionment. The 5 per cent. figure will apply to employee-deemed contracts. The normal rules will apply to contracts that are deemed to be self-employed contracts. The normal rules will apply to contracts that are deemed to be self-employed, and there will be no limits on deductible expenses. I find it extraordinary that Opposition Members continue to get worked up about this point. I have given figures on the proportion of companies that will be caught by IR35, and it is clear that a huge number of perfectly legitimate service companies will not be caught. For companies that have a mixture of contracts, the situation that I have just described will apply. There may be some service companies with contracts that are entirely employee-based, and for which there is no legitimate self-employment. In such cases, the 5 per cent. deduction will operate, plus the generous travelling costs.

<P>
I cannot explain how the provision will work more clearly than that. Are Opposition Members seriously suggesting that employees who choose to describe themselves as self-employed should be able to access all tax reliefs in the system? The Government take the view that that would not be fair, and that is the reason for this legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I just want to ensure that Hansard records that we still do not know how this figure was reached. The facts that I did not witness a piece of paper being passed by osmosis makes me believe that 5 per cent. is a magic number that was constructed because it is a nice round figure. Those who want to know whether 5 per cent. is fair will not now discover the answer, and the Treasury will be bombarded with parliamentary questions until we get to the bottom of the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I realise that I have omitted to raise one point, and I should be grateful if the Paymaster Secretary would deal with it. How will the 5 per cent. figure interact with a service company's capital allowances? Will such companies be able to claim capital allowances on equipment that is not covered under this provision, but which would be covered under the capital allowances provision?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have said that the normal rules in the tax system will apply to contracts that are deemed to be self-employed, and the 5 per cent. figure will apply to contracts that are employee only. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 106, in page 280, line 21, leave out from ``deduction)'' to end of line 24 and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) the intermediary is treated for the purpose of Step One of the calculation in paragraph 7 as receiving the amount that would have been made under that section and

<P>
(b) any tax deducted under that section from a payment for a relevant engagement may be set off against any amounts for which the intermediary would otherwise be liable under the PAYE provisions in respect of the deemed schedule E payment.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
After the heat of the previous amendment, I hope that the Minister will say something helpful and constructive about the amendment. It relates to the building industry, and particularly to subcontractors. There was almost a precursor to IR35 in the building industry, the origins of which go back a long way. It was known collectively as the lump. In effect, 18 per cent. of all sums that are paid to small companies are paid net when they are working for main contractors. The amount used to be £23, but it is now £18. Bigger firms are paid gross. I must confess that I am not sure how the distinction between firms was reached, but, presumably, it was considered that bigger firms are more trustworthy than smaller firms and more likely to pay tax.

<P>
It does not matter whether the small firm that is paid net is an individual or a company. Schedule 12 will bring into effect two overlapping schemes. Under one scheme, £18 will be deducted to try to flatten the lump while, under the other, there will be the calculation of a deemed schedule E payment under part II of the schedule. Let us imagine that a company is entitled to £100 gross. It is paid £82 after the deduction of £18, yet under step 1 of the schedule, the sum that is calculated will not be £82, but £100. The company will be hit twice, which will cause considerable difficulty for those who are registered as subcontractors.

<P>
The Paymaster General will be well aware that, as a result of the calculation, the effective rate of tax could result in a 61 per cent. tax bill instead of a real costs of 41 per cent. Such an unfair method will cause hardship. The taxation procedure under tenet 9 of the report of the Institute of Chartered Accountants-the test whether a piece of tax law legislation is fair and reasonable-was awarded nought out of 10. However, the method under the Bill is unfair in a different respect in that it is tax on funds that the subcontractors have not received, which has a touch of earlier provisions about it.

<P>
I am sure that the Paymaster General will say that it will all come out in the wash and that eventually there will be a reimbursement of the sums deducted, but that could take one or two years and those people must pay their mortgages during that time. I do not think it is satisfactory that the building industry should be hit twice, through an odd quirk, by the existing legislation and then by the proposals that we are discussing. I hope that the Paymaster General addresses that issue in her response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I support the argument made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. It is a shame that the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) is not here because she might have supported her brother, who will be affected by what is effectively double taxation. It is grossly unfair that after 18 per cent. is deducted from people's incomes, which will not be allowable, those people must also pay income tax and national insurance contributions if they fall under the schedule. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South that the refund will eventually be given. However, the measure will create cash flow problems, and people will lose out on potentially significant sums. There is a cash flow point and a cost point, which relates to the fact that two schemes overlap. I hope that the Paymaster General will respond positively.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The construction industry scheme is designed for genuine businesses and the self-employed but, unsurprisingly, its use by people who are not genuinely self-employed creates anomalies. I do not understand why that should be surprising, and I make no apologies for that to the Committee. Subcontractors have never been able to set off their construction industry scheme deductions against their PAYE liabilities, which may have a cash flow effect on those companies that has nothing to do with IR35. A subcontractor will be caught by IR35 as well as the construction industry scheme only if he meets the accepted definition of an employee. He will suffer a cash flow disadvantage compared with a subcontractor who is in the construction industry scheme alone. However, it is one of the intentions of IR35 to remove the cash flow advantage for service company workers compared with similar workers who do not use a service company.

<P>
That returns us to the question of employee and self-employed. If a subcontractor with a service company were allowed to set his construction industry scheme deductions off against his PAYE liabilities, as the amendment suggests, he would be put in an immediate cash flow advantage over a non-service company worker and would suffer only the lower rate of the construction industry scheme. That would undermine the whole principle behind IR35 because it would put those subcontractors who choose to work through a service company at an advantage over those who do not.

<P>
The amendment would favour those who frankly wish to avoid their fair share of tax, while putting at a clear commercial disadvantage those smaller construction companies who have not been able to pass the construction industry scheme turnover test but none the less use subcontracted labour or employees. The hon. Gentleman have gone on at length about commercial disadvantage, yet the amendment would create exactly the type of disadvantage that the Opposition say they want to avoid. The amendment penalises companies seeking to expand and contribute to the economy by employing people other than themselves, and rewards those who actively seek to avoid paying the proper amount of tax by using the disguise of self-employment. I am aware of the cash flow difficulties that face construction companies under deduction that must pay for further labour from the net payments that they receive. I have already asked the Inland Revenue to consult those who represent the industry with a view to tackling those issues.

<P>
The Committee must reject the amendment, as it would create an unfair commercial advantage by allowing disguised employment to continue. I shall cite two examples in support of my arguments. The first is from the Chartered Institute of Taxation conference on 1 June, when Anne Redston of Ernst and Young and the Chartered Institute of Taxation said that subcontractors could stop working through service companies to avoid the adverse effects on their cash flows. The second is from Liz Bridge, a director of tax at the Construction Federation, who said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>many personal service companies in the building industry had been set up purely to avoid PAYE and in such cases<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Ministers were rightly closing the loophole. To accept what the hon. Gentleman proposes would create the problems that the Opposition claim that they want to eradicate, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> May I press the Paymaster General on a couple of points? She rightly said that, under the construction industry scheme, builders could change their methods of employment. Does she agree, that, if they do so, they will lose the benefit of limited liability status, which she knows is important to the industry? That will result in higher individual insurance premiums.

<P>
Does the Paymaster General acknowledge that there is a third category? She missed that point in our earlier debates. There are the employed and the self-employed, as she has constantly reminded us, but there are those who were self-employed but, as a result of the provisions, will now be treated as employed. Those people will be caught. Someone who is directly employed and someone who operates for a service company but is deemed to be employed will have different tax bills in the short term. Does she acknowledge that there is a difference in the tax treatment of my third category and those employed?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The introduction of the construction industry had cross-party support and the support of large and small sections of the building industry. The scheme's message is that the industry has a well-trained, loyal work force, and it needs to depend on their having proper employment status. The hon. Gentleman would undermine that scheme with an amendment that would allow those with personal service companies who would be caught by the employee test to have a cash flow advantage. That must be bad for the declared objectives of such an industry scheme on how the proposals can be introduced.

<P>
Why would people essentially caught as employees-if they were not, the problem would not arise-want to use a personal service company if they were also in the construction industry scheme? What would be the advantage of that except a cash flow or tax advantage over others in the industry? That is what we want to remove from the system, and that is what the amendment would retain. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not trying to undermine anything. I am trying to elicit explanations from the Paymaster General, which have been forthcoming, and I am grateful to her for having provided them. It is going a bit far to accuse me of undermining the scheme.

<P>
The Paymaster General says that she is trying to clamp down on those who have a cash flow advantage. If such an advantage existed, I could see her point. However, such people are at a cash flow disadvantage. The amendment would put them on a level playing field with the loyal work force to whom she refers.

<P>
It is becoming apparent from the debate on the past few amendments that the proposal is a deliberate attempt by the Government to change behaviour. They are effectively making the use of personal service companies or intermediaries so unattractive that companies will cease to use them. It would be helpful if the Government were to admit that that is their aim, so that we would be aware of the rationale behind the debate.

<P>
I wanted to probe the issue; I do not intend to divide the Committee. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 281, line 41, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`This sub-paragraph shall give effect to the use of a cooling off period in circumstances where one or more workers of an intermediary has applied to the Inland Revenue for a ruling as to whether the provisions of Schedule 12 apply to the ``relevant arrangements'' involving the client, the worker and the intermediary concerned. This cooling off period will operate as follows-

<P>
(a) if the Inland Revenue rule that provisions of Schedule 12 do apply to the relevant arrangements, such provisions shall only take effect as from a date 3 months after the date of the Inland Revenue ruling;

<P>
(b) this sub-paragraph 8 shall only apply if the worker or workers concerned have applied to the Inland Revenue for a ruling within 30 days of the relevant arrangements being entered into. For this purpose, the term ``relevant arrangements'' includes any arrangements previously entered into, the commercial parties to which, and the commercial terms of which, were substantially the same as the relevant arrangements concerned.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would introduce a mechanism into the schedule that would help tackle the problems created by the uncertainty of the test to determine whether a particular contract falls into schedule D or schedule E. The Revenue and the Paymaster General have admitted that such uncertainty exists by establishing a special Inland Revenue group to examine particular contracts by e-mail, fax or other means. Although that may be a welcome development, while a contract is being examined, the commercial world continues. The guidance notes state that each contract will be examined within 28 days. I am led to understand that at the moment some contracts take significantly longer than that to consider. Will the Paymaster General confirm that? I am told that in some instances it is up to 60 days before a contract has been considered by the Inland Revenue. The amendment would help in such circumstances, again considering commercial reality, by ensuring that a personal service company that entered into a contract in the belief that the contract would not be covered under the Bill but subsequently found that it was covered would not be penalised for a set period. That is the crux of the amendment.

<P>
In designing an aspect of the tax system, it is important to provide certainty. In the event of additional uncertainty, businesses inevitably face extra risk. Therefore it is surely valid for the Government to recognise the extra risk that they are creating and to compensate or provide a mechanism to deal with it. I shall give a practical example.

<P>
Let us imagine that a personal service company that has tendered for two contracts is told one morning through the fax machine that it has been awarded both contracts, but that they are to run simultaneously. It cannot accept both at the same time and must therefore choose which contract to accept and enter into. Under the Bill, the company faces the risk that it may opt for the contract under which is thought that it would be deemed to be self-employed, but under which it later finds that it is deemed to be employed. It could have opted for the other contract, under which the reverse would have applied. That is the real-life problem that companies may face. Amendment No. 176 would help such companies to make the choice as they will not be penalised, at least for the first three months of the contract.

<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will accept the amendment as a way of building on the extra service that she says that companies will be offered. It will ensure that they are not penalised, and that they receive a good support service when considering a contract. Many companies that have used the new service have not had the experience that the Paymaster General described. I think that she said that 47 per cent. of the contracts examined by the Inland Revenue were deemed to fall outside the legislation-

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is correct.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Therefore, 53 per cent. are covered by the legislation. Those are interesting figures, as those in the industry to whom I have spoken say that that is not so. They say that, in many more cases, those who have sent their contracts to the Inland Revenue are being deemed to be employed. A degree of cynicism already exists. It is felt that, in the vast majority of cases, the system will find that contracts are based on employee status. Again, that reinforces the need for the kind of mechanism suggested in the amendment.

<P>
Even if the amendment is not technically accurate, I hope that the Paymaster General will accept it as a positive proposal to assist the Government in trying to make their legislation work.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> On the hon. Gentleman's comments about the Inland Revenue, a letter to the Freelance Informer on 14 April this year stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Inland Revenue has been fair and impartial in assessing a contract recently submitted for their opinion  this contradicts the assumptions-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress the word ``assumptions''-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>some individuals  had made about the way the Revenue would deal with contracts submitted to them.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In his opening remarks, the hon. Gentleman referred to contract discussions with the Revenue that take more than 28 days. According to the figures-I can draw conclusions only on the basis of those who have contacted the Inland Revenue, not those who have made assumptions about what will happen if they do-93 per cent. are cleared within 28 days, 3 per cent. are waiting for further information from the service company, and 4 per cent. have not been dealt with within 28 days. The allegation that the Revenue is slouching, or not providing the service or commitment that was promised, does not bear scrutiny when compared with the facts.

<P>
The amendment would introduce a three-month gap before the IR35 tax rules start to apply to an engagement that the Inland Revenue has ruled as falling within the new provisions. The three months would start to tick away after the decision had been given. I confess that I do not understand why there must be a three-month cooling-off period or how that can be justified. If it were established that the engagement meets the definition of employment, it will be subject to the Inland Revenue appeal process. If the definition was met, the worker should pay a fair amount of tax and national insurance for the length of the engagement, which might be for less than three months. Is it the hon. Gentleman's intention that the worker should not pay the tax at all under the Bill, because the three month cooling-off period would have taken him beyond the length of the contract? Surely that is not what he wants to achieve.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Paymaster General asked what I wanted to achieve. I hoped that I had made it clear in my initial remarks that we are talking about the risk and uncertainty facing people when they are choosing between two potential contracts and trying to understand which tax regime applies to which contract.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, if the contract has satisfied the employment test, the level of tax should be levied. His proposal is a novel way of facilitating tax avoidance. It suggests that, although the ruling was that the contract is employment and that tax and national insurance will be liable, the rules should be suspended for three months while the company decides whether it can rearrange its contract to facilitate the avoidance without being caught under the self-employed ruling. That goes back to our discussions about the purpose of the Bill at the start of today's proceedings. The hon. Gentleman has still not explained why, if the essential relationship is one of employee, the rules should be suspended for three months during which time no tax will have to be paid. Will he deal with that matter?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Paymaster General said that the amendment would apply when the ruling had been made, but it is designed to deal with circumstances in which a particular company is waiting for the ruling to be made and is faced with choosing between two different contracts-rulings on which had not yet been made. It is the uncertainty about making commercial decisions that the amendment would attack.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is an interesting definition of commercial circumstances. I expect that service companies would enter into arrangements that reflect correctly the commercial reality of their activities and, thus, the requirements and obligations of the worker and the client would be clearly defined. If the contract and negotiations had taken place and the commercial reality reflects that the contract falls within IR35-its employee relationship-there is absolutely no justification for the company to say that the Inland Revenue should not take the tax from it for three months so that it can redefine its commercial activities. The measure should not be a charter for saying, ``You tell us if you want the contract. If the contract says that you are an employee, we will give you time to go away and redefine it so that you can get out of being an employee.'' That is a very strange way in which to approach commercial decisions.

<P>
The heart of the schedule is based on the essential terms and conditions of the contract to the employee and the client. If asked, the Inland Revenue will tell companies whether the contract is deemed to be that of an employee or self-employed. That is a reasonable approach. The hon. Gentleman wants us to suspend the rules for three months, so that the companies can consider whether there is a more creative way in which to get round the IR35 rules. That is not acceptable and I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Paymaster General has still not got the point. She admitted that the Inland Revenue has not been able to deal, in 28 days, with 4 per cent. of the contracts put before them. That suggests that those people involved in drawing up those contracts faced uncertainty. If the Revenue itself, whose involvement with the legislation must have been close, cannot decide whether a contract is that of a self-employed or employed person within 28 days, the legislation must have a degree of vagueness and uncertainty. The Paymaster General has effectively admitted that there is uncertainty because her Department cannot be sure in some cases. Clearly, therefore, the Government should acknowledge that and provide a mechanism to help people faced with that uncertainty. I am not satisfied with the Paymaster General's response and intend to press the amendment.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 284, line 5, leave out lines 5 and 6.

<P>
Will the Paymaster General explain why a loss is not allowed in calculating the profits of an intermediary?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendment seeks to allow partnership intermediaries to deduct the full amount of any deemed payment, even when that might be a schedule D loss to the partnership. The legislation contains the special rules for partnerships because, if a worker uses a company as an intermediary, any loss arising in the company can be used only to reduce the profits of that company. If a partnership is used, any loss by that partnership can be used to reduce the partner's own tax liability and can be set against the tax due under schedule E. The legislation contains two rules to prevent a worker from using the interaction between the taxation of the partnership and his own schedule E tax liability to avoid paying the right amount of tax. Paragraph 18(3) of the schedule ensures that he or she cannot deduct any more in expenses against schedule D profits than the amounts allowed in calculating the deemed payment. Paragraph 18(2), which the amendment seeks to delete, ensures that schedule D losses cannot be created simply as a result of the deemed payment.

<P>
The schedule D profits of a partnership are calculated on the basis of an accounting period that can end at any point during the tax year. The schedule E tax liability created by the schedule is calculated on the basis of earnings during the tax year ending 5 April. The mismatch in timing could in some circumstances, especially when income from relevant contracts is fluctuating, create a schedule D loss in the partnership even though the only work being done by the partnership is the provision of the worker's services on terms that would represent employment.

<P>
Partnerships are not widely used as intermediaries at the moment, as it is much more attractive to use a limited company. In closing off the option of service companies, we do not want to create an incentive to use partnerships instead. I do not want to leave a loophole that would allow people to manipulate the interaction between schedules D and E to produce artificial losses.

<P>
It is also important to remember that the vast majority of legitimate partnerships will not be affected by the legislation, because of the limitations in paragraph 4 of the schedule. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General for that explanation. It confirms the theme that is beginning to appear of efforts to influence behaviour yet again. Nevertheless, we do not seek to divide the Committee, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No, 16, in page 285, line 29, after ``woman'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a man and a man or a woman and a woman'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am surprised that I had to table the amendment and that, with this politically correct Government, we should have to deal with the situation of homosexuals under IR35. I point out that this is a probing amendment. I have been waiting all day to say that.

<P>
Paragraph 4 sets out the conditions of liability where the intermediary is a partnership. It goes on to deal with the situation when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the worker, alone or with one or more relatives, is entitled to 60 per cent. or more of the profits of the partnership.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It defines a relative as meaning
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>husband or wife, parent or remoter forebear, child or remoter issue, or brother or sister.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is so far so good, as it is a clear definition. Then the anti-avoidance people obviously put on their large boots and added a welcome interpretation provision in paragraph 21(4), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of this Schedule a man and a woman living together as husband and wife are treated as if they were married to each other.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet again in the tax system, a man and woman living as husband and wife are treated as such. I understand that that is not the first time that that has happened, but it is an unusual set of circumstances.

<P>
The provision does not include a man living with a man or a woman living with a woman, so the incentive to set up a homosexual partnership as a way round this aggressive legislation is apparent. The amendment seeks to help the Government by blocking the loophole. I am optimistic that they might accept the amendment, which was tabled in a helpful way. We cannot allow such a loophole to remain untouched.

<P>
The Paymaster General may say that the problem is covered elsewhere in the Bill. If it is, what is the point of paragraph 21(4)? If a special interpretation clause is necessary to define the status of a man and a woman living together but not that of a man and a man or a woman and a woman living together, it is a pretty odd measure. In the circumstances, I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would elaborate on the thinking behind that apparent loophole.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): I am interested in the amendment, as I have several business classes and schools in my constituency. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that under section 28, which his party favours retaining, it would be illegal for those schools to refer to the amendment, because it would purport to show a homosexual relationship as the equivalent of marriage?

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Hon. Members seem to be having a jolly time debating the amendment, but I believe that it is incredibly serious and important. Tax legislation contains discrimination against same-sex couples, and we should be removing it. In tabling the amendment, the hon. Member for Croydon, South has done the Committee a service. I hope that he will not withdraw the amendment and that the Paymaster General will accept it, and if she will not, that she will tell us that on Report she will introduce an alternative provision to prevent such discrimination.

<P>
Previously in this Parliament the Paymaster General has presented to the House legislation on the working families tax credit, the wording of which was clear, good and not discriminatory. I do not understand why, having done so well on this point in another measure, she is prepared to ask the Committee not to continue that principle. I hope that she will discuss the matter seriously and tell the Committee that she at least accepts the principle that lies behind the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Before the Paymaster General replies, I should like to chip in on the issue. The Government do not seem to be being entirely consistent. As I understand it, the working families tax legislation applies to same-sex couples as well as to married couples or to a man and a woman living as a married couple. Given that in fairly recent legislation the Government have adopted a different approach, it needs explaining why that has not been done for the purposes of this schedule.

<P>
I realise that the wording in schedule 12 appears in certain social security legislation, but in those circumstances the couples themselves certify whether they live together as man and wife. That is different from placing the obligation on the tax authorities, as will be the case under schedule 12. It is invidious to expect the tax authorities to make that determination themselves. How will they decide? What questions will they ask? Will the people involved have to fill forms on whether they live together and their household arrangements in order to be classified as a man and a woman living together as a married couple? That question, like those asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, must be answered.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There has been a lot of absurd press coverage about what IR35 is meant to achieve, but this amendment takes the biscuit. It is not true to say that the legislation discriminates against heterosexual couples by allowing homosexual couples to escape paying tax on their earnings on a fair basis. If the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve the objectives for Kingston and Surbiton that he claims, he would certainly not support this amendment.

<P>
The legislation applies to anyone who works through a service company and receives payments or benefits, apart from salary, which could reasonably be deemed as representing remuneration for services provided by the worker to the client. That applies regardless of who owns the company. It also applies when a worker receives payment other than a salary from a company in which he or she has rights in relation to more than 5 per cent. of the shares, or from a partnership in which he or she is entitled to more than 60 per cent of the profits. The worker's share in the company or partnership is aggregated with those of his associates, including a spouse.

<P>
The legislation states that a man and a woman living together as man and wife should be treated the same way as a married couple for those purposes. It is increasingly common for men and women to live together and share income and household expenses, as married couples do, without getting married. Before the draft legislation was published, there were suggestions in computer magazines that unmarried couples would be able to avoid the effect of the legislation. It is now being suggested that same-sex couples should be included within the definition. It would be interesting to try to include, in statute, the concept of a man and a man, or a woman and a woman, who live together as man and wife. However, it is not necessary. The legislation will ensure that workers using service companies to disguise the nature of employment income will in future have to pay tax on a fair basis. That is not unique-similar rules were introduced by a Conservative Government in relation to claiming the additional personal allowance, to ensure fairness in the application of those reliefs.

<P>
There is nothing untoward in the Government's proposal. Although some hon. Members may find the debate amusing, it is not relevant to the Bill. The discrimination that hon. Members seek to identify is not present in the legislation. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should be most grateful if the Paymaster General would now answer the questions that I asked in my brief intervention.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have answered all of the substantive points that were made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I will therefore have to ask the questions again. First, will the Paymaster General confirm that the working families tax credit legislation applies to same-sex couples? If so, why is there not a read-across to this schedule? Secondly, I asked her about social security legislation, which, as I understand it, follows the pattern of schedule 12 but is self-certifying-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Social security issues are somewhat removed from the amendment under discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I appreciate that, Mr. Cook. However, perhaps I may return to the schedule, which refers to the treatment of couples and states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a man and a woman living together as husband and wife are treated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My point is, by whom are they treated and who will make the decision? It is understandable if the man and wife themselves make it, as happens in social security legislation. If the schedule gives the duty to the tax authorities, how is that to be determined, who will decide and on what basis?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The considerations of social security legislation are not for the Bill. I answer the right hon. Gentleman's question by making again the point about the amendment that his Government tabled in 1998, which related to how such things were decided. We have had experience of the system, which has worked perfectly well, and we have used the same wording in the schedule. If it operated well under his Government, it can operate under this one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General has given an inadequate reply to the second question and avoided the first one. May we have a reply? I am trying to be constructive-it is not a trick question. The working families tax credit legislation emanated from the Government recently, so they must have an answer.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not understand what the working families tax credit has to do with the matter. If the right hon. Gentleman had given me written notice of that question, I would have dealt with it. The same tests were used for the children's tax credit and the additional personal allowance, and Opposition Members did not seem to mind them then.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have a couple of points. First, the Paymaster General twice referred to the Conservative Government in 1998-

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I meant to say 1988. The new third way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In 1998 this Government was behaving like a Tory Government, but they have changed their spots in the past couple of years. [
Interruption.] Well, they had our spending plans-but I digress.

<P>
The Paymaster General says that she has answered the substantive point, but if she has it has escaped me. I wanted an explanation for the apparent loophole and I believe that she is saying that there is no loophole. Therefore, can she confirm that same-sex partners living as husband and wife will be caught by the provisions of paragraph 4(2)(a)? If the answer to that is yes, how can I reach that conclusion from the Bill?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The relationships pertinent to the question are those between the employee, the client, the contract and the service company, which are defined in the Bill. The points raised by the hon. Gentleman are not relevant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We do not intend to embarrass the Government any further. We have heard some weak, evasive and inadequate replies during our proceedings, but nothing to approach what we have just heard. The Paymaster General and her advisers appear to be ignorant and unable to answer the ordinary simple questions asked about the Bill and legislation parallel to it. I think that we should draw a discrete veil over the issues and go on to the next debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it the wish of the Committee that the amendment be withdrawn?

<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Mr. Cook, Liberal Democrat Members are not keen for the amendment to be withdrawn; we want to vote on it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There have been a couple of instances today when members of the Committee have responded to the names of others in Divisions. I am anxious to preserve the good humour of the Committee, which has lasted so far, thank God. The taking of a vote is a serious procedure, so will members of the Committee answer only to their own names in future?

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 285, line 32, leave out ``2000-01'' and insert ``2001-02''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 174, in page 285, line 34, leave out ``2000'' and insert ``2001''.

<P>
No. 175, in page 285, line 26, leave out ``2000-01'' and insert ``2001-02''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Some members of the Committee may consider that the amendment is a forlorn attempt to delay the Bill, none the less, we shall talk to it. We want to delay the Bill for a year primarily to give the Government the chance to think again. As we have heard throughout today, that there are many good reasons for them to do so. Such action would put them at a political advantage because Opposition Members believe that the Bill will be a massive own goal. Many in the industry believe that it will be possible to get around many of the points, even though that will add extra costs, and that the Government will not obtain the funds that they expect to receive.

<P>
The Government will receive little benefit, either political or financial, from the provisions, so the amendments would be helpful to them in many ways-as they are intended to be. The hon. Member for Croydon, South referred earlier to the recent report of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in which the scheduled scored a low mark. In fact, on the question whether the Bill met the institute's criteria for good tax legislation it scored the grand total of 30 points out of 100.

<P>
There is another argument for delaying the implementation of the provisions. If they want to go ahead with the Bill, the Government should at least meet the principles behind the tax rewrite project and achieve greater clarity in tax legislation. Nothing will create uncertainty and increase risk more than unclear legislation. A delay would help the Inland Revenue, which is trying to produce support services for those who want to find out whether their contracts are IR compliant. I hope that it could improve services during a year's delay if it decides to push ahead with the policy during that period.

<P>
We have had some long debates on this legislation so I do not intend to make this one especially long. We doubt that the Paymaster General will accept the amendment but, if she does not, we hope that she will suggest that the Government might return in a future year to try to make the provision better.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I endorse my colleague's comments. The Government should think again, because their mathematics is askew. I have not been able to attend the entire Committee this afternoon, as I had to attend another Committee for a short time.

<P>
The Paymaster General told us this morning that the Inland Revenue guessed that the average rate of tax paid or suffered by taxpayers was 21 per cent. Until the start of this tax year, the rate of corporation tax was 20 per cent. for small companies. I cannot believe that the distribution would attract only 1 per cent. Not all the ingenious tax accountants in the world are capable of that. What the Government are doing is unfair. The schedule has repercussions not on employers, but on the deemed employee-the person owning the personal service company. It is unfair that individuals who have to contract with ``clients'' on the basis of a personal service company have to bear tax and significant national insurance contributions and do not receive benefits. That is the core of the problem with the schedule.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I welcome the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) back to the Committee, as we missed him greatly. I also thank the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for suggesting that he wants to help the Government.

<P>
I think that this is the fifth major debate that we have had on the proposals. We have clearly made our arguments, as well as undertaking extensive consultation and operating the website providing information to companies. A considerable amount of revenue is at stake.

<P>
The amendment seeks to postpone the introduction of IR35 until 2001-02. I can tell the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton straight away that I do not think that that would be helpful or necessary, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That was not a surprise, as the Paymaster General will not be shocked to realise. We have had several Divisions, some surprising to hon. Members, so I shall not press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.


<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall now proceed to put the Question. That this schedule be the Twelfth schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Will you allow a stand part debate on the schedule?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 288, line 31, leave out ``amend'' and insert ``increase''.

<P>
Committee members will be aware that the schedule heralds more than the introduction of the stakeholder pension. It will also begin the process of endeavouring to push all money purchase pensions into a standardised and a somewhat simplified regime. Broadly, we support that move, but I do not want to say too much at this stage. I hope, Mr. Cook, that you will indulge us with a stand part debate later-the schedule raises several major principles.

<P>
The amendment is really very simple. There is a threshold of £3,600 per annum, and the Government hope that many people will enter into the new stakeholder pensions on that basis. The amendment is designed to prevent the Treasury from retrospectively reducing that minimum, for whatever reason. It would do no more than that. It would not require the Treasury to increase the threshold, but it would prevent any reduction. Given that there have been one or two incidences of retrospective provision relating to tax, it is a fair and reasonable proposal. It has been requested of the Government by the pension fund industry, and I hope that the Committee will accept it.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I believe that this amendment has been inspired by the concern that a future Government might seek to reduce the level of pension contributions below which tax relief can be given without reference to earnings. That is referred to in the Bill as the ``earnings threshold''. Although I cannot speak for all Governments, I can assure the Committee that this Government would not embark on this course of action lightly.

<P>
Breaking the link between earnings and pension contributions is a radical change. It will benefit significant numbers of individuals and help pension providers to reduce their costs and provide the low-cost, good-value pensions that are fundamental to our stakeholder pension initiative.

<P>
Any future change to the value of the earnings threshold would need to be introduced speedily and easily. That would be the case irrespective of whether the threshold was being increased or reduced. A Treasury order is the most practical way to achieve this and will allow the changes to be introduced outside-and more speedily than within-the normal Finance Bill timetable. The use of Treasury orders does not mean that the House cannot scrutinise any change in the value of the earnings threshold. Hon. Members can always pray against the order and force a debate. The amendment, therefore, seems unnecessary and I urge the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I had not intended to intervene at this point, because I had not thought that it would be necessary. [
Interruption.]-or controversial, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has just said.

<P>
I do not know whether the Economic Secretary has said those words before-I suspect that she has. She will certainly have heard many others mouthing the words that she has just mouthed about things being done by order, and about there being an opportunity for debate. I rather think that she and I have debated the subject of orders from our respective Front Benches before now. She will be well aware that that is more a matter of form than reality.

<P>
The Economic Secretary used a terrifying phrase, although I do not know whether she intended it to be. She did not say what I had hoped that she would say, which was that the Government would absolutely guarantee that they would not reduce the earnings threshold retrospectively. That might have made us withdraw the amendment. Instead, she said that the Government would not take that step lightly. I take it that those words were carefully crafted. Of course they would not take the step lightly: Governments never do anything lightly. Alas, it is a feature of Governments that they are rather heavy.

<P>
The Economic Secretary's statement provides the perfect escape route. It has presumably been concocted so that, when the Government suddenly decide retrospectively to diminish the amount two or three years from now, they can look back at Hansard when we squeal, and say, ``Oh, but we always warned you that we might do it. We only said that we would not do it lightly, and we have given the matter a great deal of consideration. That is why we resisted the amendment and left the provision in the Bill.''

<P>
This is a terrible state of affairs. I cannot imagine that it is what the Government really intend, because this is a measure that we welcome, as my hon. Friend said, and one that has been introduced to encourage people to take up stakeholder pensions. It would be no encouragement at all for them to find, two or three years later, that the same Government that introduced the measure could reduce the threshold.

<P>
I would, therefore, ask the Economic Secretary to think again. She has three options. The first would be to persist, in which case we should certainly press the amendment to a vote and make a considerable stink about the matter externally, which would militate against the success of the policy that she wants. Alternatively, she could remedy the matter by assuring the Committee explicitly and straightforwardly that the Government do not intend to reduce the threshold, in which case we should be happy to withdraw the amendment. Her third option would be to accept the amendment, which would ensure that the matter would not be subject to this kind of doubt.

<P>
The third option would be preferable for the Government's purposes, but I suspect that the speed of decision making in the Treasury is not such as to permit the Economic Secretary to make that sudden tergiversation in the midst of a Committee sitting. It is not normal for Ministers to be able to do that. I suspect, however, that the second option is open to her, so she could assure us explicitly that she will not change it. We can let the matter rest, and we shall have achieved the objective, which we share with the Government, of making the scheme work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I, too, had not intended to intervene, but my interest was also aroused by the form of words about which my hon. Friend has spoken. I speak without a deep knowledge of the subject, but, when the Economic Secretary replies, she could perhaps tell me whether the words that attracted the interest of my hon. Friend were formulated to deal with the fact that, in real terms, that sum of £3,600 will decrease annually. If my hon. Friend's amendment were agreed to, we could have an interesting debate on what was meant by ``sustain'' or ``increase''. The Economic Secretary could well tell us that, if she agreed to the wording, the Treasury would have to maintain the real value of the amount, rather than leaving it to diminish, in real terms. It would be interesting to know the Economic Secretary's reason for not embracing wholeheartedly the interesting and sensible proposal made by my hon. Friend.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I was interested to hear the remarks of the right hon. Member for Fylde and the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). I can assure them that the Government welcome their support for the stakeholder pension initiative, and that the reference to the fact that the Government would not embark lightly on such a course of action should not be taken so deeply as to mean nothing at all. that phrase is simply to cover the fact that the future is unforeseen. Before the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman get on their high horse about things-there is a danger that they will fall off-I would point out that this is the normal formula for legislation, allowing for an amount to be changed. The same formula is used for the earnings cap for pensions, and I can only assume that it is the Conservatives' experience in government that makes them especially cautious about the use of the formula. The Conservatives used it in government in 1993-94 to freeze the earnings cap on pensions. Perhaps it is their own previous bad behaviour that makes them so deeply suspicious.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I have finished.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Ministers cannot just sit down and say, ``I have finished'' like that. It is a resignation speech? Is it ``Good-bye''?

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Is the Minister seeking to intervene? I shall, of course, give way.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> May I just make the point that I thought that both hon. Members were seeking to intervene, although I had finished speaking. It was, therefore, logical to say, ``I have finished speaking. You are welcome to speak.'' I do not understand what the right hon. Gentleman's remarks were about.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I think that our problem was with forms of words. We had an intriguing form of words that provoked my hon. Friend and I to intervene in a debate, although we had not planned to. Then, the Economic Secretary failed to answer one of my questions. I shall put it to her again: what was the Government's intention in relation to the £3,600? Was it to insulate it and maintain its value in real terms? The Minister did not give an answer, but many people will be interested to know what it is. Will the Minister answer the question on this occasion, or will I have to ask it once again?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> What happens to all the sums is for decision in future Budgets and future consideration by Governments. It is not for me to decide what we should do about the limit. It will be a matter for a future Budget and, perhaps, for a future Finance Bill or, certainly, a future Treasury order. I remind Opposition Members, who are getting excited about the exact words, that it was the previous Government who used that process to freeze the earnings cap limit in 1993. That may be the cause of their anxiety in this regard.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for prolonging our debate-I shall not take up more than a couple of minutes. This structural argument is absolutely extraordinary. The Economic Secretary's argument for suggesting that we should not worry about the possibility that the effectiveness of the scheme that she, and we, wish to promote will be diminished by an uncertainty is that there is a precedent for such uncertainty and that we were the culprits. The fact that we were the culprits is no doubt true-I have no idea about that, but I am perfectly prepared to belive her. If there was a precedent, there is a reason for doubt and uncertainty, and if there is a reason for doubt and uncertainty, there is a problem with the scheme's operation, which should be of mutual concern to us and the Economic Secretary. It was not reassuring of her to explain that her statement that the matter would not be taken lightly did not mean anything at all. There is a serious problem in this context, but I suspect that the Economic Secretary is not in a position to give us the assurance that we want. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs will press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
More importantly, once the Economic Secretary has experienced the magnificent feeling of having scored yet another victory by defeating our amendment, I beg her to go away and consider whether something could be done on Report to remedy the real problem to which we are alluding. The people who will enter into such schemes will put real money into them, although many of them may not be very rich. If they do not know whether in a couple of years they may be prevented from making the pension real by putting in a similar sum or an indexed version of it, they will probably not bother to enter into the scheme in the first place. That is a real problem, which involves establishing whether the Government's scheme is broadly a success or failure, not whether the number of people who enter pension schemes has risen or fallen by 2 per cent. We all want the Government's scheme to succeed, and we have a mutual interest in solving the problem.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I do not expect the Economic Secretary to respond to this point, but the marketplace and the industry assume that the £3,600 limit, like the cap, will increase in line with inflation. It is therefore desirable and appropriate for the Government to explain whether that is their policy. Otherwise, there will be many misunderstandings by users of the schemes.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> It may help Opposition Members if I remind them that 95 per cent. of people make personal pension contributions that are lower than £3,600. There is provision in the scheme to make higher contributions, but that figure is a ceiling that currently encompasses 95 per cent. of personal pension contributions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> One reason for that is that under the rules that apply to personal pension contributions people cannot exceed the figure. One of the advantages of the new scheme and of the £3,600 limit is that people will be exempt from rules that may limit their contributions. I do not seek to be unhelpful or mischievous in this regard. It would be in the Government's and the country's interests if the Government explained what the limit will be in future.
