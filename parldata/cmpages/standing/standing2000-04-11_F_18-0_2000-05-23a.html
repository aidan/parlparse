Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 340, in page 79, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>including the parents of pupils at the school concerned.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment </B>(Mr. Michael Wills): I welcome you to the chair Mr. Maxton.
<P>
Before we adjourned, the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) set out his case for making the amendments, but I must disappoint him. I know that he hoped that we would be able to accept them, but we cannot and I want to explain why.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the argument for amendment No. 339. A school organisation committee will not be able fully to consider any proposals from the LSC in respect of inadequate sixth form provision until the end of the prescribed objection period. Until that point, local parents, the local education authority, members of staff and anyone else may be preparing and registering their objections to the proposals, as is their right under paragraph 34 of schedule 7.
<P>
The Government believe that decisions on school organisation should be taken at local level, so we do not want to undermine the views of interested local parties, many of which will have particular expertise and evidence that is extremely relevant to the decision-making process. Thus far we are in sympathy with the motivation behind amendment No. 339. However, it would afford no more support for the principle than the provisions in schedule 7 as drafted. Indeed, it might even prove damaging and cause delay. For example, a school organisation committee might wish to take a preliminary look at the LSC's proposals before the end of the objection period to check that the required information was available. A requirement that a committee might not start to consider the proposals until after the objection period would delay, perhaps considerably, the decision-making process. That would be in no one's interests.
<P>
The safeguard for which the hon. Member for Hertsmere is arguing is already provided in schedule 7. Paragraph 35(2)(c) places a duty on the school organisation committee to have regard to any objections made within the prescribed objection period and not withdrawn. Paragraph 35(7)(b) provides that the same duty is placed on the schools adjudicator if the proposals are passed to him or her for decision. If the committee or the adjudicator reached a conclusion on the proposals before the end of the objection period, they would, by definition, be in default of those duties. We believe that that affords an adequate safeguard.
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 340 to 342. The hon. Gentleman asked for assurances on the involvement of parents. Parents and their children are at the very centre of the Government's drive to raise education standards and achievements both in schools and, with the new arrangements in the Bill, in all post-16 learning. The principle of involving parents at every stage, from supporting their children's learning to having a say in where and how they learn, is important. We all agree on that.
<P>
The principle of parental involvement is already clearly reflected in paragraph 34 of schedule 7, which provides that any person may register objections against LSC proposals to discontinue inadequate sixth form provision. Paragraph 35(2)(c) also places a duty on a school organisation committee, when considering LSC proposals, to have regard to any such objections. Parents are an obvious example of a group that may wish to exercise a statutory right to object. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Secretary of State's guidance to the LSC, prepared under paragraph 16(3) of schedule 7, will state that parents should be consulted by the LSC before it publishes proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr James Clappison (Hertsmere):</B> I do not think that the Minister disputes the fact that the need to consult parents is not yet provided for in the Bill, but paragraph 35(3) requires a school organisation committee to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such persons as may be prescribed<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Which people do the Government intend to prescribe under that requirement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I should be happy to come back to that in a moment, but I should like to proceed from where I was in explaining why we will resist amendment No. 340 as well. The amendment proposes that a school organisation committee should be required to consult parents before a proposal is approved with modifications. We shall, of course, consult on our proposals for regulations under schedule 7, but our current intention is that consultation by a school organisation committee on any modifications to LSC proposals that the committee may oppose under paragraph 36(2)(a) should be limited to the LSC, the maintaining LEA and the governing body of the school in question. We can rely on these parties, together with the committee itself, to consider carefully the effect on pupils of any proposed modifications. It would be unreasonable for a school organisation committee to modify the proposals in order to bring forward the date of implementation.
<P>
As for amendments Nos. 341 and 342 and the suggestion that the implementation of LSC prosposals approved by the school organisation committee or the school adjudicator should then be conditional on a parental ballot, the hon. Gentleman's good intentions are misplaced. As we have already pointed out many times, the LSC will be able to make proposals to close LEA sixth form provision that has been found inadequate only after a thorough process, following two consecutive inspection reports over a typical period of two years. There will then follow a carefully thought through local decision-making process&#151;earlier today it was called cumbersome. That will balance the need for swift action against the requirements for a fair and full consideration of the merits and demerits of the prosposals and the views of people in the local community, including parents.
<P>
At the end of that process, most parents would wish, above all, for a clear conclusion and decisive action. Let me remind the Committee again that we are talking about sixth form provision that has been demonstrated to be inadequate over two years and after two consecutive inspections. At the end of such a process, conclusive and decisive action is necessary. The interests of parents and their children will not be best served by the requirement that a further hoop be jumped through after such an exhaustive process.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman, perhaps inevitably, drew a parallel with our policy of parental ballots on grammar schools. Although I am sure that I do not need to do so, for the sake of clarity I will point out to him that there is a world of difference between a parental ballot on future admission arrangements of a grammar school and the proposal for a parental ballot on the future of a sixth form that has, as I have said been demonstrably shown over two years to be failing their children. The former is a matter of individual choice. It is not driven by the same need for urgent and decisive action for the sake of the children and the community concerned. Parents will have had several opportunities to register their views, as will other interested local parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister talks about urgent and decisive action. Will he give us his best estimate of how long it will take to go through all the procedural steps in schedule 7, from the inspector's report being received to the sixth form being closed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I had hoped that I had already made it clear that urgent and decisive action was necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I shall come to the time. What is important here is that when we have been through a process that everybody sees to be fair and thorough in weighing up all the different interests involved after two consecutive inspections, there is a need for urgent and decisive action. It will depend on the circumstances. I will not make a specific commitment about the time schedule for that process, which will be thorough. At the end of it, urgent and decisive action will be necessary. The hon. Gentleman will recognise that. I hope that he now understands that there is a difference between our policy on parental ballots for grammar schools and the reasons that we have given for rejecting the amendment.
<P>
I have genuinely tried to reassure the hon. Gentleman. We recognise his concerns and the paramount need for parents to be and feel involved in the future of their children's education. That lies at the heart of what we are talking about. I hope that, with the reassurances that I have been able to give today, the hon. Gentleman will feel able, albeit slightly reluctantly, to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I cannot even bring myself reluctantly to withdraw the amendments because I am simply not persuaded by what the Minister said. I was slightly more reassured by his reply on amendment No. 339&#151;although not the first part, when he told me that it would prevent the school organisation committee from considering proposals at all. Paragraph 35 makes it clear that it has to do so and come to one of the decisions listed under (a), (b) or (c). Those things have to be done together.
<P>
I noted what the Minister said about his interpretation of the later paragraph. If he is telling me that the time for objections will have run out by the time the school organisation committee makes its decision, I will accept his assurance. This was suggested simply as a modest, common-sense amendment.
<P>
I am unhappy about the Minister's response on the other amendments. I shall be grateful if, in due course, he will let me have in detail the Government's latest thinking on who will be prescribed for consultation&#151;first by the Learning and Skills Council when it publishes the proposals under paragraph 16(3) and by the school organisation committee, under paragraph 35(3). As I have already observed, the Bill contains no requirement for parents even to be consulted, let alone for them to take a decision or have any part in it. I cannot see a world of difference between the doctrine enunciated earlier today, that decisions about a school's character should be taken by parents in grammar school ballots, and that concerning sixth forms.
<P>
The Minister says that the sixth forms in question will have been found to be failing and that we shall need to take urgent and decisive action. Why, then, is it necessary to go through this cumbersome process, during which it is possible at a number of points, to decide that a sixth form should not be closed? It is not inevitable that a sixth form will be closed; it is perfectly possible for a school organisation committee, for example, to come to a unanimous decision that it should not be closed. After that, an adjudicator may decide that the sixth form should not be closed. Parents are excluded from this process, as are local education authorities.
<P>
The Minister's exposition about the position of parents in all this reminds me of a French revolutionary leader who expounded the doctrine that authority should come from above and confidence from below&#151;in other words, parents should accept what they are given and do as they are told. That is another example of the democratic deficit. The Minister is unable even to tell us exactly how long the process will take. I would be grateful if he would write to me about that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I have now managed to find the document for which I was searching. To answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, we intend to follow the model of the current provisions in relation to the consideration of school plans. I shall read out the list of groups that will be consulted.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am afraid that the Minister may not do that as an intervention. He will be free to return to the matter, if he wishes, after the hon. Gentleman has finished his speech.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr Clappison:</B> I am happy for the Minister either to do that or to write to me, whichever is most convenient.
<P>
I have been negligent, Mr. Maxton, in not welcoming you to the Chair. It is a great pleasure to serve under you. I know from experience that you will chair our proceedings with great good humour, regardless of the hour&#151;you are always wonderfully balanced and good humoured, even at 3 o'clock in the morning.
<P>
The Minister referred to schools that are found to be failing under the definition of Schedule 7. We have concerns about that definition, to which I shall turn in a moment. Given the number of decision-taking stages that the schedule contains, it certainly allows for the possibility of more than one opinion.
<P>
I am not happy with the Minister's response. Parents are being shut out of the decision-taking process. The Government are being inconsistent, and cannot square the circle. I am therefore minded to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman is too rash, I shall try to reassure him by quoting from the document to which I referred. In respect of the model that we intend to use, paragraph 10 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Secretary of State considers that the interested parties who should be consulted by proposers include&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
any school or LEA in the affected area, and&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>parents and teachers in the area, who may be affected by the proposals, including those living in, or who have children attending, a school in the area of an adjoining Local Education Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of that, I do not know how the hon. Gentleman can sustain his argument that parents are being shut out. That is simply not so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is not the same as placing a requirement in the Bill. Even if it were to be a requirement, parents who had been consulted could still find their wishes being ignored. There is nothing to give force to parents' wishes in terms of having a share in the decision-making process.
<P>
I am not reassured by the Minister's comments, and intend to press amendment No. 342 to a vote. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 46, line 30, at end insert `appropriate to their needs'
<P>
This part of the Bill creates the framework for the ConneXions service, which the Government say is designed to support and encourage young people aged between 13 and 19 in relation to education and training. It is said that the service will bring together a range of existing providers and pay particular attention to young people who are disengaged or at risk of becoming so. The underlying objectives of the ConneXions service are worthy, but we have many questions about how they will be fulfilled. This debate on the amendment will enable us to explore some of those questions.
<P>
First, we would like to explore the basis of the relationship between the personal adviser and the person to be advised. The Government make much of this service being universal, and the document setting out its prospectus describes it as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The best start for every young person.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a written answer to a parliamentary question, I was informed recently that there would be personal advisers for children in independent schools. Although that is not the most important point that I want to raise, I would be intrigued to find out how that would be organised, and whether personal advisers will be on hand, provided by the state, in the great public schools of this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I would not wish to signal a disproportionate interest in the point raised by my hon. Friend, but would he also like to consider who is to pay for the special advisers to independent schools? If they are to be under the management of the school, will the school and the parents meet that expense, or will they be salaried from outside?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, to which the Minister will, no doubt, want to respond.
<P>
More important than that is the basis of the relationship between learning mentors and children in mainstream schools. What happens to mainstream pupils in mainstream schools will form an important part of our debate. There is a difference between a pupil forming a relationship with a personal adviser and seeing them on a regular basis, and that pupil merely having access to an adviser who may be available if the pupil wished to see them. If only access is to be provided, there could be various reasons why many children might not see their personal adviser.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us which arrangement is to be introduced? Will there be a personal adviser for every child, who sees that child regularly, or will the child merely have access to an adviser? If every child is expected to see a personal adviser, will the Minister give a rough indication as to how often that would take place? Will he also tell us how much the personal adviser would see of the child's parents, and what role they would play in the arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not trying to break up my hon. Friend's speech. I want to add only one or two points, rather than make a separate speech.
<P>
Has my hon. Friend also considered a situation in which the personal adviser and the parents and/or the child might not be compatible? Would not that be a very sensitive relationship that could give rise to a great deal of ill feeling?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. We can draw on the analogous experiences of other people working with families, and on the issues that arise between them.
<P>
The ConneXions document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The Personal Adviser will work with parents and carers as active partners in the education of their children and to ensure that higher expectations are reinforced in the home setting and support given to the development of young people's skills and aspirations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds worthy, but what do such sentiments mean in practice? Do they mean that personal advisers will have contact with the parent or parents of any young person who is in their charge, and how many personal advisers will there be?
<P>
On the number of personal advisers, Baroness Blackstone said in another place that the Government's planning assumptions were that the service may need between 15,000 and 20,000, although the number will not necessarily be as high as 20,000. What is the Government's latest thinking in that regard? In a more recent response to a written question of mine, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) said that he did not feel able to support the figure that was given by Baroness Blackstone&#151;he merely said that the Government were examining the number of mentors who would be required. He also said that a comprehensive training programme would be put in place to ensure that personal advisers had the appropriate skills and knowledge. When will that programme be established? The service's phased launch will begin during the spring of next year. How many personal advisers have been recruited so far?
<P>
The overall timetable for the ConneXions service was set out in a document that was launched by the Prime Minister in December last year. Its timetable was that the head of the national unit would be recruited by February 2000. Will the Minister confirm what he stated in a parliamentary answer recently, the implication of which was that the head of the national unit is still to be appointed? That is holding up the establishment of the national ConneXions unit, which will appear at the top of the ConneXions structure, which was supposed to be established by the spring of this year. As we know, spring is rapidly passing, but not with such good weather as we should want, and we are getting well into the cricket season. There is a key relationship between the national unit and the local ConneXions partnerships, not least in terms of funding. Is the project behind schedule, and will less time be available for some of the preparations than was originally envisaged? We have asked many questions about this matter, which is of great interest to us, and I hope that the Minister will answer all of them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I support the amendment, to which may hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) and I added our names.
<P>
Major questions remain to be answered about the ConneXions service. I am sure that all Committee members wholeheartedly support a proposal that involves a connected set of arrangements for young people, although not all of us may support the clever use of the letter X in the spelling of the service's title&#151;it provoked some entertainment. I am sure that we also all agree that there are people in the relevant age bracket out there, especially socially disadvantaged groups, who have not received a decent service to date and who deserve, and can rightly expect to get, a better service. They have not received a decent service to date because insufficient resources went into the area. It has been deemed to be too expensive to provide the holistic service that young people, especially those with multiple problems of social deprivation, need to get into useful work. We have tended to wait for them to come into the workplace later rather than to take active intervention earlier.
<P>
There is concern that the broad generality of the career services that are currently on offer will be damaged. For that reason, Liberal Democrat peers in another place tabled an amendment that now forms subsection (6), which we shall debate when we come to amendment No. 351. Amendment No. 224 would ensure that the service provided is appropriate to the needs of the young person. We are trying to address some of the same issues. The amendment explores two issues. The first is the crucial principal of universality, which relates to the extent that people can expect universal service in the future. The second is the issue of impartiality, or the extent to which the guidance service will be in the best traditions of impartial careers guidance, rather than conform to any other Government agenda for reducing benefit bills and so on. Worthy though such objectives may be, they are not the principal aims of a careers guidance service. If a young person has to choose between an employment option and an education option, the choice should be made on the basis of what is best for the young person, rather than what is cheapest for the Exchequer. They should not, for example, have to take up early employment at a low level, rather than choose another form of education or training. That is what I want to address.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
By way of background, I have received information from someone in Kent that, in the local college, there used to be 17 days of careers consultants' time a week, spread over the three sites. There are now three days a week&#151;one on each site&#151;provided only for those who are at risk of dropping out. So, there we have an example of a reduction in the general availability of advice, over the past three or four years. There is also a school in the area that has been offered six days per term, including the time for drawing up a partnership agreement and for consultation with the careers specialist. That school will have a careers consultant for less than half a day a week. It is cases such as those that have caused people to be concerned that the ConneXions service may provide an unacceptable level of service.
<P>
There are also concerns that decisions on need will be taken too centrally and that there will not be enough delegation or local responsiveness and flexibility in identifying the most appropriate needy categories. Are central Government offices going to dictate to local areas in detail on who should be regarded as a priority case? Will they do so on the basis of GSCE performance, which, as we know from our debates on league tables, do not always reflect actual need? The broad statistical features&#151;for example, relevant point scores for schools and individuals&#151;of a particular group may have different implications in one social context than in another.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will tell us how priorities will be set and that it will not be a matter for central decision. My noble Friends raised the issue in another place, and they received assurances that Ministers were in accordance with the spirit of our proposals. We have also had several assurances since that the broad service would not suffer, but it is important that the Committee should hear that again from the Minister, along with details of his latest thinking. Since then, several documents have been published, including the prospectus and specification for the ConneXions service, which came out on 20 April, and a Department for Education and Employment circular, which came out in May, looking for a response from the local learning and skills council areas on the setting up of local ConneXions partnerships. I understand that the councils must respond to the DFEE by 9 June. There will be a pilot phase, before we move forward to the full ConneXions serivce. When we come to amendment No. 351, we should return to the issue of how the Government should handle that pilot phase.
<P>
I have heard various comments on how the service should develop. People have expressed fears about the service, and it is important that the Minister hear them. A head teacher in Lancashire told us that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The idea of targeting disadvantaged and disaffected young people may initially seem worthy, unless it disguises a reduction in careers advice to others. If this is a new, additional service, giving new time to those most needing it, while continuing all existing provision in terms of time, I welcome it. If it means a withdrawal of service, I object.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That typifies how many people feel about the way in which the service could develop.
<P>
The issues of resources is critical. I know that, whenever Liberal Democrat Members mention resources, there are choruses of ``penny on income tax''. However, this is the Government's initiative, not ours, and we are simply probing their intentions. They have made a clear commitment, on paper, to developing a new service as well as maintaining the existing service. The comprehensive spending review is coming up. Is the Minister confident that he will have sufficient resources to address the head teacher's concerns?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the inadequacy of existing resources prevents the Government with a dilemma? They can either run down the current service in respect of mainstream pupils&#151;many of whom need, and all of whom have access to, personal advice and guidance&#151;or beef up overall expenditure through the mechanism of the US cavalry coming over the hill in the shape of the comprehensive review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I agree entirely. It is right that we should test in Committee whether the Government's words will be matched by pound notes. If the laudable objectives to which they are committed are to be achieved, the necessary financial resources must be made available.
<P>
The other important aspect of appropriateness to need is impartiality. The circular uses a variety of terms, including personal advisers, learning mentors and ConneXions advisers. Concerns have been expressed about the nature of the people who are to be recruited and how they will be trained. The morale of the professional cadre of staff in the career service has suffered as a result of worries about transferring to the new service&#151;for example, the fear that people will be under pressure to move away from their traditional role of purely impartial advice to individuals towards one that is more closely directed by the Government towards other objectives.
<P>
How do the Government plan to fill those posts? Social services and other groups that deal with difficult groups of youngsters often experience problems in recruiting appropriately trained people. A key element will be the ability to deal with drug or alcohol addiction, or home life problems, which have a negative impact on such youngsters' capacity to receive training and move into work.
<P>
I should like to discuss piloting at greater length in relation to Government amendment No. 351. The Government want to move forward to a rapid timetable, but it will take some time to train people to the level required to deliver the service. Will the Minister clarify whether it will be possible to bring appropriately trained advisers on stream as quickly as the Government wish?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment </B>(Mr. Malcolm Wicks): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hertsmere is no doubt aware, an identical amendment to amendment No. 224 was debated in the other place. At that time, the point was made that, technically speaking, the amendment would have no practical effect, as it would add nothing that is not already inherent in the wording of clause 103. Did the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) say, from a sedentary position, that I am being perceptive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No. While I would always wish to say that of the Minister, even when he is being obtuse, on this occasion the obtuseness relates to his hearing. I merely remarked that if the amendment would make no practical difference, why does not he accept it and give us a lot of innocent pleasure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Innocently or otherwise, I do not want to pre-empt Thursday's debate. We are not here for innocent pleasure, but to try to ensure that the Bill is a clear legal document. That is why I must resist the amendment.
<P>
The clause provides that the objective of the support services will be to secure the effective participation of young people in learning. Participation in learning which is not appropriate to an individual's needs could not be described as effective. Furthermore, as has been pointed out both here and in another place in relation to similar amendments to other provisions in the Bill, it would not be reasonable of the Secretary of State to promote young people's participation in inappropriate learning. The Secretary of State must act reasonably at all times.
<P>
Turning to the issues lying behind this probing amendment, rather than the technical reasons for which it is not required, hon. Members will know that much valuable work is being done by a large number of public, private, voluntary and community sector agencies to support young people's needs. It is widely acknowledged, however, that that provision is often piecemeal and ill co-ordinated, resulting in duplication, variable quality and gaps in provision.
<P>
As a consequence, too many young people are confronted by a bewildering array of services supplied by many different agencies, with no one taking overall responsibility. I am sure that many of us have encountered such cases in our advice surgeries. No wonder so many young people give up seeking the help that they need and merely serve time in education and training, or, worse still, drop out of learning&#151;and from constructive engagement in their communities&#151;altogether. The appalling statistic of 170,000 young people aged between 16 and 18 who are not in education, training or work is frightening for us all. It is certainly frightening for the individuals who are part of that statistic, and for their families.
<P>
I shall go into some detail on our policies, and try to address the questions that have been raised. This is one of the most important features of the Bill, and if we can get it right, as we are determined to do, the ConneXions service will form an important part of our social policy for young people. I shall explain later the process in which we are engaged, not least in terms of pilots, in order that we can work on the details as carefully as possible.
<P>
The background to the proposals was the report from the social exclusion unit published last summer, entitled ``Bridging the Gap''. The problems detailed in the report included institutional fragmentation&#151;a bewildering array of agencies individually helping young people; a lack of preparation for post-16 choices; a lack of support over that crucial threshold; and a lack of comprehensive support for 16 to 18-year-olds outside full-time education.
<P>
``Bridging the Gap'' made it clear that a comprehensive, co-ordinated and coherent support service for young people was needed, and that is what we are putting in place. We consulted widely on how best to construct such a service, and built the ConneXions service on the results of that consultation. There was clear support for putting in place strong organisational structures to enhance partnership working while ensuring proper accountability.
<P>
We have pressed ahead with the development of the service, publishing a framework document and a detailed specification. That specification will result in outline partnership plans being submitted by 9 June, and the plans used to select partnerships which will be in the first phase of implementation from April 2001. We have also established pilots in 13 areas to establish how best to construct the services. I hope that the Committee will understand that we are developing our policy carefully, by publishing when we can, by consulting, and through the pilots. We are doing our best to get this one right.
<P>
We are concerned with young people and, with their needs uppermost in our minds, I would like to digress briefly from the thrust of the amendment. I assure you that this will be relevant, Mr. Maxton. I want to put on record my disappointment with the hon. Member for Hertsmere and with what I consider to be something close to scaremongering in relation to the welfare of children subject to the ConneXions service. He has been putting out messages&#151;some have reached journalists, who have not bothered to check the facts&#151;to the effect that very young people whom the ConneXions service is being set up to help will, in fact, be at risk from contact with individuals who are not suited to work with children. I want to nail that allegation once and for all. We have made it clear in the ConneXions specification that ConneXions partnerships will be required to ensure that personal advisers employed within the ConneXions service have met recruitment specifications. They include ensuring that personal checks, including criminal background checks, have been completed prior to employment, that they have attended or agreed to attend appropriate training at a recognised centre offering approved personal adviser foundation training, and that they work effectively in the role of personal adviser to agreed standards, including the ConneXions standard for the practical application of equal opportunities and diversity. In short, anyone engaging in ConneXions service provision will be subject to rigorous tests of suitability and aptitude. That is a far cry from the hit-and-miss approach that the hon. Gentleman has been communicating.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My concern relates not least to a story in the News of the World on 30 April under the headline ``Pupils at risk from `Pervert Mentors''', which referred to the hon. Gentleman's concern that there would be no checks. A similar story appeared in the Sunday Mirror on the same day. That was despite the fact that in an earlier parliamentary answer to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, I had made it absolutely clear that there would be checks on personal advisers and mentors.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Not at the moment.
<P>
I am distressed that the hon. Gentleman should be scaremongering in that way because many people read the News of the World and the Sunday Mirror and such stories suggest to those readers, including many parents, that we have not bothered with such matters. We have bothered and we have stated our position clearly, not least in answer to the hon. Gentleman's parliamentary questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am sorry that the Minister is taking that attitude. I do not know the precise quote to which he referred, but I make no apology for asking parliamentary questions about the matter. It is very important that safety comes first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the point. The News of the World quoted him as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> It is ludicrous. Teachers, child-minders and volunteer school assistants are all subjected to checks.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Steps must be taken to ensure the same stringent measures apply to child mentors.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That implies that we would not take such steps.
<P>
Prior to those stories in the News of the World and the Sunday Mirror, I had made it absolutely clear in my parliamentary answer that those checks would be undertaken. Parents and readers believe newspapers and at a time of proper concern about paedophiles and their extraordinary ability to get into services that are close to children, such checks are important. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman documenting my concern. As he had received my parliamentary answer, he should not have been scaremongering in that way. It is important to put that on the record.
<P>
Clauses 103 to 110 lay the foundation for a long overdue, radical new approach to providing support not just for particular groups, but for all young people, whatever their abilities, circumstances and needs, and wherever they live. The ConneXions service will be a new modern service that is proactive in raising individuals' aspirations and expectations. It will help to remove their barriers to learning and support them in achieving their potential. The Bill will allow that to be achieved through flexible and innovative delivery structures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has put together a marvellous collection of adjectives straight from the new Labour portfolio. Can he answer a simple question: will the new service ensure that all young people who need or whose parents want them to have independent guidance on their future will be able to obtain that through the service?
<P>
<B>Mr Wicks:</B> Yes, I can give an absolute guarantee that every young person aged 13 to 19 will be able to get independent advice from the ConneXions service. It is a universal service, but we must strike the right balance between universality and selectivity&#151;a common issue in social policy&#151;and I shall say more about that in due course.
<P>
We will bring together public services, the private sector, and community and voluntary organisations, reaching out into communities and delivering a coherent, integrated service that is tailored to the needs of young people, their families and communities. Delivery agencies will work together to provide every young person with access to a trained personal adviser, who will ensure that they receive support appropriate to their needs&#151;exactly the provision that the amendment seeks, albeit tautologically, to include in the Bill. Central to the service's development will be widespread and continuing local consultation with young people, their families and communities, as well as practitioners. That will ensure the continuing relevance of the service to those that it supports, and will feed into continuous improvement in time.
<P>
I am pleased to tell hon. Members that we are progressing to timetable. We have recently announced the second tranche of ConneXions pilots. There will be eight new pilots in addition to the five announced in February and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) and the hon. Member for Hertsmere will be pleased to know that they include central London and Hertfordshire. The others are Lincolnshire, Durham, Oldham, Merseyside, south Yorkshire and the Huntercombe young offenders institute in Oxfordshire.
<P>
We always said that we intended to learn from the pilots and we are already doing so. One of the earliest lessons was the enormous enthusiasm of providers for coming together for ConneXions provision. The evidence included the huge volume of letters expressing disappointment at not being part of a chosen pilot area, the speed and energy with which pilot partners have developed their proposals, and their keenness to test more elements of the service than we envisaged.
<P>
There has been much discussion in the other place and elsewhere about how the service will be resourced to meet the needs of all young people. That is a very important issue and we are determined that the service will be adequately resourced to achieve our vision. As we have said many times, resources will come from co-ordination of existing central Government resources, and from those already devoted by local partners to youth support and guidance. In addition, through the Government's spending review, we shall try to identify additional resources that may be available to the new service. I appreciate the point that the hon. Member for Daventry made about the need for new resources.
<P>
On the basis of existing delivery mechanisms, a range of individuals and bodies&#151;from Lords in the other place to interested organisations&#151;have attempted to second guess the potential cost of the service in personnel and funding terms. Of course, it will not be possible to arrive at a precise national figure until proper audits of existing local provision, staffing and need have been completed, and until we have established what delivery mechanisms&#151;existing and new&#151;work well. That is why we are piloting the service and phasing it in over a number of years.
<P>
Concern has been expressed that the ConneXions service will draw on existing agencies' resources to the detriment of, for example, careers advice and guidance. We have made it clear that we aim to work in collaboration to build on and improve existing services for young people inside and outside the ConneXions service, so that all can more effectively achieve their key objectives. The recently published specification for partners makes that explicit point. However, it is likely&#151;and, indeed, desirable&#151;that some provision will be delivered in new, more effective ways to ensure that all young people receive the support that they need.
<P>
Finally, to complete what I hope will prove a useful basis for the rest of today's debate on the ConneXions service, I should like to respond to concerns expressed in the other place and elsewhere about the establishment of the service and the future of the statutory youth service. We recognise without qualification the valuable contribution that the statutory and voluntary youth service make to the lives of many young people, in particular by providing a route to re-engagement for some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. We want to ensure that that contribution is supported and strengthened. We fully expect that an effective local youth sevice will be a key partner in delivering ConneXions services at the local level. Youth service is of course provided by many voluntary and statutory organisations and covers a wide range of activities, which promote the social and personal development of young people from the ages of 11 to 25. That is at the heart of the Government's agenda.
<P>
The youth service might previously, and with some justification, have considered itself to be somewhat unappreciated and undervalued in the great scheme of things. There is certainly much variation across the country. However, in view of the Government's focus on promoting social inclusion, building communities and improving services to young people, I do not believe that that can any longer be said to be true. Much of the youth service's work will continue in tandem with the ConneXions service and we hope and expect local authority outreach and detached youth workers who focus on the core 13-to-19 age group to become key personal advisers in the local multi-agency teams of the ConneXions service.
<P>
<B>Valerie Davey </B>(Bristol, West): I am very encouraged by the Under-Secretary's comments, as, I am sure, will be youth workers around the country. They previously felt that their work was in line with the effort that the Government emphasised was needed for such excluded youngsters, who often do not make contact with any statutory body. The Government's approach offers them a lifeline and link of supreme importance.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will agree that the youth service's work should be enhanced. Additional training might be focused on the area that I described. I am sure that he has already recognised the value of youth outreach workers who make contact with young people not through clubs or activities&#151;many of us recognise that mainstream youth work is done in those areas&#151;but on the streets. That is part of the effort to ensure that such young people are gradually drawn into the system and are encouraged. The ConneXions service will give the youth service parallel support&#151;careers services, for example, will be involved. That may have previously been lacking in some local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am grateful for that intervention and I support all of my hon. Friend's comments. What I have said and what I am about to say will, I hope, reassure her.
<P>
Our intention is that local authorities will retain responsibility for local youth service provision in their area. We made it clear that we have no plans to withdraw or to top slice the funding that we provide for the purpose when relevant youth service activities are integrated with the ConneXions service. Indeed, the ConneXions service could significantly improve the prospects for providing effective local youth services.
<P>
We made it clear that we expect the youth service to be represented at all levels in the ConneXions service and that local three-year business plans should specify the contribution to be made by all partners, including statutory and voluntary youth services. In addition, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to provide grants and other financial assistance to local authorities for ConneXions provision. Integration with the ConneXions service should therefore result in more reliable, longer-term funding for effective local youth services than has previously been available.
<P>
We have also made it clear that when we devote resources to the ConneXions service, it will be important for local authorities to preserve the wider work of youth services in their area-including, for example, residential, motivation and outward-bound activities that are provided by the voluntary sector with local authority funding&#151;and that those activities are integrated, or continue in tandem, with the ConneXions service, depending on the age group that is served.
<P>
I hope that those comments will have built on those of my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone in another place to reassure local authorities and other providers of youth services that their future is bright.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
These are early days&#151;we are still legislating&#151;in terms of the links that may develop between the ConneXions service and the voluntary and statutory youth services. To take a hypothetical example, once a local management committee of the ConneXions service is up and running, it may discuss the difficulty of persuading young men and young women on a particular estate, in a particular locality, of the benefits of lifelong learning or a modern apprenticeship. That may lead to a discussion in the local management committee&#151;involving statutory services and voluntary services&#151;of the problems of that estate. For instance, the youth club may have been burnt down six years ago, causing a special cultural problem. That may lead to discussion on the kinds of youth services provision that needed for that estate. In terms of our plans for local delivery and management, there is much potential to make links between the ConneXions service, which focuses especially on personal advisers, and the wider range of support, provision and opportunities for young people. That is why I am so excited about the policy. The word ``ConneXions'', which it is correct to spell with an X, as Committee members can verify in their Oxford or other English dictionaries, although it is not the only correct spelling&#151;

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I certainly concur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> With the support of the right hon. Gentleman, I should sit down soon. Clearly, I am on a winning wicket.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If the Minister consults those Committee members who are self-consciously archaists he will find that it is the older spelling. It therefore highly commends itself to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and I. It is also a very long way from new Labour, and I hope that the Minister is on safe ground in spelling it that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Conservative party may not still believe it, but it is important to conserve what is good, and not go off in radical new directions. The Conservative party will need to relearn that at some stage.
<P>
I hope that my reassurances and explanations will allow the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. He may need further persuasion, however, and I want to address specific issues that have arisen. On training of personal advisers, many recruits to the ConneXions Service will come from the careers companies and services&#151;forming the core of the new service&#151;many from youth service, and others from different parts of the community and society. Some will have recognised professional backgrounds and qualifications, while others, I hope, will be community leaders in their own right.
<P>
I want a rich mix of personal advisers. I hope that retired police officers&#151;who, as we know, retire very early&#151;those from the teaching profession and those without recognised professional qualifications who are role models in their community, such as former sportsmen and women, will join the ConneXions service. Localities will therefore benefit from a service that is relevant to local needs and local youth. We must be imaginative about how to recruit, and positive about the need for professional development and training. Currently, other parts of government, not least the Department of Health, are trying to recruit more people to the professions that deliver their services, and we are anxious to look across government at the human resources and personnel issue, so that we are not in danger of developing a new service in our Department that might inadvertently rob other services of good professional people that is our concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister will know that some of the more enlightened companies operate mentoring schemes with children in local schools. People with other jobs do the mentoring on a semi-voluntary basis for a few hours at a time. They are not looking for a job because they already have one&#151;that is one of their strengths. Will there be scope for that to be incorporated, and in some way developed, within the ConneXions service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We should accommodate people in the neighbourhood and the community, especially people from ethnic communities, who want to volunteer&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Within companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Within companies, or whatever. Those people might be included, as part of the strategy, as volunteers. Of course, the proper criminal background checks that apply to scout leaders and others must apply to those volunteers. I hope that I am not being too fierce about that, but it is an important matter.
<P>
I hope too, that we can be a modern employer to the professionals&#151;to the personal advisers&#151;and will recognise the part-timer. We should accommodate the personal adviser who is a professional but who works with only half a dozen young people with special difficulties. We need to be innovative about recruitment policy, while recognising the role played by volunteers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is assisting the Committee. I want to make a point that follows from that made by the hon. Member for Hallam. Will the Minister consider flexibly the idea that people who give two thirds of their time to a health authority, or to another public body, are admirably placed to provide their experience and angle as part of the ConneXions service on a part-time basis? They could do that either on a voluntary basis or, more possibly, on a salaried basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I agree with that. The mix of people that we get will vary from one locality to another, which is why I cannot specify what the scheme will be like in any one community. I expect it to work differently in different communities, although they will all work to a common policy and structure. Much will depend on the strength of the careers services&#151;many of which are strong&#151;on the role that the youth services play and on the mix of statutory, voluntary and private elements that we develop. There will be some variation, which is why we are piloting.
<P>
In reply to the hon. Member for Daventry, I say that we will need to draw professionals from different services. I hope that when we look at local ConneXions services in some years' time, it will be difficult to know where they end and other statutory and voluntary services begin. We are genuinely trying to innovate and create on-the-ground, joined-up government. My own experience is that government can be joined up at a strategic level, centrally or in a town hall, but that the involvement of the young person and the family is where it counts. We need, and are determined, to run the service on that level.
<P>
I want to say a little more about the need for every young person to have a personal adviser. As we have explained in the ConneXions strategy document, all young people need face-to-face advice and guidance at some point in their lives. Those on the right track, who have support in their communities or at home&#151;and we want to work closely with parents&#151;may need such guidance only occasionally, at key decision points in their careers. Those key decision points exist for all, and not only the disadvantaged will use the service. To an increasing extent, our young people are making interesting and complex decisions about their A-level choices and vocational or academic routes. From our work on the Select Committee, we know that some of the most gifted and highly able children need special care and advice. The ConneXions service may have personal advisers who specialise in that area.
<P>
Although we make no apology for the focus on disadvantage, we mean this to be the universal service that we discussed. Others will need more help to find the best way through. Those facing multiple problems may need intensive, one-to-one support from their personal adviser to get back on track. We do not intend to impose such support where it is neither desired nor needed, nor do we intend that the service will take over the role of the family.
<P>
I was a little distressed by the fact that Opposition Members seemed to express concern on Second Reading. I am sure that they did not mean it, but it was a good publicity stunt that somehow the ConneXions service is taking over from the family or parent. That clearly is nonsense. Wherever possible it will work closely with parents because they are the first educators of their young and are crucial sources of guidance about learning and career choices. We also see it playing a particular role for those children who do not have families or whose families are in difficult circustances. ConneXions personal advisers will be trained to identify and understand the needs of young people under their care and will be available to offer appropriate support as and when needed. I hope that that goes some way to satisfying the hon. Gentlemen.
<P>
I was asked whether we had appointed a head of the unit and whether we can make any announcements: yes, we can. We recently appointed Anne Weinstock as the head of the new national unit. She is at present the chief executive of CI, an organisation working in a closely related area. I was asked how many personal advisers had been recruited so far. Many personal advisers already work in existing youth support services such as the youth service and the Careers Company. I have had useful discussions in different parts of the country with personal advisers, some of whom are doing the kind of work that we want them to do in ConneXions. Some are working in careers services, often with the disadvantaged. Some are working in the TEC field and others are working in the youth service. I am confident that many excellent people with much experience will join the ConneXions service. We will know how many additional people are needed when local partnerships have completed their audits of existing provision and need.
<P>
Finally, I turn to the independent schools. I am sorry that I have left them until last. The hon. Member for Hertsmere raised them at the beginning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It was not the most subtantive point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I know that, but we are concerned about them. It is for local partnerships to decide how personal advisers are deployed to ensure that all young people have access to a personal adviser, including those in independent schools. Some of that access will be available in informal community settings and some in schools. It is very important. I have met young people from independent schools who, if things are not working out for them at 16, may want to move on to a sixth form college. Many of the decisions and choices are the same whether one is in an independent or a state school. We need to guarantee that. I apologise for speaking at some length, but the amendments offered me the opportunity to set out the policy. I hope that I have been able to deal with specific questions and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw what I think was a probing amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I join others in welcoming you, Mr. Maxton. I am disturbed that the Committee has been so exhausting that it has worn out our two main Chairmen, for whom you are a reserve.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister referring to the pilot arrangements in my constituency, and I was delighted to hear about the appointment of the chief executive of the national unit. It regularly sends appeal documents to me, as I am sure it does to other Committee members. I have fallen into the habit of replying to them and have become impressed by the organisation and its leadership.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister was good enough to write to me on 3 April about the pilot arrangements. He impresses me because he always signs his letters; I do not receive a facsimile or mechanical signature. It is good of him to go to the trouble of letting us know what is happening in our constituencies&#151;these are genuine and not ironic words. I may not have replied to him, but I usually do to demonstrate that his trouble has been noted and appreciated. However, the Bill, and what an Italian correspondent called the exigencies of epoch&#151;he spelt it without an ``h''&#151;have got in the way of the ordinary conduct of business, so I am delighted to deliver my appreciation in person.
<P>
The Home Office wrote to me 18 months ago about a service connected with the youth courts that are attached to the west London magistrates courts. I realise that those are not part of my constituency, but they do serve it. Long ago, I employed a former thrice chief constable of three separate counties who had become one of Her Majesty's inspectors of constabulary. He said in conversation that all young policemen from wherever they were recruited should spend a year in central London where they could learn more than they would from spending five or seven years in many other parts of the country. I do not know whether the Home Office and the Department for Education and Employment are concentrating their pilot arrangements in central London because of the experience that can be derived from it or because of the expertise of the bodies in its constituencies. It is sometimes a matter of both because the nature of the experience generates the expertise. I am delighted to welcome the pilot scheme in my constituency and I shall do anything that I can to sustain it. I also gently remind the Minister of what I said on Second Reading: I am the president of the oldest youth club in the country, which is within half a mile of the Committee Room, and it, too, will be delighted with the scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden (Blackpool, South):</B> I wish to say a few words about the issue of appropriateness to needs, which has been at the heart of the debate. I do not wish to anticipate the Opposition's response, but we have been talking around the same issue. We need to strike a balance between the appropriate concern for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in the 13 to 19-year old age group while maintaining the universal provision, of which my hon. Friend the Minister spoke so eloquently.
<P>
In discussing the appropriateness to needs, we must not lose sight of the novelty and force of the new ConneXions provision. It is an ambitious advance that provides for the first time a proper person-centred service to bring together the different and disparate aspects that have been mentioned in the debate. Given that major advance, it is not surprising that people are worred about it. I am delighted that my hon. Friend has gone further than our noble Friend in the other place. The details in the prospectus and the specification have allowed him to offer us greater reassurance.
<P>
CareerLink in west Lancashire is my local career link provider. It has done a good job. However, in a letter to me, it describes its concern
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that, because of a shortage of resources and, the particular and understandable priority afforded to disadvantaged 16 to 19 year olds . . . the principle of a universal service providing independent, informed careers guidance . . . might be eroded. There must be no disjunction between stated intentions and what happens on the ground. Such advice is not only expected by your constituents but is a crucial pillar of the lifelong learning culture and should continue to be a mainstream, easily accessible, and properly resourced service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that the chief executive of CareerLink was right to express those concerns, but my hon. Friend the Minister has taken us a long way in the process of reassurance.
<P>
My hon. Friend gave some welcome detail about the continuing role, both statutory and voluntary, of the youth service. If ConneXions is to be a success and if we are to manage the difficult balance between broad provision for all those who need it and specific concentration on those who are especially disadvantaged or vulnerable, the youth service has a critical role to play, not least in partnership. Since Blackpool became a unitary authority three years ago, my youth service has become part of local authority provision. Before that, it was administered by Lancashire county council. Many of the key personnel in the Blackpool provision are inherited from the previous Lancashire provision, where they did an excellent job. They are continuing to do an excellent job now.
<P>
On two significant estates in my constituency, the Mereside and Grange Park estates, large numbers of young people between the ages of 13 and 19 have had problems with exclusion from school or school attendance. The Minister will know from other debates and other places that Blackpool is one of several areas in the country with a high level of pupil mobility. The role played by youth workers has been crucial in keeping young people who have often opted out of the formal education structure involved in some form of advice and career pattern for the future.
<P>
It is ironic that people often think of a town such as Blackpool as being stuffed with entertainments and leisure attractions. However, young people between the ages of 13 and 19 who live on the outskirts of the town often have neither the transport nor the money&#151;and, sometimes, not the inclination&#151;to take advantage of the commercial and sometimes slightly dubious leisure activities that are available. It is extremely valuable for the youth service and youth workers to generate community activities in the way described by my hon. Friend the Minister, to help young people in such circumstances.
<P>
I am sure that youth workers will be reassured by my hon. Friend's comments on the continuing importance of the youth service in the ConneXions service. They, like everyone else, will be delighted to know that they will continue to play a key part in such activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will wind up formally for the Opposition. As has often happened, there has been wide educational and pastoral consensus in the committee, which I do not want to interrupt. I want, however, to put on record my admiration for the statutory youth services throughout the country and in my locality in Northamptonshire, and for the relationship that they have generally achieved in working alongside the voluntary youth services.
<P>
I consider the relevant figures when I had ministerial responsibility for this fascinating area and noted the high proportion of the total effort that was delivered by the voluntary sector. Of course, that effort was made alongside and was to some extent supported by statutory provision and the grants that local education authorities make for voluntary provision. People in that service give a strong delivery and a huge commitment. The same is true of the people who work in parallel in the guidance arrangements that are now in place for the welfare of young people.
<P>
When we pick over the details and ask Ministers questions, which they answer with greater or lesser degrees of plausibility, we do so not because we want to subvert their wishes to improve delivery, but because we are anxious that the situation should not be worsened inadvertently and produce unintended consequences. The Under-Secretary has given a number of assurances, which are important. However&#151;and this is my personal comment on the matter&#151;the youth service and the guidance service working together have already made a huge contribution. Nothing should be done, nor any decision be taken too quickly&#151;to fill some momentary need&#151;that would mean that they are no longer able to discharge that task. Their commitment is to all young people. In a sense, it is similar to the argument sometimes made about special needs. All pupils at some stage and to some extent have a special need, even if it is not formally defined as such within the rubric. All young people need informal education and guidance. They need access to the best quality advice, to advice that is part of the context, but is independent to them and tailored to their particular needs.
<P>
That is all I need to say. The Committee as a whole wishes to achieve the same thing. If we have doubts&#151;and we do have doubts&#151;they are about the delivery and not the Government's intentions. It is essential that the delivery is got right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The debate has been useful and the comments of my hon. Friend well judged. As the Minister said, the policy is in its early stages. We apprehend that the Government are heavy on intentions and sentiment. We will have a number of questions to ask about delivery. The Committee will understand the concern about striking the right balance between helping those who are socially disadvantaged, which we all want to do, and maintaining the same standard of provision for mainstream pupils in mainstream schools. We will come to that in detail in the debate on Government amendment No. 351, which we are concerned about. So that we can come more speedily to that amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 46, line 35, leave out `direct' and insert `request'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 249, in page 48, leave out line 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Government's outline proposal on ConneXions speaks of partnerships with local authorities. However, the provisions in the Bill give the central Government in the shape of the Secretary of State the power to direct local education authorities. The word ``direct'' needs to be defined. We would like to hear how the Secretary of State will use the power to direct local education authorities. So far that has not been made clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am interested that the hon. Gentleman has proposed amendments Nos. 247 and 249. His noble Friends applied some pressure to strengthen the statutory basis for the ConneXions service. We resisted that on the basis that it would limit the flexibility of the service to develop and to respond to needs. The amendments, however, would weaken the statutory basis for the ConneXions service. They would remove the long-stop provision available to the Secretary of State to ensure that local authorities, which will be key ConneXions partners, contribute to the service. Amendment No. 247 would leave clause 103 with two meaningless references to direction. I am optimistic that the hon. Gentleman wishes merely to explore the rationale for the Secretary of State's power to direct local education authorities. I hope that he will not press the amendments as he implied. I am happy to set out the Government's rationale for the provision.
<P>
The ConneXions service is a long overdue, radical new collaborative approach to helping young people. It will provide help, encouragement and advice. It will raise aspirations and expectations. It will enable young people to exploit opportunities so that they can maximise their potential. It has received widespread support across a wide range of public, private, voluntary and community organisations. All agree on the benefits for young people of a collaboration on a comprehensive, integrated service to support young people in effective learning throughout their teenage years.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clauses 103, 104 and 105 provides the powers and the duties, which will enable the Secretary of State and delivery partners to bring together and build on the wide range of existing services for young people. We have not attempted to prescribe in statute what part particular organisations will play. We want local partners to come together to agree what arrangements work best in their area and to take local decisions in the light of local circumstances. That is why the pilots are important.
<P>
In view of their responsibilities and experience across a wide range of services for young people, it is sensible that local authorities play a major role in the ConneXions service. It will also chime with their new responsibilities for the promotion of the economic and social well-being of their local community. Local education authorities are keen to play their part in the ConneXions service. A number of representions have been made to the Government asking that local authorities be made the lead partner in their area. That will not be possible not least because it would cut across the principle of arrangements for delivery being determined by a range of local partners. However, the representations do indicate the enthusiasm of local authorities for ConneXions services.
<P>
We owe it to all young people to ensure that the Secretary of State retains powers to direct local education authorities on the rare occasions when services are inadequate or arrangements have broken down. However the arrangements will remain long-stop provision&#151;if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me&#151;for use in rather extreme and, I am sure, uncommon circumstances. Hon. Members will be reassured to learn that the same long-stop powers of direction over local authorities exist in section 10 of the Employment and Training Act 1973, which provides the statutory basis for the provison of careers services. Having given those explanations and assurances&#151;and understanding that these were probing amendments&#151;I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel free to withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been another useful debate. The Under-Secretary's interpretation of the amendments tabled by my noble Friends is a little strained. Many of his arguments were made during the debate in the other place. However, it has been useful to obtain a little more information from the Government on the power of direction. We understand that it will be a limited and long-stop power and that it will be used in limited circumstances. Perhaps the Under-Secretary could have told us more about those circumstances. However, I will not seek any further infomation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 351, in page 47, line 5, leave out subsection (6)
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to improve the Bill by restoring clause 103 to its original wording. I understand the concerns that lay behind the addition of subsection (6) to clause 103 via a Liberal Democrat amendment on Third Reading in another place. However, the Committee would be failing in its job if it sanctioned poorly drafted legislation. Subsection (6) is poorly drafted. It does two things. First, it requires the Secretary of State to ensure that ConneXions provisions do not adversely affect the quality and quantity of the existing careers provision. Secondly, it requires him to fulfil existing statutory duties in respect of careers provision for young people.
<P>
The first part of subsection (6) refers to the quality and quantity of the existing careers provision for young people. We have seen significant improvements in careers provision in recent years, but it is still variable from place to place&#151;in quality and quantity. Although I join other hon. Members in paying tribute to the excellence of much of that provision, it is only fair to be realistic and note the variations in quality, and to accept that young people in some areas are rather poorly served.
<P>
Our purpose in introducing the ConneXions service is to raise the quality of provision throughout the country, and this part of the Bill supports that objective by making provision for rigorous inspection of the service, including what is for technical reasons a specific clause dedicated to the inspection of the careers element of the service.
<P>
What does ``adversely affect'' mean? Some may feel that any change in the way that careers advice and guidance are given would adversely affect it. For example, some who are still wary of information and communication technology would regard its use in the delivery of information advice and guidance with deep suspicion. Thankfully, such people are becoming fewer by the day. That view is not shared by an increasing number of the young people whom we seek to serve.
<P>
Subsection (6)(a) is woefully imprecise, and it could inhibit real progress in the expansion and development of information advice and guidance for all young people.That, I believe, is entirely contrary to the effect intended by Liberal Democrats in another place. It should therefore be removed from the Bill.
<P>
Subsection (6)(b), as noted in another place, is strange. It would require the Secretary of State to fulfil his existing statutory duties with respect to careers provision for young people. It would have no legal effect whatever. The arguments against including that provision in the Bill were well put on Third Reading in the other place. It was made clear that a statutory duty is a statutory duty. It does not need to be repeated in the Bill that the Secretary of State must fulfil the statutory duties imposed on him by other legislation. The Committee will probably agree that our time is not best spent making provisions that require the Secretary of State to do what the Secretary of State must do.
<P>
Not only in subsection (6) poorly drafted; it could inhibit the ConneXions service's ability to improve the quality and delivery of careers provision for all young people. I believe that it would be irresponsible to leave it in the Bill. I therefore hope that all hon. Members, including Liberal Democrat Members, will agree to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Government have chosen to remove a subsection that my noble Friends worked hard to have included in the Bill. I pay tribute to them for their diligence and for mobilising support to win that vote.
<P>
The Minister will understand the range of concerns that led us to seek the inclusion of what is now subsection (6), some of which have already been debated. Subsection (6)(a) speaks of not adversely affecting the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the quantity or quality of existing information, advice and guidance services provided for young people.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall return later to the question of phasing, to which the Minister referred on an earlier amendment.
<P>
We are worried that there will be a dip in the general availability of existing provision to implement the ConneXions service, as people are diverted from the former service, perhaps with the promise that it will be reinforced later. That may be because of a lack of resources, another subject that has already been referred to. If the comprehensive spending review proposes a resolution&#151;we hope that it will&#151;it may not provide the money immediately; it may be phased in.
<P>
Secondly, only a limited number of people have the relevant experience. The Minister spoke warmly about broadening that pool and bringing new people into the service, but they must remain concerned that it will create a hiatus in the interim. Subsection (6)(a) tried to address that problem by putting a hold on the development of the service&#151;I accept that&#151;until such time as the Government can demonstrate that they have the resources and the trained personnel to expand it. We were not seeking to hold the service back out of malice, but to ensure that the Government committed the resources and brought trained personnel on line, both of which might take a little time. We suggest that the Minister should proceed more cautiously with the phasing. He is currently saying that 40 per cent. of England is coming on stream for the new service in 2001. We are worried that that sort of phasing and piloting will not allow genuine evaluation of the service over time. We are also worried that the Government will be so keen to proceed that the lessons of the pilot will not be properly learned, as has happened before when Governments say that they will pilot a project and then implement a phased introduction.
<P>
A second phase of piloting could be needed because things have been missed out in the first phase or because new issues have arisen. For example, some of the early lessons in the new deal have taken a while to filter through, as the Government have acknowledged in some of the adjustments that they are making. Those adjustments include doing more intensive work with disadvantaged groups and extending the gateway. Such lessons will have a comparable application in respect of the matters under discussion. The service should not be rolled out and established in a structured form before we have learnt the lesson from the original pilots, which could help in saving resources and in making the arrangements more targeted in the long run.
<P>
In respect of subsection (6)(a), and with the aim of not adversely affecting original provision and of ensuring that the new provision is as good as possible, we urge the Government to proceed cautiously rather than to do so more quickly than the existing envelope of resources would allow. We hope that they will take the advice given by experts in the field. If people blow whistles and tell them that there are problems in resourcing the generality of provision in a particular area, we hope that they will listen to those people and take their queries seriously.
<P>
The Government have indicated on a number of occasions that they want to expand the service and not to treat it as a diversion of resources. The Minister gave a similar assurance today. We want that to happen, which is why we want subsection (6)(b) to be included in the Bill, so as to ensure that it contains a statutory duty. I understood the Minister's comment that the Secretary of State is still bound by statutory duties, but some concerns remain. We are anxious, for example, about some of the guidance that has been made available. As we understand it, the DFEE circular does not refer to certain parts of sections 43 and 44 of the Education Act 1997, which require all publicly funded schools to provide access to careers advisers, so that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>all year-11 pupils are aware of all careers, training and education opportunities available, have comprehensive accessible information about these, and receive impartial advice on the possible outcomes and implications of different choices.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement was contained in a DFEE circular published in 1997. There is anxiety that the failure of current guidance to restate such concerns means that they will not take such prominence as they would have originally. That was one of the intentions of seeking to ensure that a proper requirement was contained in primary legislation.
<P>
There are also concerns about the business connection in the service, and, in particular, about intelligence in respect of local labour market needs. We hope that local learning and skills partnerships will generally improve these factors, although they might not be dealt with effectively by the current structure if we do not take our time and do not ensure that the service is established at an appropriate speed.
<P>
Those are the matters that underlie the debate. Specific examples include the concern that was expressed to us by a careers co-ordinator from Norfolk. He told us that Her Majesty's inspector for careers education had voiced worries in a recent conference in London about what the legislation implies. He was inspecting in a school only the day before, and received negative feedback from a group careers interview. The students all felt that they should have been seen individually. Most delegates at the conference were extremely worried about the implications of the legislation, although they broadly sympathised with the Government's overall aims. Concerns such as those about moving from individual interviews to group interviews underlie the questions being asked about quality and quantity. Clearly, the co-ordinator was talking about a perception that the current arrangements are effective and a fear that that quality will be diluted if the instructions are changed to state that individual interviews are appropriate for some groups of people, but that group interviews will do for others. A group interview would not previously have been regarded as acceptable. Those concerns underline the amendment made in another place and remain because the Government are seeking to remove the provisions. I freely accept that the Minister has been forthcoming in seeking to give the reassurances that we require. Nevertheless we remain of the view that a measure should be spelled out in the Bill to add belt and braces to the commitment that the Government have given on paper. We cannot be certain of that commitment until we have seen the pilot phases completed. We may then see the way in which the roll out is to take place.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I reiterate that we hope that the Government will not be too proud to go more slowly than their advertised timetable if they find the occurrence of problems that we have highlighted regarding ensuring broad access to provision and the presence of individuals. I hope that they will not proceed if such problems occur during the pilots or as the initial phases roll out. Further, I trust that they will be realistic about their prospects of rolling the service out and will seek to ensure that the quantity and quality of the broad range of provision that existed before the coming into force of the ConneXions service remains.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am not sure that I should be in the business of echoing the praise that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) bestowed upon his colleagues in another place but it is reasonable to observe that the Liberal Democrat amendment in another place attracted much Conservative and Cross-Bench support. The concerns of those who voted for the amendment were clear enough. The way in which the case was put by Baroness Sharp outlined the concern. She sought to ensure that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Careers service, in its new guise as the Connexions service, continues to provide careers advice, information and guidance to all young people and does not find all its efforts swallowed up by the new . . . personal adviser service.&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 23 March 2000; Vol. 611, c. 422.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The concern is real enough and should not be lightly dismissed, whatever the technical aspects of the amendment. Many others feel the concern&#151;the hon. Member for Hallam mentioned some examples and I have received representations from the Hertfordshire careers service, which tells me:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> There is already anecdotal evidence that de facto rationing of this service is acting to the detriment of average and able pupils seeking careers advice and will cause resentment and confusion to pupils and parents alike.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is much else in the same vein in the service's representation to me. It is looking, as many others are, for reassurance that there will be a universality of provision, as has already been discussed, and that young people will not lose out.
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's arguments against the amendment made in the other place. With regard to the first part of his case, I was not entirely convinced that he took us much further by observing that there was variation in the quality of careers services. Subsection (6)(a) referes to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not adversely affecting the service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the subject of the question, rather than whether there will be a variation in the service. What ``adversely affecting'' means is clear enough. I do not have the difficulty with the meaning of those words that the Minister seems to have.
<P>
The second part of the Minister's case was the technical objection that subsection (6)(b) merely repeats a statutory duty contained eleswhere. We will have to study the issue technically. Would it be so fatal for the measure to echo what is contained elsewhere? I hope that the Minister will take away the concern expressed by those who moved the amendment in another place and the representations received by the Committee from many careers services, even if the amendment is technically defective. The area is of real concern. It is incumbent on us all to watch it carefully in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I hope not to detain the Committee much longer on the amendment. Although I must address what we regard as technical deficiencies, there is always a risk of sounding technically pedantic about such matters. I recognise the underlying concerns. Further, I hope that I was able in an earlier long speech to reassure members of the Committee about our good intentions and about the balances that must be struck between universality and selectivity. We must offer each young person a decent service that provides advice and guidance on learning options and careers choices and meets our need to focus on special groups that include our most disadvantaged young people. We want to provide a universal service not only because that is right and proper for every young person, but because many of us subscribe to a social policy school of thought that makes us wary of having services that are for poor people only. One of my academic mentors, Richard Titmuss of the London School of Economics observed that services for poor people tend to be poor services. That explains why many of us are passionate universalists; we are worried about every young person.
<P>
We recognise the concerns of people in careers companies and schools. We are engaged in a substantial change. Managing change is always difficult and we are doing our best to tackle people's fears. It is interesting to consider how we will deliver the universal service to young people. Face-to-face contact is crucial, but information technology offers enormous possibilities because of the expertise that it can deliver to young people and their parents. We must use more imaginative work experience in our schools, which will enable people to understand the world of employment. I recently saw in a school in my constituency a Canadian game being played, called the real game. It enables youngsters at a young age in secondary school to consider the life choices that they will have to make and the implications that those will have for employment, careers and qualifications. We are entering a new world of service delivery. I hope that I have reassured hon. Members.

It noted a preponderance of organisations that are involved in the administration of justice and which have to be consulted in subsection (1)(a) to (f). Its experience of Youthstart is that the number of young people who are on the margins of society and who are at a real risk of dropping out completely is relatively small and that the risk to those who have been involed in crime is smaller still. Clauses 103 to 112 provide support for all young people aged 13 to 19. However, of the six agencies to be consulted in the list in subsection (1), four are involved in police probation or are offending teams. The Institute of Careers Guidance wants the consultative process to be broadened to include organisations that reflect wider interests. The Minister will notice that the amendment does not delete the references to the consultees altogether, but broadens the list.
<P>
Under amendment No. 225, the Secretary of State would retain his duty to provide a careers service under section 10 of the Employment and Training Act 1973. With the ConneXions service, the body may provide a statutory career service that is not in the contract. In those circumstances, it is important that a career service sub-contractor is consulted, and the amendment would ensure that it would be. Amendment No. 226 requires that local learning partnerships should also be consulted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am anxious that we make progress, but I need to consider this clutch of amendments with care.
<P>
The change to the wording of the opening sentence of clause 104 proposed in amendment No. 208 would have no practical effects, as all the bodies listed in clause 103(1) already provide services for young persons, or otherwise deal with young people as part of their statutory functions.
<P>
The proposed removal from the list of probation committees and chief officers of police would significantly undermine the practical effectiveness of clause 104. Some people argue that the list of statutory bodies has too strong a flavour of tackling crime, but that fails to take into account the wider role of the police in youth and community support. Chief officers of police have a role in protecting all young people, promoting safety, supporting the victims of crime, providing a range of informal community activities for young people such as summer schools and sport, and bringing young people in from the street to put them in contact with families and others who can help.
<P>
The probation service supports young people aged 16 to 25. That covers the upper range of the ConneXions service, which is young people up to the age of 19. In contrast, the youth offending teams work with young people up to the age of 17. I agree that the ConneXions service must not focus on young people in trouble to the exclusion of others. At the same time, its remit is to provide forms of support to all young people that are tailored to their individual needs. That includes young people on the fringes of or fully involved in criminal activity. As a matter of practicality, we need to build in requirements for consultation with the range of statutory bodies that deal with young people in and out of trouble up to the age of 19.
<P>
There seems to be some inconsistency between amendments Nos. 208 and 345. One seeks to remove chief officers of police from the list of statutory bodies to be consulted and to collaborate in ConneXions provision, while the other seeks to add them to the list of those empowered to pass information about young people to the ConneXions service under clause 109.
<P>
Chief officers are important partners in the ConneXions service, which is why the hon. Member for Hertsmere has tabled amendment No. 345. With his permission, I should like to explore further whether a chief officer of police might have relevant information about individual young people that would not be available from the bodies already listed in clause 109. The hon. Gentleman will understand the importance of limiting the clause to what is necessary.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 208 and 225 would add to clause 104(1) providers of statutory and voluntary youth services, local providers of education and training, and local providers of careers education and guidance, including careers companies. We made it clear in the other place that the bodies listed under the provision are all statutory bodies involved in relevant aspects of youth support provision. Their powers are defined by statute. The provision in the Bill is intended to put it beyond doubt that they could enter into a contract with or otherwise contribute to the ConneXions service. Their inclusion in clause 104(1) also means that the bodies are under a duty to support, assist and collaborate in provision for youth services, as provided by subsection (4), which we shall debate in detail shortly. That is another reason for listing them expressly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister touched on subsection (4), to which we have tabled later amendments. If he were to undertake to write to me about the implications of the subsection and the way in which he envisages it operating, that may assist the Committee's progress.
<P>
<H5>6.30 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wickes:</B> I shall certainly look carefully at the record of our proceedings to see if I can add anything useful..
<P>
As example of a group of statutory bodies that should not be added to clause 104(1) is primary care trusts, as proposed under amendments Nos. 352 and 353. Those new statutory bodies that were establishd under the Health Act 1999 will be responsible for commissioning or directly providing general medical services at local level. That includes specialist services to support young people with special educational needs, such as those with disabilities, mental health problems, impaired sight or hearing, which can pose significant barriers to learning. The new bodies will be critical partners in local ConneXions provisions. They should be included in the preparatory consultation and be under the subsection(4) duty to collaborate.
<P>
It follows that primary care trusts should be added to the list of bodies empowered under clause 109 to past relevant information to the ConneXions service. As bodies with responsibility for arranging or providing general medical services in their areas, they will hold relevant information on how the needs of individual young people with medical problems might best be met to support their participation in effective learning, which is why we tabled amendments No. 356 and 357.bernMr. Boswell: I have two points to make, one of which is in relation to information transfer, which applies to many provisions. Given that much of the information is confidential, can the Minister assure the Committee that the duty of confidentiality will transfer between the bodies including the ConneXions service, so that nothing will leak? Secondly, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has already anticipated my second question by saying that the primary care trusts are statutory bodies. At present, many trusts are still at the stage of being primary care groups. I take it that the Minister is not imposing a statutory obligation to consult. However, it would be good practice to do so before the trusts are established.
<P>
<B>Mr.Wicks:</B> That is certainly my understanding. We are concerned about confidentiality and privacy. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman about such matters.
<P>
I return to those statutory bodies listed under clause 104, which must be consulted about, and collaborate in, ConneXions provision. In contrast, that sort of statutory duty cannot be imposed on private or voluntary bodies and many other local bodies that can and, in many cases, should contribute to the ConneXions service. Indeed, that is the reason for the separate provision under subsection (2) for the consultation of such voluntary and other bodies as the Secretary of State will advise, and which are not captured by the subsection (4) duty to collaborate. The carefully constructed clause would be flawed if non-statutory bodies were included in the list under subsection (1)
<P>
There was debate in the other place about whether some of the bodies to which the hon. Gentleman's amendments refer might be included in subsection (2). Indeed, amendment No. 226 would add another group of non-statutory bodies&#151;local learning partnerships&#151;to that part of the clause. There is no doubt that a wide range of partners and other relevant bodies will be consulted on ConneXions provision, including those that the amendments would include in the Bill. We have made that absolutely clear in earlier debates and in the ConneXions specification. However, to list every organisation that will be consulted will make the legislation cumbersome and would risk the omission of bodies which, in some parts of the country, would make a significant contribution&#151;and about the involvement of which we would not wish to cast the slightest doubt. Clause 104, as drafted, provides for a wide range of bodies to be involved in the new service, while maintaining simplicity and flexibility for local variation.
<P>
I shall use this opportunity to say more about how the ConneXions serivce will work. The recently published specification makes it clear that a contract for local provision will be awarded only if the national unit is satisfied that the partnership has included in its plans the optimum mix of delivery through private, voluntary and public sector partners. It will expect ConneXions partnerships and local management committees, in developing their plans and working arrangements, to involve and take account of the views of a wide range of partners in the area.
<P>
In addition, ConneXions partnerships and local management committees will need to show how they work with other related agencies&#151;including local learning partnerships and, for example, employers and their representative bodies, those providing social security benefits and local learning and skills councils. All those bodies have yet wider links, which can be brought to bear on ConneXions provision. Learning and skills councils will have responsibility for ensuring effective links between school and business. Their function in that regard is to consider how such links will be achieved, to contract with the education business link consortium and to determine what funding and other support is necessary.
<P>
Education-business link organisations have much to contribute, for example in the provision of work experience and mentors. The ConneXions service will involve consultation and collaboration on a wide scale. It will be inclusive in more ways than one. The service could not achieve our vision without consulting and collaborating with a wide range of bodies. I am happy to reassure hon. Members as explicity as I can that ConneXions partnerships will be required to show that they have consulted all the bodies mentioned in amendments Nos. 205, 225 and 226.
<P>
With those explanations and assurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will withdraw the amendment. I also hope that he will join other hon. Members in supporting the amendments in my name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister and I shall want to reflect further on what he said. In order to make progress now, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Government new Clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>Support for 13 to 19 year olds: inspection</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Government believe that clause 107 should not stand part of the Bill, so we propose to replace it with the provision in new clause 24. Similarly, we propose that amendment No. 361 should replace clause 112. Three points of substance lie behind the changes in the Bill, which will ensure the inspection of ConneXions provision and of the careers service for young people, which is an integral part of the Bill.
<P>
The amendments give freestanding powers to Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools in England to inspect the ConneXions service. In other words, Ofsted's ability to inispect the ConneXions service will not be contingent on requests from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It is and remains the Government's policy to ensure that careers and other support services, including the new service for young people, are raised to the highest quality. To achieve that, it is important for such services to be subject to rigorous and independent inspection.
<P>
The effect of clauses 107 and 112 in their current form would be that the Secretary of State would determine the ConneXions service inspection programme in each successive year by requesting that Ofsted undertake inspections. However, we must not overlook the possibility that the Secretary of State may not always be in the best position to determine how inspection resources can be most effectively deployed to secure the best assessment of and greatest improvements in the service. The additional powers of independent inspection that we propose to give the chief inspector will enable him to target additional inspections as he thinks fit and will accordingly strengthen the inspection regime. Ofsted will have a duty to inspect and advise on the ConneXions service when asked to do so by the Secretary of State, and a general power to inspect the service.
<P>
Our amendments also make it clear that inspections of and advice on the ConneXions service may include an investigation of or commentary on service providers' management and use of resources. We attach great importance to ensuring that services are well managed and that public money is used efficiently. Subsection (3) of the new clause 24 and subsection (4) of proposed new section 10B, in amendment No. 361, will put beyond doubt that the management and use of resources is within the remit of the chief inspector when inspecting or offering advice on ConneXions service provision.
<P>
The amendments introduce a criminal sanction against a person who wilfully obstructs a ConneXions service inspection, which will incur as a penalty a fine of up to level 4. It is vital that Ofsted is given the access to services that it needs to conduct inspections. The Bill already provides for criminal sanction against anyone who obstructs inspection by the adult learning inspectorate, and similar provisions exist in respect of Ofsted in the School Inspections Act 1996. We do not intend legislation for the inspection of the ConneXions service to provide anything less by way of back-up provision than legislation for the inspection of schools and other post-16 learning. Subsection (7) and (8) of proposed new section 10B, in amendment No. 361, correct that anomaly.
<P>
If we are to ensure that the inspection of the ConneXions service by Ofsted is seen to be entirely independent, hon. Members should join me in agreeing that clause 107 should not stand part of the Bill and that the provisions in clauses 107 and 112 should be replaced by Government amendment No. 361 and Government new clause 24.

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 49, line 35, leave out `age' and insert `date of birth'.
<P>
This is an especially important amendment, although it is a small and technical provision that should not detain the Committee long. The clause enables disclosure from the child benefit database by the Secretary of State for Social Security of basic information about young people in the ConneXions age group. That will be an important way of ensuring that the ConneXions service holds accurate and complete records.
<P>
The amendment changes the reference in clause 108 to ``date of birth'', which corresponds more accurately to the data that the Department of Social Security will supply under the clause. It is clearly important that the clause be correct in that respect.

<P>
Government new clause 15-Wales: provision of information by public bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The motion to transfer the clause, and amendments Nos. 359 and 360, are technical corrections to make explicit the Secretary of State's power to provide and arrange ConneXions services that apply to England only. That is necessary because of the Government amendments to establish a new local service for young people in Wales, which I shall discuss shortly. Clause 110 amends the Education Act 1996, which applies to both England and Wales, so the motion will move it to allow a reader of the Bill to see easily that it is not covered by England-only provisions, to which clauses 103 to 109 refer.
<P>
New clauses 8 to 15 provide for a youth support service for 11 to 25-year-olds in Wales. That flows from the Government's Green Paper, ``Learning is for Everyone'', produced in April 1998. The National Assembly for Wales has also considered the issue further since devolution. The new clauses prepare the ground for the National Assembly to adopt a distinctive Welsh approach to support services for young people, in partnership with local councils in Wales and in co-operation with the voluntary sector and other agencies.
<P>
The new clauses will enable the National Assembly, in consultation with others, to introduce a range of measures that the Government and the Assembly believe will provide tremendous support to young people. They will particularly support young people in the transition to adulthood and independence, and assist them in developing attitudes and skills that will enable them to benefit from specialist advice. The measures will promote equality of opportunity for young people and discourage youngsters of compulsory school leaving age from discontinuing their education. I hope that they will encourage people over the compulsory school leaving age, up to the age of 25, to remain in education and training or return to it.
<P>
Like ConneXions in England, the service will promote lifelong learning and provide young people between the ages of 11 and 25 with information and counselling services. It will support individuals whom local authorities, the youth service and the National Assembly have identified as socially excluded and disengaged from society. I hope that the measures will also prevent offending and re-offending, and help to reduce risk-taking behaviour by young people. The new clauses are clear and the National Assembly fully supports them. The Welsh Grand Committee agreed to the proposals and welcomed them. I will happily discuss the new clauses today, but we could make more progress by accepting the amendment now.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are now making considerable progress, and I am anxious not to detain the Committee, but we should spend a moment or two discussing provisions for special education needs, because they are important. The changes made to the Bill in another place expanding the Secretary of State's responsibilities in connection with that matter, are welcome. We shall return to those on the next clause.
<P>
The clause provides for the extension&#151;which we also welcome&#151;of the more general power to conduct induction arrangements to FE colleges. However, the amendment proposes the induction of new teachers and related staff members and proper preparation for working with people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. It would add a subsection (9), providing for a catch-up programme for people who have not previously received the training.
<P>
The background to the amendment is the so-called blue book on teacher education, which we issued in 1995 when moves were being made to establish the Teacher Training Agency. I was involved in persuading the Department to ensure that the identification of special needs was an important part of a new teacher's portfolio. I still believe that that is extremely important. It is also important for FE colleges, as we are extending induction responsibilities to them. I have said to the Minister on several occasions that there are two levels of response. The first level is to say, ``Fine, we'll put it in the Bill.'' The second is to say, ``We'll resist the amendment, but its spirit must be embodied in guidance for or the practice of the institutions in question.'' In this case, I would very much settle for a level two response, which I hope that the Minister will give.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Government support the principle that all teaching staff should have an appropriate awareness of the issues relating to those with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. There is no difference between us on that. However, I have to resist the amendments. The clause allows FE institutions to take part in statutory induction programmes for newly qualified teachers and, as we could have set out at greater length, requires newly qualified teachers to take account of those with special educational needs and to provide an appropriate environment and teaching method for all pupils. Those serving their induction in FE institutions will be required to work to the same high standards as those in the school sector.

Secondly, it would not be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of the recent consultation process, which sought to ensure that all FE teachers, not just those undergoing induction, have an appropriate awareness of the needs of students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. That consultation process finished at the end of March, having benefited from some 200 responses, including those from all the key players and groups in the provision for people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities. Those responses are being fully considered and a ministerial statement about our next steps will be made later this year. Hon. Members should be in no doubt that we attach proper importance to the issue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response, which was not wholly unanticipated. In the light of it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not intend to get cantankerous at this hour of the evening, especially as the Minister has spoken so eloquently. I seek from him&#151;a mere nod will suffice&#151;the assurances that as the amendment further qualifies the commitment in the clause, it in no way restricts its substance and that no individuals will be left out because the Secretary of State deems them not up to educational training so that they are unlikely to receive it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I am happy to give that reassurance.

Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I apologise, Mr. Maxton, but you may have noticed that the word ``Government'' does not appear in front of this on the selection of amendments. That is what caused me to jump to my feet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Clerk has admitted that it is his error.

Amendment agreed to.
