<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 3 March 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></h4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/095/1997095.htm">School Standards and Framework Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. You will be aware that some time ago the Committee discussed, at considerable length, the establishment of the school organisation committees and the adjudicator. The Minister assured us that decisions about future closures or the opening of new schools would be made at the local level. You may have heard, Mr. McWilliam, as I did, the Minister's statement an amazing coincidence a few hours before the countryside march that it was the Government's intention that the decision about the closure of small rural schools was to be made by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Only two possibilities can arise from that either it is the Government's intention that the new Bill will be law in the summer and that it is only between now and the summer that the Secretary of State will have such powers; or the Government will table a new amendment to the Bill to give the Secretary of State those powers. Have you, Mr. McWilliam, been given notification of the Government's intention to table such an amendment? If not, surely it is a misuse of the procedures of the House not to ensure that the Committee has an opportunity to debate such issues, rather than leave them to a later stage of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Nothing out of order has occurred. Telepathy is not a requirement for membership of the Chairmen's Panel.
<H4><center>Clause 104</center></H4>
<H4><center>Definition of nursery education</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): I beg to move amendment No. 490, in page 76, line 34, leave out "elsewhere" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in another pre-school institution whose primary purpose is education."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 469, in clause 105, page 76, line 37, after "education", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or such other pre-school provision as it considers desirable".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 491, in clause 105, page 76, line 41, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) A local education authority shall secure that provision by them of nursery education, whether within primary schools or in separate nursery schools, meets appropriate standards.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 470, in clause 107, page 77, line 41, after "regulations,", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(aa) set out the plans of the authority for the development of nursery provision in (i) reception classes in school, (ii) nursery classes in school and (iii) pre-school nursery provision, and state the basis on which it proposes that decisions will be made about the provision which will be made available to each individual child.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I seek clarification from the Government of the wording of clause 104, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In this Part `nursery education' means full-time or part-time education suitable for children who have not attained compulsory school age (whether provided at schools or elsewhere)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am interested to know the meaning of "elsewhere". I hope that it will not be as obscure as the definition of "aptitude", but it is important to clarify whether the Government mean bodies or institutions whose primary purpose is education, or those that have some form of statutory registration. That is not clear from the word "elsewhere" and it is on that basis that we tabled the amendment. We want a clearer idea of what the Government have in mind.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is quite warm in the Room this morning, so hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets. As always, hon. Ladies are free to do what they like.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> I am happy to give assurances to the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning). It may be helpful if she referred to the "Early Years Development Partnerships and Plans" guidance notes that were sent to local authorities and others before they started drawing up this year's plans. She will see on page 13 of the notes that we intend to include a range of providers, not only schools. Under clause 104, "schools" mean the maintained-school sector. Early-years education can take place there, but it can also take place within the voluntary and independent sectors. Naturally, they would have to be approved through the inspection system if they are to receive public money. All providers that could receive grants, and were inspected as such under the existing legislation, could be full partners under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell (Charnwood):</B> I rise to speak on the amendments because now is a convenient moment to pause and reflect on the balance of nursery provision that the Government envisage. The Under-Secretary answered my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton in a way that was no doubt well received by the Committee. We need to ensure a variety of provision for children of below statutory school age, to reflect the differing views of parents, differing family circumstances and the differing needs for children. I am pleased that the Under-Secretary has acknowledged that it is not desirable to expect nursery provision for children of pre-statutory school age always to be in a maintained school setting.
<P>
Before we consider the detail of part V of the Bill, it is important to understand the nature of the variety that the Government seek in pre-school provision and this is a more specific question the nature of the research that the Government think desirable on the effectiveness of the different sorts of pre-school provision. It is a matter of cross-party consensus that parents should be offered a choice of provision for pre-school-age children. Each of those different sorts of provisions will be supported by people who will make claims for the results in a child's later life. What plans do the Government have to research the different sorts[Mr. Stephen Dorrell]
of provision and how they might affect a child's later development?
<P>
What is the Government's view of the different provisions made for that group of children? The first model is nursery classes being provided by maintained schools a nursery class in a primary school or in a dedicated nursery school. The second model is the voluntary pre-school activity. As the Under-Secretary acknowledged in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton, that allows a well-developed network of provision involving the parents more directly, particularly the mother, in meeting the needs of the children. That is a voluntary arrangement in support of pre-school provision. The third model, which has been growing fastest in recent years, is the primary school reception class, which is not nursery class in the statutory sense, and certainly is not pre-school provision.
<P>
One of the problems with having three different sorts of provision was highlighted in the Under-Secretary's answer to my recent question about staffing regulations. The social services require a voluntary pre-school to have one member of staff for every eight four-year-old children in the unit. In a properly defined nursery class, there has to be one member of staff for each 13 children in the unit. Because reception classes are regarded as the bottom end of the primary school, there is no formal regulatory limit on the teacher-size of class ratio.
<P>
If the recent decline continues in the availability of pre-school provision, which has the highest staffing requirement, and the provision of reception classes, which has the lowest staffing requirement, continues to expand, the change should at least be measured by the Government. The desirability of that development from a public policy perspective should be the subject of critical analysis. At the moment, it is being offered in an unplanned way not only by the Department for Education and Employment, but by local education authorities and the shift in the sort of provision provided, particularly for four-year-olds, is happening without proper analysis of policy or results.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Can the Committee take the right hon. Gentleman's remarks as a repentance speech for nursery vouchers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The nursery voucher is one of the factors that led to the expansion of reception classes. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the evidence, he will see that expansion did not begin with the introduction of nursery vouchers and is not likely to end with their abolition. The incentives for primary school head teachers to recruit children into a reception class existed before nursery vouchers and will exist in the system that the Government envisage.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is implying that that is not true it is true. If a primary school gets more resources by attracting children into its reception classes, and those classes do not have the same regulatory requirements on staffing as nursery classes and pre-school classes, that is an incentive to which one would expect primary school heads to continue to respond, as they have been. As I said, that shift in pre-school provision should be subject to critical analysis. Those head teachers regularly put parents into a bind by telling them that they have to send their child to a reception class in a popular primary school if they want to be sure that the child will later have a place in infant and junior classes. That system gives the head teacher potential for what the business world would describe as an abuse of market power [Interruption.] Well, an abuse of position, in that the head teacher puts parents in an undesirable position by requiring them to send their children to the reception class so that they can receive a benefit later in the child's career, when those parents may have wanted to choose a different sort of provision. That is an undesirable pressure  [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should not heckle.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have already dealt with the sedentary point raised from the Liberal Democrat Bench, which was the same point as that raised by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner).
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Having experienced the pilot scheme, which was more like a forced march, I know that the previous Government were responsible for some of the negative elements that the right hon. Gentleman is detailing. For electoral reasons, we were pushed into national implementation without proper piloting and that created considerable problems. This Government are trying to ensure that there is a planning process and that issues are addressed. The right hon. Gentleman should at least acknowledge that the previous Government got it wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I acknowledge that the trends that I am describing began when the previous Government were in office. Unless the Government take action, those trends are likely to continue. It is proper to ask Ministers where they stand on the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised. I look forward to the answer, because it is not revealed in the Bill or, with respect to the Under-Secretary, in the supporting documentation that the Government have published.
<P>
To continue the development of provision for pre-school age children which the Opposition support and which we develop during our years in office we need provision below the age of five and provision that offers parents real choice and variety, reflecting the fact that different families and children have different needs. We want to develop that balance of provision.
<P>
I want the Under-Secretary's assurance that the Government envisage a continuing role for the voluntary pre-school movement. The Under-Secretary and I attended a recent launch on behalf of the pre-school movement, and I seek an assurance that the Government recognise both the desirability of continuing to develop that provision and the difficulties that many pre-school groups face because of the loss of their four-year-olds to reception classes, which puts in question the viability of many of those pre-school groups.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk was right to say that the trends have developed over a period of years, but they have continued unabated over the past few months. Unless there is a conscious shift in public policy, which is not foreshadowed in the clauses on nursery education, we must expect those trends to continue. The Under-Secretary should commit the Government to monitor those changes and to consider the public policy implications that they raise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Hope </B>(Corby): I am gratified that the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) has decided to convert from the nursery voucher market place chaos, which this Government inherited, to early years development planning. I welcome his change of view.
<P>
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the "Early Years Development Partnerships and Plans" guidance notes, which spell out the way forward to develop provision for all children from the age of nought to eight. That document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Over time the age range of the Plan should cover at least birth to 8 years old for the full range of services. . . However in 1998-99 some Plans will focus on the initial requirements of places for four year olds only."</font></ul>
<P>
That document, to which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary referred, describes the aims of the partnership and states that it should
<P><ul><font size=-1>
"bring together the maintained, private and voluntary sectors in a spirit of co-operation and partnership, based on existing good practice".
<P></ul></font>
The document then lists the members of that partnership and the expected providers.
<P>
All the points raised by the right hon. Member for Charnwood have been fully dealt with in the guidance notes that have been issued to local authorities to enable them to produce their early years development partnership plans. If that is not convincing enough, the draft evaluation criteria, with which local education authorities have also been issued, state that in addition to all the detail, the plans produced by local partnerships
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"must: demonstrate that a free, good quality, part time early years education place can be provided for four year olds ... clearly demonstrate that there is co-operation and partnership between all providers and sectors ... show commitment to ensuring that every place secured is of good quality".
<P></ul></font>
The questions that have been asked are fully answered by our practical action not awaited, but happening now in taking forward our plans to provide decent, good quality pre-school places for all children.
<P>
I should like to draw to the Committee's attention the excellent Pen Green centre in Corby, which is one of seven centres of excellence that the Government have identified. It provides a comprehensive range of services for children and parents. It is a model of good practice, which many other local authorities might want to emulate. In Northamptonshire, there is a range of provision, a new early years development plan and all providers are involved in a working partnership. That will be in the interests of all children in Northamptonshire.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I want to speak to amendment No. 491, which I tabled. It would include in the Bill a requirement for local education authorities to ensure that the nursery education provided in nursery classes in their primary schools or maintained nursery schools reaches appropriate standards. That is important because the whole of part V deals with nursery education and schedule 26 refers to inspection of nursery education, but there is no specific reference to the responsibility of the local education authority to maintain standards of nursery education. It is important for that reference to be included in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Corby (Mr. Hope) quoted from the various documents on early years education that the Government have sent out to local education authorities. I noted that the hon. Gentleman referred to the requirement that every place secured should be of good quality and of an appropriate standard, and I am sure that we all agree with that. Therefore, the provision should be included in the Bill, rather than being merely guidelines issued to local authorities. After all, the Bill is about schools standards and framework and the issue of standards in nursery education is extremely important.
<P>
I understand that there will be a debate on appropriate standards in nursery education. Some members of the Committee may have seen the Channel 4 "Dispatches" programme at the end of January. I did not see it, but I heard about it afterwards. It raised the question of what is appropriate to be provided for children at pre-statutory school age and whether we push too much for formalised education on reading and writing, rather than play-based and action-based education. There is a genuine debate to be had about the provision of pre-school education to ensure that children are given a correct basis.
<P>
While I hesitate, following the previous contribution, to quote a constituency example, I shall not be prevented from doing so. A few weeks ago, I mentioned a maintained nursery school in Cookham, where great emphasis is put on a variety of activities. The programme includes talking and listening; stories and rhymes; pre-reading skills; word books; drawing and colouring; writing opportunities; tracing, templates; matching; counting and number recognition; sequencing and various other maths-related activities; floating and sinking; magnification; mirrors; and so on. There is a whole list of activities under various headings, including music and drama; art and craft; technology; computer; and social, emotional, moral and physical education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am very interested in the curriculum that the hon. Lady is outlining. Does she agree that it is absolutely essential to have qualified staff to deliver quality in early years education?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point; I was about to refer to staffing in classes. When we consider the interaction between nursery classes and schools, the reception classes for rising fives and the issue of maintaining appropriate provision, we find that the best examples of nursery education occur when it is offered by those who are specially trained in early years education.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend will be aware that nursery teachers are concerned about children who have only just turned four being included in reception classes. At that age, a year's development makes a lot of difference it is 25 per cent. of their life span to date, so development in that period is signficant. There is a worry that some options may result in what nursery teachers regard as inappropriate settings for very young children.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> My hon. Friend has anticipated some of the comments that I intended to make later 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Sorry.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> No, not at all my hon. Friend made the point rather better than I would have done. Nursery teachers are raising a genuine problem.
<P>
When I visited Cookham nursery school, the head teacher and the chairman of governors raised with me the problem of ensuring that those who are teaching children in the early years of nursery provision are appropriately trained, because such teaching is different from teaching a child in a primary school. The real problem arises when young children enter a reception class in a primary school and may be taught by teachers who are more used to teaching children older than five within that school. Teaching an eight-year-old is quite different from teaching a four-year-old.
<P>
It is important for us to consider the whole issue of who is appropriate to teach within nursery provision. That is another reason why it is important to require the local education authority to ensure that the nursery education provided in its schools and nursery classes is of an appropriate standard. I admit that the wording of my amendment may not be the most felicitous despite having spent several weeks in Committee, I still have a lot to learn about drafting but I hope that the Government accept the concept of the need for a duty on local education authorities to maintain standards. It is important that LEAs closely consider the interaction between nursery education and the early years of primary school.
<P>
Increasingly, LEAs are concerend about the extent to which they will be able to continue to provide separate maintained nursery schools, rather than bringing children to their primary schools, because of the financial squeeze imposed on them by the Government under the recent settlement [Interruption.]

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Madam Speaker has ruled strongly that pagers must be switched off or be on silent mode.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverly Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): My apologies, Mr. McWilliam. I have come straight from home and forgot to switch my pager to vibrate mode.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I note that the hon. Lady is switching her pager to vibrate mode at the moment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is nothing wrong with that mine is on the same mode.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I am sure, Mr. McWilliam, that you will be happily vibrating together.
<P>
I would be interested to hear the Government's comments on the question of ensuring standards of nursery education. It is important to emphasise that nursery education is education. When nursery education started to be 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The reading of newspapers in Committee is not in order. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) should put his newspaper away. If he intends to quote from it later, he can photocopy the page.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I suspect, Mr. McWilliam, that I have hit the depths of speaking in the House if even Liberal Democrat Members feel that they have to read the newspaper when I am speaking. I thought that they were interested in nursery education, but obviously they are not.
<P>
When nursery education began to become prevalent in this country, some took the attitude that it was just about providing somewhere for mums to leave their kids. We must give a clear message that that is not what it is about; it is about education. That is why it is so important to ensure that that education is being provided by properly trained and qualified people and to appropriate standards.
<P>
We have talked about reception classes and rising fives. What is the Government's policy on and attitude to rising fives? A number of primary schools in my constituency are finding it difficult to accommodate them. For example, because of the settlement agreed for Wokingham district council and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, this summer Polehampton school in Twyford, will not be able to accommodate a tranche of rising fives. Those children will miss an extra term of education at the school, whereas some of their peers will have had the opportunity to go to the school.
<P>
I am aware that it is down to the admissions authority. It has always been the policy in Berkshire that schools can take such decisions for themselves, but there is a growing concern about accommodation and whether all children are provided with educational opportunities. Children should not be prevented from taking an educational opportunity at a school because the size of a particular tranche of children makes accommodation difficult. Given the leeway that the Government have given themselves in providing extra resources to maintain infant class sizes at 30 or below, I wonder whether they should also consider this matter.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that the Committee and the Government will accept that standards in nursery education are important. Given that the Bill is called the "School Standards and Framework Bill", I hope that the Government will accept that it should be made quite clear in the Bill, in the section on nursery education, that nursery education should be provided to appropriate standards. That will require all local education authorities to ensure good standards in the various elements of nursery education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I join my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) in supporting the amendments. We have learned the hard way that unless you tie the Government down and get them to spell things out, you do not know where you stand.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have no intention of tying anyone down.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Quite so, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Nowhere could the contrast between the Government's public attitude and their policies be more clearly illustrated than in the matter of village schools, many of which are having to depend on an element of pre-school provision to justify their existence.
<P>
At the weekend, we heard the Minister for School Standards championing the survival of the village school, but at the same time, his colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions took more than œ100 million from shire counties, where many villages schools are based, and gave it to metropolitan areas. The result will be that great pressure will be put on LEAs in shire counties to find savings. That will inevitably pose a threat to village schools.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are talking about amendment No. 490, which is specifically about nursery education. The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) was going a bit wide of the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for that ruling, Mr. McWilliam, as I was becoming increasingly irritated by a speech that was flying in the face of reality. Does the hon. Member for Guildford accept that during the last five years of the Conservative Government, which he supported, more village primary schools were closed than at any other time in our history?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am conscious that you will call me to order, Mr. McWilliam, if I dwell for too long on that subject.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall call the hon. Member to order if he dwells on it at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I was about to say that, in this coming year, œ2 million will be taken from Surrey county council's education budget, and in particular its provisions for nought to four-year-olds. Frankly, that will impact especially on village schools because they increasingly rely on the early years component of their education provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hope:</B> This year, Northamptonshire a shire county received from the Labour Government the second highest standard spending assessment in the country. That comes after four consecutive years of vicious funding cuts, which threatened village schools, village nursery schools and secondary schools across the county. I was a county councillor at the time, and I remember the Labour county council making provisions to protect schools from the ravages of the previous Administration. It is a bit rich that the hon. Gentleman should criticise the present Government for failing to protect small schools when the Conservative Government did so much damage in previous years.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are ploughing a particularly unproductive farrow, as we are all out of order except me.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I can only draw on my experience as a by-election candidate 11 years ago, when, for the first time, a Conservative Government made a specific pledge to protect the interests of village schools. I was delighted to endorse that pledge, which was made by Mrs. Angela Rumbold, the Minister at the time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause and the amendments relate specifically to nursery schools. When I attended a village school in Peebleshire more years ago than I care to remember there was no nursery anywhere near it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for beaming me on to my next point. In Bramley, where I live, we fought hard for two years to prevent the closure of the village school. One reason why the school is now viable is that it is developing early years provision. It is important that that provision is of the right standard and it is worrying that we have not heard a clear statement from the Government about how that standard will be achieved.
<P>
I received a letter from the principal of the College of Care and Early Education in which he expressed his concern about the message that seems to be coming from the Government, namely:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that childcare can be provided for those returning to work by rapidly training a vast number of school leavers and those who have failed to find work in other areas."
<P></ul></font>
The principal points out that in the first year of a child's life the brain doubles in size, and it proceeds to double in size again over the next four years. That is a critical period of development for any child. Do the Government intend the expansion of early years education to be provided by teachers who reach a quality standard, or are they content that a proportion of that education is provided by those whom one might call, for want of another word, child minders?
<P>
The Surrey Association of Montessori Schools wrote to me recently on behalf of that excellent group of schools in my county. It was concerned that the way in which the Government made the transition from the voucher scheme to their own funding proposal would jeopardise the position of some good schools that provide high quality teaching and development, but necessarily at a cost considerably above the level that the Government have set nationwide. I am sure that the Under-Secretary is familiar with such correspondence.
<P>
The association said that the Government provided œ1,100 per child under its scheme, whereas even for local education authority schools in Surrey the budget in the coming year will be about œ1,800 to œ1,900. That illustrates the differences that there will be throughout the country in the cost of provision by local education authorities. In its most recent letter to me, the association states: "To create genuine partnership" the partnership between the public and private sectors in early years provision 
<P><ul><font size=-1>
"the LEA must be more open about how they fund nursery places."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that the local authority calculations of what grant is sufficient for its provision does not include rent, rates, building services and other factors. In contrasting the cost of a private sector provision and that of a state sector school, there are some real hidden costs.
[Mr. St. Aubyn]
<P>
The Under-Secretary has been helpful to Montessori schools in Surrey. The guidance issued in January on top-up fees for early years education places was useful. In Surrey, where the Conservative LEA is keen to promote Montessori schools, it is hoped that such a measure will be regarded as broadening the breadth of provision

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to the next clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am speaking about maintaining standards, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause concerns definition. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to clause 105, not clause 104. He must return to clause 104.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I stand corrected, Mr. McWilliam. I wanted to emphasise the need to clarify the intentions of the Government towards Montessori schools and others in the private sector, which maintain high standards.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> With the leave of the Committee, having already spoken once in the debate by accident 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady does not need the leave of the Committee; members of the Committee may speak as often as they like, provided they stay in order.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am glad that you did not say that in our first sitting, Mr. McWilliam, or we may not have reached what may be our last.
<P>
Many of the points raised by both Conservative and Labour Members are genuine although Labour Members who sat on the Committee stage of the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996, which introduced nursery vouchers, are a little irked to hear Opposition Members telling us that what we warned would happen has happened. We thought that it was bad legislation and that is why we voted against it. The Government now have the task of picking up the pieces and making sense of early years provision. The Government and the Opposition agree that it is crucial to the interests of children that we get that right.
<P>
For the first time, local authorities have been given the responsibility of providing places for early years education. The previous Government made such education a priority only during the last two or three years of their time in office and when they did so, they introduced the wrong policies. For the preceding 15 years, there had been no positive action to promote early years education. Positive action existed and flourished only in local councils, not central Government. Parents and others now accept that early years education is crucial, but much work remains to be done.
<P>
I shall explain what we have done and what we plan to do. The right hon. Member for Charnwood was right about the research project. It is like many other things in education; what is considered appropriate for those essential early years changes over time. As we gather more evidence about what works, people change their minds. The hon. Member for Maidenhead is right, there was a time when parents were happy for their children merely to be in a safe, secure place while they were at work, without worrying about the educational benefits or disadvantages of a particular environment. In a relatively short period, early years education has grown in importance and everyone involved has acknowledged that it is indeed education.
<P>
There has been a change of mood over the past three to five years. There was a feeling that if early years education is education, we need simply do earlier with children what we do with them at five. Much of the research, such as the "Dispatches" programme I did not see it, but I read the booklet which the hon. Member for Maidenhead may also have read introduced the notion that early years education should prepare children to learn through communication, listening and the development of social skills. The right hon. Member for Charnwood will be pleased to know that the university of London institute of education has undertaken a five-year research project, funded by the Department and led by Professor Kathy Sylva, an established and respected expert in the field; it is examining all types of provision before primary school and monitoring the outcomes on 2,500 children at key stage 1. It was set up under the previous Government and is a third of the way through. It is probably the first research project to evaluate the different pre-school environments.
<P>
We also have the reports from Ofsted and Her Majesty's chief inspector who has a duty to report each year to the Secretary of State on the pattern of provision and on any other issue about which the Secretary of State may request information. A growing body of evidence about what is successful is therefore available. We must also remember that the early years are not compulsory years of education and it must be left to parents to exercise their right to choose what happens to their child during those years. Some will decide that their child is better off staying at home until they start school at five; others will want their child to attend for one, two or three terms before the age of four. We need to ensure that there is a pattern of provision in terms of location, style, involvement of parents and integration with child care that meets parents' needs no matter what course they choose to take.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is why we do not want to accept amendment No. 470, in particular, because it would provide that the local authority should somehow decide what is best for a child. We are talking about parents' right to make that decision. That leads me on to my second theme. If we are to achieve a range of provision, early years education cannot be restricted to the maintained sector, it must involve voluntary playgroups and the independent sector, because they provide diversity and choice for parents.
<P>
Playgroups have experienced difficulty recently. Opposition Members were absolutely right: under the nursery voucher scheme there was an incentive to get children into reception class, because that attracted money. Local authorities had lost the money in the first place, so they were attempting to recoup their loss. Under the previous Government, the more that authorities had done previously to provide early years education, the more they then lost; the less they had done previously, the less they then lost. There was an absolute incentive for authorities to recoup what they had lost so that they could continue to provide the good quality of service that they had been providing for many years.
<P>
Paragraph 60 of the early years guidance that we issued states clearly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For example, maintained schools are not expected to expand their reception classes by taking in the youngest four year olds unless appropriate provision is made for such children."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have done as much as we can within what is essentially a non-statutory requirement to take in children under five to make it clear that we want appropriate provision.
<P>
We must not run away with the idea that appropriate provision cannot be provided in the maintained sector. What is key is the quality of what is provided, not where it is provided. It is no good having poor provision in the voluntary or independent sector. Whether provision is good or bad is not determined by the sector in which it exists. It is crucial that provision is appropriate to the level, needs and age of the child. When we inspect we are arranging for Ofsted inspection of all providers it is vital that that is considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I agree about the importance of ensuring that provision is high quality, whether it is in the public or the private sector. May I return the Under-Secretary to the question of the incentive currently in the system which certainly existed under the voucher scheme, but which still exists now and will continue in future for a primary school to recruit into a reception class? I agree with her emphasis on the parental right to choose and variety of provision. With respect, she is skirting round the difficult issue, which is how parents' right to choose and variety of provision can be delivered without perpetuating the powerful incentive on primary schools to recruit into reception classes. Will she meet that issue head on and, in particular, address the different regulations that apply to four-year-olds, which make it more difficult to provide a level playing field across the different types of provision?
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> There is an age in law by which a child must start school; we do not want to introduce an age under which a child cannot start school, although that would obviously be one way to deal with the problem.
<P>
We have dealt with the matter by partnership. For example, on behalf of the Secretary of State I am considering some of the early years development plans submitted by local authorities. Although we will make announcements in due course about what appears to be good provision and will give examples of good practice, I was heartened that according to two partnership forms that have already been submitted, two local authorities have moved from a single point of entry to two points of entry in any one year. Under the voucher scheme, many local authorities moved to a single point of entry, which cut out the incomes of voluntary and independent sectors for one or two terms.
<P>
I was heartened that having made the different schools sit together to plan provision across a local authority area, two of those that I have looked at so far agreed that children who could go to local authority maintained schools, could end up in either the maintained or voluntary sector. That has to be the way forward. The measure is not about dogma or about saying, "That will not happen." It is about building in a mechanism that will work.
<P>
The key to the early years partnership is the plan that will be produced as a result of consultations and deliberations. I welcome the enthusiasm of all those concerned in the early years forums in suggesting good ideas that have not been thought of elsewhere. They have suggested local solutions to local needs and we shall be monitoring their ideas.
<P>
We have made the definition as clear as we can. We have tried not to build in financial incentives for reception classes to be expanded, but we shall take stock after the first year of provision because we are determined to ensure that good providers are not squeezed out of the system.
<P>
The regulations are in a mess; they were not tackled by the previous Government in 18 years. We shall do so on three fronts. We are almost ready to publish a consultation paper on the regulatory framework to bring together inspection of child care and early years learning. We cannot ask local people to integrate early years education with child care, and then not integrate the systems of inspection or regulations on teacher qualifications and so on. It will not be an easy task. There are some good reasons why the numbers are different. More adults will be required if the children involved are very young. If fully qualified teachers are available, some people may feel that they can cope with more children, although I am not saying whether they can or cannot. However, it will not be too long before full consultation is completed and decisions are made about where to go from here. Further legislation may be required in due course.
<P>
Comments were made about the quality of teachers and the range of qualifications that exist. We have asked the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to bring together all the different qualifications into a semblance of order. We want a clear framework of qualifications. Some could help parents to become assistants in playgroups. They may have failed at school or it could be their first time back into work and learning. We could have a qualification allowing them to gain a certificate; it may be on the bottom rung of the ladder, but they could then go further. There is no reason why people who have qualifications and experience in LEAs should not go on to full teacher training courses. They ought to have access to that ladder of opportunity.
<P>
We await advice from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority on the new qualifications framework. We also await advice from QCA at easter on alternatives to the desirable learning outcomes. That is when we shall begin to see a reflection on the LEA's curriculum and all that has been learnt in the past two years desirable learning outcomes are only two years old.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> There sems to be an emphasis on inspection. One of the main issues that will affect placements in the early years development plans is the fact that there are very small private sector providers, which do not have the support that an LEA institution will have. What will the Government do about giving advisory support to those organisations and where will they get the resources to do so?
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Some of those, sometimes isolated, playgroups are now part of the partnership, so at least everyone knows that they exist. Their representatives will attend partnership meetings, which is an important first step.
<P>
The backstop to the policy is that, from this September, nursery providers in all settings no matter where or who they are, or how they are financed will benefit from the involvement of a qualified teacher. That will make a huge difference to the playgroup to which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred.
<P>
We have suggested to local authorities that, in rural areas, there might be eight, nine or 10 playgroups located in different villages and that a teacher might be involved in guiding them. We want to ensure that playgroups benefit from that involvement, but there must be local solutions to local problems. My constituency a compact urban seat does not have such problems; one nursery is almost on top of the other. We do not want to be prescriptive about such matters, but we are keen to include a bottom line while working out the qualifications.
<P>
We would like, in time, to be able to specify that teachers with early years qualifications and experience should be involved. We cannot do that now because there are insufficient numbers of such teachers, but the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will know that we have changed the category of initial teacher training that covers three to eight-year-olds. With the increasing importance of early years education, the number of applicants to that category will increase.
<P>
We have had a wide-ranging debate on the clause the first in part V. Although much is still to be done, there is agreement about the importance of early years education. Mistakes have been made in the past 18 years. We have moved quickly to abandon the nursery voucher scheme, but we are moving as quickly as possible to put something in its place that will ensure co-operation, quality and maintain the choice that parents want.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The Under-Secretary has been speaking specifically to clause 104, but amendment No. 491, which I tabled, relates to clause 105. She has spoken about the importance of standards, but what is her reaction to my proposal to have a specific requirement, as in amendment No. 491, on standards in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I do not disagree with that proposal in principle or in any other way. Of course it is right that local authorities have regard to standards. I shall reflect on that matter, but I think that it is probably accounted for elsewhere. I am content about the quality of provision given that every provider will be inspected and given the desirable learning outcome the single aim of which is to ensure the quality of provision, however it is carried out. We look to Ofsted and to the inspection framework to maintain that provision. I am confident that partnerships will mean that more providers will train together, so raising standards. If, on reflection, there appears to be a hole in the Bill, we would wish to fill it.
<P>
I must correct what I said earlier the requirement for qualified teachers to be involved will begin in September 1999, not September 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> This has been a wide-ranging debate on what is in theory a narrow clause, but the group of amendments has provided an opportunity to consider the Government's broad approach to nursery education. I welcome the fact that the Under-Secretary has stressed the importance of having variety of provision and of ensuring that the parent's choice is the principal determinant in the type of provision a child receives if the child receives any provision at all. Parents must have the right to choose not to put their children into pre-school education. I welcome all that she said about that.
<P>
With respect to the Under-Secretary, she has expressed the hope that there will be variety of provision and parental choice in the system without knowing how to reconcile the different forces. She took some free sideswipes at the nursery voucher scheme. The reality is that those pressures were not invented by the nursery voucher scheme, and they have not disappeared with its abolition. Ministers have still to resolve the pressures. Nevertheless, the Under-Secretary set out a way forward and a list of objectives. I have no difficulty in endorsing them.

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We Liberal Democrats decided not to take part in the previous debate, although we enjoyed watching the conversion of the right hon. Member for Charnwood and other Conservative Members. The fact that they should be asking the Government for so much action so quickly 
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have only got three words out [Interruption.] I cannot add up, either. I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
Rather than have a debate on nursery vouchers, we should make clear the enormous damage done by the Conservative Government to early years education. It was a political gimmick. It was done not to provide quality of education, but to bribe parents, and it failed. I remember once doing a sponsored walk with Saltergate infant school, which needed œ12,000 to extend a classroom to make room for an extra five children. That was the only way in which the school could preserve the quality of its teaching.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Clause 105, like clause 104, is about nursery schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I was talking about nursery-age children, Mr. McWilliam. However, I stand corrected.
<P>
We welcome the Government's commitment to nursery education. It seems that we have a constructive dialogue, which we hope will continue throughout the lifetime of this Parliament, on developing nursery education. The amendment allows us to ask the Government to be a little more ambitious in that respect.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading, I was a late convert to the value of early-years education. Being somewhat long in the tooth and a secondary school head, I had little to do with nursery schools or with the early years of primary education. I worked in east Leeds and remember an oversubscribed, school where something was clearly wrong. Nearly 80 per cent. of the children had a reading age of at least two years below their chronological age. I can remember sitting down with the hon. Member for Lees, East (Mr. Mudie), who is now the deputy Whip, and our shouting at each other he shouted a lot and I had to listen about why the school had such problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson (Plymouth, Devonport):</B> Nothing has changed!
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Nothing has changed.
<P>
The deputy Whip invited me to visit some of the primary schools in the area to see what some teachers had to face. I did, and it was an eye opener to see just how difficult were the circumstances that so many of those teachers had to face, particularly teachers of reception classes. Some classes were overloaded, with more than 30 pupils, and the teachers were dealing with children who had none of the basic skills necessary to enable them to be taught. They had no language skills; they communicated only with aggression and by hitting each other; they pinched things from each other, shouted and had tantrums; their use of words and their recognition of objects was incredibly poor; and their understanding of colour and of simple number was virtually non-existent.
<P>
Nobody needs to tell the Liberal Democrats, especially not me, that the case for early years education has been proven. Indeed, the most important clauses of the Bill are on early years education, because they provide a long-term investment. If we get that right, and if we start to redress the problems that exist in so many inner-city and rural areas, where children are growing up without those basic skills, we shall be able to deliver better provision in later years.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have it as an ambition to include a foundation key stage as a discrete part of the education system. It would cover children of between three and six years old, and it would embrace their education as an entity, with its own curriculum, its own standards, its own framework, its own inspection and its own specialist teaching force. That notion has much merit; indeed, examples can been seen throughout Europe of formal teaching not starting until the age of six or seven. Those early years are seen as different and separate. Indeed, I am glad that members of the Committee said earlier that reception teaching or infant teaching is different from early years teaching. It is good that the Committee recognises that differences.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to extend early years education to all three and four-year-olds. We know full well that the Government could not immediately magic enough places for all three and four-year-olds, even if they wanted to. However, a Government who put nursery or early years education at the heart of their school standards programme should have a greater ambition than simply to ape previous provisions for four-year-olds. Extending those provisions to three-year-olds, either during this Parliament or later, should be an ambition for all in the education.
<P>
There are some distinct advantages to having three-year-olds as well as four-year-olds included in the provision. First, as we have mentioned on several occasions, the quality of staff is important. I was delighted that the hon. Member for Maidenhead responded so positively to my question, and I agree wholeheartedly with her that properly trained, properly qualified staff are needed to teach the early years sector. Neither private nor public providers will find the resources nor the continuity of resources necessary to recruit permanent quality staff on the basis of just one school year. It is therefore important to create a financial base to expand the provision.
<P>
The second factor, not mentioned in the previous debate, is the quality of the buildings. I know that we abandoned minimum standards during the previous Parliament, particularly for primary schools; but for early years education, the quality of the physical environment is desperately important. It is absolutely crucial in order to achieve a good start. You cannot do it, either as a public sector or a private sector provider, unless you have the critical mass to create the financial base necessary to achieve that sort of investment. That is why it is so important to include three as well as four-year-olds.
<P>
We have already mentioned the stranglehold on reception classes, and it has been well documented. If three and four-year-olds were a discrete sector, it would remove the stranglehold of nursery children going into reception classes. However, there is another important factor about including three-year-olds. Many nursery schools provide for three-year-olds and perhaps one term for four-year-olds. Three-year-olds, to develop at that crucial age, need role models. It could be said that[Mr. Willis]
four-year-olds are not particularly important role models, but they are in the early years setting. Seeing and playing with older children is important, so that they can develop socially and academically.
<P>
There is also an important financial requirement, especially for nurseries in the private sector, to enable children to have two full years. Many nurseries are closing at present, because they cannot sustain their provision with three-year-olds alone. Liberal Democrats make no bones about wanting an expansion of local authority provision and quality nursery schools. All evidence points to the fact that they deliver the highest quality overall education in early years provision. Many studies have demonstrated that.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to persuade the Government to work towards a vision of nursery education for three-year-olds as well as for four-year-olds. We want to make those who are making the provision, both in the private and the public sectors, aware of that vision. Let us be serious about raising standards and giving all our children the best possible start.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Let us also be serious about the use of the word "you".
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman made his point well. If early years education is good for four-year-olds, it is good for three-year-olds. He described the provision as "three to six"; in our plans we called it "nought to eight" because, in the long term, we must consider what happens to children before the age of three certainly in terms of the development of communication and so on. The hon. Gentleman knows that we can move only as resources allow and we have to do so in a planned way. The record of Labour LEAs on the education of three-year-olds is far better than the record of the Liberal Democrats at local level. We have no reason to apologise for our record on early years education.
<P>
At present, only 34 per cent. of three-year-olds are in early years education in the maintained sector. It would cost œ460 million to make that available for all three-year-olds. We have not sat back and taken no action. Some local education authorities already have 100 per cent. provision for three-year-olds, but that provision is not spread evenly throughout the country. Some authorities have not even begun to plan for provision for three-year-olds. We said in our early years document that local education authorities will have a responsibility to provide for four-year-olds from this September, but we want them to show in their plans for this year how they will expand, so that they can provide places for three-year-olds, too.
<P>
That is a priority and we shall not run away from it. In due course, when the time is right, we shall want local authorities to provide for three-year-olds as they have provided for four-year-olds, but it was not possible for us to do so this year. I doubt whether those local authorities, which have been Tory controlled for years and in which early years education was almost non-existent, could have made such a provision this September.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I rise in response to the Under-Secretary's slur on Tory education authorities. I was chairman of a Conservative education authority which, eight years ago, completed its plans to provide a nursery school place for every three and four-year-old child whose parents wished them to have a place in the county primary school. We also persuaded the voluntary controlled church primary schools to provide nursery units. Each year, we spent above the SSA on education and managed to keep rates and the council tax down at the same time.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It is a pity that the hon. Lady did not spread that good practice. I congratulate her authority on its action, but statistics show clearly that Tories are pretty much at the bottom of the league table when it comes to the provision of early years education for three and four-year-olds. I welcome those small pockets of good practice in Conservative local authority areas, and let us hope that other authorities follow suit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for her comments. My party is only 10 years old it has its anniversary this month and in the areas that we control we have suffered from the previous Government's draconian spending cuts.
<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman has just cut himself loose from all Liberal history although Gladstone would be pleased that he could not be held responsible for some of the arguments of the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The history of British political parties is not a subject suitable for teaching in nurseries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I merely wanted to establish how successful we have been over the past 10 years.
<P>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Maidenhead for not giving way to her when I spoke to the amendment. The amendments enable us to express our vision for early years education. We are grateful that the Minister shares much of that vision and, indeed, is going beyond it with the proposed provision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> You pulled me up during our debate on the previous clause, Mr. McWilliam, and said that my comments were more appropriate to the clause that we are now discussing.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was a ruling, not an invitation.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am aware of that, Mr. McWilliam, but I have the interests of my constituents and of the wider community at heart.
<P>
Would the Under-Secretary answer the points that I raised earlier? In the guidance occasionally given by the Secretary of State, as provided for in subsection (2)(b), does the Under-Secretary intend to give guidance to local authorities on the teaching qualifications and standards necessary for teachers providing early years education? Will she deal with the point made by the College of Care and Early Education that those who have merely a child minder level of skill might not be appropriate? Will she also answer the problem raised by the Montessori schools in Surrey? Having reached a modus vivendi with Conservative-controlled Surrey county council, a minimal stance has been adopted whereby Montessori schools need provide only one free place to qualify under Surrey's scheme. Does the Minister recognise the need for such flexibility in local arrangements? Will she give guidance to other local authorities to be generous and flexible in order to encourage the high standard of education that schools such as Montessori schools provide?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Of course I recognise it the Government, not the local authority, enabled that flexibility. We gave to all local authorities the guidance that we gave to Surrey in January. We want flexibility, within the framework of our early years development plans. Our guidelines are for good-quality education that is inspected and that is seen to be achieving the desirable learning outcomes. There is a wide range of early years provision; some providers do not work to desirable learning outcomes, which puts them in a difficult position in regard, for example, to nursery education grants. Surrey has taken advantage of the flexibility that we offered it in January, as have other local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> What initiative or action would the Under-Secretary take if local authorities do not adopt Surrey's attitude and do not have such a helpful approach towards the private sector provision of early years learning?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It is a decision for the partnership. We put the framework and the mechanisms in place; it is for the partnership, not just the local authority, to decide how it acts. Our letter will go to the partnership; all members of the partnership will be aware of the letter and will make the decision together. If the hon. Gentleman wants to write to me to let me know of local authorities that have withheld the document from the partnership, or have not acted in line with the document, I will happily consider the matter.
<P>
There may be a series of reasons why a partnership acts in a certain way. The safeguard is that the local authority does not act in isolation, it will consult the partnership. The range of provision that will emerge from partnerships will by definition vary. For example, what will emerge from the partnership with local authorities that already have 100 per cent. of their three and four-year-olds in maintained provision will be very different from what will emerge from the partnership with local authorities that are almost starting from scratch.
<P>
I think that I answered the points about the qualifications of those teaching in the early years sector in my response to our debate on the previous clause, so I shall not go over that again.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7) Each partnership shall in discharging its functions under this section and additional functions as may be specified in an order made under subsection (6) have regard to reviews conducted by the local education authority for the area under section 315 of the Education Act 1996.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is simple, and I hope that the Government will accept it. It is to ensure that special educational needs provision is in all settings, including that of an early years development plan, kept under review. All members of the Committee will recognise that there are specific benefits to the early identification of children with special educational needs, especially children with behavioural problems. A lot of research demonstrates that behavioural problems can be identified very early on, and that the earlier they are tackled and systematically dealt with, the greater the chance the child has of integrating normally into school life thereafter.
<P>
It is not obvious that the Bill requires authorities to ensure that provision is both adequate and appropriate, although the Department's 1998-99 guidance document, "Early Years Development Partnerships and Plans" stated that the Government would require that.
<P>
The amendment would ensure a co-ordinated approach by the LEA to arrangements for provision for children with special educational needs. There will be statements for children younger than the compulsory school starting age, so there should be a requirement to review provision for early years development plans.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is simple. Once children enter mainstream schools, there are annual reviews to consider whether setting are appropriate. There is no such provision for early years education; the amendment would remedy that.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> We would not wish to leave loopholes in this matter. I reassure the hon. Gentleman we have taken action on the matter in two ways. First, there is a requirement in primary legislation on providers funded through an early years development plan to have regard to the SEN code of practice. Secondly, as the hon. Gentleman said, in the information we issued on development partnership plans, we said that plans must state that all providers are able to identify and assess SEN and include details of how support will be provided to facilitate that.
<P>
I feel that that covers the matter. I am, as always, ready to reflect on it, because it is so important to ensure that special needs children are identified and supported early on. If we felt that more detail was needed, we would provide it by statutory guidance rather than in the Bill. I hope that, given those assurances, the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 267, in page 77, line 42, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3A) Regulations under this section shall inter alia specify the qualifications required to be held by persons involved in the provision of nursery education.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many of the issues surrounding this amendment have been debated earlier, so I shall not make the speech that I had prepared. However, I can provide those members of the Committee who are especially interested with documents that clearly state that quality, well-qualified and well-trained staff are necessary to ensure quality early years education.
<P>
All the research from the Audit Commission report, "Counting to Five", to "Starting with Quality", the report commissioned by the Committee of Enquiry into the Quality of Educational Experience offered Three and Four Year Olds, chaired by Mrs. Angela Rumbold concludes that well-qualified teachers and specialist teaching are the best ways to deliver quality early years education.
<P>
We would never dream of asking an unqualified teacher to teach a group of 18-year-olds advanced mathematics, but, sadly, we would be happy for people without formal qualifications, who have nothing other than a genuine interest in children, to teach young children. We expect that to produce quality provision it does not. The purpose of the amendment is to seek an assurance from the Government I understand that they gave such an assurance earlier that only high quality, well-qualified staff will be involved in early years education that is funded from the public purse.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I do not disagree with the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, but I shall add to what he said. The Under-Secretary said that the Government are looking at the age range from nought to eight. The training for teachers of that age group should be of the appropriate type and duration. However, by drawing the line at age eight rather than perhaps seven, training is taken into key stage 2, which is not appropriate for the age group on which we are focusing. It would be a waste of time and resources for individuals to train up to key stage 2, when their skills and knowledge could be reinforced in the lower age group in which they would be more appropriately involved.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I do not want to repeat the statement that I have made about QCA's work on the qualifications framework. I assure the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that we want high quality, well-qualified people to be in charge of young children. We do not want to exclude people who might have qualifications other than teaching certificates. I would not want to suggest that there is no place in early years education for those without teaching certificates. We shall work on such matters, and we share the hon. Gentleman's aspirations, which is why we took early action to ensure that fully qualified teachers will be involved from September 1999.
<P>
In the interests of continuity in the curriculum, we decided that the proposal will involve three to eight-year-olds so that key stage 1 teachers some of those involved will teach infants will understand what their children will do in the first year of their key stage 2 curriculum. The proposal will work the other way around in the seven to 11 group. We thought that that an understanding either of the key stage to which the children that you teach will go when they leave you, or of that from which they will come before they arrive with you, would be a proper requirement for those doing their initial teacher training.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I do not intend to go into nursery teaching.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> You would be superb, Mr. McWilliam, as you are at everything else.
<P>
I thank the Under-Secretary for those comments. One of the most valuable things that has come out of this morning's debates is the commitment to quality in early years education. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 78, line 3, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) In the course of preparing an early years development plan the authority shall consult 
<P>
(a) the governing body and head teacher of every school maintained by the authority; and
<P>
(b) such other persons as they consider appropriate".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I shall be brief [Interruption.] I do not want a cheer for that. It is an important amendment about a matter that worries many head teachers of primary schools. While they accept that head teachers and members of governing bodies will be represented in the consultation process, they feel that the views of a wider group of schools may not be considered. The allocation of places could have an impact on schools by the knock-on effect on their budgets. The amendment would ensure that the LEA consulted the governing body and head teacher of all schools affected by an early years development plan.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> We require local authorities to consult on the plan and the guidance includes a long list of people whom they must consult. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is right that they do not have to consult every maintained school. Some head teachers will be in partnerships and people in the area will be aware of that because the meetings will be open.
<P>
We cannot accept an amendment that would put into legislation a requirement to consult the maintained sector but not any other sector or health workers, parents or any of the others that we have included in the guidelines. I speculate, but I am not sure whether all secondary schools need to be directly consulted. We shall issue new guidelines in due course for the partnerships that will be drawn up for the following year. I shall certainly bear the hon. Gentleman's comments in mind and if it appears that there has been a gap in consultation, we shall certainly do all that we can to fill it, but not by writing such a provision into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I shall not pursue this matter in Committee, but I give the Minister notice that one LEA bullied two head teacher representatives on the early years forum into signing an early years development plan, which had a significant effect on school places in that LEA. It is such coercion that my amendment is trying to address.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I invite the hon. Gentleman to write to me about that example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> With the assurance that the Under-Secretary has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I rise briefly to ask two questions about the relationship between the early years development plans and other plans that we have already agreed should be provided by LEAs. First, when we agreed the education development plan, it was to cover children of compulsory school age or of any age above or below who were registered as pupils at schools maintained by the local authority. I assume, therefore, that the education development plan will set targets for maintained nursery schools. It was explained when we discussed clause 6 that education development plans were about setting targets, although my reading of the Bill suggested that they were about something else. I assume that the early years development plans must fit in and almost be a subset of the education development plans, and I should be grateful for the Minister's clarification.
<P>
My second question follows the remarks of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the relationship of the early years development plans with the school organisation plans. As I understand it, clause 25 provides for schools offering primary and secondary education and does not cover the provision of nursery education, but the early years development plan will affect maintained nursery schools and nursery provision in maintained primary schools. There should be a link between the early years development plan and the school organisation plan. I should be grateful if the Minster would comment on that and whether the Government envisage a school organisation committee having any responsibility or duties in relation to the early years development plan.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The early years development plan will not be an annexe to an education development plan. We have made it clear in recent weeks that we shall expect targets to be set at the end of key stages 2 and 4.
<P>
On the school orgainsation plans I understand I shall correct myself later if I am wrong that the school organisation committee would not consider the provision of early years places and the document in which it will be written down will be the early years development plan. We expect a separate document an early years development plan covering quality of provision for the under-fives and how provision will be made for four-year-olds and, eventually, three-year-olds. We have made clear in the guidelines more work will be needed as we find our way the plans required under the social services legislation for the care of children, and account will have to be taken of that this year.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 107 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 108</center></H4>
<H4><center>Approval, modification and review of statement of proposals</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 471, in page 78, leave out lines 28 to 38.
<P>
The amendment covers issues that were raised earlier when discussing education development plans and the role of the Secretary of State in approving, monitoring and overseeing delivery of the early years development plan. The amendment would eliminate subsection (5), which puts on the Secretary of State the obligation to monitor the implementation of each LEA's early years development plan and, if he believes that it is not being properly implemented, to take action to suspend the plan or remedy the situation.
<H4><center>[Mr. Tony McNulty in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I do not want to go over our earlier debates and we may wish to return to the matter on Report, but I would like to hear from the Minister how that responsibility can be discharged in the context of an early years development plan. As the main provision of a single stream service for the statutory school age child, that may be possible, but the cross currents in the early years requirements will be more complex. The implication of subsection (5) is that the officials in the Department for Education and Employment who will give advice, presumably to the Secretary of State, will monitor not only the delivery of the key stages within the statutory school age provision, but all the cross currents of the varied local provision which the Minister described in her response to an earlier debate. It is implausible that that level of detailed knowledge can be made available to the Secretary of State and those working for him within the Department. The purpose of the amendment is simply to identify the extraordinary ambitious role allocated to the Secretary of State in monitoring all the different provisions. It will be difficult for an LEA to do that within its own authority and impossible for a Department operating at nation level. I shall be interested to hear how the Minister thinks she will be able to deal with that.

<P>

<B>Ms Morris:</B> The Secretary of State would hope to use this provision rarely, if at all. It is included because the democratic strand of the way in which the partnerships are drawn up means that it is up to the local[Ms Morris]
education authority the council to enact the partnership. Without that power, there is nothing to prevent an LEA from changing substantially an early years development plan without the partnership's consent, after the plan has been approved. If, during the course of the year, a local authority changes a partnership at a meeting of the education committee or in the full council, the Secretary of State will want to ensure that it carries out the partnership plan.
<P>
The partnership is only advisory on the local authority. It is for the local authority, as the democratic strand and allocator of resources, to enact the partnership's provisions. The principal purpose of the clause is to enable the Secretary of State to ensure that the plan agreed by the partnership at the start of the year is followed.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not understand how the clause has that effect. It says that when the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is of the opinion that the statement should be modified... he may withdraw his approval... where he is of the opinion that the authority's statement is not being properly implemented... he may withdraw his approval".
<P></ul></font>
The power of initiative rests entirely with the Secretary of State. The clause does not give a partnership the power to amend a plan, or the Secretary of State the power to agree to its changes. Paragraphs (a) and (b) oblige the Secretary of State to monitor the performance of an LEA's development plan and, if he believes that it should be modified or that it is not being properly implemented, to take appropriate action. The obligation is placed on the Secretary of State to monitor the delivery of the plan.
<P>
We expressed concerns about the enhanced role of the Secretary of State as set out in the Bill. How will we have the knowledge to use the power? The Under-Secretary said that the Government envisage that the power will be used rarely. I welcome that, but the Government are asking us to accord that power to the Secretary of State. I explained why that carries the seeds of substantial over-concentration of power within the DFEE. Not only are we over-concentrating power, but we are giving the Secretary of State powers he will not have the knowledge to use flexibly and responsibly.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Morris:</B> Certainly within the Department, officials are reading, monitoring and evaluating plans as we receive them from local authorities. They know what each local authority is doing. That is essential for the Government to deliver on the promises that I made this morning and which we made in the House previously. We want to ensure that local authorities and partnerships act in line with the general thrust of Government policy. That is vital. I expect officials to keep contact with local authorities, especially those with weaker plans. Perhaps, in time, the standards and effectiveness unit will examine what is going on in the important early years.
<P>
It is for local authorities to enact their partnership plans, but we do not intend to let them have free rein to do whatever they want, without a provision for the Secretary of State to ensure that they carry out the plan agreed by the partnership. That provision allows me to stand here and give assurances that the general thrust of Government policy on early years will be monitored and that we will take action to ensure that it is carried out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I disagree with the Under-Secretary. She let the cat out of the bag when she said that vesting powers in the Secretary of State is the only way to assure us that promises are being kept. We return to the issue of whether responsibility rests on the LEA and local providers, or whether it follows the national health service model and rests on Ministers.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I need to put on the record that that is not the only way. If I said that it was, I was not being as clear as I would have wished. There is, of course, Ofsted, the inspection of LEAs and the plans that come to the Secretary of State for approval in the first place. It is right for the Secretary of State to have the power to act in what the Government hope would be exceptional circumstances.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not agree with the Under-Secretary. This is another example of the over-centralisation of power. The fault is not in transferring power from institutions to LEAs I have not sought to argue that LEAs do not have a role in this context but in taking power from the LEAs and vesting it in the Secretary of State. When there is a specific issue of the kind that we have discussed in previous sittings of the Committee, the effect of the subsection will be to make the Secretary of State personally accountable for delivering the balance and choice to which the Minister referred. I agreed with her earlier on the objective although I highlighted some issues that the Government have not thought through but the idea that the balance she seeks can be delivered by personal guarantee of the Secretary of State is implausible and undesirable. I therefore wish to press the amendment to a vote.

<H4><center>Inspection of nursery education</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I rise briefly to ask Ministers for guidance. The main effect of the clause is to substitute schedule 26 of the Bill for schedule 1 of the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996. Will the Under-Secretary explain what the practical implications of that substitution will be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I rise to give the Under-Secretary an opportunity to respond to the anxieties of many people about the current arrangements for nursery inspection. As the right hon. Member for Charnwood said, those arrangements will be enshrined in schedule 26.
<P>
The Committee will be well aware that registered nursery inspectors are required to report on continuity and progress in learning for 4-year-olds in nursery settings. Many people have rightly expressed concern that that important function will be carried out in a single day under the current arrangements. It will be difficult for a registerd nursery inspector to make a full judgment on continuity and progression in one day. The Committee should bear in mind that whereas a section 10 inspection is carried out by a team of inspectors, the nursery setting inspection is to be carried out by a single inspector, who must attempt to cover the broad range of activities in each nursery setting in a single day. Without a team of inspectors, there is no opportunity for the interchange of ideas and the testing of possible disagreements about what has been observed.
<P>
A further problem, on which the Under-Secretary should comment, is the speed with which inspectors are required to report back on their findings. Unlike for section 10 inspections, no time is allowed for reflection. Under the current arrangement, inspectors are required at the end of day of the inspection immediately to comment on all the issues to which they are likely to refer in their subsequent written report. Registered nursery inspectors need more time to reflect on those issues.
<P>
I am anxious about current procedures because in order that inspection can be carried out at the required speed, the registered inspector is required merely to make a comment or often merely to place a tick in a single box to cover the four separate aspects of provision that take place in the early years setting. Those four separate aspects provide for the children's spiritual, moral, social and cultural development; all four may be covered by a single tick in one box. There is growing evidence that although overall provision may be reasonable, masked within it could be weaknesses in, for example, cultural development.
<P>
The speed with which the operation is to be undertaken also creates problems for special educational needs. In her response to the right hon. Member for Charnwood, the Under-Secretary said that it was vital that the early years settings be involved in the early identification of special educational needs. However, under the current inspection arrangement, it is difficult to check whether that is taking place. The inspector is required to examine the setting's understanding of the code of practice for special educational needs, but can choose not to cover that aspect if the inspector believes that the code of practice is not relevant to that setting. I cannot imagine any contingency in which there is no requirement for the setting to have a clear understanding of the requirements of the code of practice for special educational needs. That issue should be investigated.
<P>
I have expressed anxiety that a single inspector carries out the inspection in a single day, that inspectors must make their initial report instantly and that they often merely tick boxes to demonstrate their satisfaction on a wide range of issues covered by a single box. However, there is a further problem. Growing evidence suggests that the price available to contractors to carry out inspections is being reduced to such a point that it is increasingly difficult for contractors to provide inspectors with a wide range of experience, skills and knowledge in the setting. There is therefore a real danger that inspections of early years settings will not be provided at the level that we expect and that the settings deserve.
<P>
Clause 109 gives effect to schedule 26. Paragraph 8 of schedule 26, which deals with the rights of entry of various people into the settings, allows the right of entry for a registered nursery inspector or for Her Majesty's inspectorate conducting an inspection. It also enables the right of entry of Her Majesty's inspectorate monitoring an inspection.
<P>
However, as part of their own procedures for quality assurance, individual contractors of nursery education inspection are required to monitor at least 10 per cent. of the inspections that they carry out. To do that, they will require a registered nursery inspector, who will monitor on their behalf, to enter the premises to assess their inspection. That provision appears to have been omitted from paragraph 8 of schedule 26. How will the Under-Secretary guarantee the right of access to those inspectors to carry out the assessment?

<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Our debate has drifted on to schedule 26 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I realised that while the hon. Member for Bath was speaking. I am being a bit flexible, because that is the best way to proceed in this case.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> With your permission, Mr. McWilliam, I shall discuss some of those matters now and not when we come to schedule 26.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath will be aware that it is crucial to get this matter right. Many of the relevant provisions involve Ofsted, which is obliged to review how it carries out its inspection duties, and it does so from time to time. I listened carefully to his comments, and I take his point about day inspections. I have heard anecdotal evidence suggesting that people do not feel that that leaves sufficient time for inspectors fully to appreciate early years provision, especially in view of the added requirements relating to children with special educational needs. We will raise that matter in the consultation document about future inspections of child[Ms Morris]
care and early years providers. When that consultation document is published, we shall have an opportunity to debate many of the hon. Gentleman's points and to establish the way forward. I hope that he will forgive me if, for the moment, I simply listen to his argument. I have made notes of some of his concerns, and I assure him that we shall return to that matter in the future it is an important part of our thinking.
<P>
Section 1 of the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained School Act 1996 established a framework to cover the way in which grants were paid the Bill replicates many of its provisions and ensured that grant is specific to a provider. From next year, we shall pay the money to early years providers not as direct grant but as part of the under-fives SSA. We had to establish separate inspection arrangements in schedule 26 because those in section 1 were too tied in to the way that money was paid.
<P>
Certain alterations are involved here my comments overlap with the provisions of schedule 26 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It might be for the Committee's convenience if I explain the situation. The fact that the clause will enact a schedule means it is impossible to draw a line between it and the schedule. I am therefore being a lot less grumpy than usual about Committee members speaking about matters that are not in the clause.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am grateful to you for your tolerance. Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Schedule 26 will allow inspection of early years providers before the grant is made, which again relates to the way that it will be funded. Under the old system, which is contained in section 1 of the 1996 Act, grant was not always paid it could be held back. That will not be possible under the new funding system because the money will already have been given. We also want to encourage early inspection.
<P>
Our proposals will give the inspector the right of access to nursery provision, and they will give the chief inspector the right to exclude categories of inspectors. An example I know that the right hon. Member for Charnwood always asks for examples might involve an inspector who was the head of a nursery school that had been deemed to be failing. She might be perfectly competent in her own right, but it might not be appropriate for her to be an inspector elsewhere while she was heading a nursery school that had been deemed to be failing or suffering from serious weaknesses.
<P>
Additional requirements are involved, including the ability to replace the leader of an inspection team if the original registered inspector is unable to complete the inspection, perhaps because of a family bereavement or illness. Our proposals double up on the right of access in section 1. At present, the chief inspector can remove an inspector from the roll only in exceptional circumstances. We have strengthened that provision so that the chief inspector has the right to remove an inspector from the roll in other than exceptional circumstances, but other safeguards will be in place.
<P>
The clause and schedule 26 will re-enact the inspection provisions in Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996. That was the first time that the system had operated under the new financial arrangements. Our proposed amendments to schedule 26 make certain other changes, most of which I hope I have identified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Before the Under-Secretary sits down, will she address my question about right of entry under paragraph 8?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Having taken the time to move amendments that give a right of entry to match that in schools, we would not wish that anyone who should have a right of entry did not have one. May I check the matter with my officials and drop the hon. Gentleman a line to let him know whether his specific point is covered.

</UL></FONT>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The code of practice will reflect the outcome of the Government's consultation on special education needs. In a written answer to me, the Minister said that the conclusions of the consultation are not likely to be made public until the early summer. When the consultation was launched, early intervention was flagged up as very important. We agree that it is so for the age group that we are talking about.
<P>
A mechanism of early intervention should be available and enforced at nursery level. The various agencies that will have contact with children specifically, children who have a disability and those who have emotional disturbances that may not become apparent until later should exchange information with educational bodies. Increasingly, one finds concern among infant and primary teachers that, having accepted a child into full-time education, they find that a history is on record relating to that child whether from the medical or social service which, if it had been made available, would have made the child's first few years or months at school easier.
<P>
LEA intervention is needed at that point. The Bill refers to a code of practice, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will make proper amendments to the code if she feels that it needs to be strengthened on the basis of her consultation document.

<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Yes, we will do that. The hon. Lady will know that, as well as examining the issue of early intervention in the Green Paper on SEN, we are considering the code of practice. We have made no decisions yet, but if amendments are needed they will be introduced in due course.
<P>
This is an incredibly difficult area, and these are important children whose needs must be addressed at this particular age. I entirely agree with the hon. Lady's definition of early intervention; indeed, for some children intervention should start before the age of three. We must do everything possible to progress in this area.
<P>
Clause 110 ensures that providers must have regard to SEN if they are part of the early years development partnership. Previously, providers had to have such regard only if they received funding under the nursery grants legislation. We have introduced this clause because of a change in the way in which LEAs are funded. I share the hon. Lady's commitment, and I hope that the early years partnerships will be a forum for the exchange of ideas between the different professionals with an interest in special needs children and their parents.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain):</B> The clause, which is linked to schedule 27 and clause 113, provides for a number of amendments to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Those amendments will enable Welsh further education institutions to provide full-time and part-time education for 16 to 18-year-olds at schools maintained by Welsh LEAs under a partnership arrangement. The clause also extends the powers of the Further Education Funding Council for Wales to provide financial support to Welsh LEAs for the purposes of any partnership arrangement.
<P>
These changes are an important part of the Government's overall strategy in Wales to promote co-operative ventures between the 29 further education colleges and the 164 secondary schools with pupils aged from 11 to 18 years. They flow from Cm. 3708 the Government's response to the second report of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, which sat during the 1996-97 Session, and which accepted the Committee's recommendation that action should be taken to allow the Further Education Funding Council for Wales to fund collaborative arangements between colleges and schools.
[Mr. Peter Hain]
<P>
The clauses also build on the new arrangements piloted in a scheme funded by the Welsh Office between College Glan Hafren, Cardiff LEA and a number of its secondary schools. Incidentally, when I inquired into how that pilot scheme, which has operated since September 1996, was legislatively possible, I was told "Minister, you don't want to know", which was a novel reversal of the theme of "Yes, Minister". As that scheme was introduced under the Conservative Government, I am sure that it was absolutely okay.
<P>
This is good news for the young people of Wales. They will have a much greater choice of qualifications for which they can study at secondary schools or elsewhere in the community. Subjects such as leisure and tourism studies, catering and engineering could, in future, be studied at school. It is also good news for Wales as it will enable the delivery of a comprehensive further education curriculum in our secondary schools.
<P>
The Wales-only clauses in the Bill will enable Welsh further education colleges to provide full-time and part-time further education in local authority schools and will allow the Further Education Funding Council for Wales to provide financial support to LEAs. This pioneering scheme will remove legislative barriers to real partnerships and effective co-operation between our secondary schools and further education colleges. It will also this is an especially important argument for these clauses help to stem the 10 to 15 per cent. or so of pupils who drop out at 16 and vanish from the system. They will be encouraged to stay on in their school setting to take further education courses. The much broader curriculum will enable them to consider in principle hundreds of options that the school could not otherwise offer.
<P>
Partnerships will enable and encourage LEAs, colleges and schools to plan and deliver school-based further education opportunities, increase choice for 16 to 18-year-olds and make efficiency savings. I stress the importance of that because there is much duplication of provision in the education of 16 to 19-year-olds. There is scope for efficiency savings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister said that the purpose of the partnership arrangements, which sound interesting and which I support in general, is to allow the provision of further education courses within the school context. Is that to be confined to 16 to 19-year-olds, or will the school and further education college partnership offer further education colleges to a broader section of the school community than has been the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> That is an interesting point. I should like partnerships to develop. The intention is to enable further education courses to be provided within schools. That is the purpose of the partnership. Incidentally, it could be viewed the other way around. Suppose a school sixth-form pupil wanted to do an A-level in a subject that was not provided by the school for example, computer science or music. He or she could go to the college to do it but remain on the school roll. As for adult provision, although the clauses are not specifically directed at that, it could be explored, if convenient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to post-16 funding. In "The Learning Age", his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred several times to rationalisation of post-16 funding. In terms of implementing the clauses, will there be an equalisation of funding for similar courses post-16 in either a school setting or a further education setting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> That, too, is an interesting question, and we shall bear it in mind. The hon. Gentleman is aware that there are differences in the levels of funding for 16 to 19-year-olds in schools, further education colleges and elsewhere in the vocational training regime. I have asked the education and training action group, which I established and chair in Wales, to consider the practicalities of that. We would not want schools to feel that partnership arrangements threaten their funding. Partnerships are to be voluntarily entered into by schools. A wider agenda needs to be addressed to make efficient provision for 16 to 19-year-olds and to release and redistribute resources to ensure that the maximum choice is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Let me press the Minister a little further. How will the funding streams operate if a further education college chooses to seek the agreement of a school to operate a particular further education course in it? How will an A-level course in a school, which was originally run in a further education college, be funded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> The Bill provides for funding arrangements to be agreed on the basis of partnership. In the circumstances described by the hon. Gentleman, I would expect the college, with the consent of the funding council, to make provision for that. There may be associated costs, which would have to be agreed. The individual student would be an FE student studying in a school context, not a school pupil. A sixth-form pupil taking a couple of A-levels might add to the curriculum choice by doing an FE-provided vocational course or a different A-level, and in that context would be an FE student. That would have to be agreed under the regulations covering schools and FE colleges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> There is an important issue here. The hon. Gentleman accepted that there would be rationalisation of funding and a redistribution of resources for post-16 education. That suggests a levelling down to the lowest common denominator. Does he agree that that is a back door method of ending sixth forms in schools, especially in Wales which has many schools with small sixth forms?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> Not at all. This is not a back-door method of reducing sixth forms in schools and it could be argued that it may prolong their life. Between 10 and 15 per cent. of 16-year-olds, often from deprived backgrounds, simply vanish from the system and are lost to the educational world. That is a severe problem in creating a highly skilled, high quality society and economy. The FE college choice may persuade them to remain in a school setting.
<P>
The provision is not a back-door or front-door method of levelling down the funding. On the contrary, it could prolong the sixth form provision in many schools because it will offer more choice. The Government are committed not just to higher school standards, but to better choice. That will be good for schools, pupils, colleges and the wider community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Blizzard </B>(Waveney): In support of the proposal for Wales, I draw my hon. Friend's attention to a proposal in Lowestoft, in my constituency, where for many years three high schools have co-operated in a sixth-form consortium. They announced formally this week that the FE college will join that consortium. The FE college and the schools have made that arrangement voluntarily because they believe it will strengthen provision, widen choice, increase staying-on rates and raise the level of skills of youngsters in that age category.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point extremely well and emphasises that the provision will extend and improve choice. Its purpose is not levelling down. The model that we are providing for Wales may be considered elsewhere in due course.
<P>
Jointly planned, locally based learning opportunities will increase choice and widen participation in further education, particularly for youngsters in areas of social and economic deprivation. Partnerships will improve the relationship between LEAs, schools and colleges and help to avoid unnecessary duplication of courses and resources needed to deliver high quality, relevant education. I stress that the arrangements are voluntary; no one if forcing anyone to do anything. The school will make arrangements with its local FE college if it chooses to do so. If it decides that that is not appropriate, it can progress as at present. This innovative opportunity will greatly benefit educational provision in Wales.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have listened with care to the Welsh Under-Secretary. He has opened a series of interesting doors in response to questions from me and the Liberal Democrat spokesman. With respect, I am not sure that he has thought of exactly where those doors will lead. He said, disarmingly, that all this was about voluntary co-operation between schools and further education colleges and that it seeks to enlarge choice and present a greater range of options to individual families and, in particular, to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
<P>
That sounds very enticing, but, in response to a question from the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, the Under-Secretary said that there would be questions about how resources could be better used and the fair distribution of resources between sixth forms and FE colleges. He immediately denied that that would mean a rationalisation of course provision, but it seems to me that those sorts of institutions will be subject to that pressure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that there would be voluntary arrangements between FE colleges and schools. I suspect that he would say that where the Further Education Funding Council is involved, LEAs will have no direct locus in those discussions. Frankly, he seems to live in a different world from mine if he can imagine that an LEA, given constraints on resources, will not consider the options that may exist for a particular school in a co-operation arrangement between a school and an FE college.
<P>
The Welsh Under-Secretary is opening the door to constructive partnership a word to which he is much attached of the kind endorsed by the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard). It all sounds friendly and positive, but I am not sure that he has thought through the traps or of where his policy will lead when real choices have to be made against the inevitability of scarce resources. I look forward to seeing the policy's practical implications being worked through in the hard world in which it will be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> I realise that the right hon. Gentleman finds it difficult to look a Labour Government's gift horse in the mouth without looking 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Past the front teeth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has been extremely well behaved in responding to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman has not been well behaved. He has been heckling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has been extremely constructive and has almost entered into partnership.
<P>
In my frank and open response to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough the kind of response that Labour Ministers always give I said that I see the opportunity to avoid duplication of resources in cases where a college runs a course that has fewer students than is desirable. The opportunity of taking that on in a school setting providing for pupils to become students who would not otherwise do so, but would drop out provides greater funding opportunities for the college involved. That will result in a more effective use of resources. I cannot see all the dark problems alluded to by the right hon. Member for Charnwood; I see choice and opportunity opening up for everyone concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> No member of the Committee would deny the exciting possibilities of an opening up of education. However, the right hon. Member for Charnwood is right to point to a range of problems that need to be overcome. Let me test the Under-Secretary on one problem. If sixth-form provision is made in a further education college while the child remains registered with a school, will Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools have the opportunity to inspect the work of the college? Have the Government taken that into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> In the hon. Gentleman's example, it depends on the course. If a student studying for several A-levels wants to study tourism, or engineering, for example a vocational subject that the college provides that would come under the college's regime. The A-levels studied in the school context would be covered by normal school inspection.
<P>
The arrangements will be voluntary, conducted on the basis of partnership and worked out with the local education authority and with the school and college[Mr. Hain]
involved. We have considered the matter extremely carefully, as the hon. Gentleman can see from the schedule and clauses. I do not envisage any problems. The scheme that has been piloted in Cardiff has worked to everyone's benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I would not want the hon. Gentleman to think that I am criticising the exciting proposals, but it is important that the Committee receives information about the detailed thinking that he says has taken place.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has said that if a pupil does one of his or her A-level courses in a further education college, that would fall under the funding council's regime. Therefore, presumably, that course would be inspected by the funding council's inspection arrangements. However, that pupil is the school's responsibility. Under schedule 26, it is the duty of Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools to ensure that all provision made by the school and for which the school has responsibility is up to appropriate quality standards. Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools will therefore have a responsibility to ensure that provision in the further education college is at an appropriate level. Will the hon. Gentleman explain how Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools would be able to do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> I hope that I respond charitably to the hon. Gentleman's question. He has been extremely sympathetic, as indeed has the right hon. Member for Charnwood, for which I am grateful. We are not discussing England in this context, for which Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools inspection arrangements apply. In Wales, the Office of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector inspects further education colleges and schools, so that problem does not arise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, I remind hon. Members that the questions are being taken together, as is sensible. We are therefore dealing with clause 112, clause 113 and schedule 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> My final point I think is that we are attempting to introduce a co-operative relationship between different education institutions to establish a co-operative, partnership-based approach to education. Under the previous Government, the model of education was based on competition, which was often extremely destructive, wasteful of resources and created much duplication. Clauses 112 and 113 and schedule 27 will overcome that and allow us to move forward.
