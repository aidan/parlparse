some of which we can say and some of which we cannot, we have missed

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Today’s
debates focus on clauses that go to the heart of the Bill and of
Government’s claim that they have made substantial and
substantive changes to their plans. Chapter 2 of part 3 contains 12
clauses that explicitly introduce competition law into primary
legislation on the NHS for the first time. The clauses give Monitor
sweeping powers to conduct investigations into NHS services; to impose
penalties and fines on NHS services; to disqualify senior NHS staff in
hospitals and other services; and to require national and local
commissioners to put services out to competitive tender. The clauses
also give the Competition Commission powers to promote competition in
all parts of the NHS and to impose penalties on NHS
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Not
a single Government amendment has been tabled to the clauses. Let me
repeat that: not a single Government amendment has been tabled to the
clauses. I believe, and  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 398<a class="bkMark" name="Column398">&#160;</a>
                  </div>I hope that I will go on to show, that the failure to make any changes,
despite what the Government claimed in their response to the Future
Forum, still gives Monitor sweeping powers to promote competition in
all parts of NHS, whether or not it leads to benefits for patients,
without proper accountability or scrutiny. Lest the Committee fears
that I intend to make a long speech on all the clauses, I assure them
that I will direct the main thrust of my argument toward clause
64.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause gives Monitor concurrent functions with the Office of Fair
Trading under part 1 of the Competition Act. It is important to spell
out to the Committee what those powers are, so that we are clear about
what the Bill introduces. Chapter 1 of part 1 of the 1998 Act prohibits
undertakings—I will say what they are in a minute—from
reaching certain agreements that prevent, restrict or distort
competition; that includes not only fixing prices, but sharing markets.
Chapter 2 prohibits undertakings from abusing a dominant position in
the market. Undertakings are defined in EU law as entities engaged in
economic activity. That is important, because chapters 1 and 2 of part
1 of the 1998 Act are modelled on articles 101 and 102 of the treaty on
the functioning of the European
Union.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
us be clear about what it means to give Monitor the same powers as the
OFT. First, Monitor may investigate when it has reasonable grounds for
suspecting a breach in any of the prohibited areas that I outlined
relating to health services in England. Monitor will also have
powers to impose remedies or penalties for breaches, including the
power to fine undertakings that are found to have broken the law up to
10% of their turnover. Monitor will have the power to fine anything
that is considered an undertaking—an NHS service
provider—up to 10% of its turnover. In addition, third parties,
including competitors, can bring damages claims against such
undertakings, so an undertaking may face not only a 10% fine, but
damages, too. Individuals found to be involved in cartels may be fined
and imprisoned for up to five years, and directors of organisations
found to have breached any of those prohibitions may be disqualified
for up to 15
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000027">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Has my hon. Friend
considered the possible impact on the third sector? Large multinational
companies might feel that such risks are worth taking, but the risks
could frighten the voluntary sector away from engaging in the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000028">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes an extremely important
point. I was going to come to voluntary sector organisations in a
minute, but I shall address them up front, for the record. My noble
Friend Lord Beecham asked in a written question whether voluntary
organisations and social enterprises will be considered undertakings
under the Bill, and the answer was yes. Monitor will have the power to
fine not only large private sector companies and NHS hospitals, but
small voluntary sector organisations, too. When the Government champion
the role of the voluntary sector in the NHS, as they should, perhaps
they will make it clear that, under their Bill, the voluntary sector
will face such penalties and fines,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000029">&#160;</a>

for their finances. As I have made that point on the record, service

                  </strong> Yes, I do share those concerns. There is nothing
in the Bill that would prevent service providers from doing precisely
that, or prevent private organisations with the same set-up as Southern
Cross from providing services in the NHS, thereby raising in the NHS
the serious problems that we face with Southern Cross. It is critical
that the Government realise that, by opening up the full range of NHS
services to private providers without having the regulatory regime
necessary to prevent the private equity and leaseholding
deals of Southern Cross, they may be creating the possibility of the
Southern Cross problems being repeated in the NHS. The Minister of
State, the right hon. Member for Chelmsford, who alas will not respond
to this debate, gives me one of his trademark quizzical looks. I hope
that his fellow Minister will specify which of the Bill’s
provisions will prevent that from happening. We have to take that issue

whether he has a good basis for doing so in a moment. As for sharing a
market, if a hospital does a deal with pharmacies, local GP services
and district health nurses to provide a whole pathway of care in
diabetes, could Monitor consider that to be sharing a market and
preventing other competitors from coming in? Again, the Minister shakes
his head. I think hon.

               <p class="tabbed">I am not
arguing, as Ministers have claimed the Opposition have, that the Bill
extends the scope of competition law. My argument is that the Bill
extends the applicability of competition law to the NHS. It is not just
the clauses we are discussing today that will make that happen; so will
other clauses, such as those that abolish the private patient cap on
foundation trusts, and aspects of the Government’s policy,
particularly requiring commissioners to consider any qualified
provider for all services, no matter how quickly or slowly
this is applied. All those things will guarantee that the NHS will be
considered and treated as a full market, and that the providers of NHS
services will for the first time be treated as undertakings for the
purposes of competition law.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is the
crucial point. In the past, hospital providers have not been considered
to be or treated as economic undertakings. When cases have been taken
in other European countries, hospital providers have not been
considered economic undertakings because of their social purpose and
objectives. Their aim is to produce a social good: improving health. My
concern is that the Bill will, through the competition clauses, the
removal of the private patient cap and the policy of any qualified
provider, guarantee that they will be treated as economic undertakings
for the first time.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000038">&#160;</a>

to its website—produced a briefing for primary care trusts and
GP commissioners. It states

up a new regulatory body, Monitor, to protect the NHS from their own

not taken legal advice, why not? This is
incredibly important. It does not take a genius to figure out that
putting 12 clauses on competition law in a Bill, removing
the private patient cap and having a policy of any qualified provider
could fundamentally change whether providers and commissioners of
services are considered to be undertakings. The right hon. Gentleman
should have taken legal advice. Has he done so? Yes or no?<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000049">&#160;</a>

the challenges that the NHS will face in the years ahead—in
fact, it is likely to make meeting those challenges harder. I hope hon.
Members will forgive me, even though I have made this point many times
before, but two key things need to be done to improve the quality and
efficiency of health and health care. First, we need to move some
services into specialist centres to improve quality and outcomes,
because consultants and other staff there would have greater
experience, technical skill and expertise, which would help save more
lives, and help more patients survive and lead lives that are free 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 402<a class="bkMark" name="Column402">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from disability or illness. Secondly, we need to shift many other
services out of hospitals into the community and more towards
prevention and, crucially, ensure that these services are more joined
up with social care. Those are the two key things we need to do if we
are to improve care for people with long-term and chronic conditions
and take advantage of the technological developments and advances that
can make a phenomenal difference to patient
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000050">&#160;</a>

have achieved many of their aims without the Bill. They could have
cut<em> </em>the number and size of primary care trusts, put the
clinicians in control and reduced the size of strategic health
authorities. They could have brought in the voluntary and private
sector where the evidence showed that it was succeeding. Instead, they
have thrown the service up in the air, distracted it and wasted time
and resources. In the best-case scenario, competition will be driven

specialising services into some centres and shifting other services out
of hospitals and into the community have major implications for the
future of hospital services, particularly district general hospitals.
That will have real consequences that have to be properly managed.
Simply to leave these huge changes to a full market system without the
ability to manage them is a huge mistake. The Government have
completely failed to explain how this part of the Bill will help us to

               <p class="tabbed">I
have used the example of stroke care before and I will do it again,
because the example of how the NHS has changed stroke services in
London is compelling. NHS London went through a controversial
reorganisation of stroke care in the capital to establish eight
hyperacute stroke units. Within just five months, those specialist
centres more than tripled the number of patients receiving clot-busting
drugs to the highest rate of any large city in the world. It is
estimated that this will save 400 lives a year, as well as
significantly reduce disabilities. The NHS did not need to use
competition law to achieve those goals. Indeed, competition law might
have prevented those changes from happening as it might have led to the
accusation that the hospitals were sharing markets for stroke
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000057">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It may not
suit the Government’s view of the world, but the achievements in
London show major service changes can be achieved through effective
planning at the strategic level, yet the Bill will remove strategic
health authorities—the very organisations that have the capacity
and have shown in practice that they can make such changes happen. The
Government insist instead that smaller clinical commissioning groups
led by GPs will take on the role, but hon. Members will remember
evidence given to the original Bill Committee from the Health
Foundation that the previous experience of involving GPs in
commissioning showed that they had not managed to secure fundamental
changes to hospital services. Yes, GPs have managed to improve
community services, because they know and understand community services
better, but in the current financial climate we cannot afford to double
fund hospitals and community services to do the same things at the same
time. Difficult decisions must be made.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000058">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government now say that clinical senates will help clinical
commissioning groups to make decisions about major service
reconfigurations, but we do not yet know how strategic clinical senates
will be or whether they will cover a sufficiently wide geographical
area to make the large-scale changes necessary. Most important, they do
not yet exist. Changes to stroke services and improvements to areas of
care such as trauma services that are urgently needed to improve
outcomes for patients could be happening now. As I have said, the
experience in London suggests that 400 lives each year have been saved
by the changes they made. Those are lives that could and should be
saved now.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government seem to have totally forgotten that Ara Darzi led a major
review of NHS services, which led to clinicians in every region working
together to develop a range of pathways that would improve the outcomes
and quality of care. In my region primary care specialists and
secondary clinicians have been working together to develop a pathway of
care. That has been put on hold. The Government need to understand that
all that work, which could save lives and improve care, has been put on
hold.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I refer to
the review to make the point that the clauses, which are at the heart
of the Bill, will not help us to achieve any of the changes that are
needed. It astonishes me that instead of getting on and making the
changes, the Government are putting through all these clauses. Worse
still, the Bill creates a plethora of new organisations, which will
result in a confused system of responsibility and accountability. It
also demonstrates a determination to use competition law as a tool for

will end my comments with a wider and possibly more philosophical point
that is absolutely relevant to clause 64 and its explicit introduction
of competition law into primary legislation on the NHS for the first
time. I have always believed that we need to give patients more
information, more choice and more say over their treatment and care.
When people can make choices in all other aspects of their lives, the
NHS, like every public service, must respond if it is to retain public
support and taxpayers’ money in the long term. Health care is
not simply another commodity, however, and patients are not consumers
alone. As individuals, patients have a vital role in creating good
health and in preventing 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 404<a class="bkMark" name="Column404">&#160;</a>
                  </div>disease by what they eat, by how much exercise they take and by their
sense of mental health and well-being. As Members of Parliament, we are
also crucial in determining the future shape of services and how they
will be funded. We make the difficult decisions that are necessary to
determine how resources should be fairly
distributed.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Alongside
policies that seek to improve choice and give patients a greater say,
we must also address the other side of the equation, namely the
responsibilities and duties that patients should be expected to have in
return as individuals and as members of wider society. A political
choice must be made about the sort of relationship that needs to
develop between patients and health services. That relationship can be
based on the consumerist model, where the rights of the individual are
all-powerful, over and above those of the local community or society as
a whole, or on the citizenship model, where patients have a clear right
to choose but also have reciprocal
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000063">&#160;</a>

Government have chosen the consumerist model, as the Prime Minister
aptly demonstrated yesterday in his speech announcing the public

                  </span> I will echo some of the
sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West.
This is one of the most fundamentally important clauses of the Bill and
it is important that we consider its implications very carefully as a
Committee. The briefing note provided by the House of Commons library
indicated that the
clause<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000069">&#160;</a>

my hon. Friend indicated, this is in relation to chapter 1, part 1 of
the Act,
which<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000070">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p>It also relates to
chapter 2,
which<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“prohibits
undertakings from abusing a dominant position in a market. There are
similar provisions under EU
law”.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000435">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
NHS Future Forum report told us that competition should be used to
secure greater choice and better value for patients. It should be used
not as an end in itself but to improve quality, promote integration and
increase citizens’ rights. Ministers have tried to sell the idea
that, by reforming the role of Monitor, they have dealt with the issue
of competition for competition’s sake. I contend that that is a
false premise. I understand that Monitor will continue to identify
market distortions, and now anti-competitive practices, with the
Competition Commission taking appropriate corrective action.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When these
clauses were first raised in the Committee, the Opposition asked why
they were needed to introduce competition law if the Bill is simply an
extension of the previous Government’s reforms over the last 13
years. There can be only one answer: because the Bill does a lot more
than that. Since then, the listening exercise found agreement with the
Opposition that Ministers had gone too far, promoting competition above
patient’s needs. It is another example of the emperor’s
clothes, and therefore begs the question why, while Ministers have
amended the clauses on Monitor, there have been no amendments to the
whole section on competition. The truth is that competition is still
being introduced and is being applied to a much greater extent within
the NHS. The application of competition law is being implemented in
primary legislation, and it is clearly not maintaining the current
framework, otherwise it would not have been in the Bill. Is it not
possible that we will now be in an even less desirable position in so
far as competition is being introduced just as it appeared in the
original and, some would argue, discredited version of the Bill, and
yet the regulator is being
weakened?<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister will answer this question. While
Monitor’s duty to promote competition has been turned on its
head, or so we have been told, in so far as it must now prevent
anti-competitiveness, what change has there been to the extent that
competition is being introduced by the Bill? Monitor’s functions
are far less important than the fact that competition, and EU
competition law, will now be applied to the NHS. Since it was
established 63 years ago, it has not been necessary to introduce
competition law to reshape the NHS. My principle concern is that, by
changing the structure and architecture of the NHS and by exposing it
to EU competition law at the same time, we risk rushing ahead while not
knowing the true consequences. I want to explore that point, which we
have discussed before, because it is relevant to clause
64.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
evidence to the Select Committee on Health, of which I am a member, on
5 July, the Secretary of State said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“if
you are trying to establish with certainty the boundary of that
application of competition law… It is a matter essentially of
debate and will be something that would, other things being equal, only
be determined over time as cases were brought before the
courts.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000436">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is a stunning admission, coming after the listening exercise and after
everything that has been said about the role of competition in the NHS.
We still will not know how the Bill will affect services or how
competition 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 406<a class="bkMark" name="Column406">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will be interpreted by the courts. That statement is the closest thing
to an admission by the Secretary of State that competition law will
take precedence over clinical commissioning, despite assurances to the
contrary from Ministers in this Committee. The truth is that Ministers
cannot tell us what the impact of the clause or, indeed, the rest of
the Bill will be, but as the Secretary of State indicated when he
effectively let the cat out of the bag, it will result in court
challenges and a constant threat of litigation hanging over the NHS
like the sword of Damocles. In effect, we are creating a legal
minefield. Following the Government’s response to the Future
Forum, Dr David Bennett said in an interview with the <em>Health Service
Journal</em>:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
policy statement makes clear Monitor will still be given enforcement
powers concurrent with the Office of Fair Trading and the Commissioning
Board will have to consult with Monitor on its competition
guidance.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000437">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is directly relevant to clause
64.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000077">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, told Radio 4
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000078">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>Opposition
Members would like the Minister to explain exactly what he meant by
that statement. The Bill clearly extends the application of competition
law. By extending it to the NHS, the NHS is effectively being turned
into a market, in which competition law is being added to primary
legislation for the first time. That is an important and fundamental
point. By doing that, there is a clear intention for it to be applied
with greater frequency and power. UK and EU competition laws will
increasingly become applicable, and the Minister has confirmed to the
Committee in the past that the majority of providers are likely to be
classed as undertakings for the purposes of EU competition law, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West also indicated a few moments
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are further questions about whether commissioning groups will find
themselves covered by competition laws. In addition to the Competition
Act, we have been told that there will be sector-specific regimes. By
saying that the principles and rules for co-operation and competition,
as conducted by the Co-operation and Competition Panel, will continue,
the Secretary of State has sought to sell his reforms as evolution,
rather than revolution. We need clarification on that point. On
14 June, the Secretary of State made a statement to the
House that I suspect was clouded by the fog of
war:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               <p>That is

2010 rules, which include the “preferred provider”
stipulation, are to be kept? From statements in the press and comments
in Committee, my understanding is that it is the June 2011 rules, which
include “any willing provider”, that will be placed on a
statutory footing. I am sure that the Secretary of State would not
mislead the Committee or the House, so I invite the Minister to clarify
whether the new term “any qualified provider” will be
placed on a statutory
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000081">&#160;</a>

duty to consult that the Bill places on the NHS might constrain such
improvements. At the same time, the NHS needs to devolve into

strategies, and for the way in which they drive commissioning plans at
a local level. At the heart of the debate is the Opposition’s
fundamental misunderstanding that we want competition to design and
deliver services. That is actually the role of commissioning, and we
will come back to that later. We have already debated commissioning,
but that fundamental misunderstanding is at the heart of the

were expressed by Ministers, on the record, in <em>Hansard</em>, in the
last Parliament. Indeed, they are the words of the right hon. Member
for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw), who spoke about the establishment of the
competition panel, which we have heard so much about, not least because
my hon. Friend the Member for Southport drew it to our attention in the

come back to the incredible journey that the official Opposition are
on—from being a party that was proselytising about the benefits
of competition only a year or so ago. As part of that journey, in 2008,
when in government, they significantly extended the choice offer around
elective surgery. In their manifesto, just a little over 12 months ago,
they talked about having a system where people could choose any willing
provider who was prepared to operate at NHS prices and NHS standards
when it came to elective care. What is that, if not a policy of any
qualified

weight of competition to bear—obviously, the primary legislation
set out in the Bill—is also changing the architecture of the

law.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000109">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Let me start
with the points raised by the hon. Member for Leicester West and by her
hon. Friends in interventions. I was asked whether providers will need
to set up contingency funds in case they get fined; that was another of
those scares that some Committee members seem to want to
erect in this debate. Fines could be levied only for breaches of the
law. Setting up a contingency fund rather suggests that the Opposition
would condone organisations infringing the law. It is nonsense to
suggest that such a thing would happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Office of
Fair Trading, which currently applies competition law in most sectors,
has used large fines only for particularly harmful behaviour such as
deliberately fixing prices. As we will come on to
later, the whole issue of prices and transparency around
that is a completely separate matter that is dealt with through the NHS
commissioning board, Monitor and the arrangements that the Bill, if it
becomes an Act, provides for.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It was then
suggested that the sanctions would be too harsh, especially on the
voluntary sector. Again, the answer is no. Monitor has a range of
sanctions available to it, including accepting undertakings. Later we
will come to a clause that specifically stipulates that it can do that.
The sanctions would be applied proportionately to the offence and the
size of the organisation, in accordance with statutory guidance.
Monitor would issue clear guidance to help avoid inadvertent
breaches.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was also
asked whether the Bill extends the applicability of competition law and
whether it in some way guarantees that providers will become
undertakings; that was at the heart of the question from the hon.
Member for Easington. In a way, the hon. Gentleman asked the question
because he knows the answer; he has heard it before on a number of
occasions. Once this place legislates, it is for the courts to
determine whether a body is an undertaking. That is the case now; it
was the case before and it will be the case after the Bill is enacted.
The Government are simply acting in the environment and legal framework
that was established by the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Competition Act
1998—legislation passed by the previous Labour
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000114">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is the heart of the question that we have been
debating, about whether competition will see the NHS being broken up.
The Minister says that it will be for the courts to decide. Our point,
however, is that the context in which the courts will decide will be
different once the Bill applies, because there will be more entrants in
the marketplace; the nature of what those entrants provide will have
changed as a result of lifting the private patient cap and allowing
providers to be more commercial. It therefore becomes more likely that
the courts will deem them undertakings and that competition law will
apply. That is our point, and it is an argument that the Minister
refuses to accept.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000115">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I simply and respectfully say that the journey
that the hon. Gentleman seems to suggest began in May last year in fact
began many years before. It was part of a journey initiated by Labour
in government, and there is nothing that the hon. Gentleman can do to
run away from that now. The record is clear. His Government started the
process of enabling competition to play a part in the NHS—he may
not like that, but <em>Hansard </em>is clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000116">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> As we have said repeatedly, the fundamental
differences are that, first, competition did not have a statutory
basis, and secondly, at the end of 13 years of Labour Governments,
fewer than 5% of NHS services were provided through the private
sector—meaning that courts would have made a judgment in the
context of there essentially still being a monopoly state provider.
Therefore, undertakings would not have been the description attached to
providers. Under the Bill, there will be many entrants into what will
be a proper market. They will be deemed as undertakings, and the courts
and competition law will apply. That is the difference, and it is not
true to describe it as an
evolution.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000117">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman can continue to assert his
view, but the reality is very different. It is set out clearly in
<em>Hansard</em>, in speeches extolling the virtues of competition, made
by his right hon. Friend the Member for Exeter, in debates on this
subject as recently as 2009. The then Prime Minister did so, too, and
the former Secretary of State for Health, Patricia Hewitt, gave a
speech saying
that<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000118">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“new

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman now seems to want to resile from that position, but the
proposals are clearly part of the previous Labour Government’s

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Members for East Lothian and for Leicester West asked about the
voluntary sector, and there is the concern about how competition law
and procurement law apply to it. Again, this is not a change, because
the voluntary sector is already subject to such laws—and, in
many cases, such bodies are regarded as undertakings. The only
difference that the clause makes is that Monitor, rather than the OFT,
would enforce the Competition Act, so an organisation that is expert in
and knowledgeable about health care will carry out enforcement, rather
than the organisation that can currently do so but does not have that
knowledge. The Future Forum rightly recommended a sectoral regulator to
enforce the provisions, and the Government have responded to its
suggestion.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000120">&#160;</a>

dominating diabetes care was the proposition that the hon. Member for

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady’s next question was about stroke care in London, and
how competition law might have prevented what happened there. She is
right to extol the virtues of those changes, but if a commissioner
worked openly with providers to develop a new or improved service, as
happened in London, and it was done fairly and openly in response to
commissioner requirements, it is difficult to see how there could be
any legitimate challenge on the grounds of restriction of competition
or sharing of markets. The reality is that competition is being seen as
the vehicle to deliver service change and better care pathways when we
know that that happens through the commissioning route, which we have
already
discussed.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000128">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Why
did the Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford, say
one thing and then apparently say something else? I think that that is
a complete misreading of what happened. In preparing legislation,
Government lawyers will always consider whether the clauses in a Bill
are compatible with EU law—which, of course, includes
competition law—and human rights law. That is always the case,
and has been in respect of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000129">&#160;</a>

come now to the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury’s
question about Southern Cross, and how it might be relevant to these
issues and to sale and leaseback. The hon. Lady expressed concern for
Southern Cross. My concern as a Minister is not for Southern Cross, but
the staff and residents of those care homes, and their families. I am
sure that that concern is shared across the Committee. We will,
undoubtedly, have to learn lessons from the experience of Southern
Cross about how the adult social care system is regulated. We must look
carefully and critically at the regulatory framework that we inherited,
and how it has changed over the last 10 years, to ensure that we have
one that is fit for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000132">&#160;</a>

address the concerns of the NHS Future Forum. I can do no better than
to read from the Committee’s public evidence hearing on the

said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000138">&#160;</a>

it significantly raises the burden of proof on us. If we
feel—normally working alongside the commissioning

interests of patients, the burden of proof that that, rather than other
ways of furthering such interests, is the right way to go is
significantly higher. That is the other key thing that has
changed.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

Hancock. The hon. Member for Easington also asked me whether the NHS
was exempt from competition law as section B services. The NHS has no
exemption from competition law, and such exemptions do not apply to
other service sectors either. He must be thinking of part B services
for the purposes of procurement law. It is important that we draw that
distinction for the benefit of those who follow our proceedings. Health
care services are part B services, the effect of which is that the full
rigour of procurement rules does not apply to such services. There is
no change to that provision. The principles of transparency,
proportionality and equal treatment apply to the procurement of health
care services. I hope that that puts that issue to bed.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will try to
draw the debate about clause 64 to a conclusion. The clause will give
Monitor concurrent powers with those of the OFT under part 1 of the
Competition Act 1998 in relation to the provision of the
health care service. The Bill will not introduce the Competition Act to
the provision of health care services for the first time. Competition
law has always applied where providers are performing an economic
function. The existence of a sectoral regulator does not mean that the
courts are more likely to decide that competition law applies.
Competition authorities and courts consider the facts on the ground
when applying the law, regardless of the institutional arrangements for
their enforcement. The existence of a regulator has absolutely no
bearing on whether or not competition law
applies.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000147">&#160;</a>

deflect attention from the Bill. He shimmied almost as effectively as
the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills did on
“Strictly Come Dancing”. However, he gave the game away
in his final comment, when he said that “Competition law has
always applied where providers are performing an economic
function.” The point is that health care providers have always
been considered as carrying out a social function. The Bill changes
that, and the Minister knows
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has failed to answer four simple questions. First, why
introduce 12 clauses in part 3 of the Bill if they make no difference?
The Minister said that chapter 2 simply inserts Monitor into
the Competition Act 1998. It does not. Has he read it? There are 12
clauses. If they do not make a difference, why are they in the Bill?
Secondly, why give Monitor concurrent powers with the OFT if it will
not use them? What is the point, unless Monitor uses them to conduct
its functions? Thirdly, if it is really the role of commissioners to
promote competition, as the Minister has said, why set up Monitor at a
cost of up to £320 million over four years and give the
Competition Commission a role in the NHS for the first time? Fourthly,
why does clause 66 state that the core duties of Monitor,
which the Minister says that the Government have amended, do not need
to apply when it is carrying out its functions under the 1998 Act and
the Enterprise Act 2002? That is the key
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
just in case anyone had any doubt and to clarify for the record, the
Committee is about assessing the Government’s policy. I would
swap places in a heartbeat, so that our policy could be assessed, but
that is not the point of the Committee. When we were in government, we
brought in different providers where they could increase capacity in
the NHS or provide some challenge where services needed to improve. We
did not enshrine competition law in the NHS, nor did we propose to do
so. We always had the ability to manage the real consequences of having
competition and choice in the system, particularly with district
general hospitals through the existence of strategic health authorities
and primary care trusts, which the Government are removing. We also had
clear national standards, or targets, so that patients did not lose out
in the system. I would proudly defend our record in government on the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000152">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 65 gives Monitor the functions that the
OFT has under part 4 of the Enterprise Act 2002 in respect
of health services in England. The clause will allow Monitor to make
what are called “market references” to the Competition
Commission if it has reasonable grounds to suspect that any feature of
a market would prevent, restrict or distort competition. Not only
Monitor will be looking at health services in England; the Competition
Commission will, too. The primary purpose of the Competition Commission
is to promote competition, but, as far as I am aware, it has no
experience, skill, knowledge or expertise in health and health
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to raise a key issue about this clause, as I did in the original
Committee. What will be counted as a market under this clause? Could a
whole local area be considered a market? For example, suppose that only
one district general hospital provides diabetes care in a local
community in which there are no other providers 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 417<a class="bkMark" name="Column417">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and either another provider challenges the situation or Monitor
decides that the current set-up restricts competition. Could Monitor
refer that to the Competition Commission? David Bennett gave precisely
that example in one of his many productive interviews before progress
on the Bill was
paused.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000186">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> In respect of that example, Ministers and David
Bennett have pointed out that there will now be a higher burden of
proof on Monitor to demonstrate that integration in the service is not
in the interests of competition or of patients. Can my hon. Friend
imagine any circumstances in which the OFT and Monitor will not view
that it might not be in the interest of patients, because there is
collusion and only one service is being
provided?<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000187">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend is right to raise the issue of
burden of proof, and I would be grateful if the Minister explained in
simple, layman’s terms what the burden of proof would
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would also
like to ask the Minister whether one of the national services that the
NHS board—NHS England—commissions would be considered a
market. That includes, for example, specialist renal services or kidney
treatment. If Monitor decides that only NHS providers will deliver
those services and a private provider from this country—or
indeed from other European countries, which could happen under the
Bill—offers to provide better renal or kidney services, will
Monitor be able to refer those services to the Competition
Commission?<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000189">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On 17 March,
during the last Committee, the Minister, the right hon. Member for
Chelmsford, told me in response to my question about what a market
could
cover:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>

the Government done nothing to change the power that Monitor gets under
clause 65, which is about not only Monitor’s role but the role
of the Competition Commission? The Minister speaking today has made
much of the Government’s decision to amend Monitor’s core
duties, but nothing in the Bill changes how the Competition Commission

she raises is borne out by the Government’s own words. Point

states:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor
will be limited to tackling specific abuses and restrictions that act
against patients’ interests, to ensure a level playing field
between providers. For example, Monitor could take action against a
provider seeking to frustrate patient choice, or colluding with another
provider not to offer patients home-based
treatments.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000448">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Renal
care is one example where hospitals often insist, for good reasons, on
patients’ coming into hospital for dialysis, but they are now
being challenged by home care providers that offer to provide dialysis
at home. Would Monitor be able to deem the provision of such a service

                  </strong> The clause gives Monitor powers to make market
references to the Competition Commission if it has reasonable grounds
to suspect that features of the market restrict, prevent or distort
competition. An example of when Monitor might use the power would be if
a number of providers introduced systems that made it difficult for
patients to choose providers or move between them, or made it more
difficult for potential new providers to offer services to patients. I
will come to specific points in a moment. The Competition Commission
would investigate and, if it found an adverse effect on competition, it
would determine remedies to address this, which are set out in
competition
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor
would have concurrent powers with the Office of Fair Trading to
undertake this function, so the Bill requires that these bodies consult
each other when first exercising this function in relation to a
particular issue and not to make the reference if the other body has
already done so. That includes investigation powers, which Monitor can
use to decide whether or not a reference should be made.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000205">&#160;</a>

                  </div>intentionally, or without reasonable excuse, would be an offence. In
practice, however, Monitor is likely to have a lot of the information
that it would typically need when considering a
reference—information that the OFT may not have. That is the
basis on which this power is included in the Bill. Monitor would also
have the power to accept undertakings in lieu of a
reference.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000206">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As
with clause 64, the clause does not create a new power; these powers
already exist, and that is what concurrency is all about. The Bill
simply provides Monitor with the powers that currently rest with the
OFT, which they could use in all the scenarios that the hon. Member for
Leicester West and the hon. Member for Pontypridd rehearsed. The powers
that could already be used in regard to the NHS can now be exercised by
a sector-specific expert regulator, in the form of Monitor. We want to
create a single regulator for that very reason and in respect of the

Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000207">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister said that a market could constitute
only a part of England. That makes the point that we have been trying
to impress on him. If that included the whole of England that would be
truly dreadful, because it would imply that anybody offering to provide
any services anywhere in England and not being allowed to do so was
somehow being prevented or restricted in respect of competition law.
Even in a local area, surely the Minister sees the point that that
could result in Monitor’s deeming standard activities—GPs
contracting with a hospital, as they have always done, to provide
services—in a local health market to be anti-competitive and
collusive, and therefore intervening. That is the issue that we see as
a problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000228">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We do not accept that that is a problem, because
we do not believe that that is what the Bill does. The evidence is that
such references have not occurred, as was mentioned earlier. There is a
clear difference between colluding with other providers to deny
patients choice or home-based treatment—the hon.
Gentleman’s specific point—and responding to pathways of
care, which commissioners have procured in a way that is open and fair.
That comes back to the point that I made earlier, and to the point here
that commissioners are the responsible part of the new architecture
that the Bill puts in place for redesigning services and leading the
effective delivery of services.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000229">&#160;</a>

address the amendment. I want to remind hon. Members of the specific
and significant powers given to Monitor under clause 66.
Subsection (4) gives Monitor the power to disqualify
directors for competition infringements if they are in breach of the
Competition Act 1998. On 17 March, I asked the Minister, the right hon.
Member for Chelmsford, to clarify to whom the provisions apply. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
applies to directors of companies and those in equivalent positions,
such as senior staff in NHS providers who perform a
director-like role.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,
Health and Social Care (Re-Committed) Public Bill Committee, </em>17
March 2011; c.
876.]<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000451">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
needs to be clearly on the record, so that NHS staff in primary,
secondary and community care can be clear about it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
consequence of the Bill is that if the bodies involved are found to
have done something that Monitor considers has restricted
competition—for example, sharing markets or having a dominant
market position—they could be disqualified from working in the
NHS for 15 years. If a clinician—a GP, hospital
doctor or nurse—is a senior member of staff in an NHS service,
will they be covered by this power? That is the first set of issues. If
the Minister says, “Oh well, they’re not going to use
these powers anyway,” why have them in the Bill? That is the
question that he continues to fail to answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000264">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
may remember that the Government tabled a new set of amendments at our
previous sitting to give Monitor the power to conduct investigations
where it has “reasonable grounds” to suspect that any
commissioners have failed to comply with the prohibitions on
anti-competitive conduct. The other Minister—the right hon.
Member for Chelmsford; it is so complicated to say that all the
time—gave a specific example of how Monitor could become aware
of a “pattern of service provision” that suggested that
patients were being directed to certain providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What might
that mean in practice? If a GP regularly refers his patients to the
local hospital, or recommends that they go there, for diabetes
care—as you may gather, Mr Hancock, I am very concerned about
diabetes care—would that be considered
anti-competitive?<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 233
is extremely important. It would delete subsection (2), which says that
Monitor’s general duties—we spent last week discussing
them, and the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 423<a class="bkMark" name="Column423">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Government said they had changed them and that Monitor would not promote
competition, but prevent anti-competitive behaviour and promote
integration—need not apply when Monitor carries out its
functions in relation to the Competition Act 1998 and the Enterprise
Act 2002.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Government really want Monitor to abide by and be driven by its new
duties, why does subsection (2) say that those duties need not apply
when it exercises its functions under those two Acts? The Government
should support amendment 233 so that they can make real their claim to
have changed Monitor’s role in the Bill. I look forward to
Government Members’ voting with
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000268">&#160;</a>

I read that, the Office of Fair Trading can—if asked to,

draw a parallel—I said this earlier, but I will put it on the

               <p>We assume that that is

reversed—presumably, the OFT decides, and that is
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000274">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That
seems to be at odds with where the power lies. The Future Forum was
clear that it was deeply concerned about the interaction of competition
law, which is a point that we have heard many times, including in
evidence to the Committee. It begs the question of why the clause and
the previous two clauses remain in the Bill unamended, if the
Government are trying to assuage people’s fears that competition
law and not the health service will decide on the shape of local health
services. Surely, that was what the Future Forum implied when it said
that it thought the job would be best done “by a dedicated
regulator” and not by the powers that the OFT has been
given.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000276">&#160;</a>

that Monitor has concurrently with the OFT. At the heart of the series
of clauses that we are  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 424<a class="bkMark" name="Column424">&#160;</a>
                  </div>working our way through is the point that in order to exercise
concurrency, there have to be exactly the same powers for regulators
that are not sector-specific and which do not have knowledge specific
to the sector, as are then exercised by the sector-specific regulator.
Benefit is added through the additionality gained from a
sector-specific regulator that has knowledge of the sector, which is
why the NHS Future Forum saw the advantages of that as a safeguard
against the disproportionate use of competition. In essence, that was
the Commission’s argument, so the right hon. Gentleman’s
view seems completely unsustainable if taken alongside the whole of the
Future Forum’s
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000278">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As

               </p>
               <p>The
amendment relates to how Monitor would exercise its concurrent
functions. Subsection (2) means that when Monitor is carrying them out,
its main duties and the matters to which it must have regard would not
apply—the concern that the hon. Member for Leicester West
raised—unless the OFT also took account of any particular duty
or matter. That is the important point: there is a clear public
interest test that Monitor would apply in this context when exercising
concurrent powers, and it would, of course, exercise that public
interest test equipped with its sector-specific expertise and
knowledge. That is the point that hon. Members who do not wish to have
Monitor exercising concurrency seem to miss, because without
concurrency, we leave the NHS open to the OFT, which does not have that
expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000280">&#160;</a>

points.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
amendment itself, the OFT and Monitor would not investigate
commissioners because they are unlikely to be considered undertakings.
We debated that issue at length the last time the matter was dealt
with. The second issue is about competition legislation setting a
significant threshold in terms of the sort of practices that are to be
regarded as anti-competitive. Chapter I of the Competition Act 1998 and
article 101 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union
prohibit agreements between undertakings that prevent, restrict or
distort competition or that are intended to do so and that affect trade
in the UK or the EU.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000291">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
agreements likely to be prohibited include those by providers that, for
example, fix the prices to be charged for goods or services, limit
production, carve up markets, make a contract conditional on factors
that have nothing to do with the subject of the contract or that
discriminate between customers. Examples of such discrimination could
be charging different prices or imposing different terms where there is
no difference in what is being supplied. The legislation also covers
cartels, which are agreements between businesses not to compete with
each other.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Chapter II of
the Competition Act 1998 and article 102 of the treaty on
the functioning of the European Union prohibit a business that holds a
dominant position in a market from abusing that position. A dominant
position in a market means that a business is generally able to behave
independently of competitive pressures, such as other competitors in
that market. Conduct that may be considered an abuse by a
business in a dominant position includes charging excessively high
prices, limiting production, refusing to supply an existing
long-standing customer without good reason, charging different prices
to different customers where there is no difference in what is being
supplied or making a contract conditional on factors that have nothing
to do with the subject of the
contract.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
practices are a very long way away from providers co-operating to
provide continuity of care along a care pathway. They are deliberate
and serious attempts to manipulate a market to extort unjustified
profits, which are already prohibited. The OFT already has the power to
investigate them under current legislation. They are not in the
public’s interest and they are not in patients’ 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 426<a class="bkMark" name="Column426">&#160;</a>
                  </div>interests either. It is also relevant that, under competition law,
market distortions may be permitted if they are beneficial to users.
That comes back to a question in our earlier discussions. However, in
general, anti-competitive practices by providers, if they were to occur
in health care markets, would not be in the best interests of patients
because they could restrict choice and stop the NHS getting value for
money for the taxpayer in the first
instance.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Future Forum concluded that Monitor should have concurrent powers with
the OFT because, in looking at potentially anti-competitive practices,
it would be able to bring to bear its knowledge of health care,
including the importance of co-operation through clinical networks and
the benefits of integrating services to improve quality. The Government
agree. We think that that is absolutely
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000295">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I will come to subsection (2), the heart of this
debate, and the hon. Lady’s amendment. She asks that subsection
(2) be removed from the Bill. The effect of deleting it would be to say
that, although Monitor exercises concurrent powers, it should do more
than exercise specialist knowledge. In our view, the provision is not
necessary, because the patient’s interest can in any case be
taken into account, as can the nature of NHS health care.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000297">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Moreover,
removing subsection (2) would create uncertainty. If either of the two
regulators can exercise powers, they must do so on the same basis.
Otherwise, the determination in a particular case could differ
depending on which regulator considered it. For that reason,
concurrency is necessary, as it would remove that uncertainty.
Accepting the Opposition’s amendment would create uncertainty
and confusion, as it would not be clear what the regulator would take
into account when considering whether a particular practice was in
breach of the legislation. By creating Monitor as a sector-expert
regulator, we are strengthening protection in the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000298">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A question
was asked about the role of promoting competition, and the concern that
other regulators might have no expertise. The issue was touched on
earlier, but it is worth putting the answer on the record now. The
concern was about the expertise—or the lack of it, as some
asserted—of the Competition Commission. It is worth saying that
promotion of competition is not an objective of the Competition
Commission. That is not set out explicitly in legislation, and it is
not its stated legal purpose. The OFT could concurrently refer a health
care market to the Competition Commission. We will, I am sure, return
later to the issue of
expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000305">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Leicester West asked why the Bill gave powers to
disqualify directors. The OFT already has powers in that area and can
apply to disqualify directors for breach of competition law, including
directors of foundation trusts. The Bill simply allows those powers to
be exercised by a sector-specific regulator, Monitor. It gives Monitor
concurrent
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000306">&#160;</a>

have been asked about subsection (1). That subsection means that a
decision reached between Monitor and the OFT as to who is best placed
to make a case cannot be challenged by a third party. That is the
purpose of that part of the clause. Such a decision must be taken in
accordance with concurrency regulations. The hon. Member for Leicester
West asked whether GPs regularly referring patients to hospital for
diabetes care would be considered anti-competitive. I believe that
Leicester has a high level of diabetes, so I understand that she has a
constituency interest as well. The answer to her question is, no.
Monitor will have power to intervene only in conduct that restricted

decision from Monitor, and, as we will see in later clauses, it is
clear that the Competition Commission also has a role. At worst, as my

the NHS. Later on, we see it in the role of setting prices, which my
hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd will talk about. It is
unclear. If there is a dispute between Monitor, the NHS commissioning
board and providers about how a price can be set, the matter
can be sent to the Competition Commission for arbitration. Who has the

                  </strong> By opening up competition under the guise of
increasing patient choice and clinician-led commissioning, the clause
epitomises what the Government are trying to do with the NHS. In spite
of the weak evidence, they are trying to convince us that a competitive
market health system is the way to improve quality of health care or,
to paraphrase, it is the Government’s preferred way to deliver
health care. The current Secretary of State made that clear in a speech
to the NHS Confederation in 2005. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000382">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“So
the first guiding principle is this: maximise competition. There are,
of course, potential benefits from privatisation in terms of access to
capital, flexibility, and creating new markets; but private sector
ownership is a secondary consideration to competition, which is the
primary
objective.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000458">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>He
then explained that in order to maximise competition, we need to
maximise the number of providers and purchasers in the system. He
continued:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000383">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“To
make markets work requires not only a plurality of competing suppliers,
but willing and active
customers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000459">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>He
went on to say that the NHS needed<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000384">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“more consumers

fewer.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000460">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In
another key statement, the right hon. Gentleman
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000385">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
statutory formula should make clear that choice should be exercised by
patients,”—<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000461">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>this is
fundamental—<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000386">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“or
as close to the patient as possible, thereby maximising the number of
purchasers and enhancing the prospects of
competition.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000462">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
explains why the Government are transferring power and financial
decisions to GP commissioners. The commissioners are closest to the
patient and GP 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 431<a class="bkMark" name="Column431">&#160;</a>
                  </div>commissioning will help to increase competition and the number of
purchasers through greater choice in the system, especially if it is
driven by the private framework for procuring external support for
commissioners. That also explains the patient-held budgets policy. The
Government want a system in which the number of both purchasers and
providers are maximised, creating a citizen consumer competitive market
to drive forward the forces of “creative destruction” on
the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000387">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
creative destruction causes constant entry and exit from the market,
which is prohibitively expensive in health care because of the costs of
medical infrastructure, technology and staffing. In a single payer
system with a fixed budget, such as our NHS, that will inevitably lead
to financial meltdown. The only way to avoid that is by getting extra
capital into the system, and this is where we come to the heart of it.
The Bill achieves that in a number of ways. First, foundation trusts
can borrow money from the City to invest. They will have to repay that
by treating more NHS patients and more private patients; that will be
aided by the abolition on the cap on private patients’ income
for foundation trusts. Secondly, there will be an increasing demand for
health care insurance as waiting lists go up. We are seeing that
already under the so-called efficiency measures. Thirdly, a new
insurance market will be set up for top-ups and co-payments. Fourthly,
we fear that this will also lead to direct patient
charges.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000388">&#160;</a>

               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">12.45

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Because
the NHS budget is fixed, the drive for excess capacity and a
consumerist approach to health care will have a rapid draining effect.
That will result in clinical commissioning consortia increasingly
becoming rationing bodies, driving up waiting lists and reducing the
number of core NHS services. It will drive foundation trusts into
further debt burdens, forcing closures, mergers and private management
takeovers. That is why the clauses are in the Bill. Despite what
Ministers have said in the past, we are already seeing the beginning of
that in increasing waiting lists. In fact, the process is crucial to
stimulating the private health care insurance and provider industry.
That is why we argued strongly for the retention of the exact phrasing
of the Secretary of State’s duty to secure and provide a
comprehensive health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000389">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
the Government have supposedly made concessions that recognise that the
public would not accept an attempt to privatise the NHS, as the
utilities were privatised by a previous Tory Government in the 1980s,
they have changed tack, not direction. The quality, innovation,
productivity and prevention programme allows politicians to say that
the NHS will continue to receive year-on-year increases in funding. The
efficiency savings, however, are harsh. No health system has ever
attempted such a
scale-back.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000390">&#160;</a>

the hon. Lady’s party, which was in power until last year, that
imposed that programme. In recognition of the situation, we have
allowed the NHS to take four years instead of three to make the
savings, so that it can reinvest every single penny in front-line
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000391">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We have said
all along that the Bill is a privatisation measure. Dr Lucy Reynolds,
who submitted evidence to the Committee,
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000393">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
worked as a privatisation adviser in the 1990s, and I can recognise a
privatisation law when I see it. That’s what this is, and, even
more disgracefully, it is nothing but that. It does nothing
constructive for the NHS at all, just removes its protections against
being pillaged and weakens patients’ protections against being
harmed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000463">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Bill is designed to make the NHS fail and drive the need for private
investment in our health service. Taxpayers will pick up most of the
bill, but get less and less for their money. Additionally, English
citizens will increasingly have to consider taking out health care
insurance policies. The most vulnerable in society will be the most
adversely affected because of the inverse care
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000394">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
opening up the NHS to EU competition law will dramatically increase the
amount of capital available to our health service, but, ultimately,
that capital will flow back to the investors as profit, at the expense
of the UK taxpayer, private health care insurance payments, and so on.
That will only increase income and health care inequalities, which are
both known to damage economic growth. As I have asked throughout our
deliberations, how can the Secretary of State justify the Bill? How
does this clause relate to clause 3 and his duty to reduce inequality?
It is a
paradox.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000395">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State also mentioned EU competition law in his 2005
speech,
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000396">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“A
vital aspect of our relationship with Europe should be to encourage the
EU to be concerned with promoting competitive markets. Although we
don’t want the EU to intervene directly into domestic
legislation, I see no difficulty with encouraging EU trade in services,
by ensuring that a strong market orientated regulatory framework is in
place in each Member State. And it will come, I dare say, for the
education and health in the future—as it did for Telecoms in the
recent past. I see good reason to plan positively for it, rather than
ignore
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000464">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>The
Secretary of State clearly set out his vision in 2005. He believes that
maximising competition is the primary objective, that a strong
pro-competitive regulator, Monitor, is needed, and that there should be
a regulatory regimen geared towards maximising competition or, where
competition is absent or limited, enforcing contestability. He believes
that the market requires not only plurality of competing providers, but
willing and active consumers. It is clear that a single payer system,
our NHS, cannot survive these policies. In fact, the whole point is to
move away from that idea and the Bill will certainly to see to that.
This is a disaster for our NHS, which is actually a very efficient
system. We need proper accountability and collaboration, not this
competitive market system that is being
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000397">&#160;</a>

are talking about services within and without the NHS. What regulations
do the Government have it in mind to lay out the detail? That would be

                  <em>]</em> We could get into a debate about
the definition of what promotes the interests of patients, but the
clause does not talk about the quality of services for the patient. The
term is so vague and nondescript that we have no definition of what
quality actually means. The measure is still subservient, as I said
earlier, to Monitor and the OFT working together, subservient to the
Competition Act and the Enterprise Act. There is nothing in there about
quality at all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000409">&#160;</a>

concerned about is that quality is not even mentioned. How does that
relate to private sector advertising? A patient’s choices could
be based on advertising by a private company that is seeking that

rather, it is based on private sector advertising.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000412">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I shall touch on a point that was eloquently made
by my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley. We are all
concerned about subsection (3)(a). As he correctly said, it suggests
that regulations could be passed to impose requirements on the NHS
board—on national services, therefore—and on local
commissioners to put services out to competitive tender, but it is not
clear what that will cover. As my hon. Friends may remember in the
original Bill Committee, we tabled amendment 492, which would have
deleted subsection (3)(a) to ensure clarity. The hon. Member
for Southport may remember that he voted against that
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000413">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is not
right for the Secretary of State to have the power, as he could under
subsection (3), to use regulations to force—the clause uses the
words “impose requirements”—the NHS board, which
will be responsible for commissioning £20 billion-worth of
services, as well as local commissioning groups to put services out to
competitive tender. If that it is to happen, it should be up to
clinicians, commissioners and patients, not the Secretary of State.
That is why we tabled the amendment, but, unfortunately, the Government
voted against it. I ask the Minister now to do what the Minister of
State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Chelmsford, was
unable to do last time, and clarify which services the provisions
cover.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000414">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
talked about efficiency measures. My hon. Friend the Member for
Southport rightly drew attention to the evidence, and indeed the stout
defence, given in respect of the QIPP programme, which the Labour
Government identified as necessary. They identified the £15
billion to £20 billion of savings as an absolute necessity and
they commenced the work to get the programme under way. It does not
behove the hon. Lady to imply that the coalition has cooked up that
programme since it came into office and inherited the present
challenge. We are working through the programme to redesign services to
ensure that they actually deliver better value for the taxpayer and
quality outcomes for the individual. I am sure that the hon. Lady
accepts that those measures emanated from the Labour
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11071252000420">&#160;</a>
