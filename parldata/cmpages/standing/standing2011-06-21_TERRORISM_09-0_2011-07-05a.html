sight.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am interested in the Minister’s response to the question asked
by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford South, but I want to make a
few observations. The schedule looks rather innocuous—it covers
the obvious practical arrangements for moving from one system to
another—but it throws up one or two important issues, which the
Minister will want to
address.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Section
2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 makes it clear that a control
order can last for up to 12 months, and can be renewed on
one or more occasions. As things stand under the Act, it can continue
indefinitely. We have had some well-informed debates in Committee about
the merits of limiting the time for which a control order or a
terrorism prevention and investigation measure can operate. Last week,
my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles moved a
constructive amendment, which offered the opportunity for a further
extension of one year beyond the two-year maximum. I hope that the
Minister has given thought to that and to the other issues that we have
raised.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the schedule, the transitional period is set at 28 days, beginning on
the day of commencement. I look forward to the Minister’s
explanation, but I understand that existing control orders will remain
in force throughout the transitional period. However, when I first read
paragraph 4, I wondered how on earth the Minister had 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 264<a class="bkMark" name="Column264">&#160;</a>
                  </div>got it past his Liberal Democrat colleagues, because it will give the
Secretary of State a rather interesting power. The paragraph, headed
“New powers not affected by previous control order”,
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Secretary of State’s powers under this Act in relation to an
individual are not affected by a control order having been made in
relation to that
individual.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
provokes several interesting
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How
does the paragraph square with the Government’s policy—it
is apparently written in stone, according to the response that we
received the other day—that requirements imposed on a suspect
should last no longer than two years? The Minister may want to advise
us about some of the current control orders and how long they have
lasted. May I ask him straight out what the longest period is that a
control has now been running? As we enter the transitional period, how
long will that control order last? Under the Bill, the Minister will
give the Secretary of State the power to extend the period of
restriction in a control order—let us assume that it has run for
four years—for a further two years, which means that, in that
hypothetical case, the restrictions under the two different regimes
will last for six years. In earlier exchanges with my right hon. Friend
the Member for Salford and Eccles, the Minister’s avowed
position was that two years had to be the maximum, yet he is giving the
Secretary of State powers to make a much longer
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Also,
is it fair that some individuals who are subject to conditions under
the TPIM regime would by definition not have to be subject to those
requirements for more than two years, while others who were subject to
the TPIM requirements would be subject to restrictions for a much
longer period? What legal advice has the Minister received and does he
think he is on safe ground? If I were under a control order and then
subject to the TPIM, I would be talking to my lawyer. Given that the
Government’s policy is that nobody should be under such
arrangements for more than two years, I would try to construct a case
to challenge the Government, so I am interested to know what legal
advice the Minister has had and whether he can share it with the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister is giving the Secretary of State the power to take someone
subject to the control order, perhaps for a two or three-year period,
into the new arrangement, perhaps for as long as two years, why could
he not accept my right hon. Friend’s perfectly sensible proposal
to have the option to extend for a maximum of one further year where
the terrorist threat was such that that was felt to be both necessary
and proportionate? Somebody can be on a control order for four years,
subject to TPIMs for two years and therefore under restrictions for six
years. How can that be right when the Minister is not allowing the
Secretary of State to extend it up to three years in the case of
someone who has not been on a control order and comes into the TPIM
system? Schedule 8 appears innocuous, but I think that the Minister
needs to address some pretty substantial
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have one more important issue to raise with the Minister, which is the
case of an individual who may have been subject to a control order in
the past but who either previously or at the point of transition is no
longer subject to requirements. In other words, they are released from
the conditions of their control order. However, what if the Secretary
of State receives intelligence 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 265<a class="bkMark" name="Column265">&#160;</a>
                  </div>from the Security Service, backed up by the police, that the person who
was previously on a control order now poses a serious threat? They
cannot be prosecuted for all the reasons that we have previously
debated, but they pose a serious threat. It is a factual question.
Under the definition of “new terrorism-related activity”
in clause 3, will the information that led to the making of
the control order count as new information in relation to the making of
a TPIM? The Committee—and the wider public—would want
reassurance that a TPIM would be possible in such
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Schedule
8 appears straightforward, but it throws up many pressing issues of a
practical nature and of principle too. I look forward to the
Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000026">&#160;</a>

                  </span> It is a
pleasure to welcome you to the Chair this morning, Mr Scott, to
continue our debate on this important Bill. I listened with interest to
the remarks of the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East. I
was initially slightly perplexed by paragraph 4, given the
Government’s settled position, which I think is correct, that a
TPIM should last no longer than two years. However, a moment’s
reflection indicated to me that the measure is warranted, because of
the change of regime between control orders and TPIMs. As I understand
it, what is proposed by the Government is to some extent a change in
culture, which will result in a greater focus on the investigation of
terrorism. Having reflected on the matter, I do not foresee any
objection to a controlee who has been subject to a control order for a
number of years becoming subject to a TPIM notice for a maximum of two
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was
slightly surprised by the right hon. Gentleman’s objections to
the provision, given that amendments tabled by the Opposition have, at
least partly, suggested that the Bill is unnecessary and that the
existing regime was adequate. The Opposition’s position has been
that a controlee could remain subject to a control order under the old

Gentleman’s protest that the Government’s position is
inconsistent reveals an inconsistency in the Opposition’s

read paragraph 4 with the same concerns that the right hon. Member for

               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman also asked—I offer my own view on this; it is for
the Government to set out their position—what legal advice the
Minister had received. He saw inconsistency between the policy of
having a TPIM for two years and the possibility of someone who is
subject to a control order, and subsequently to a TPIM, challenging
that in law on the basis of the Government’s policy position. I
shall leave the Minister to answer that, but any controlee subject to a
TPIM who wants to make some sort of legal challenge should do so on the
basis of the law and not on the basis of the Government’s policy
provision. The courts may be many things, but they seek to apply the
law rather than the Government’s policy—the law is the
law as written. Paragraph 4 is useful, because if it becomes law it
will make clear Parliament’s position that a controlee who has
been subjected to a control order for any period can subsequently be
made subject to a TPIM for two years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000033">&#160;</a>

points in relation to the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for

three, four, six or eight years instead of two; two years strikes the
right balance. For those reasons, I understand the Government’s
drafting in schedule 8. As powerful as the points made by the right
hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East seem at first glance, I am
satisfied that paragraph 4 is not objectionable for the reasons that I
have sought to develop, albeit inadequately. I look forward to hearing

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Bradford South asked me what the schedule will do.
Obviously, it provides for the necessary transitional and saving
provisions, and particularly for the transitional period of 28 days
during which existing control orders may remain in force following the
commencement of the Bill. The transitional period is essential to
ensure a safe and managed transition to the new system that gives
prompt effect to Parliament’s wishes, but does not put the
public at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
provision allows time for control orders to remain in place—a
limited period of 28 days—during which the Secretary of State
will consider the cases of those subject to them, including whether it
is appropriate to impose a TPIM notice on them, and, when appropriate,
apply to the court for permission to do so. When such a person is
served with a TPIM notice, the control order will be revoked at the
same
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East asked about the
Government’s confidence in the legal drafting and the manner in
which the schedule will be interpreted. We are confident about our
approach, and the provision in paragraph 4 underlines the fact that
when a TPIM notice takes effect, it will not be fettered by a previous
control order, which is an important part of the schedule. Although the
right hon. Gentleman rightly identified that such schedules often
appear to be not so significant at first sight, they can have relevant
and important elements built into them, which is why I welcome this
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000040">&#160;</a>

because, unlike my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and

confirm that when TPIMs come in, someone on a control order will
automatically be transferred off it and on to a TPIM, or have I got
that wrong? I am not as clever as hon.—and hon. and
learned—Members serving on the Committee, and we ex-Army

               <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State will determine in individual cases whether the TPIM
requirements apply in relation to each individual. Obviously, clear
consideration will be given to those who are subject to an existing
control order. The Secretary of State will need to review the
provisions for each individual to ensure that the requirements of
clause 3 are satisfied in each case. As we have indicated previously,
there is a requirement for reasonable belief, and the Secretary of
State will need to be satisfied that the relevant conditions will be
met for a particular
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000043">&#160;</a>

touched on this in our debates on clauses 3 and 4, but it is worth
clarifying the position on acts that occur prior to the Bill coming
into effect. I refer the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East to clause 3(6)(a), which I hope will give him the
assurance that he was seeking about existing activity and the
definition of what constitutes “new terrorism-related

               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that we will go on to debate clause 26, which is another
seemingly innocuous provision about interpretation. However, I am a
little confused about the interaction between clause 26(2) and the
definition of “new terrorism-related activity”. If I am
following the Minister correctly—I am trying to follow him
closely—there will be a situation in which, as the hon. Member
for Beckenham said, someone could be on a control order and the
Secretary of State could then look afresh at whether it was necessary
to impose measures under a TPIM. We could therefore have a situation
whereby someone had been held for three years under a control order and
then perhaps another two years under a TPIM. However, within the
definition of new terrorism-related activity, clause 26(2)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
Secretary of State is not prevented from taking account of that
activity for the purposes of the continued imposition, or subsequent
imposition, of measures on that
individual.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Are
we saying that the acts of terrorism-related activity could be perhaps
three or more years old and still be taken into account when
considering the imposition of a TPIM? That seems contradictory. The
thrust of the Bill is that we need new evidence of new involvement in
terrorism before we impose such intrusive measures, yet that provision
suggests that some of the incidents could be three or more years old
but could still be relevant for the purposes of imposing a TPIM. Will
the Minister address that apparent
inconsistency?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000047">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We have addressed clause 3(6) and the way in
which the approach is intended to operate with the two-year time
period. If a further TPIM is sought, new terrorism-related activity
would be required for it to be imposed. I think that the position is
quite clear. I promise the right hon. Lady that I will consider what
she has said so that we ensure that the drafting reflects my
understanding of its intent on the imposition of a TPIM for the first
time. We would be able to look back on the actions that had taken place
prior to the Bill coming into force. Obviously, if a further TPIM was
then sought, we would have to look further to new activity that might
have occurred.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000048">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way
again, which reflects the spirit in which the Committee has been
conducted, but I want to press him on this point. Is he saying that
there could be circumstances in which evidence that was at
least three or four years old could be used as the foundation for the
imposition of a TPIM that could then be renewed again for a further
year after its expiry? At the end of the period, that TPIM would be
based on acts of terrorism-related activity from five or even six years
previously. I do not say whether that is right or wrong, but it seems
to go against the spirit of how the Bill has been introduced—the
idea that what is required is a higher threshold and for
people to have been involved in recent terrorism-related activity. I
would welcome direct confirmation from the Minister of
whether it is possible for a TPIM, which expires at the end of two
years, to be based on evidence of terrorism-related activity that is at
least five years
old?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000049">&#160;</a>

evidence of intention, and such evidence from three or four years ago
is pretty recent. To be honest, I would go back all the way through

point. Historical evidence might be relevant, but the Secretary of
State will need to be satisfied that the TPIM remains necessary to

a continuing risk and that therefore the relevant provisions in clause
3 are fully met. The information, the intelligence and the risk will

of schedule 8 makes it clear that the Secretary of State may impose a
TPIM notice on a person who has been previously subject to a control
order. It would not be appropriate at this stage to pre-empt a decision
about whether any individuals who are subject to a control order should
be subject to a TPIM notice, but it would be irresponsible and
inconsistent with protecting the public to rule that out. When the time
comes, the Home Secretary will need to consider,

and proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Schedule 8
also provides for certain judicial proceedings under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act 2005 to continue, or to be brought after the repeal of
the Act, for the purposes of determining whether a control order or an
obligation imposed under a control order should be quashed. The need
for the provision is clear. Although the 2005 Act will be repealed when
the Bill is commenced, so the control order powers will no longer be
available, ongoing litigation will need to continue. It is right that
individuals who have been subject to control orders should retain their
right to have their order reviewed by the court, or to bring or
continue appeal or damages proceedings relating to that control order.
That is why schedule 8 is important, and it is why I hope that the
Committee will agree to it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000074">&#160;</a>

the individual concerned is currently subject to a control order, but
if he is, at the transition he will have been subject to control order
conditions for more than four years, and might then be subject to TPIM
conditions for a further two years, which would mean more than six
years. I have still not had an adequate response about the
inconsistency between a controlee who might have had six years’
conditions and those who, under the new system, will have no more than
two years’ conditions. I am amazed that we have not had any
interventions from Liberal Democrat Members, because they must be
appalled by that inconsistent policy, but I look forward to the

more than two years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000089">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We come to
the point that the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles made, which
is, perhaps, not a substantive point but a matter of drafting that the
Minister might need to grapple with after Committee stage. Under clause
2, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that conditions<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“A to E in

               </p>
               <p>before a TPIM notice
can legitimately and lawfully be imposed. Condition B in clause 3(2)
requires that<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“some or all of
the relevant activity is new terrorism-related
activity.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000286">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
measure may create a difficulty that might give rise to litigation, so
it is important either for the Minister to set out a clear position
today, or for the Department to go away and think about the content of
clause 26. Subsection (2), which, as a matter of drafting, is an odd
place for an interpretation provision, provides for a case in which a
TPIM notice has come into force. As a result, for the purposes of
clause 3, any terrorism-related activity is not new terrorism-related
activity. None the less, under clause 26(2), the Secretary of State is
entitled to take that activity into account for the<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“purposes of the
continued imposition, or subsequent imposition, of measures on that
individual.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000287">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham has rightly referred to the fact
that the Government should be entitled to take into account for the
purposes of the imposition of a TPIM notice previous terrorism-related
activity. Will the Minister confirm that position, which would be
consistent with the explanatory notes? The difficulty in the drafting
relates not only to the location of the provision in the Bill, but to
the fact that it is not clear what is meant by<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“taking account

activity”<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000288">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>for
the purposes of the continued imposition, or subsequent imposition, of
measures. Does that mean that old terrorism-related activity, to coin a
phrase, can override the primary provisions, so that condition B in
clause 3(2) is to some extent undermined? Alternatively,
does it mean that although new terrorism-related activity is a
condition that must be met before a TPIM notice can be imposed, under
clause 26(2) the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account
previous terrorism-related activity?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The position
is ambiguous, and I suspect that the Government intend the measure to
be used as part of the transitional measures between the two regimes.
In addition, we have focused on the primary provisions in clause 3
because they are key to the Bill and to the change in regime. The
Government may believe that although those provisions should have
primacy, the Secretary of State is none the less entitled to take into
account—to have regard to, for want of a better
phrase—what the controlee or the individual subject of a TPIM

               <p>When
the Secretary of State is considering whether to make a TPIM, some old
terrorism-related activity might form the background, but there would
have to be sufficient new terrorism-related activity for the TPIM to
grip on that new activity. That must be substantial enough to resist
any application or appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000100">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am
interested in the Minister’s view on the proportions that the
Secretary of State might have regard to. If there was a wealth of old
terrorism-related activity and a minor incident of new
terrorism-related activity, would that provide a substantial foundation
for a TPIM to be made? I am sure that he cannot do an 80:20 division,
but these matters, as the Minister knows, will be intensely litigated
from all sides, so the Minister must contemplate the balance of
activity that could form the foundation under condition B for a TPIM.
How much new terrorism-related activity is required for the TPIM to be
made?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham made a point
about drafting. There is a similar point in clause 26(2), which states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000102">&#160;</a>

               <p>That

interpretation clause is an odd place for something that interacts
with, and possibly overrides, clause

want to raise another matter with the Minister arising from clause

tribute to the hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles for
putting their finger on an important issue. It demonstrates how we have
tried as a Committee to be constructive on all sides to improve the
Bill where we can. We are relying on the Minister to go away, consider
the matter and being prepared to come back with alterations and
amendments to make his Bill a better Bill. If hon. Members have played

               <p>Section 2 refers to the
list of measures in schedule 1 that can be imposed on an individual
subject to a TPIM. I choose this moment because it might be the last
opportunity for the Minister to give the Committee some indication that
he has been reflecting hard over the weekend and in recent days on what
those measures currently constitute. It has become increasingly clear
during our deliberations that there is a difference between the
arguments made by the Minister and by other Committee members about the
adequacy of those measures. It is not just members of this Committee
who have spoken about the inadequacies. We heard evidence from Mr
Osborne during our first sitting that the challenges would increase as
a result of the impossibility of relocation under the measures outlined
in schedule 1. Lord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism
legislation and a respected authority on such issues, mentioned his
concerns about the lack of a relocation measure. Lord Howard, a former
Home Secretary, also expressed clear concerns about that
omission.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
says that the definition of “measures” is as stipulated
in section 2 and schedule 1, but I submit that those provisions are not
adequate. We need confirmation from the Minister that he is still
considering the issues. The definition might apply through the lifetime
of the Bill and after it is enacted, but it is still possible that in
our remaining deliberations, we could refine and add to those measures
to provide a greater degree of public safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000109">&#160;</a>

doubt, it is the issue that all of us who have concerns would
pick—but it is not the only one. My right hon. Friend the Member
for Salford and Eccles mentioned her concerns about the two-year time
limit, and she has persuaded me of the importance of having an end in
sight to such restrictions. It is important that we remain open-minded,
but I still see the inconsistency between the Minister’s denial
of her request for a three-year extension and the possibility that
somebody could be under a control order for up to six years, or perhaps
even more. That is a clear inconsistency, and it needs to be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000110">&#160;</a>

that at least reflects the same commitment that the Secretary of State
gave on pre-charge detention, and hopefully goes much further than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000111">&#160;</a>

(Temporary Extension) Bills. We will consider the report carefully in
the context not only of extended pre-charge detention and emergency
legislation but of the relationship between them, and of what
consideration might need to be given to the Bill in the light of the
report. I think I have been quite straightforward and open about the
fact that we will carefully examine and respond to the Joint
Committee’s report. However, I am sure there will remain
differences between us on a number of the Bill’s provisions and
that our discussion of them will continue on Report, as they

Members on both sides of the Committee for their discussion of the
detail of the drafting of subsections (2) and (3) of clause 26. As the
right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles suggested, the read-across
between clause 26(2) and clause 3(2) highlights the point that some or
all of the relevant activity will be new terrorism-related activity. In
the context of clause 26(2), old terrorism-related activity
may be considered in the overarching arrangement, because it may still
show a pattern of risk, but there would still need to be new
terrorism-related activity to obtain the new TPIM at the end of the two
years. Clause 26(2) is important to underline that and to ensure that
there is clarity of operation with clause 3, and I think that it does

event had taken place six years before—it might not be enough to
convict, but it might be a serious event—how would that fit with
the Bill? Would the individual be subject to a continuation of the

under which, if there is evidence of new terrorism-related activity at
any time after the first imposition of a TPIM notice, a new
TPIM notice may be imposed beyond the two-year time limit. To be clear,
if there is a TPIM notice, new terrorism-related activity takes place
and the notice is revoked and subsequently revived, a new TPIM notice
may be imposed after the end of the revived notice, provided that the
conditions in clause 3 are met. If the new terrorism-related activity
takes place after the revival of the notice, it, too, will count as new
terrorism-related activity, which would allow for a new notice after
two years.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000118">&#160;</a>

important that we put these things properly on the record and allow

                  <strong> </strong>Resources have been much discussed in
Committee. The thrust of amendment 126 came from the evidence of DAC
Osborne in our first evidence-gathering session. Committee Members may
find it helpful if I take them back to the important part of that
evidence that relates to amendment 126. DAC Osborne told my right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles that the police were
comfortable with the control order regime, because it had had time to
bed in and they were used to the system and resources, and the
interplay between them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000130">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I asked DAC
Osborne what time scales he was working to in relation to the
bedding-in process for the TPIM regime. He
replied:<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“To
get the resources that we anticipate we need will take more than a
year, in terms of being able to get people trained and to get the right

on how many people actually go on to the TPIMs regime and how many
people come off it.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

is not only a question of money; it is about the extra surveillance

the curfew measures—the overnight residence
requirements—the period of which will be shorter than that
available under the control order system, and the relocation measures,
which will not be available under the TPIM regime, thus requiring much
greater use of surveillance officers. As DAC Osborne said in response
to a question from the hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, it takes about 12 months to train surveillance officers and
ensure that they are ready to be deployed in a challenging security
environment. The aim of the amendment is to prevent a gap

                  </strong> With respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman,
we are dealing with a Bill relating to terrorism, which is incredibly
serious. Such Bills are very different in nature from other measures.
The thrust of my amendment is to deal with the issue of resources
coming online. We are moving from a regime under which additional
resources were not necessary, because of the nature of the measures in
place, to one in which there will be greater risk, which the Government
say can be managed by the provision of those additional resources. The
amendment would prevent the time gap and the additional risk that it
will
cause.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000135">&#160;</a>

an Act of Parliament, but that is not a good point, because the
amendment does not seek to frustrate the Government’s purpose in
introducing the TPIM regime, but to mitigate a risk that we heard about
from DAC Osborne. It does not matter if it has not arisen in another
Act of Parliament; I do not think that DAC Osborne has given that kind
of evidence before, and I am very worried about that security
gap.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000137">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It always worries me when people say that
terrorism is just completely different from everything else we do in
our legal system. Different people have been on control orders at
different times and, depending on how many there were, presumably more
or less surveillance was needed. Should the previous Government have
done such an assessment of needs before imposing a control order on
someone, because of the extra resources needed, or does the hon. Lady
agree that we should have a legal framework and that we should get on
with it in that
way?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000138">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> With respect, the hon. Gentleman misses the point
of the amendment. The control order regime allowed for a range of
measures for which a different level of resource was required, and
where there was a different security environment for the police to
operate in. The new regime has a lesser menu, with two specific
measures no longer available—the curfew for 16 hours
and the relocation provision—so not only money, but greater
resources will be required. We heard evidence from Lord Carlile, who
said that under control orders, it cost about £1.8 million per
control order, but now there is a risk of a TPIM costing around
£18 million. It is not just about money, but about
the extra surveillance officers required. People will no longer be kept
in their home for up to 16 hours or be relocated somewhere where they
do not have contacts with their friends, so they can get on with
planning attacks. Therefore, more surveillance will be required. DAC
Osborne clearly said that training a surveillance officer so that they
were ready to be deployed in a security environment of the kind
envisaged under the TPIM regime would take more than a year. It is
because he said that that I have tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000139">&#160;</a>

for inclusion in the Bill. The amendment is of a probing nature.
However, if such an amendment were accepted, I would envisage that the
control orders regime would continue until the resources are online and
we can move to the new TPIM
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000143">&#160;</a>

want to put in place a mechanism for the discussion between the Home
Secretary and the police and security services on resources, which
should be ready to come online. I am aware, however, that there is
already a system in place. In the first evidence session, DAC Osborne
told us about the draft business plan that went to the Home Office the
previous Friday. Presumably, there is already a Home Office structure
in place. I am therefore ready to accept the fact that proposed new
paragraphs (a) and (b) may be overtaken by the systems that the Home
Office has in place for the consideration of the draft business case.
DAC Osborne told us that that would take around two to three weeks. He
was not able to give us greater clarity, but perhaps the Minister could
discuss that in his response. The simple fact is that it takes a long
time to train surveillance officers; DAC Osborne was clear about that.
We will need many more of them when we move to the TPIM
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000144">&#160;</a>

pressures on the services as a result of the Olympics, which is
probably the biggest security threat that we face? Does she share my

be additional assets. I can only guess that they must be of a technical
variety, but that they would have to be designed, ordered and made to
order for the Home Office. I cannot imagine that that task can be
completed merely in weeks. I assume that that is why he made it clear
that it would take more than a year for them to be completely ready and
for the new regime to bed in, so that it works as effectively as the
control order regime. The intention of the amendment is not to
frustrate the will of the Government in introducing the new regime, but
merely to prevent a security gap arising as a result of resources

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
141, like other parts of the Bill, is a direct lift from the Prevention
of Terrorism Act 2005. It relates to the annual renewal of the powers
granted to the Secretary of State and makes it necessary to bring them
back to the House so that they can be allowed to run for an additional
year—essentially, it is a sunset clause. The amendment is based
on oral evidence that we received from Liberty and Justice, which were
both very clear about the importance of bringing the powers back to
Parliament every year for annual renewal and confirmation that they are
still needed. I do not think that Opposition Members have often agreed
with the position taken by Liberty in relation to control orders.
However, I was struck by the fact that when Shami Chakrabarti gave
evidence on behalf of Liberty, she said—to be fair, she choked
on these words—that she would take the current control orders
regime with annual renewal, rather than the new TPIM
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000148">&#160;</a>

better than the TPIM regime. However, Lord Howard and others also said
that we are legislators—legislation is what we do. If
circumstances change and this Bill is no longer necessary, we should
have faith that we will be able to revise it, rather than having to
lean on sunset clauses. Does not that make amendment 141 somewhat

Lord Carlile and Lord Howard. The hon. Gentleman is right that they
were clear—Lord Carlile was very clear—and I take on

Parliament to repeal an Act if circumstances change and we feel that it
is no longer necessary. However, there are two reasons why I reject the

I take on board what the Joint Committee on Human Rights said in its

suggested something that is, in some respects, stricter—that the
annual review should involve primary legislation. However, I propose
that the mechanism is the same as that under the 2005
Act—through statutory

to prosecution whenever possible is no different under the new regime
from under control orders. I do not have the direct reference to hand,

to having prosecution, and that including the desire for prosecution in
the Bill concentrates the

symbolic importance in Parliament saying that it views the measures as
exceptional and that we would dearly like to be in a situation in which
we do not need them any more, so we will consider the position
annually. That approach would also concentrate the mind, because we
would have to think regularly, “Is this something we still need?

important that the Home Secretary is brought to the House each year to
justify such an exceptional measure. That gives Members the opportunity
to raise objections that their constituents might have about the
regime. As I said earlier, I think that the process will concentrate
the mind. The symbolic value of engaging in such a debate is not a
fiction. The process concentrates the mind and makes us ask ourselves
each year, “Do we still need this?” In an ideal world, we
would not have such a system at all. I think we are all very clear
about that. However, this is not an ideal world, but it is good that
Parliament has the opportunity to ask itself that question every year.

of coming back to the House every year concentrates the mind. Hon.
Members should not forget that the control orders regime changed. It
was introduced in 2005 in respect of the Belmarsh decision, and all
those subject to it were foreign nationals. Over time, it has changed.
At the moment, it also applies to British nationals. The current
arrangements allow for an annual debate about the nature of the regime,
about to whom it applies, and about how it works in practice. It is
important for the Government of the day to put its case before the
House so that Parliament can take a view about whether to continue the
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000179">&#160;</a>

the amendment. The hon. Member for Bradford South suggested that we
would not want the matter to be debated, but we can debate and
scrutinise the activities of the Home Office all the time, such as
during Opposition day debates. We can bring up the principle of control
orders or TPIMs at any point during the year, so the symbolic
discussion of whether they should exist can happen not just annually,
but at any time. The hon. Lady might want a mechanism that could amend
or question the legislation, but that could be done only after the
security services had given the green light to say that the situation
has
changed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000180">&#160;</a>

am unclear about whether the hon. Lady is saying that the debate should

cannot do so without the security services; if it is the latter, we can
do it at any time of the year.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000181">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendment 141 replicates the position under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 on the continuation of measures for
another year. It is not about subsequently amending the legislation,
but about continuing the Home Secretary’s power to make the
measures in the first place. It is important that Parliament says
clearly that the regime is an unattractive and undesirable aspect of
our legislative framework, but because it is necessary, we should
continue to question at least annually whether it should remain. It
would be wrong to decide now that the regime should be a permanent part
of our legislative framework without further recourse to Parliament.
The hon. Gentleman is entitled to his position, but we take a different
view. Such an arrangement is important not just for symbolic value, but
because it would concentrate the mind and continue the position under
the 2005 Act, and that was why I tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000182">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I apologise for being led astray by the right
hon. Lady. I have not yet given up hope that we can make the situation
less exceptional and work within the legal framework, although that is
not what the shadow Minister is calling for. What is the purpose of
sunset clauses? There seem to be four purposes, which I will briefly
explore. First, they flag up the fact that a piece of legislation is
exceptional. Secondly, sunset clauses also ensure a debate each year,
which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood. To be
honest, however, such debates have brought limited light to the matter;
they are not particularly useful ways of looking at the situation and
we have heard fixed positions reiterated and many of the same speeches
given every year. As has been said, there are other opportunities for
us to debate important issues. There is value in the debate provided by
a sunset clause, but it is limited.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The same
point applies to the vote that happens every year. That vote has not
been exciting, and indeed has been somewhat tokenistic—some
would say that that is  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 288<a class="bkMark" name="Column288">&#160;</a>
                  </div>true of far too many votes in this House, but I will refrain from
discussing that before I get told off again. We know about Government
whipping, and that the Opposition are still whipping people to support
control orders. I am not sure that the vote is always
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, the
sunset clause provides a chance to review the policy, and allows the
Government to stop and think about whether something is the right thing
to do, collect evidence and take stock of their position. I do not
think that annual votes and debates help much with that review.
Realistically, the Government cannot carry out a proper review annually
because the resources required are taken up with other things. However,
getting the Government to carry out a proper review is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government carried out a full review of counter-terror strategy, which
was a detailed and helpful piece of work. It did not go as far as I
would have liked, but it has taken steps in the direction in which I
and the Government believe. Ensuring that such a review happens
regularly is the most important use of a sunset clause that I have
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The question
is how we ensure that a review is done properly and not simply as a
token. My idea is that every new Parliament should be forced to take a
stance on terrorist legislation and think carefully, “We are now
in a new place. Now is the time to work out what we do, and do not,
need.” The same sort of detailed work should be carried out by
an independent investigator such as Lord Macdonald. That would fit with
the idea of a five-year sunset clause, at which I hope the Minister
will look seriously. Each Parliament would have to consider the matter,
and because that would happen roughly a year and a half or two years
into a new Parliament, the Government would have the chance to carry
out the review properly and come up with a serious piece of work.
Whoever forms the next Government, and the one after that, we all
expect them to treat this matter seriously and come up with a settled
position, rather than letting legislation go through on the
nod.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000196">&#160;</a>

landscape. The question is how one comes up with a regular cycle, as

“Right, we’re now going to review where we’ve got
to,” rather than just carrying on with business as usual.

information comes in, but one cannot do a proper review on such a time

126, which relates to resources, we all heard evidence in our first two
sittings that caused us some concern about not only the resources that
would be available, but the time scale under which they could be put in
place. My hon. Friend referred to the evidence from Deputy Assistant
Commissioner Osborne, who thought it would take about a year to recruit
enough people, train them, put them in place and given them
the skills to do the surveillance. That was a concern for
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I raised my
point of order at the beginning of the sitting because it is important,
if we are to reach a considered judgment, to have a note from DAC
Osborne about what resources will be required. The Minister has made
great play of the fact that the police and the security services will
be provided with extra resources to fill the gap they have acknowledged
is there as a result of moving from control orders to TPIMs. However,
we are not in a position to put precise figures to the
Minister at the moment, and it would be helpful if we could.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have a
couple of questions for the Minister on another issue, and perhaps he
can give us a bit more information. He will have heard that Lord
Carlile estimated the cost for each of the people on a TPIM who might
require 24/7 surveillance at between £11 million and
£18 million. He does not need to go into detail about
the extra resources that he is providing, but the Committee is entitled
to a statement from him about whether those extra resources are
commensurate with the figures Lord Carlile referred to. The Minister
does not have to give us exact figures, but if the resources are long
way from the figures Lord Carlile talked about, that would increase the
risk that we have to manage, which would cause me and other members of
the Committee great concern. I therefore press the Minister, in

                  </strong> Mr right hon. Friend makes exactly the point that
he made in an earlier intervention. It is a tremendously powerful
point, and our debate has illustrated the constraints in which we
operate. Some of this information is necessarily secret, because it
relates to the capability of our services to protect us, so there
should be something in the Bill to reassure the public that this debate
has taken place and that there is a certification that enough resources
are in place. The public would then be able to sleep in their beds
happily 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 292<a class="bkMark" name="Column292">&#160;</a>
                  </div>knowing that the resources are sufficient to enable the security
services to cope. That is a tremendously powerful
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is another issue about resources. The Government have acknowledged
that, as a result of the loosening of the measures that can be imposed
under a TPIM compared with the measures that can be imposed under a
control order, there will be an increased gap to be met. That
acknowledgment is clear, otherwise extra resources would not be
forthcoming from the Government for greater surveillance. Some of that
weakening of measures relates to relocation, exclusion, association and
the overnight residence provision. I have made it clear in all my
contributions during our proceedings that I am particularly concerned
about the relocation provisions. I remain concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
possible that when the TPIM legislation comes in, the Secretary of
State will have to take a view after 28 days as to whether there is
sufficient evidence to impose a TPIM. Under the TPIM regime there will
not be a relocation provision, so the person who was formerly subject
to a control order will be free to reside in his locality or where his
family are. We know that at least five of the people who are currently
under control orders with a relocation provision are from the London
area. That was in the evidence that DAC Osborne gave
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to raise unnecessary fears. My long association with security matters
means that I would not do that. I feel a personal responsibility,
however, to highlight this issue, put it on the record and see if we
can get it addressed. Will the Minister consider a transitional period
for those control orders, because five of the most dangerous people in
the UK—otherwise they would not be under control
orders—could return to London at a time when the security threat
is incredibly high and the security services are stretched? Such a
period could continue a relocation provision to take us beyond the
Olympic games. That would be a sensible, pragmatic measure and it would
enable us to keep the relocation provision in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We heard from
DAC Osborne that relocation is the most useful provision that we have.
Lord Howard said that it was a useful provision. If someone is
relocated, perhaps to Norwich or another area where the policing
pressures are not as great, the resources for 24/7 surveillance might
be easier to obtain, and the gap caused by the reduction in overnight
residence orders could be filled. This is a genuine, heartfelt request
to the Minister: is there not a temporary provision that we can put in
place to get us over the period of the Olympic games, when we will be
facing such a tremendous pressure on our
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000229">&#160;</a>

TPIM regime, there will be an increased risk; extra resource will be
required for us to manage that risk; and a particular part of the
increased risk will relate to the lack of a relocation provision. That
is why it is important that there is agreement that sufficient resource
is in place under the Bill to reassure all of us and the public that
the risk can be managed and we can all be safe and secure. I will
obviously be careful not to stray too far, Mr Scott, but I do not think
that we had as full a discussion about exclusion as we might have had.
We talked about place, area and locality. I remember it well; it is all
flooding back to me. I would be interested to hear what the Minister
has to say, but I am not convinced that sufficient resource will be in
place to manage the fact that we will not have a relocation
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000233">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I think that the Olympic games are a unique event
in our capital city. If the hon. Gentleman looks at reports of the
Select Committee on Home Affairs, which has looked into the pressures
on security at the time of the Olympic games, he will see that this is
not a normal set of affairs; it is not a small event. It is the biggest
event, with probably the biggest security risks that we have dealt with
in the past 20 or 30 years. Therefore, I do think that it is
appropriate for me to ask the Minister—I hope that he gives me a
specific reply—whether it is possible to have a transitional
provision to allow for relocation arrangements to remain in place in
relation to those people who are subject to TPIMs after their control
orders expire as a result of the new legislation in order to take us
over the period of the Olympics. That would reassure many of
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to say a few words about amendment 141 and the idea of a sunset
clause. My instinct is to share that of my right hon. Friend the Member
for Wythenshawe and Sale East. If we could get away from an annual
set-piece analysis of the legislation, that would be helpful. I
reluctantly conclude that we are likely to face a sustained and severe
terrorist threat in this country for many years to come. I see no
evidence whatever of the threat reducing or of our not having to take
measures to deal with the security threat that we
face.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000236">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
a result of all my misgivings about our ability to manage the risk and
the uncertainty about the introduction of the new TPIM regime and the
move away from control orders, I think that a close examination of the
implementation of the new regime, the provision of resources and the
ability to fill the gap created by the dilution of the measures in the
TPIM regime will be a necessity. Probably in the next 12 months and
perhaps even after that, there will be a greater need for scrutiny 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 294<a class="bkMark" name="Column294">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of the regime than there has been in the past. I think that we could be
managing increased risk and fragility unless the right resources are in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
I certainly support the idea of a review of the legislation, as
suggested in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Ladywood, after it has been in operation for 12 months. I
would want to be examining closely what the legislation’s effect
had been. We are taking a step into the dark, and despite the
Minister’s lengthy and erudite reassurance that all will be
well, all will be fine, there will not be a problem, I say,
“Rather him than me.” He will be responsible for the
operation of the legislation, and we need close and intense scrutiny of
the implementation of his new regime. It may throw up some new problems
that he will have to deal
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000238">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a pleasure to follow my right hon. Friend.
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood on
the way in which she spoke to her amendment this morning. She provoked
an interesting debate, and has taken us to the heart of two key issues.
One is the practical issue of resources, and like many members of the
Committee I look forward to what the Minister has to say about that.
The other is the principle issue relating to renewal or repeal of
counter-terrorism legislation. I am pleased that so many members of the
Committee seem to have come armed with the <em>Hansard</em> report of the
Second Reading debate, and I will say more about that
shortly.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to
talk first about resources. My real concern, which is shared by other
hon. Members, is that there is a particular political dynamic within
the Government 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 295<a class="bkMark" name="Column295">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that could cause the wrong thing to happen. Any Minister
in any Government will commence legislation when resources
are in place and to the best of their knowledge the policy that the
House has introduced in legislation can be delivered on the ground and
in practice. But there is a dynamic within the
Government to rush headlong into the new system
of TPIMs and to get outside the control order system. What worries me
is that that political imperative will become so strong that a risk too
far is taken. That is a genuine concern. We recognise that the
Government will get their way, and that we will move forward, but there
is real concern that if they do so too hastily, there will be too great
a
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000244">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Ladywood would deal with that issue in a practical way. She mentioned
some of the matters that the Minister must take into account. Money is
obviously crucial, but it is only part of the picture. She talked about
the need to recruit and train the relevant staff because, by
definition, the TPIMs regime will require more people to make it work
than the previous control order regime. That must be done with great
care and great skill, and requires time. In his evidence to the
Committee, Stuart Osborne referred to the likelihood that it would take
at least a year to bed
in.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000245">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is evident from our debates that the Minister cannot escape the
concentration of risk when he assesses how quickly the new system can
be implemented. My right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles
has made the point many times and with great conviction, and rightly
so, that the prospect of the wholesale relocation of dangerous suspects
back to, not only one city, but one part of a city is concerning. That
must weigh in the Minister’s mind as he considers when the new
regime should come into
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
our previous sitting, I went through some of the relevant issues. The
suspects will be in their home environment, with the more immediate
access to contacts and networks that that necessarily entails. The
physical environment will present difficulties, and we want to be
satisfied that the powers of exclusion and association are sufficient
to help the police and the Security Service to deal with those
difficulties.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Whenever
we have such debates, my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford South
continues to raise the question of returning people who have been
convicted of terrorist offences to similar areas. Will the Minister
update the Committee on how many convicted terrorists are expected to
be released from prison over the next 12 months? I submit
that that number will be greater than the number subject to control
orders, so that substantially adds to the
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
pay tribute, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles
did the other day, to those in the agencies who are working in
communities to try to mitigate and manage the risks posed by returning
prisoners. None the less, that has to be added to the mix, and it is an
issue of
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000249">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The real worry is that, in my experience,
terrorists who have been convicted and sent to prison get out after
relatively light sentences. For example, the five people who killed six
of my soldiers and 11 other people, and against whom I gave evidence,
were out 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 296<a class="bkMark" name="Column296">&#160;</a>
                  </div>after five years. They are still terrorists, and they still have evil
intent. I endorse the right hon. Gentleman’s
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000250">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman’s
observation, which gives me an opportunity to repeat what the Minister
said earlier. The observations made by the hon. Member for Beckenham
during the Committee’s proceedings have been perceptive and
powerful, and I am grateful for that. He has made another important
point this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000251">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
risk posed by some of those returning prisoners will be substantial and
will have to be managed by the police, the probation service, the
Security Service, and others, as those prisoners re-enter society. We
should not underestimate that risk, and the numbers are growing, which
is a
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
we add together the Olympic games, returning prisoners, the new regime
and the police and Security Service’s trying to recruit and
train, it is a potent mix at a time of severe threat. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles made a powerful argument for a
transitional phase, for putting back the date of commencement and for
doing the right thing to manage the risk without putting the public at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are also concerns as we look at the wider policing environment, which
my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford South has mentioned. He will
have read and heard the comments of Sir Hugh Orde, the president of the
Association of Chief Police Officers, who spoke about the current
policing environment in his usual candid tone. When I was a Minister in
the Northern Ireland Office, it was my privilege to work closely with
Sir Hugh to address organised crime and terrorism in Northern Ireland.
He is a first-rate police officer and a first-rate chief constable, and
we should take his advice
seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000254">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Sir
Hugh drew attention to three issues. I am sure that the Minister has
studied his speech, but I encourage all members of the Committee to
look at what he said. He discussed the tight time scales. We all know
that the Government are in a headlong rush on every front to bring
about reform and change, but we cannot and should not take unnecessary
risks in this area. None the less, we have to include the imminent
arrival of police commissioners in our consideration. Issues raised by
my hon. Friend the other day still require answers.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Sir Hugh
discussed the change in the architecture, particularly at national
level, of the policing structure. In addition, the National Policing
Improvement Agency will be dismantled, and a new national crime agency,
of which we know the outline but not the detail, will be created. Added
to that is the ongoing review of pay and pensions, which does not make
an atmosphere conducive to a huge change in managing one of our
greatest risks. Sir Hugh also made an interesting point about funding:
as the National Policing Improvement Agency disappears, many of the
things that it currently pays for do not disappear, such as the police
national database. All those costs are now being loaded on to local
police forces and authorities, adding further pressure. Some of them
will have to deal with the threat from terrorists. I make those points
to amplify the challenge for the police in managing further change. Why
can the change not be put off for another year or two, until such time
as the police are satisfied that the environment in which they operate
is sufficiently stable?<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000256">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">My right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles made a number of points about
our first evidence session, and the important questions that are still
to be answered. We do not know to what extent it might be possible to
have them answered in full. They include the question of the business
case; the cost of surveillance; the balance of risks between the new,
less stringent regime the Government propose and the need for more
resources; and whether those resources are adequate. I look forward to
the Minister’s response and, I hope, further amplification on
what information may be available to the Committee as it reaches
conclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Comments were
made earlier about my observations about renewal on Second Reading.
There is a place for sunset clauses in certain legislation, and for
renewal dates. Without straying too far from today’s business, I
will give two brief examples from my experience as a Minister in the
Northern Ireland Office. We had special provisions for the recruitment
of police officers in Northern Ireland, which required derogation from
European employment legislation, to allow the recruitment of one
Catholic officer for one non-Catholic officer. That was obviously
controversial. However, 10 years ago, 8% of police officers in Northern
Ireland were Catholic; now that figure is 30%. The end result of that
legislation was certainly worth while. However, it was so controversial
that it could not be implemented on a permanent basis. Once we reached
Lord Patten’s recommendations on representation of Catholics in
the police, it was right that the legislation should come to an end.
That was renewed every two years; earlier this year it was not renewed.
I fully support the decision not to renew those special provisions.
That is a case where renewal every two years made
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
instance results from the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act
2007, which saw the replacement of the Diplock courts. I am sure that
our hon. Friend the judge—I am referring to the hon. and learned
Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham—will be interested in
that. Again, it was very controversial, as justice moved to a new
system of judge-only trials in Northern Ireland. Quite rightly, that
too is subject to renewal every two years. Just last week in Committee,
it was agreed that those powers should be renewed for a further
two-year
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
are examples in controversial areas—such as trial without a
judge—where there is an argument, especially when trying to
reach the point where the special provision is no longer required; and
in relation to 50:50 recruitment of police officers in Northern
Ireland. I believe that we should try to get to a different place on
counter-terrorism legislation in general, and particularly a provision
such as this one. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for
Salford and Eccles that the risks we face, sadly, are not going to go
away. Senior police officers repeatedly remind the public that such
risks will be here for a considerable time—for the foreseeable
future—so it is a pretence to think that we will not need these
or similar powers, and we should not suggest to the public that we
think differently.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000260">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is an important part of the argument that we should strive for
political consensus on such measures wherever we can. As I have tried
to demonstrate, along with other Members, some of us have moved from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 298<a class="bkMark" name="Column298">&#160;</a>
                  </div>positions that we once held, because we have reflected carefully on the
evidence and principles involved, and we have come to different
conclusions. My right hon. Friend has spoken persuasively about time
limits. I have spoken about 14-day pre-charge detention. My hope,
therefore, was that we would move towards a sufficient consensus, where
we could say, “This is an agreed position. The threat will be
here for some time and we can now agree on this piece of legislation.
We don’t need to keep coming back to it and adding to the
controversy, once we have a settled
position.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
problem today, in relation to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood, is that I do not think that we
have reached a sufficiently strong consensus. We have been through many
of the Government’s proposals in great detail. We have discussed
the gaps regarding relocation, time limits, and in policies on access
to phones and the internet, as well as the absence of the reserve power
that I proposed in an earlier amendment. Although we have not reached
consensus, my hope is that the Minister will come back, either in
further speeches today, or on Report, and bring us closer to that
agreement. That would give me comfort, because we should not subject
counter-terrorism legislation to annual renewal. The Minister, however,
still has some way to go to cement that consensus.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My second
difficulty relates to the short-term scenario that we face,
particularly over the next 12 months, and my right hon. Friend the
Member for Salford and Eccles has spoken about that. Suspects will be
relocated back to their own communities, and we must also deal with the
emergence and release of convicted terrorist prisoners back into the
community. The Olympic games are a target and there are other threats,
such as that posed by Northern Ireland-related terrorism—we must
not forget not only that the threat level is considered
“severe” in Northern Ireland but that it is
“substantial” here, which places an additional pressure
on our police and security services. We need to go a good deal further
to reach consensus on policy. The Minister must reflect on the next 12
months, when the risk will be great. It is the worst of all times to
consider bringing in a new regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
could alleviate my predicament by accepting the spirit—if not
the letter—of amendment 126, which aims to make it absolutely
clear that the new system would not come in until an explicit agreement
is reached between the Secretary of State and those who would have to
implement the powers in the proposals. If he were prepared to do that
and ensure that we did not have a headlong rush in the face of
increasing risk, he might get me off the hook. In principle, however,
we should try to achieve a more settled position than annual renewal.

                     </span>
                  </strong> I shall be brief, because the arguments on
resources have been well rehearsed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Ladywood, and by my right hon. Friends the Members for
Salford and Eccles and for Wythenshawe and Sale East. There is a
tremendous responsibility on the Minister to respond to those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000265">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I accept that
the Minister has a difficult job in relation to the Bill. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East discussed the political
imperative for introducing the Bill, which was recognised 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 299<a class="bkMark" name="Column299">&#160;</a>
                  </div>by Lord Carlile, who discussed how the Bill came together. I understand
that Government Members want to see progress in relation to the TPIM
regime because they thought that the old control order regime was
ineffective and wrong. Taking that position is their right. We are in
difficult circumstances, however, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Ladywood is right to push the Minister. She will accept
that the technical drafting of the amendments may not be accurate, but
their principle and the thrust behind them deserve a hearing from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
coalition Government now have a track record, because they have been in
power for over 12 months, and the public are worried about issues of
security, the 20% cut in the Home Office budget and cuts to police
numbers and to the terrorism budget. The Minister is asking us to
accept that, despite everything that is taking place, there will be an
increased risk, which will be mitigated by the extra resources that we
are going to provide. However, for the obvious reasons that have been
expressed, the Committee cannot push on the detail of what those
increased resources will be, because of the risk to our country. I hope
that the Minister will take seriously my intervention on my right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles about the possibility of the
Joint Intelligence Committee and Intelligence and Security Committee
examining such issues in greater detail, with the opportunity to see
whether the increased resources have met the
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Olympics and Paralympics are unique events and, unfortunately,
tragedies have occurred at previous games. This is not about
scaremongering in any way, but having been a Sports Minister and having
sat on the Olympic board, where security has been addressed, I know
that there are great concerns about increased threats. Resources are
available to the Olympic board for security issues, but the Minister
should be aware of our concerns about the measure that will be lost on
relocation. My right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles made
a powerful point about whether we can delay or find some transitional
arrangement to meet the
threat.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000268">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister can reassure us today. If he cannot do so, we
feel strongly that we may have to return to these issues. It was quite
sad that we did not have the information that DAC Osborne said that we
would have, because that would have been helpful. There is no doubt
that increased surveillance will mean increased costs. On the reduction
in police numbers, I am particularly concerned about the senior police
officers we are losing because of the imposition of regulation A19. A
lot of experience will go. The comments of Sir Hugh Orde,
who has been around for a long time and who has much experience in
difficult policing areas, should not go
unnoticed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000269">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
were catastrophes in the Home Office both when we were in government
and more recently. You have ruled on this, Mr Scott, but the whole
issue around police bail and what has happened and when it happened is
of concern. I am sure that we will return to that on Thursday when we
debate the police bail Bill. I hope that the Minister will understand
our great concern about the changes he has made to the legislation, and
he must ensure that not only we but the public feel reassured by the
measures that he has introduced. It would be apt 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 300<a class="bkMark" name="Column300">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to have the opportunity to review amendment 141, for the reasons that my
right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East has stated,
to see what has happened and to see where we are. I again hope that the
Minister will accept that
principle.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000270">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendments deal with two separate issues:
resources and the duration of the provisions. It may interest the
Committee to know that before I came to Committee this morning I
undertook a joint briefing with the Metropolitan Police Service, the
commissioner, the Home Secretary and other agencies involved in the
security preparations and exercises that will be undertaken in coming
months to ensure our preparedness for the Olympics. We certainly do not
need any further underlining of the responsibilities of the Government
and those agencies in ensuring that we present a safe and secure
games.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The issue is
a national one. It is not simply about London. Events will take place
across the whole country. The torch relay will obviously touch all
parts of our country as well. We are confident about the preparations
undertaken to date, but we are in no way complacent, and will retain
our resolve to fulfil our commitments to a safe and secure
games.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A budget of
£600 million has been allocated for Olympic security, but we
believe on the basis of our current estimates and examinations that the
budget can deliver on the basis of £475 million. Obviously the
£600 million is retained, as it is the envelope
within which we operate. The sum may not be needed in full, but it
provides support for Olympic preparation security. The police and other
agencies, and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and
Paralympic Games, are doing good work to prepare for the Olympics.
Things are being co-ordinated, and that work will be tested in the
months ahead to ensure that there is the correct level of preparedness
to deliver security at the games, as we all
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
right hon. and hon. Members will understand from previous comments that
I have made in Committee, we do not provide specific figures on
counter-terrorism funding for the security services and the police.
That is not because we want to hide information, but because of
concerns about the underpinning of the capabilities and techniques, if
that information were disclosed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I appreciate
the points that right hon. and hon. Members made—fairly, I
think. I can tell them that we have had extensive discussions with the
police and security services, not only recently but for months. The
police and security services have been aware at least since February of
the money available to enable them to begin developing additional
capacity and capability for the preparations for transition to the TPIM
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Right hon.
and hon. Members will have heard what I have said about confirmation
from the security services about mitigating risk, and the overall
arrangements. The Metropolitan Police Service and I have made it clear
that from January, arrangements will be in place effectively to manage
the transition from control orders to TPIMs. It would be irresponsible
of the Government to introduce the new system when it was not safe to
do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
the issues that are being flagged up, but we are confident, as I have
said, about the preparations and capabilities that can be put in train.
We are confident 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 301<a class="bkMark" name="Column301">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in the ability of the Security Service and the police to deal with the
new system—and it is a new system that gives a broader
context—with the significant resources that are being made
available for an overall package of security in relation to TPIMs, and
the use to which surveillance and other techniques will be
put.<a class="bkMark" name="11070573000277">&#160;</a>
