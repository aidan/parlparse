<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting (Janet Anderson):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Television Licences (Disclosure of Information) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Two o'clock except for Thursday 20th April and Thursday 4th May 2000 when the Committee shall not meet.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. I believe that this is your first Standing Committee on a Bill as Chairman. We are honoured that you have chosen us and we wish you well.

<P>
The sittings motion proposes that, during proceedings on the Bill, the Committee meets on Tuesdays at half-past 10 and half-past 4, and on Thursdays at half-past 2, except on 20 April, which is Maundy Thursday, and 4 May, when the Committee will not meet because most, if not all of us will have other things on our mind that day.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> First, Mr. Illsley, I reiterate the Minister's welcoming you to the Chair. We look forward to your stewardship of our proceedings.

<P>
We welcome the Government's intention not to sit this Thursday afternoon, nor on Thursday 4 May, when there will be an important debate in Westminster Hall on the Government's strategy on sports. I am grateful to have the opportunity to concentrate on that. I hope that I am not giving too much away by saying that we hope that the Bill might be dispatched on Tuesday 2 May, although that will depend on the progress that we make on the issues.

<P>
We appreciate that, although the Bill is very short, it is important. We recognise that the issue that it covers is a narrow one: our proceedings will consist, not of debates on the principle of giving free television licences to the over-75s, but solely of discussions about the Government's preferred mechanism for implementing that promise. The narrowness of the Bill's subject matter, however, adds to the difficulty of marshalling our thoughts on the issues that we should ask the Government to consider.

<P>
In that regard, I am worried that the proposed grouping of amendments to clause 1 brings together several issues that we would have preferred to debate separately. I do not know whether that can be altered by agreement. We are also disappointed that amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which touch on an important point, have not been selected, although we might be able to make that point by some other means. We should have preferred the amendments to clause 1 to have been marshalled so that we could debate amendment No. 1 on its own, amendments Nos. 4 and
 5 together, and amendment No. 14 later in our proceedings. Bearing in mind that small caveat, we are anxious to make progress, although there appears to have been some misunderstanding as to my availability this morning. In the event that I have to leave the Committee before the end of the sitting, I would like to tender my apologies in advance.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.

<P>
In view of the debate on the sittings motion, we shall take amendment No. 1 on its own.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disclosure of information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 6, leave out, ``at the request of the BBC''.

<P>
I am grateful to you for that ruling, Mr. Illsley. It will be convenient for the Committee to consider amendment No. 1 separately, as the amendment gives us the opportunity to consider the principle of the Government's chosen method for ensuring that all pensioners who are aged 75 and over, and are entitled to a free licence, receive it.

<P>
The Government have chosen to place the onus on the BBC to request information about whether a pensioner is entitled to a free licence-that is, whether they have reached the appropriate age-and to obtain other information to cover the security aspect, especially in relation to the fact that pensioners receive a free licence for only one address. We understand and concur with the Government's approach in that respect. However, it begs the question-which many have already asked-why the Government thought it inappropriate to compile a list of the 3 million or so eligible pensioners in order to produce a database of the information that could be made available to the BBC. The question was raised on Second Reading, but we have not yet received a satisfactory explanation of the more obvious method was not chosen.

<P>
I add the caveat that I, the Minister and other members of Committee are at a disadvantage in that we are not social security experts. The workings of the Department of Social Security, in terms of the way in which records are kept and computers are organised, might mean that this would be a difficult operation. Perhaps the argument has already been lost. However, it is right to ask, at the commencement of the Committee's proceedings, why the Government have chosen to adopt a method that requires the BBC or its contractors to verify, on every occasion, that an old age pensioner aged over 75 who has applied for a free licence is entitled to it, when it might be preferable to provide the BBC with a complete database of eligible individuals.

<P>
Another argument centres on cost. What will it cost to process each individual request for information? Common sense suggests that it will be more expensive to deal with the matter on the basis of individual applicants. If the BBC were to be given a complete list of the 3 million or so eligible pensioners-I assume that the DSS knows who they are-people would be less likely to fall through the net, either by not having a licence or by buying one when they did not need to. That issue, too, was discussed in detail on Second Reading.

<P>
To put the onus on the DSS or the Government to supply information, instead of on the BBC to request it, would also be a more effective way of dealing with the question of people who die, because one assumes that the DSS is among the first to know when an elderly person dies. It could then supply that information to the contractors dealing with the licence records; it should be a straightforward procedure. As the Government will pay for it anyway, we should ask at the start of our Committee proceedings why they have decided on the individual route, as opposed to setting up a complete database.

<P>
However, it will not be the BBC that makes the request or receives the information, but the contractors or companies that administer the licensing system, currently known as TV Licensing. That body already has a mass of information about us-who we are and where we live-so we should not get too excited about a specific age-related list; however, the Bill gives wide powers to provide social security information. There is understandable concern about that apparently unprecedented departure from normal practice, and we should not allow the desirability of the end-free television licences for the over-75s-to justify a lack of care in implementing the concession.

<P>
If the government believe that there should be a request and supply mechanism, a key question is where the request should originate. That is why we have tabled amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which are clearly related to amendment No. 1. Should the request come from the BBC? If not, we see no prospect of the BBC being able to supervise the arrangements properly.
 
<P>
The BBC is defined in the clause in terms of its contractors; therefore, the contractors will make the request and receive the information, with no supervision by anybody in the BBC. Therefore, we suggest that the definition of BBC in subsection (2) should be amended to make it clear that the contractor definition relates only to the receipt of the information and not to the making of the request. If the Government accept our suggestion that a database should be provided to the BBC and, from it, to the contractors, the supply of information would be complete.

<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee any longer on the arguments, but two clear issues emerge that require consideration. The first is why the Government have decided to deal with the matter as they have, instead of asking the DSS to draw up a proper database of everyone who qualifies. Secondly, notwithstanding the clear and severe penalties set out later in the Bill for wrongful use of the information, some thought must be given to the fact that the contractors, rather than the BBC, will be the main players. What supervision will the BBC exercise over its current contractors and, more important, future contractors that it appoints. If we agree to the Bill we, in effect, give the BBC a free hand in relation to appointments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I have received several complaints about TV Licensing, which has written to some of my constituents stating that it refuses to believe that they have no television, or only a black-and-white set. That underlines the hon. Gentleman's point about the need to ensure that the BBC exercises proper supervision over TV Licensing.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I am trying desperately hard not to be overtly partisan or party political, and to make my points in as sober a fashion as possible.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's intervention reminds me of the coverage at the end of ``Newsnight'' last night about CEMA, which is currently implementing medical examinations in connection with disability benefit. All hon. Members have constituents who will be affected. CEMA appears to have implemented the Government's intentions in respect of independent medical examinations-which I freely acknowledge they inherited from the previous Government-in a heavy-handed manner. I do not want to incur your wrath, Mr. Illsley, by straying too far, but it is an important example. In principle, it sounds cosy to say that, to obtain value for money-I am all in favour of that-private sector contractors will be used. In practice, however, we need assurance that those contractors will do a proper job. I am more concerned about that than about any other proposal in the Bill. We should be given clear assurances about how the BBC and the Government intend to supervise the operation of the measure. When the system is up and running, DSS clerical staff, those who work in TV Licensing and other contractors will make applications and obtain the information. My intuition is that that system contains a recipe for difficulty. We need clear promises about how the Government and the BBC will supervise the system.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Tredinnick </B>(Bosworth): It is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley. We first met about 10 years ago when we were engaged on parliamentary business on the west bank, and we have stayed in touch ever since. I never envisaged serving under your chairmanship in this or in any other Committee. It is appropriate that a man of your substance should have his first outing as Chairman in the biggest Committee Room in the House.

<P>
I support the principle of providing free television licences to the over-75s. Before you call me to order, Mr. Illsley, and point out that I should have discussed that on Second Reading, I should add that I also support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) on the Government's so-called method. Unusually, I also support the comments of the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker). In our advice bureaux, constituents often draw to our attention the unsatisfactory way in which television licenses are processed.

<P>
It is strange that a Government who pride themselves on what they call, in kindergarten jargon, joined-up government should seek to unjoin what could be their remit in this regard, namely, their management of their own data systems. I am deeply concerned about the proposals that the Bill sets out. I do not understand why the Government cannot formulate a list by themselves. I am even more concerned to read in the explanatory notes-in the preparation of which the Minister has, no doubt, had a hand-that the measure affects 3 million people. We are not talking about a few pensioners; we are talking about 3 million people. That number will, no doubt, increase, given the improvements in public health.

<P>
I must also query the suggestion that the chosen so-called system would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>relieve most applicants of the need to submit documentary proof of entitlement, making the application process less burdensome.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot see the logic of that. How can it be less burdensome than the maintenance of a proper register by the hon. Lady's Department? It might be unchivalrous, at this stage in the proceedings, to call it absolute nonsense, but it does seem strange.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale made the point that we are dealing with sensitive information, including information about the amount of money that people receive; that information could be abused. He also referred to the contractors. Who are they? My hon. Friend and I have, since Mrs Thatcher's day, been great supporters of the principle of privatisation-I am sure that my hon. Friend will not disagree with that-but we must be sure about who those contractors are.

<P>
What safeguards will the Government--[
Interruption.]  Is the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) trying in intervene? No? Having sat on the Government side for rather a long time, I know what it is like. Government Members are not encouraged to participate in Committee proceedings-the Whips put the manacles on. I am not trying to provoke the hon. Gentleman out of his corner. No doubt, in his mining days, the hon. Gentleman-

<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Barron </B>(Rother Valley) rose–
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tredinnick:</B> Here we go.

<P>
<B>Mr. Barron:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman making the case that the whole process of competitive tendering, through which the public sector has been going for in the past decade, should involve only individually named companies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tredinnick:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. There is some truth in that-I grant him that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Barron:</B> What is the hon. Gentleman saying, then?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tredinnick:</B> I am saying to the hon. Gentleman-to whom I generously gave way-that there is some truth in what he said. Am I supposed to go through all the competitive tendering contracts that we had?

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tredinnick:</B> My hon. Friend certainly does not want me to.

<P>
The point is that a great deal of sensitive information will be used, and we are worried about the system for that. I ask the Government to address those concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. Harry Cohen </B>(Leyton and Wanstead): I shall be as brief as possible. I strongly support the Government's decision to introduce free television licences for the over-75s. It must be administered in the best possible way. The Bill refers to the provision of relevant social security information, either to the BBC or to its agencies, by the DSS. The amendments, however, require the provision of a person's date of birth and national insurance number, as well as the age and address.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We shall come to that, when we debate amendments Nos. 4 and 5. That information is mentioned in the explanatory notes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> I know that. However, the amendments would put it specifically into the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the selection list shows, I originally intended to call amendments Nos. 1, 4, 5 and 14 to be debated together. However, in view of the comments made by the Opposition Front-Bench Spokesman this morning, it has been decided that we will take amendment No. 1 on its own.

<P>
Therefore, at the moment, we are debating amendment No. 1 only. We will discuss amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 14 as the next group of amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> I shall make my comments at that stage.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I will try to respond to the points that have been raised. We will come to many of them later in our consideration. Amendment No. 1 deals with the Government's method of ensuring that the BBC has access to the relevant information. I shall set out some of the alternative methods that we considered.

<P>
Without the social security information that the Bill will make available to the BBC, every elderly applicant would have to produce documentary proof of their age, which would impose a considerable additional burden. Many applicants do not have such documentation and would therefore have to obtain it before they could apply, which would cause delay, inconvenience and expense. A system involving manual handling of more than 3.5 million documents would also be far more expensive to administer. An alternative proposal, which would require the BBC to seek verification of claims from the DSS and the Northern Ireland Department, would still entail much of the information that members of the Committee are concerned about being disclosed through the verification process. Such an approach would also involve the BBC and Government Departments in a duplication of effort and cost.

<P>
The points raised in this morning's debate are important, and I welcome the opportunity to reassure hon. Members about the control that Parliament will have over the information to be provided to the BBC. Hon. Members referred specifically to the BBC's supervision of the contractors, which is an issue to which we shall return later in our proceedings. That will be set out in a memorandum of understanding between the DSS and the BBC: the DSS will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. The contractors will also be subject to the Data Protection Act 1998, and there must be specific written contractual guarantees, including security measures. The data protection commissioners will investigate breaches and other concerns. I hope that that reassures hon. Members.

<P>
Members of the Committee are understandably concerned to ensure that personal information released by the Government to third parties is properly controlled and supervised. Amendment No. 1 is-perhaps, with the best of intentions-designed to prevent the BBC from indulging in a fishing expedition be requesting information that is not strictly necessary for the administration of free licences for the over-75s. However, the Bill does not give the BBC any right to require information to be supplied. It provides only that the Secretary of State or the Northern Ireland Department ``may'' supply social security information at the BBC's request; they will be under no obligation to do so. The reference to a request from the BBC in subsection (1) relates to the timing and procedure for such transfers, not to the information that can be provided. Any supervision of what is released will be exercised by the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister made an interesting comment earlier, when she said that it would be expensive if the BBC or its contractors had to seek verification on an individual basis. I agree with that, but that was my understanding of the way in which the concession would work. Is the Minister saying that the information that she expects to be provided will be provided more in bulk, along the lines of the database that I have proposed? That is the issue that I wanted to get across in our brief debate on the amendment. I entirely understand the point: we, too, are not thinking about fishing expeditions.

<P>
<B>Janet Anderson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that timely intervention. We expect the information to be passed on in bulk: that is one reason for choosing the mechanism that we have chosen. The alternative route, whereby the DSS would check claims only at the BBC's request, would not be cost effective. The total cost of the concession in the current financial year is estimated to be £368 million, so the arrangements for administering it must be, not only user-friendly, but secure against fraud. The alternative route would not be cost-effective because, instead of using a relatively simple data-matching exercise, the DSS would need to establish its own unit. That has not been fully costed, but we estimate that it would multiply the cost by a factor of 10. It would also cause considerable delay in processing, and we are anxious to ensure that all pensioners entitled to the concession should be able to avail themselves of it from 1 November, which is the date of implementation.

<P>
I hope that that reassures hon. Members. I ask the hon. Member for Ryedale to consider withdrawing the amendment, in view of the assurances that I have given.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This has been an important exchange. I suggested that it would be the most important element in the debate, because of the need to gain a clear understanding from the outset of what the Government intend by way of process. It will be clear from what I said earlier that we believe that the only sensible way of dealing with the issue is to process through a bulk transfer of information, as checking individual verifications would be extremely expensive. Anyone reading the Bill who was not aware of the Government's intention might have reached the same conclusion that I did, which was that there would be constant requests for information about individuals. I am not surprised that the Minister mentioned a rise in the cost by a factor of 10; such measures would be very expensive.

<P>
I am now very content about how the Government intend the information to be transferred. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Further consideration adjourned.-[Mr. Dowd.]
