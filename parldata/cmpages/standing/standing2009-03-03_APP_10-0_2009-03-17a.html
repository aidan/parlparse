<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
46</h4><a name="09031816000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Work
experience for persons over compulsory school
age</div><a name="09031816000634"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="09031816000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
(this day) again proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="09031816000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031816000679"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): As I was
saying before lunch, clause 46 is a classic example of the top-down
prescription so loathed by those who value their professional autonomy.
The clause requires local authorities to encourage the participation in
work experience of those still in education between the ages of 18 and
19.</div><a name="09031816000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I understand the clause correctly, it will force sixth formers studying
A-levels to take time out from their studies and sporting or voluntary
community activities to spend time doing work experience. I should have
thought that whether that is beneficial would be a matter for the
student&#146;s teacher and for the student to assess. Although the
wording is &#147;encourage participation&#148;, such a clause will
come to be seen by schools as compulsory because they will consider
what Ofsted&#146;s response would be to compliance with the
clause.</div><a name="09031816000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
an experience might be valuable for many 16 to 19-year-old students.
However, surely that should be left to the discretion and judgment of
professionals, rather than imposed by the diktat of this small group of
Ministers. It is a one-size-fits-all approach. Is this what the
Government mean by personalised learning? The clause does not seem to
be very
personalised.</div><a name="09031816000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000680"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b> It is good
to be back after a break, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="09031816000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will give local authorities the power to secure the provision of
work experience for young learners over compulsory school leaving age.
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton should read
line
15:</div><a name="09031816000589"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
local education authority in England may secure the provision of work
experience&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not say &#147;must&#148;, there is no prescription, they are
not forced to do it; they may do it. The clause goes on to say that a
local authority in England must &#147;encourage participation&#148;
and &#147;encourage employers&#148;. Again, there is no
prescription.</div><a name="09031816000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is evidence that work experience provides learners with the opportunity
to develop the employability skills that employers want. It helps them
to get into and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>remain in employment and to progress in their working lives. Hence, we
want local authorities to encourage participation. I was pleased to
launch the CBI&#146;s 2007 report &#147;Time well spent&#148;
with Richard Lambert. More than two thirds of 14 to 16-year-old
respondents agreed or strongly agreed that work experience had helped
them to understand how learning at school is important in getting a job
and 80 per cent. agreed that it had given them a good insight into the
world of
work.</div><a name="09031816000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost
all young people participate in work experience in the final two years
of compulsory education. The clause will help to ensure that they can
continue to do so beyond that stage of their education and obtain
further benefits, but it does not require them to do
so.</div><a name="09031816000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000681"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Proposed new section 560A(2) says that a local
authority &#147;must&#148;. That is the prescription that I am
talking
about.</div><a name="09031816000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000682"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I encourage the Committee to support the clause
because it says simply that local authorities must encourage
participation and encourage employers. That is an entirely progressive
thing to
do.</div><a name="09031816000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000685"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is good to be back after a splendid lunch. I had
a glass of champagne. I do not know what you had, Mr. Chope,
but I am sure that the Minister is equally fortified and ready for this
afternoon.</div><a name="09031816000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
accused the Minister for Schools and Learners of being limacine in
respect of the progress towards self-regulation in further education, I
fear I will now be rather slow myself. We are about to deal with a
large group of amendments on an important clause, and there is much to
be said in the interests of improving the legislation and representing
the interests of learners and
others.</div><a name="09031816000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
47 inserts new section 18A into the Education Act 1996. The new section
will affect the local education authorities for England and Wales in
respect of the relevant use of accommodation in their area. Hosting
authorities will be required to secure that</div>
<a name="09031816000596"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enough suitable
education and training is provided to meet the reasonable
needs&#148;</div><a name="09031816000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
children and young people in the youth justice system who are held in
those
establishments.</div><a name="09031816000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
127 to 129 and 132 to 134 probe the reason for provision through local
authorities in new section 18A, questioning why the responsibility
cannot be transferred to the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency. A
theme emerged before lunch, before the hon. Member for Yeovil joined
us, and I feel that it is necessary to acquaint him with that theme so
that he can better do his job here. In essence the theme was about the
Opposition challenging the new involvement of local education
authorities through this legislation and Government resolutely
defending that backwards
step.</div><a name="09031816000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a sense, the group of amendments continues that theme. As I have
argued&#151;I thought pretty persuasively but clearly I did not
persuade Ministers earlier&#151;it seems that by involving more
agencies in the management and funding of skills and training we are
likely to end up with a system that is less cost-effective, more
insensitive, less responsive to need, more bureaucratic and more
opaque. Once again in this part of the Bill, we see that opacity in a
new role for LEAs in dealing with youth detention, which is currently
the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council. We believe that
it would cause the least disruption and have maximum effect if those
young people who are already disengaged are not put through the
upheaval of being passed from and between different local education
authorities.</div><a name="09031816000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bear
in mind that many of the young people will not have had a happy
experience of education earlier in their lives. Often they have been
failed by the system the first time round and deserve better. The Young
People&#146;s Learning Agency would be a better place to deal with
young offenders serving their sentence outside their own local
authority area.</div>
<a name="09031816000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031816000686"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I must confess
that I had a similar reaction when I first thought about the clause,
but does the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>agree that a policy that addresses all the issues of a young
offender&#151;housing and education, for example&#151;is probably
best brought together at local level and in conjunction with the
children&#146;s trust? If we parcel it off to the YPLA, I am a little
concerned that we will not get the other connections
right.</div><a name="09031816000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000687"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That is a good argument. There is indeed a case for
a holistic approach. The difficulties are that some of the matters
concerning young people will not be dealt with by local authorities
anyway, if there are health issues, for example, associated with those
young people&#146;s welfare and circumstances. Clearly there will be
issues involving matters of justice, and they might face other
challenges that are outside the competence of local authorities. It is
clear that the local authorities will have to interface with a wide
variety of agencies in the same way that the Young People&#146;s
Learning Agency would if our amendment were
passed.</div><a name="09031816000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
real problem is that people may be moving between institutions. Indeed,
they may be well outside their own local authority area. There is no
guarantee that they will be in custody in the place where their family
is based, where they have a history and where information about them is
easily accessed. It would be better for the sake of clarity and lack of
complexity and possible bureaucracy to channel the work through one
agency rather than a multiplicity of local
authorities.</div><a name="09031816000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
we welcome a statutory responsibility for the education of those in
detention&#151;one of the points made by the hon. Lady&#151;there
is a big gap in how we deal with the education and training of people
who are detained in that way, particularly so for young people. Indeed,
much of the evidence from independent reports as well as from the
Government&#146;s own analysis suggests that there is a long way to
go to get the education and training of offenders right. We therefore
welcome a new focus on the
subject.</div><a name="09031816000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that the provisions under proposed subsections (1)(a)
and (1)(b) are likely to lead to some confusion and to a lack of a
joined-up approach to the provision to which the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole referred and which Opposition Members want.
We feel in particular that proposed subsection (1)(b)(ii)
and proposed subsection (4) might cause problems due to the transitory
nature of the detention of many of the young people concerned. In
essence, a young person might be the responsibility of one LEA at home,
but another in youth
detention.</div><a name="09031816000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
a movement between LEAs, those in detention could find themselves
passed from pillar to post and subject to the arguments of different
funding authorities. The impact of that would be felt most negatively
in respect of the progression of the young people. Let me support that
argument by referring to what happens in much prison education at the
moment. The Minister might want to comment on what is a significant
problem that is founded on the lack of consistency of provision for
those in custody. People often start one course with one tutor, but are
then moved to a different institution and, unable to complete the
course, the relationship formed between teacher and learner is broken.
There is a lack of follow-through of what people have started so they
have to begin all over again. Thus there is a real lack of consistency
in how we make opportunities available to those in custody, yet we know
that recidivism is linked closely to a lack of skills and education. In
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>sense, the Bill is part of a bigger issue: how we train and educate
those in custody and our mission, which the Government probably share,
of improving that provision, particularly in respect of greater
consistency.</div><a name="09031816000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
movement to LEAs should in the eyes of the Government create the
greater focus that we seek, but that can work only if LEAs are ready
and quick to do the job and there are doubts about that. It is an
important new responsibility for local education authorities and we
want firm assurances that they are indeed tooled up in resources and
skills. Thus far, not much evidence has been brought to that effect. As
the Special Educational Consortium argues, the drafting of the clauses
leaves some questions unanswered regarding the provision for people
with special educational needs who are detained, the prevalence of
which is sadly
significant.</div><a name="09031816000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reports
from the Youth Justice Board found that about 150,000 children and
young people under the age of 18 enter the youth justice system each
year, of which about 70,000 are of compulsory school age. It has been
found that 33 per cent. need help with reading and writing and 15 per
cent. have SEN statements compared with about 3 per cent. of the
general population. Some 83 per cent. of boys in custody have been
excluded from school and 41 per cent. of boys and girls in custody were
aged 14 or younger when they were last in
school.</div><a name="09031816000635"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="09031816000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
young people face multifaceted problems and need to be provided with
opportunities through a more consistent, more coherent package of
measures to deal with both their core skills and their aspirations to
achieve more. I think that Members across the Committee will understand
that unless we do that, we are likely to exacerbate a cycle of
disengagement. It is vital to get the Bill
right.</div><a name="09031816000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interim report of the Bercow review of services for those with speech,
language and communication needs indicates that at least 60 per cent.
of the 11,000 people passing through young offender institutions each
year have difficulties with speech, language and communication. A
recent Department of Health report highlighted that a quarter of
children in contact with youth justice have learning disabilities.
Offenders fall into three main categories: those with learning
disabilities, the wider group with learning difficulties, and the
largest group with some kind of borderline problem. There are few young
people in those circumstances who do not require an entirely fresh
approach to education and training. As I said earlier, they have often
failed the first time
around.</div><a name="09031816000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are three other worries, however, about the clauses, which have been
highlighted by the Prisoners&#146; Education Trust and the Standing
Committee for Youth Justice. First, among all the other funding
priorities that LEAs have, how will the provision for those in
detention centres be ensured? How will we build on the support for
those young people? What priority are LEAs likely to give them? I was a
member of a local authority. You, Mr. Chope, served in a
distinguished fashion in such a capacity and other members of the
Committee may have done so too. How will a local authority respond to
demands on its resources from that quarter, when many of the young
people concerned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>will not necessarily be from its locality&#151;merely residing there
temporarily&#151;and when there are other demands on resources from
schools and other places that are strongly supported by the local
community? We are handing local education authorities a poisoned
chalice, and it would be much better for an agency that did not face
those pressures to have responsibility for this important area. These
young people need second chances to put things right, not inadequate
provision and closed
doors.</div><a name="09031816000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
have the Government considered whether some LEAs will be
disproportionately burdened by youth detention centres in their area?
Clearly, those that have many young people in custody in their locality
will bear a much greater responsibility&#151;in quantitative
terms&#151;than those that do not. How will the Government deal with
that, in terms of funding, resources, support and so on, and how
dynamic is that support likely to be? These are rapidly changing
circumstances. Fortunately, many people who pass through youth custody
are there relatively briefly. I guess that is the nature of youth
custody. How responsive will the system be to change? Will the funding
follow the learner or will it have to come from the same budget as
funding for all other provision? Will the funding be ring-fenced? If
so, how, and how will that work in the context of local authority
finance, which is difficult to understand? I remember that when I was a
member of Nottinghamshire county council I proposed or seconded
amendments to the budget. For a fleeting period I understood local
government finance but then the moment passed and I forgot about it. My
current understanding of it is about as great as that of most Members
of Parliament and most members of local authorities, but the Minister
will have a clearer, more comprehensive and more incisive view about
those things and we look forward to benefiting from her knowledge and
insight.</div><a name="09031816000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
what provision will there be for information sharing and joint
curriculum development, not just across local authorities
but&#151;further to the intervention from the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole&#151;across a variety of agencies? As I
said, although some of the responsibilities of local government are
such that they would be able to provide a semi-holistic
service&#151;it would be honed in some regard&#151;there is no
guarantee that local authorities would be good at accessing information
from other agencies or relevant sources, or indeed passing that
information on. It is not just about gathering information; it is about
how that information is stored, handled and how it would be passed on
as a legacy of knowledge to the people who might be dealing with that
young person as they move through the system. What use is it to the
young person concerned if they move from one LEA to another and that
second authority has little or no information about them and so
attempts to approach them in a different way, offering them a different
educational diet unaware of their progression? That is not fanciful,
given what I said earlier about the record on education, skills and
training of offenders generally, which is at best&#151;at my most
generous&#151;patchy. That was raised, as the Minister will know, by
the Standing Committee on Youth Justice as a distinct worry and should
be addressed to minimise the disruption to those learners who have
often already suffered so much disruption in their
lives.</div>
<a name="09031816000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 92
makes provision for the CEO of the SFA to secure education for those
youth offender institutions accommodating 18 to 20-year-olds, raising
the question 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>as to why 16 to 18-year-olds cannot be dealt with on a national basis,
which may eliminate the vagaries of geographical caprice in their
treatment.</div>
<a name="09031816000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 99
is reasonably self-explanatory in that it aims to ensure that learners
in youth detention receive a minimum of 30 hours per week of education
or training. This ensures that learners have a maximum chance while in
detention to engage in education and successfully as a result gain
skills which enable them to re-engage in employment
and&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000688"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> Has the hon. Gentleman
inadvertently strayed into the next set of amendments? Amendment 99 is
in the next
set.</div><a name="09031816000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000689"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That was a mere aside. In terms of this peroration
that was barely a word. I really only meant helpfully to set the matter
in context for the benefit of the Minister before she gives what I
think will be a scintillating response to these few brief words.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The Minister for Schools and
Learners is intervening from a sedentary position but I will not be
goaded by him, despite the fact that I described him as being sluggish
earlier. He has clearly tried to disprove that by the energy of his
sedentary
intervention.</div><a name="09031816000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
212 aims to ensure that LEAs take account of learning and language
difficulties. I mentioned the Bercow review earlier and the profound
issues around the language skills of many of the young people we are
speaking of in this part of the Bill. Those in detention who may not be
able to speak English as a first language or who suffer speech
impairment may be significantly disadvantaged by this clause. This
amendment should be used to establish guidance on this matter.
Barnardo&#146;s is most concerned about this and seeks the
reassurances that I articulate in these comments and through this
amendment. It is particularly concerned that the duty on LEAs to ensure
education for the group of children with language difficulties includes
a clear requirement to meet the needs of children with statements and
those whose first language is not English. It is also anxious that if
children are detained outside their home local education authority that
the home LEA must co-operate with the LEA where they are placed to
ensure that suitable educational support is provided immediately on
release.</div>
<a name="09031816000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
378 and 379 are probing amendments, once again stimulated by the
Standing Committee for Youth Justice, to clarify how guidance under
these clauses will be applicable to both the host and home local
authorities, to children&#146;s services and youth offending teams as
well as to education services. We also seek assurances that the
guidance will specifically address the issue of information sharing,
sentence planning and curriculum content in the way that I mentioned
earlier.</div>
<a name="09031816000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
amendments will allow the Minister to confirm that guidance will be
applicable not only to LEAs, but to those other agencies in order to
ensure effective joint working between the various arms of the local
authority in this matter. This is necessary, given that new
subsection 18A requires host local authorities to have
regard to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State and new section
562C, inserted by clause 49, does the same for the home authority. This
guidance should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>address a number of issues. This is an important matter and a number of
outside bodies, agencies, representative groups and charities are
particularly concerned about this aspect of the Bill. These matters
deserve airing.</div>
<a name="09031816000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure
that a child is able to fulfil their learning potential it is vital
that information about the young person&#146;s educational needs and
experience is shared between host and home authorities quickly and
readily as a child goes into custody and then again to prepare for
their release. The speed and readiness of the process is what I am
trying to highlight here because, as I said, these can be highly
dynamic circumstances where, without that alacrity, there will be
failures that impact on the young person concerned. It requires schools
and local authorities to have joint working protocols with youth
offending teams and the secure estate.</div>
<a name="09031816000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
particularly important for children with special educational needs, for
some of the reasons I gave earlier. That is certainly the view of the
SEN consortium which suggests that the host authority should meet the
child&#146;s recognised special educational needs where applicable
and be in accordance with part 3 of their statement of special
educational needs. That will be workable only if the information
regarding SEN and the statement itself is made available in a timely
manner. Will the Minister therefore confirm that the issue of
information sharing will be addressed in the guidance and if so,
how?</div><a name="09031816000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence our concerns about these matters are founded on doubts about
existing practice. You will know, Mr. Chope, with your
comprehensive knowledge and profound interest in these things, that the
National Audit Office report in 2004 found that only 6 per cent. of
youth offending teams were able to confirm that young people could
continue education started in custody after release, mainly because of
logistical problems in finding suitable courses, reluctance by some
young people to attend and difficulties in persuading schools to accept
young people who might have previously been excluded. So how will the
guidance associated with the Bill ensure that kind of continuity in
what is offered to young people, both in terms of information sharing
and in placing them in appropriate training or education once they have
been released?</div>
<a name="09031816000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those
few remarks on these important matters, I invite the Minister to
address some of the critical questions that we have raised. We have
discussed these matters at length with some of the bodies that had the
greatest expertise in dealing with young people and the bodies that
also have considerable doubts about the effectiveness of some aspects
of the Bill. We do not for a moment believe that the Government are not
as concerned as we are about these things, but we have real doubts
about whether all the measures have been thought through as fully as
they might have
been.</div><a name="09031816000636"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="09031816000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Annette
Brooke:</b> I will be brief. This is an important clause as it deals
with yet another area that has been long neglected. Although I might
not agree with all the comments made by the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings, I agreed with a great deal of what he said.
This is an occasion where we must get it right.</div>
<a name="09031816000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given
a lot of thought to the balance between the local authority where the
institution is located, and the home authority where the young offender
has some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>residence. I think that the measures in the Bill are right, but it will
be incredibly difficult to implement them well and we must be aware of
that. It has not always been easy for youth offending teams to keep
track of everybody in institutions when they have a lot of people on
their books and are spread out all over the place. In Dorset, for
example, young people can find themselves miles away from home, which
makes it difficult for the youth offending team. That means that there
is a burden of resources on both the home and local authorities, and
both must be resourced adequately to make the provision work. There
must be staff in the home authority with the specific duty to liaise
and ensure that it works.</div>
<a name="09031816000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am entirely
in sympathy with amendment 232. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, one
of the big issues is that for various reasons young people may have
missed out on basic educational skills. The one true way to
rehabilitation and an end to reoffending is to break that cycle.
Addressing special educational needs is really important. In instances
of speech and language difficulties, addressing those needs could mean
that there is the chance to overcome those disabilities. That is an
unusual situation, but it could happen. Come what may, we know that
educational retainment will be low and there is a huge challenge to be
tackled at that level. It is important not to get into a downward
spiral regarding children and young people who, for whatever reason,
have not managed to get a basic level of education up to this
point.</div>
<a name="09031816000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
many opportunities. Many of us will have heard about the
apprenticeships that Transco has provided in various youth
institutions. Those have set up young people and enabled them to move
into a job. If the approach in the Bill can provide opportunities for
apprenticeships, it will make a big contribution to the future. I
support the approach, although there are a lot of ends that need tying
up and we need reassurances. We also need monitoring because the danger
is that a young person could fall between different
authorities.</div>
<a name="09031816000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000690"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> First, I shall speak to
amendments 127 to 131. We have heard from the hon. Member
for South Holland and The Deepings that their intention is to place a
duty on the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency to secure the
provision of education and training in juvenile custody, rather than
see the duty placed on local education authorities, as in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09031816000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the concerns that, as drafted, the duties will mean that LEAs that have
juvenile custodial establishments in their area will need to secure
provision for young people from different local authority areas who are
detained in their establishments. I also sympathise with the concern
that we need to ensure consistency in the approach to education and
training provision across the juvenile secure estate. However, clause
47 is at the heart of our reforms to improve education and training for
young people in juvenile custody and to ensure that education and
training arrangements for that group are aligned as closely as possible
with those in the mainstream sector.</div>
<a name="09031816000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend the
duties on the home and host local authorities to promote continuity and
consistency in provision. That would certainly not happen by giving the
duties to the YPLA because provision should mirror the mainstream as
much as possible. We expect local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>authorities, as the strategic commissioners of children&#146;s
services in the mainstream sector, to be in the best position to secure
education and training to meet young people&#146;s reasonable needs
while they are in juvenile custody. Our proposals to make LEAs
responsible for education and training in juvenile custody will
establish clear accountability for children and young people&#146;s
learning, aligned with the mainstream sector, for children and young
people&#146;s
learning.</div><a name="09031816000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Members for South Holland and The Deepings and for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole expressed concerns about a local authority&#146;s
capacity to deliver. We will be working on a national delivery
framework, which will be developed in partnership with central and
local government, the Youth Justice Agency, the National Offender
Management Service and the Prison Service. We will consult to ensure
that there is a delivery framework and will issue statutory guidance.
The YPLA will play a vital role in supporting LEAs, and the React
programme, established in the LGA with the support of the Association
of Directors of Children&#146;s Services, is working to prepare local
authorities for their new responsibilities.</div>
<a name="09031816000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">A concern was
also expressed that some host local authorities may be
disproportionately burdened because they have a young offenders
institution in their area. However, they will receive specific funding
and resources for this purpose via the YPLA. There were also concerns
about information sharing but, if I may, I will defer my remarks on
that until we get to the proposals on information provided by the home
LEA, particularly, on SEN. They are in new clause 17, which we have not
got to yet.</div>
<a name="09031816000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000691"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Local authority funding seems to be critical. The
Under-Secretary has reassured the Committee that the affected local
authorities will receive extra funding. Will it be ring-fenced? How
will it operate year by year? Clearly there are long-term planning
issues associated with this work, so will the funding be annual or over
an extended period? I also raised a point about dynamism. Circumstances
will change radically according to the number of young people that the
local authority is responsible for and their particular needs, such as
learning difficulties.</div>
<a name="09031816000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000692"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We intend the YPLA to play a pivotal role in
ensuring equitable distribution of funding. The arrangements for
exactly how that will be managed will be developed with the
YPLA.</div>
<a name="09031816000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expect that
another argument for not using the YPLA is that, as hon. Members are
aware, it will cover England only and its jurisdiction is not planned
to be extended to Wales. We have worked closely with the Welsh Assembly
Government to consider the best approach for people in juvenile
custody, and we propose that a consistent approach across England and
Wales, where LEAs take on the function, is the best way forward.
However, in England, the YPLA will have an important role in ensuring
consistency of approach for education and training provision across the
country. The Welsh Ministers will fulfil that function in Wales and
will work with relevant partners to agree and set parameters for
education and training in juvenile
custody.</div><a name="09031816000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, I propose that clause 47, as drafted, provides the best
way to ensure that we align education and training in juvenile custody
with the mainstream 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>sector and to ensure that the needs of those children and young people
are met. I thank the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole for
concurring with the view that this is the best approach.</div>
<a name="09031816000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
132, 133 and 134 relate to clause 49, which places a duty on the child
or young person&#146;s home LEA to promote the fulfilment of that
person&#146;s learning potential while they are in custody and on
their release. We intend for that duty to play an important role in
fostering a consistent education experience for children and young
people in juvenile custody. For the first time, one authority will need
to maintain involvement in the young person&#146;s education,
regardless of where that person is in the system. That will also help
to ensure that young people&#146;s education and training needs are
picked up on their release from juvenile
custody.</div><a name="09031816000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000693"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I am concerned that the home authority will need
additional funding to cope with the responsibilities of tracking and
making sure that the young person is receiving the education. Can the
Minister say something about the resources for the home
authority?</div><a name="09031816000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000694"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am sure that that is something that will
be developed in our framework, particularly with the YPLA having the
overarching responsibility to ensure that there is equitable funding
across the system from the home LEA and the host LEA.</div>
<a name="09031816000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many young
people are held in custodial establishments located in LEA areas that
are different from where they live, so the individually owed duty is an
important mechanism for ensuring that a young person receives a
consistent experience.</div>
<a name="09031816000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sympathise
with hon. Members&#146; intention to place that duty on the YPLA.
That would be particularly applicable if the YPLA were also to be
responsible for securing education and training, as proposed in hon.
Members&#146; previous amendments. However, the YPLA, as a national
agency, would not be in a position to consider the individual needs of
every young person in juvenile custody and would not be the appropriate
authority to be able to, for example, transfer information about the
young person&#146;s prior learning needs, or to take such steps as
securing appropriate educational training places for the young person
on their release from juvenile custody.</div>
<a name="09031816000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that placing that individually-owed duty on children and young
people&#146;s home LEAs will be a huge step forward in terms of
fostering consistency of provision for that group and in encouraging
information exchange about young people&#146;s personal educational
needs.</div><a name="09031816000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000695"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am anxious, as other Committee members might be,
about who will be the owner of the information to which the hon. Lady
refers. This is a complex matter. We are talking about gathering
information from a variety of sources, ensuring that that information
is accurate and then passing it on to a variety of others in order to
ensure not only the coherence, but also the continuity, that we seek.
Are LEAs equipped to do that? What database will they use? Can the
Minister say something about the protocols involved? This is very
challenging and I am not yet convinced that LEAs are equipped, or as I
put it earlier, tooled-up, to do the job.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div><a name="09031816000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000696"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Maybe I have more faith in the ability of
local government than the hon. Gentleman. There is a huge will among
local authorities, particularly with their new responsibilities for the
children&#146;s trusts boards, to make sure that those things happen.
As I said, we will be strengthening provisions as we get on to our two
next sets of amendments, which will give local authorities the power to
enable that information-sharing to
happen.</div><a name="09031816000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the intention of amendment 212 is that the duty to
secure suitable provision for persons in juvenile custody should
specifically require LEAs to have regard to children, or young persons,
with language difficulties when securing suitable provision. However,
that amendment assumes that a person&#146;s language needs are not
already included in the definition of special educational needs or
learning difficulties. As hon. Members might be aware, the definitions
of special educational needs and learning difficulties are set out in
section 312 of the Education Act 1996, and in section 15ZA of that Act,
as inserted by the Bill. Clause 47 should be read alongside
that.</div>
<a name="09031816000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 312
provides that the child has special educational needs if he has a
learning difficulty that calls for special education provision to be
made. It is therefore implicit in the 1996 Act that language needs are
encompassed in the definition of special educational needs. We consider
that clause 47 already provides that host LEAs will need to have regard
to young people&#146;s language needs.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000697"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I apologise for interrupting the Minister again,
but these are really important matters. I did not really follow the
Minister&#146;s last remark. I was the shadow schools Minister when
my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton regarded
that post merely as a distant ambition, among his many objectives, and
I remember serving on a Bill Committee that I suspect was one of those
to which the Minister referred in relation to SEN. One of our concerns
about statements was that they were not necessarily holistic or
comprehensive in taking into account the subtle needs of children. The
young people concerned might be statemented for emotional and
behavioural difficulties, for example, but if they have language
problems, it is not absolutely certain that those problems would be
identified in that EBD
statement.</div>
<a name="09031816000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000698"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Statutory guidance in the SEN code of
practice divides SEN into four categories, including communication and
interaction, which encompasses speech, language and communication
difficulties.</div>
<a name="09031816000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000699"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am grateful for that assurance, which has
educated me, if no one else, but what about the quantification of the
provision needed to meet those challenges, because the critical things
about that guidance are the specificity of the provision to meet
statemented needs and how that provision can be quantified? Perhaps the
Minister will say something on
that.</div><a name="09031816000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000700"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The point I am trying to make is that I do
not think that the requirement on local authorities to have regard to
SEN&#151;I might be corrected by a little note if I am
wrong&#151;refers specifically or only to statemented young people. I
need to clarify one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>further thing: it is implicit in the 1996 Act that those reasons are
other than those relating solely to the fact that a language in which a
person is taught is different to that spoken in the person&#146;s
home, a point to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</div>
<a name="09031816000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
passage of the Education and Skills Act 2008, we committed to work with
the Communication Trust and other relevant organisations to develop
training materials for those with responsibility for the education of
young people in juvenile custody. We published our response to John
Bercow&#146;s review of speech, language and communication needs last
year, which set out a series of initiatives across Government to
improve services for children and young people with speech, language
and communication needs.</div>
<a name="09031816000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
development of an improved awareness of the importance of speech,
language and communication and better support for those with SLCN
across universal, targeted and specialist services will also help young
people in contact with the youth justice system. Our action plan made a
commitment to develop a joint commissioning framework on services for
children with SLCN through up to 20 local area pathfinders. We are
currently selecting those pathfinders, and it is intended that they
will include services for children in contact with the youth justice
system, including those in
custody.</div><a name="09031816000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000701"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I wonder whether I might helpfully intervene while
the Minister seeks further inspiration. What proportion of young people
who are incarcerated or detained at home and who do not have a
statement acquire one thereafter? If a young person who is detained has
profound difficulties that have not been identified earlier in their
school life, it seems critical that we should put in place measures
that allow those difficulties to be analysed and dealt with in an
appropriate way to move them on and improve their chances. Does that
happen, and if not, why
not?</div><a name="09031816000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000702"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Obviously, I do not have that information to
hand, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman on that point. We will
also make clear our expectations for the provision of education and
training and for meeting the SEN of young people in custody through
statutory guidance to local education authorities. That will be
developed in partnership with stakeholders and will be consulted
on.</div>
<a name="09031816000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment 232, to which the hon. Members for South Holland and The
Deepings and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole both referred, I understand
that its intention is to amend the new duty inserted by clause 49,
which is to promote the fulfilment of a person&#146;s learning
potential while they are in custody and on their release, so that it
specifically requires the home authority to have regard to any SEN or
learning difficulties the person might have. However, our view is that
in taking steps to promote a person&#146;s learning potential the
home authority will already need to take account of any SEN or learning
difficulties that person might have. We will also issue statutory
guidance to local authorities, which home local authorities must have
regard to when exercising their duty to promote the fulfilment of the
person&#146;s learning potential while they are in juvenile custody
and upon their release. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>will set out our expectations that, in doing so, the home local
authority should take steps to help to ensure that a person&#146;s
special educational needs and learning difficulties are
met.</div>
<a name="09031816000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000703"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I just wanted to take the Minister back to a comment
that she made earlier, which clarified an earlier comment that she had
made during her remarks that language difficulties were not included in
the other clause that she referred to. If the language difficulty
arises because English is not the person&#146;s mother tongue, and if
she is conceding that point, she is not providing a sufficient argument
against Barnardo&#146;s, whose concern led to our drafting amendment
212. Yes, Barnardo&#146;s is concerned about children with
statements, but it is also concerned about children whose first
language is not English. If she is now saying that the Bill does not
cater for such children, then she has not provided this Committee with
an argument against amendment
212.</div><a name="09031816000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000704"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The Bill is in line with any other Bill
about the responsibility of the local authority, whether or not people
are in the secure establishment. Currently, there is nowhere in the
legislation that requires a local authority to include as a special
educational need the fact that the language in which a person is taught
is different to that spoken in their home. As we all know, that does
not necessarily mean that in other parts of educational establishments
those needs are catered for and I envisage that, in our statutory
guidance, we would include guidance about that too.</div>
<a name="09031816000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank hon.
Members for amendments 378 and 379, which are timely amendments. Before
we introduced the Children&#146;s Act 2004, which brought together
education and children&#146;s social services functions to deliver
the Every Child Matters agenda, the term &#147;local education
authority&#148; was widely used. Since then, those working in this
sector have used the term &#147;local authority&#148; to encompass
everything that they do for children and young people. Our
communications with the sector and stakeholders have reflected that
change.</div>
<a name="09031816000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee will have noticed, the Bill is peppered throughout with the
term &#147;local education authority&#148;. I want to reassure the
Committee that that is not a mistake. The Bill has been drafted in this
way because the order-making power in section 162 of the Education and
Inspections Act 2006 to change the term has not yet been used. I am
pleased to put on record that it is our intention, subject to the will
of this House and the other House, to lay that order at the end of this
parliamentary Session. A copy of the draft order was sent to all
members of the Committee recently and it is also available in the House
Libraries.</div>
<a name="09031816000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given this
information and my assurances, I trust that hon. Members will withdraw
amendments 378 and 379, along with the other amendments that I have
referred to.</div>
<a name="09031816000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000705"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I remain concerned about these matters. I have no
doubt about the good intentions of those involved, which the Minister
described as the &#147;goodwill&#148; associated with these
matters. I have absolutely no reservation about the
&#147;goodwill&#148;, either of Ministers or indeed local
authorities. I am well aware of the sterling work done by councillors
of all political persuasions in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>local authorities up and down Britain. However, I do not think that
bowling local authorities a googly and then saying, &#147;They are
people of immense goodwill&#148;, is quite the way to proceed. This
measure is certainly a googly; there is no question about that. It is
an immensely deceptive area and it is very easy to get this
wrong.</div><a name="09031816000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000706"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that I
certainly did not intend that this measure would go ahead solely on the
&#147;goodwill&#148; of local authorities? Instead, the powers that
we have put in and the framework that we are going to deliver will
enable local authorities to deliver the measure, with their
&#147;goodwill&#148; as well as the powers that we are giving
them.</div>
<a name="09031816000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000707"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The Minister, in responding to the amendments that
I proposed, suggested that her faith in the &#147;goodwill&#148; of
local authorities was greater than mine. Now, I am arguing that my
faith in their &#147;goodwill&#148; is just as great as hers, but
that my doubt about the capacity of local authorities to deliver these
provisions is rather greater than hers, not because of any fault on
their part but because this is an immensely complex area. As I said, it
is deceptive in its complexity, because of the need to draw information
from a variety of agencies and the need to pass that information on
speedily and effectively.</div>
<a name="09031816000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
offered me few assurances about the systems that are in place and
almost nothing about the protocols that I asked for. Just in terms of
the data, this matter is immensely complex. A series of independent
parties have doubts about the effectiveness of databases in respect of
Connexions. That is not an allegation of the Opposition, but an
observation based on evidence. It is no wonder that so many third party
organisations have expressed concerns about this power. Those
organisation have expertise in this field that certainly exceeds mine
and may even exceed the
Minister&#146;s.</div><a name="09031816000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000708"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the
delivery framework we are developing to bring all people together will
develop the very protocols he is talking about? All the parties
involved will be
consulted.</div><a name="09031816000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000709"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Again, I have no doubt about the willingness to
consult. The Bill is a move from the Stalinist, Soviet Russian view of
the world that was embodied in the Learning and Skills Council to
Byzantium. As I said this morning, at least a Soviet approach brings a
certain predictability and consistency. Byzantium was an altogether
different affair and it is made real in these provisions with a
multiplicity of local authorities dealing with some of the most
challenged young people. As a Parliament and as a civilised society, we
have a profound responsibility for those young people. They deserve a
better deal, a fairer chance and greater
opportunity.</div><a name="09031816000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments seek to create a more straightforward system by giving those
responsibilities to a single agency. This is not an open and shut case.
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole is right that something
about local responsiveness is attractive. I mentioned earlier that we
are advocates of local government so you, Mr. Chope, and
Committee members have experience 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>in that regard. As such, we always want local authorities to play an
important role in these matters. However, I am not sure that we should
hand them the competence for this matter when there are real doubts
about their capacity to deal with it, although there are few doubts
about their
willingness.</div><a name="09031816000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have amplified many of the questions that have been put by a series of
third parties. They are of such significance that I am inclined to
divide the Committee on amendment 127 to put them on the record. If
passed, these matters would be passed to the YPLA rather than to local
authorities. That is not because I do not believe in the good will of
local government but because I believe in these young people and their
futures and I want the best for
them.</div><a name="09031816000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000725"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 99, in
clause 47, page 29, line 38, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) In
deciding for the purposes of subsection (1) whether education or
training is enough to meet persons&#146; reasonable needs, a minimum
of 30 hours per week of education and skills training must be
provided.&#146;.</div><a name="09031816000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000726"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 340 to 342, 348 and
349.</div><a name="09031816000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000727"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Most children should be able to decode words
effortlessly by the time they are five or six. Every child, except
those with specific neurological problems, should be a fluent reader by
the time that they are seven. I make absolutely no apology for
labouring those points at every opportunity, because the full scandal
of how we have been teaching children to read in the past 40 years has
yet to be revealed. Statistics for 2007 show that 48 per cent. of
prisoners had a reading age of 11 or less, 65 per cent. had maths
skills below those of an 11-year-old and a staggering 82 per cent. had
handwriting skills at or below those of an average 11-year-old. Reading
those statistics makes one realise the full horror of what happens when
children fail to acquire such basic skills at an early
age.</div><a name="09031816000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
2003 inspectorate of prisons report revealed that 83 per cent. of boys
and 65 per cent. of girls under 18 in custody had been excluded from
school. More than 40 per cent. were 14 or younger when they
had last 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column361" />Column number: 361</div>attended school. I strongly believe that the fact that so many
11-year-olds still struggle with reading when they start secondary
school lies at the root of their disaffection. How do we help those
youngsters in youth custody? The answer must lie in education in the
basic skills and more that lead to a general
education.</div><a name="09031816000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Action
for Children is a voluntary sector provider of children&#146;s
services that shares our concern about the quality of education for
young people in custody. Action for Children
states:</div><a name="09031816000597"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Within
the secure estate, education and training provision is patchy. There is
a commitment of 30 hours per week of education and skills provision,
but figures suggest that the average amount of time spent on education
and training is much
lower.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
99 would therefore insert into clause 47 a provision defining whether
education or training is enough to meet a person&#146;s reasonable
needs by requiring at least 30 hours a week, or six hours a day. Given
the importance of education in today&#146;s competitive modern world
and the poor education suffered by most young people in custody, the
amendment is
essential.</div><a name="09031816000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I was a member of the Education Select Committee, we conducted an
inquiry into prison education. What we saw in our prisons when it came
to education was appalling and contrasted heavily with prison education
abroad. The churn of prisoners meant that education was given a low
priority by prison officers. Education in youth custody is not quite as
bad, but a statutory duty to provide 30 hours a week would focus
priorities in our system. In an important 2002 report, &#147;Reducing
Re-offending by Ex-Prisoners&#148;, the social exclusion unit
concluded that employment reduces the risk of reoffending by between
one third and one half, and that prisoners who did not take part in
education were three times more likely to be re-convicted than those
who did. If we believe that education is vital to help young offenders
back on to the straight and narrow, Ministers should support amendment
99.</div><a name="09031816000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with the Government amendments grouped with amendment 99, as they
seek to ensure that those in youth detention receive the same education
provision as those in mainstream schools. Government
amendment 340 defines the curriculum to be used as either
the national curriculum or a local curriculum and requires learning
providers to use information from the student&#146;s home authority,
but I have a question for the Minister on that amendment. Clause 47(2)
says:</div>
<a name="09031816000598"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
deciding...whether education or training is suitable to meet
persons&#146; reasonable needs, a local education authority
must...have regard
to&#151;</div><a name="09031816000599"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the persons&#146; ages, abilities and
aptitudes;</div><a name="09031816000600"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
any special educational needs&#148;.</div>
<a name="09031816000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment adds to
that three more requirements. The first is the desirability of enabling
persons to complete programmes of study or training that they have
begun. My concern here is about the wording. If when deciding whether
education or training is suitable to meet the person&#146;s
reasonable needs, a local education authority must have regard to the
desirability of enabling persons to complete programmes of study or
training which they have begun, that could be interpreted to mean that
if the young person will be unable to complete a particular course or
training once they leave custody, it will not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>necessary to provide it in custody. I should like some reassurance from
the Minister that that will not happen in
practice.</div><a name="09031816000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000728"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Some very important points have been made by the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. It is vital that we get
this right. I was thinking outside the box as he was speaking because
it strikes me that whether or not they have special educational needs,
each young person needs an individual learning plan under these
circumstances. Needs will vary from individual to individual. It is
difficult to start specifying precisely. I have witnessed voluntary
work in Feltham young offenders institution which was very good. The
programme gave individual attention and was honing basic writing
skills. So each individual young person will have specific needs and
there needs to be a tailored programme. I shall confess my ignorance
here. I do not know whether prison education is inspected. I think it
should be. So I should like to ask the Minister about that. I support
all the sentiments behind this, but I feel we should tailor to the
individual person and have clear points of progress that can be checked
by an independent
inspector.</div><a name="09031816000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031816000729"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): I rise to
support amendment 99 and its requirement that young people in custody
should be entitled to 30 hours per week of education and skills
training. The Minister may be horrified by the cost of delivering that.
As well as cost issues there may be practical issues of being able to
deliver that within youth custody. But as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made clear, the cost to society of
allowing young people whose education has so far been a failure to
continue to be uneducated and thus unable to engage in normal
employment outside, is far
greater.</div><a name="09031816000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore hope that the Minister will take this issue extremely
seriously. I also put to her the proposal that she might look to amend
the Bill so that, given the lamentable educational standard of most
people who enter youth custody, entering youth custody triggers an SEN
assessment. Under the Bill it is not the home authority that will have
to deal with the young person when they leave custody, but the
authority in which the institution sits. It will have to make the
assessment and provide the funding and I fear that without the
long-term commitment that the home authority would have, it may
interpret the Bill to mean looking at any already established special
educational needs of a young person who is in custody. It will
certainly have no economic incentive to make such an assessment and
thus be obliged to allocate additional resources to help that young
person turn their life around. I hope that the Minister will also
comment on that proposal&#151;that entering youth custody would
trigger a formal assessment of special educational
needs.</div><a name="09031816000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031816000730"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000731"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I will start with amendment 99.
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton says that his
intention is to further define in the Bill what is meant by ensuring
that suitable education is provided to meet the reasonable needs of
children and young people in juvenile custody, by specifically
requiring a minimum of 30 hours of education and training per week. I
sympathise with the view that we should include specific requirements
such as the number of hours that should be delivered per person per
week. However, the clause makes it clear that LEAs must, in determining
whether provision is suitable, have regard to the persons&#146; ages,
abilities and aptitudes and any special educational needs or learning
difficulties they might
have.</div><a name="09031816000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand from working in close partnership with our colleagues at the
Youth Justice Board and from wider stakeholders that it is not always
practical, or in fact desirable, for young people to participate in
30 hours of education and training per week. As we can all
appreciate, young people in custody often have complex needs, which
require a range of interventions and support, and we want to ensure
that regimes in custody are able to support those needs. For some, that
might mean receiving at least 30 hours of education a week, but others
might have wider needs. For example, they might need to participate in
drug detoxification and behaviour programmes. We therefore propose to
set out our more detailed expectations for what education and training
should be delivered for children and young people in custody in
guidance, in which we can be clear that provision should be able to be
adapted to meet children and young people&#146;s needs. That was, I
think, the point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole.</div><a name="09031816000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000732"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The Minister makes a case for a more flexible
approach because of the particular needs that the young people might
have, but it would be entirely possible in guidance to speak about a
normal expectation of 30 hours of education or training per week,
excepting for the kind of circumstances she has described. If the
guidance were less robust, doubts would take root about just how much
education and training young people would receive as a
norm.</div><a name="09031816000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000733"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points and when we put our statutory guidance together we will consider
how it could be worded so that the expectations are as I am sure
we  all wish them to be. However, it is not necessary
to  put that requirement in the Bill. Amendment 99 is 
therefore unnecessary and I urge the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw
it.</div><a name="09031816000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000734"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Another argument in favour of the amendment is that
it does not say that a young person has to complete 30 hours of
education. The clause is about a local education authority securing
that enough suitable education is provided to meet the reasonable
needs, which is defined by the amendment as being able to receive 30
hours of education a week. The young person does not need to attend the
education but the LEA needs to ensure that it is provided. It is
important that it is because otherwise the LEA will find a whole
host of excuses not to provide 30 hours of education in
custody.</div>

McCarthy-Fry:</b> I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point but it would be too prescriptive to put that requirement in the
Bill. I prefer to put it in guidance so that we can emphasise the point
about meeting the needs of the individual
learner.</div><a name="09031816000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
340, 341 and 342 would strengthen the clause, while amendments 348 and
349 are technical and consequential. I welcome the support from
Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members for the amendments. Given
that support and in the interests of time, I do not intend to dwell on
their detail. However, I want to put on the record that the assumption
is that it is desirable and that guidance will say that young people
will be able to continue in education or training obviously subject to
the constraints of a custodial
setting.</div><a name="09031816000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000736"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Does the Minister consider that people entering
youth custody should trigger an SEN assessment?</div>
<a name="09031816000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000737"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> No young person under the proposals will
gain a statement while they are in custody because part 4 of the
Education Act 1996, which deals with SEN, is suspended while they are
in custody. There is a specific reason for that. The statementing
process takes a considerable time and most young people are in
custodial settings for relatively short periods. We are proposing to
suspend the statementing process while people are in custody with a
requirement on the home LEAs to pick it up when they return. However,
we have not reached that clause
yet.</div><a name="09031816000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000738"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am disappointed in the Minister&#146;s response,
despite her encouraging opening comment that she was sympathetic with
our view. I visited several youth custody settings and prisons while I
was a member of the Education Committee, when every excuse from churn
to the fact that the prison sentences were not long enough was given by
prison officers as a reason why education was not provided. I am
talking about prisons, not youth custody settings, but in the prisons
that I toured back in 2004, the average amount of education given was
half a day a week compared with full-time education in most prisons
that we visited abroad.</div>
<a name="09031816000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we
specify 30 hours a week under the Bill, I am worried that that level of
education will not be provided. It might be provided for 20 or 15
hours, but it will be nowhere near to six hours a day, which is
essential if we believe that the road to redemption for prisoners is to
ensure that they have a full education to equip them to cope in the
modern world. Even programming the Sky+ box often requires a
sophisticated level of education, let alone finding a job and holding
it
down.</div><a name="09031816000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000739"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am asking the hon. Gentleman to give way
because I am not sure whether I will get an opportunity to explain the
difference. In the adult prison estate, there is no requirement for any
prisoner to participate in education. We are now talking about the
youth offending estate, where the responsibility is currently
undertaken by the Ministry of Justice and which we are transferring to
local authorities. That will be best delivered through statutory
guidance not under the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000740"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but the
ethos that seems to prevail in her custody settings in this country
differs from other countries. Since so much is laid out in legislation
that is of less significance than the issue that we are discussing, the
hon. Lady is wrong not to accept the amendment, which would put into
the Bill that young people in custody should be able to access up to 30
hours a week of education. Given that we regard education important for
young people in custody, I intend to test the Committee&#146;s view
on the
amendment.</div><a name="09031816000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000757"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000758"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am delighted to be called to speak on this
clause, Mr. Chope. No doubt the Minister will want to draw
on her expansive notes to explain the purpose of the amendments and new
clauses.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div><a name="09031816000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to draw
new clause 17 in particular to the attention of the Committee. It will
insert new chapter 5A, entitled &#147;Persons detained in
youth accommodation&#148;, into the Education Act 1996. The new
clause goes a considerable way towards addressing some matters that we
raised earlier today, as the Minister is acknowledging. It answers some
of the questions that I raised on clause 47 and is therefore
welcome. However, I have a number of particular questions that I hope
she will
address.</div><a name="09031816000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 562B(3)(b) is of particular concern to the Standing
Committee for Youth Justice, which highlighted the short period in
which young people are kept in detention and the necessity of planning
their reintegration on the first day of release. Will the Minister give
guidance as to how that is likely to be ensured, given the wording that
she is proposing is,</div>
<a name="09031816000602"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where it
appears to the home authority appropriate for them to do so, making
arrangements for provision, on the person&#146;s release from
detention&#151;(a) of
education&#148;?</div><a name="09031816000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an extraordinarily vague proposal when what is needed is clear
guidance. Where it appears for the home authority to act appropriately
does not assure me that the preparation for the release of the young
person and a reintroduction into society is going to be dealt with the
rigour and certainty that we would expect.</div>
<a name="09031816000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
question relates to proposed new section 562C(3). We welcome
provision for learners with learning difficulties but this again is
quite weakly and, in my judgment, poorly worded. It says
that,</div><a name="09031816000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
host authority must use best endeavours to secure that appropriate
special educational provision is made for the detained
person&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
precisely does the Minister mean by &#147;best endeavours&#148; and
what does she expect the outcome of these best endeavours to be? Will
statemented children with special needs and other children with special
needs get the educational provision they so desperately need? Where and
how will &#147;best endeavours&#148; be more clearly
defined?</div>
<a name="09031816000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
query concerns, in appropriately chronological fashion, proposed new
section 562C(4)(c). This gives the power to the host authority to
assess whether the special educational provision in a statement of a
learner remains appropriate and to take amending steps as necessary.
With no provision for updating the statement in this clause, how will
the authority judge whether the existing statement is appropriate or
accurate or, indeed, inaccurate? Does this not simply mean that local
authorities will judge what is necessary according to what they can
provide? There are real differences between authorities in terms of the
number of statements they issue, the speed with which statements are
dealt and the effectiveness of their provision. It seems the Bill will
enshrine those vagaries in law in an unhelpful way. We need clear
guarantees about how local authorities will behave and what will be
expected of them. I am not sure that the Bill as currently worded does
that.</div>
<a name="09031816000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">My fourth
question concerns proposed new section 562E(1). The SCYJ and
the AOC have both highlighted the need for sharing information to
ensure best provision for those in detention. With this in mind, why
does the clause
say,</div><a name="09031816000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
person who has provided education or training for a detained
person...may provide information relating to the detained person
to&#151;(a) the home authority, or (b) the host
authority.&#148;?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div><a name="09031816000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely, the Bill should
say &#147;must&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;. Is this not
again rather weakly and ineffectively worded? The provider should be
required to share information or the weaknesses of those LEAs who drag
their feet will have a detrimental effect on the interests of learners.
If there remains uncertainty about LEA involvement of the kind that I
highlighted in our discussion about clause 47 and if these Government
proposals are designed to firm up the provision to respond to those
criticisms&#151;and I guess they would not have been tabled if that
was not the intention&#151;then surely they need to be fit for
purpose. I am not sure that they are as
drafted.</div><a name="09031816000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will be pleased to know that this is my final question, Mr.
Chope; the Minister will certainly be pleased. It deals with proposed
new subsections 562G (5) and (6). We welcome the requirement
on a host authority to notify the home authority if it believes that a
child in detention in its area has special needs, but could the host
authority not be given the right to assess those needs, in line with
existing, well established statementing practices? In raising these
questions we want to ensure that the Government&#146;s proposals are
sufficiently rigorous and robust to improve the legislation along the
lines that most third parties and we, the Opposition, feel is
necessary.</div><a name="09031816000640"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09031816000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000759"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As drafted, clause 49 places a duty on the
child or young person&#146;s home local authority to promote the
fulfilment of that person&#146;s learning potential while in custody
and on their release. Amendment 344 removes clause 49, and
new clause 17 replaces it and inserts proposed new chapter 5A into the
Education Act 1996. Through new section 562B, the chapter also places a
duty on the child or young person&#146;s home local authority to
promote the fulfilment of that person&#146;s learning potential while
in custody and on their
release.</div><a name="09031816000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed new chapter also includes a power to regulate to modify
provisions of the 1996 Act in how they apply to persons detained in
juvenile custody. That is necessary where it is inappropriate for
certain provisions of the 1996 Act to apply. For instance, the duty on
parents to cause children of compulsory school age to receive full-time
education should be disapplied while the child is in juvenile
custody.</div><a name="09031816000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new chapter makes further provision for persons detained in relevant
youth accommodation and significantly strengthens the requirements
relating to persons in juvenile custody with special educational needs.
If, prior to detention, a person had a statement of special educational
needs, proposed new section 562C now requires the host LEA to use its
&#147;best endeavours&#148;. The hon. Member for South Holland and
The Deepings asked about that phrase; it reflects the fact that it will
not always be possible to supply the exact provision in the statement
and it is the same as the duty on governing bodies of maintained
schools. We will be issuing guidance on what it
means.</div>
<a name="09031816000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000760"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That is interesting. It highlights the reason why I
raised the matter in the first place. When a statement is issued, as
the Under-Secretary knows, there is an obligation on the authority to
meet the needs identified in that statement by providing adequate
provision. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>Should it be impossible to make that provision within the local
authority&#146;s compass, the local authority must acquire
additional resource from outside its boundaries. Why should that be
different for people who are detained?</div>
<a name="09031816000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000761"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> A statement may require a young person to
attend a particular school or include provision for one day a week at
an FE college. By virtue of the fact that these young people are
detained in a custodial environment, it may not always be possible to
deliver everything in the SEN statement, which is why we have the words
&#147;best
endeavours&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 562C also requires the authority maintaining the statement
to keep a copy of it while the person is detained. New section 562F
provides for the transfer of SEN statements and makes provision to
ensure that the host authority is aware that an authority was
maintaining a statement of special educational needs for a person prior
to detention. An LEA maintaining a statement for a person who then
enters juvenile custody must, on request by the host LEA, send a copy
of the statement to the host authority. The provisions are designed to
ensure that the relevant authority has a copy of the person&#146;s
statement so that it can exercise the duties set out in the new
chapter.</div><a name="09031816000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the person is released, new requirements have been put on the host LEA
to inform the home LEA of the person&#146;s release or, if different,
the LEA that was responsible for maintaining the statement prior to the
person&#146;s detention. The provisions will help to ensure that the
appropriate authorities are aware that the person has been released so
that, where necessary, special educational provision can be made for
the person in the
community.</div><a name="09031816000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000762"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady says that the LEAs will be required
to make information available, but the wording that she proposes says
that they &#147;may&#148; provide information, not that they
&#147;must&#148; or are required to or should. How does she
reconcile what she has just said with what it says in the
amendment?</div><a name="09031816000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000763"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> A statutory duty cannot be imposed without a
means of enforcing it, so it would require criminal sanctions when a
body is not a public body. I will undertake to write to the hon.
Gentleman to clarify that.</div>
<a name="09031816000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section
562A also facilitates the transfer of relevant educational information
relating to the detained person in order to ensure that information
relating to the person&#146;s prior education and particular needs
can be transferred between appropriate persons so that education and
training in juvenile custody can, as far as possible, meet the young
person&#146;s needs and build on their prior
learning.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000764"></a>Mr.

educational information will include? Can she confirm that it will not
include confidential notes of pastoral- type discussions
between the former teacher and the young
person?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div><a name="09031816000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000765"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I envisage that it will be educational
information, but we will clarify that in guidance. We do not envisage
that it will include anything other than educational
information.</div><a name="09031816000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically,
the new clause enables those providing education or training for the
young person prior to or during their detention in juvenile custody to
share educational information about the person with the home and host
LEA, and requires LEAs to comply with any requests for information as
soon as practicable. It also requires Welsh Ministers to provide a copy
of any relevant assessment reports on request by a home or host LEA.
All the provisions will help to ensure that relevant information about
the education of children and young people in custody can be
transferred so that we can achieve the ends that I am sure we all
desire.</div>
<a name="09031816000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000766"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> In respect of new section 562G, there may well be a
difference of approach between the home and the host authority. The
approach that different authorities take to statementing and special
educational needs varies immensely. Why should the host authority not
be given a right to carry out an assessment of needs along the lines
that I propose? I do not understand why that would not be a positive
measure in the interests of the young
person.</div><a name="09031816000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000767"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The practical answer is the length of time
that young people spend in custody, which in many cases is limited. The
time needed for an assessment would be better spent on using the
information that we have and ensuring that they have some education
while they are in custody, which is the point that was being
made.</div>
<a name="09031816000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000768"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> With respect, if the host authority has a
responsibility for the young people and it is uncertain about the
information that is passed to it about their needs and the provision
necessary to cope with those needs, any responsible local authority
would want to assess the young person concerned. It might not be a full
re-statementing, but some kind of assessment, to ensure that it was
living up to its statutory responsibilities in terms of providing
adequate education or training. That would be fundamental. If I were
running a host authority, I would certainly want that to happen, and I
am sure that the Minister would too.</div>
<a name="09031816000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000769"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I do not disagree. I thought that the hon.
Gentleman was referring to a statutory assessment in the statementing
sense. We will certainly develop in our framework guidance something
like the more informal assessment to which he
refers.</div><a name="09031816000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to move Government amendment 351,  a technical
drafting amendment consequent on amendment 344. I would also
like to move Government amendment 352, which relates to the provisions
in new clause 17 requiring local education authorities with relevant
youth accommodation in their area to use their best endeavours to
secure appropriate special educational provision for persons detained
in juvenile custody. Specifically, amendment 352 amends section 207 of
the Education Act 2002 to enable regulations to be made allowing the
host LEA to recoup the cost of making appropriate special educational
provision from the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>authority in whose area the person belongs. That will help to ensure
that the host LEA can meet the special educational need of persons in
custody and recover the costs over and above the core education costs
in
custody.</div><a name="09031816000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to move new clause
19&#151;</div><a name="09031816000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000770"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I must interrupt the hon. Lady for a
moment. Strictly speaking, she will have the opportunity to move the
amendments later, formally. At the moment, she is just speaking to
them.</div><a name="09031816000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000771"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I stand corrected, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="09031816000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 will insert new section 312A into part 4 of the
Education Act 1996. It suspends part 4 of the Act while a person is
detained in relevant youth accommodation, meaning that an LEA
maintaining a statement for a child does not have to continue doing so
while the child is in juvenile custody. In effect, it means that the
duty will be suspended during that time.</div>
<a name="09031816000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
proposed new section 312A and the amendment to it also provide that a
statement of special educational needs maintained before a
child&#146;s detention must be revived and reviewed on their release.
We believe that the amendment provides a significant improvement in
policy for children with SEN in juvenile custody. Currently, children
who have statements of special educational needs on entering custody
have their statements stopped, and they are not necessarily picked up
again on
release.</div><a name="09031816000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that it is essential that education and training in custody
meet the needs of detained children and young people as far as is
practical within the custodial environment, but we are also aware of
the need to consider the practicalities of arranging and delivering
highly specialised and discrete provision for persons in custody, the
majority of whom spend only short periods
there.</div><a name="09031816000256"></a>

Hayes:</b> While the hon. Lady is speaking about the
determination, and the balance between practicalities and what is
desirable, will she say something about the interface with Connexions?
It is critical that when a young person is released, there is good
transmission of information between other authorities and Connexions so
that the young person&#146;s circumstances can be made known and the
options available to them explored through the Connexions service. She
said nothing about that. Will she enlighten the Committee about her
thinking on the
subject?</div><a name="09031816000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000773"></a>Sarah

Connexions back under the wing of the local authority. They have all
the tools at their disposal to achieve
that.</div><a name="09031816000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that Committee members will agree that it is not practical for all
the duties imposed on local education authorities in the Education Acts
to apply to the education and training of persons detained in relevant
youth accommodation, but that our new clauses and related amendments
provide a robust and practical solution to ensure that the special
educational needs of children and young people in juvenile custody can
be supported appropriately. We will also issue guidance to which LEAs
must have regard when exercising their duties. The guidance will set
out our expectations of how LEAs should support the special educational
needs of children and young people in juvenile
custody.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000778"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> New clause 18 inserts new section
39A into the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 to require youth offending
teams in England and Wales to notify a child or young person&#146;s
home and host local education authority when they become aware that
that person has been detained in or transferred or released from
relevant youth accommodation. The new clause replaces clause
50, which is omitted by amendment 345, and extends that clause&#146;s
requirements.</div><a name="09031816000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
50 currently requires youth offending teams to notify the home LEA when
they become aware that a child or young person has become subject to a
detention order and has been detained in relevant youth
accommodation. New clause 18 reinserts that requirement and extends it
to require youth offending teams also to notify the host LEA in the
area in which that person has been detained. The new clause also
requires youth offending teams to notify LEAs as soon as they become
aware that a person has been transferred between juvenile custodial
establishments or is released from relevant youth
accommodation.</div><a name="09031816000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause will ensure that home and host LEAs always know when a child
or young person moves into, within, and out of the juvenile custodial
estate. It will also ensure that they know where the person is
detained, and will help LEAs fulfil their new duties under new chapter
5A of the Education Act 1996. Furthermore, the new clause will help to
ensure that suitable education 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>is arranged for such children and young people while they are detained
in juvenile custody, as well as upon their
release.</div><a name="09031816000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000779"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The new clause ensures that youth offending teams
share and exchange information with host, as well as home, authorities,
which goes some way towards dealing with the concerns that we raised a
few moments ago. As such, that is a step in the right direction, but I
re-emphasise that we are most concerned that the right mechanism be put
in place to exchange information. That would require a considerable
investment in terms of databases, protocols and so on. Given the doubts
that have already been expressed about whether the Connexions database
is fit for the additional purposes for which it is now intended, I
remain unconvinced that systems are in place to ensure that the issue
is appropriately dealt
with.</div><a name="09031816000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000782"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> We now move on to transport following our rather
tortuous discussions on education in youth offending institutions and
so on. Amendment 125 would insert a requirement for consultation in the
Bill. There is a very good reason for that. Most people would agree
that local authority transport plans need to be made&#151;after
proper consultation with colleges and other appropriate
stakeholders&#151;yet the Association of Colleges&#146; 2008 survey
found that that did not happen in 40 per cent. of cases. That is quite
staggering when considering the importance of transport in the
Bill&#146;s proposals. It is therefore very important to make sure
that that really 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>happens. There are a number of general points that I want to make and I
will attach those to my comments on new clause 2.</div>
<a name="09031816000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to make a number of probing points on whether a local authority should
have a duty to provide affordable transport. The Bill proposes
strengthening transport arrangements for 16 to 18-year-old students and
I think that we all applaud that. When publishing their annual
transport policy statement, local authorities will have to set out, in
full, their thinking behind the statement and publish it in good time
so that young people and parents can take account of it when making
decisions about where to study. That is all very important, but at the
moment there is no duty to provide affordable transport that takes into
account the ability of young people to pay. Cost considerations are
from the point of view of the local authority rather than the learner,
and we have been emphasising today how important it is that the learner
should be at the fore.</div>
<a name="09031816000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
inconsistencies in the provision from different local authorities.
Analysis of local authority transport policies in 2006-07 for students
aged 16 to 19 shows that charges can be from between &#163;60 to
&#163;550 per year. Free transport provision is available from some,
but for the most part it is means-tested. The charge can cover
anything&#151;from the student&#146;s contribution to student bus
passes, places on local authority-provided buses, train passes, mileage
allowance, or whatever the local authority has agreed to subsidise.
While I am all in favour of local decision making, we have to determine
that there is equitable provision for our young people across the
country.</div>
<a name="09031816000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the most
part, local authorities will provide only free or subsidised transport
to the nearest or nearest appropriate educational establishment. It is
important to consider the young person who is travelling to undertake a
course that is on offer at a particular institution only, or to a
specialist college, which might be outside the home local authority
boundary. The Government have encouraged colleges, schools and training
providers to specialise and to offer more options, but sometimes young
people need to travel further to access the right course. Choice in
education is what we all wish for, but it can be expensive. However, if
we have skill shortages, then we have to accept that travelling might
be essential. It is important that young people have a genuine choice
about their education and training, and that they should not face
barriers relating to
transport.</div><a name="09031816000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have several specific questions that follow on from that. For example,
colleges have been told by the Learning and Skills Council that they
must no longer use the learner support fund&#151;a fund to help
disadvantaged students access courses&#151;to fund transport. It
would be very useful if the Minister clarified whether colleges can use
that fund and whether the final responsibility to fund student
transport should lie with local authorities.</div>
<a name="09031816000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has to
be concern about transport provision when colleges currently spend an
average of &#163;305,000 per year subsidising student travel. For
example, Kingston Maurwood college in Dorset specialises in agriculture
and many other very good courses. It manages to get a high proportion
of students attending by having a very innovative transport policy that
collects students from across the urban conurbation, as well serving
the rural area. That issue is very unclear in terms of the future of
colleges and needs to be addressed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div><a name="09031816000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
proposes that local authorities publish a transport policy statement
covering travel arrangements for students aged 19 to 25 with a learning
difficulty assessment under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. Does this
mean that, on transport provision, students with learning difficulties
who do not have a relevant assessment will be treated as adults,
despite their additional needs? The purpose of the new clause is to put
a firm responsibility on the local authority to ensure that there is
genuine transport provision, so that all students can access the course
that suits them best&#151;while taking on board any
disproportionality, as we discussed earlier today. I shall be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on
that.</div>
<a name="09031816000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000783"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I want to add some brief comments to this short but
interesting debate. The hon. Lady raises some significant matters, and
I want to emphasise their significance for rural areas. She spoke about
the inconsistency of provision, and it would have the most devastating
effect in those places where people will have to travel furthest to
access the right training and education. In my constituency in
Lincolnshire, for example, there is no FE college; the FE colleges that
serve my constituents are in Boston, Stamford and Peterborough, so
journeys are significant, take time and involve costs.</div>
<a name="09031816000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some important issues about guaranteeing adequate skills training and
education for people in rural communities. Not all rural areas are
immensely privileged, as some might believe. My constituency has an
economic profile that, in a nutshell, could be described as one of high
employment, low skills, relatively low educational attainment and real
deprivation, so it is important that the Minister deal appropriately
and clearly with the hon. Lady&#146;s points; otherwise, doubts will
remain about the opportunities for young people and others in
communities such as those that I represent.</div>
<a name="09031816000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000784"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The clause will give young people a new
voice in the local transport arrangements for those of sixth-form age,
and, by requiring local authorities to consult young people on the
drawing up of their transport policy statements and ensuring that the
statements can be amended in response to complaints, we will strengthen
local accountability in the implementation of the current duty. The
measures should ensure that local authorities are bound to give
adequate consideration to the cost of transport and affordability when
they develop their statement. Local authorities already consult young
people and their parents on a range of children&#146;s services, and
we envisage that they will build on their existing good practice in
consulting young people and their parents about transport
provision.</div>
<a name="09031816000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the
proposed transfer of responsibilities from the Learning and Skills
Council, we intend that the Secretary of State issue guidance under
section 509AB(5) of the Education Act 1996. We will use the
guidance to set out our expectations of local authorities when
consulting young people and examples of good practice. Given that we
will put that in the guidance, we do not feel it necessary to include
amendment 125, so, in the light of that assurance, we ask
the hon. Lady to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="09031816000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">On new clause
2, we share the hon. Lady&#146;s view that access to affordable
transport is integral to helping young people access education and
training. Current 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>legislation strikes a balance between protecting the interests of young
people everywhere and giving local authorities the flexibility to
direct resources to local priorities. I am sure that she will agree
that it is right that local authorities should have the discretion to
determine how to target their funding to meet local needs. The increase
in total Government grant for local services since 1997 will stand at
45 per cent. in real terms by 2010-11. Drawing on that funding, the
current duty already requires local authorities to take into account
the cost of transport in preparing their transport policy statements,
and that should ensure that transport is affordable for young
people.</div><a name="09031816000642"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09031816000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady spoke about colleges and their requirements. While colleges
might wish to provide discretionary financial support for individual
learners facing particular hardship, we do not expect them to fund
transport provision routinely. With regard to young people aged 19 to
24 with learning difficulties, we are strengthening our learning
difficulty assessment guidance to include an explicit reference to
consider a young person&#146;s wider needs, including transport. New
section 508G in the Education Act 1996 will place a duty on
local education authorities to make available in a transport policy
statement information about the travel provision they have to put in
place for young people aged 19 to
24.</div><a name="09031816000287"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000785"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It is exceedingly important to tease out where the
responsibility will be for the college and the local education
authority. Colleges have increasingly been put in a position in which
they have had to top up transport because local authorities are not
funding that. Equally, many in local authorities say that students have
their education maintenance allowance, but I am not convinced that the
EMA is necessarily intended for transport fees. Can we be clear that
local authorities will have adequate
funding?</div><a name="09031816000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000786"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I have made the point that the increase
local authorities have had in their funding has enabled them to fulfil
their transport duties. It is not necessarily intended that the EMA
should be used to fund transport. We do not expect colleges to fund

authority. Given my remarks on amendment 125 and new clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000787"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It is of course welcome that students and their
parents are being consulted, but the fact that colleges are having to
provide transport to overcome the shortcomings means that the
consultation has to be wider and also go to the providers so that they
can have their input in the local authority transport plan if the local
authority is to have ultimate responsibility for this. I ask the
Minister to take that on board. That will have to be clear in the
guidance. I would also like to echo the points made on colleges in
rural areas, as an important issue is that some young people in those
areas cannot access courses. That will be an expensive provision, but
if we truly mean it, it has to be backed by funds and resources. We
cannot tell young people that they can have all these opportunities

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000789"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall be brief on these points. New clause 3
relates to complaints about transport arrangements, and the Minister
has already alluded to the fact that there is a system within the Bill.
We welcome the improved route of appeal for young people of sixth-form
age and their parents on local authority transport arrangements.
However, since local authorities have a duty to provide transport where
necessary for learners with learning difficulties or disabilities up to
the age of 25, we feel that those students should have the
same right of redress. Therefore, I ask the Minister to give that
serious
consideration.</div><a name="09031816000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 suggests that the Secretary of State may intervene. The Bill
seeks to strengthen existing duties on local authorities, but colleges
have genuine concerns that some local authorities have not been
fulfilling their statutory duties to produce appropriate transport
plans. As a backstop, the power to review any arrangements for
transport would ensure that they are effectively planned and, most
importantly, implemented, so that the whole scheme works to the
advantage of our young
people.</div><a name="09031816000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000790"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Clause 53 introduces new arrangements for
sixth-form transport complaints. Local authorities will have a new
power to amend their transport policy statements during the year, to
take account of complaints or in response to direction from the
Secretary of State. An updated statement will be published with a
description of the change, ensuring that young people and their parents
can always access up-to-date information about the transport and
financial assessment arrangements available to them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div><a name="09031816000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sixth-form
transport complaints will need to be considered locally, before being
brought to the attention of the Secretary of State. Complaints
addressed locally can be resolved more quickly and effectively, as that
would take account of local context. Taken together, the measures will
lead to more responsive sixth-form transport policies, as local
authorities will have greater awareness of any problems that learners
face in accessing provision and will have a power to amend their
transport policy statements in response to complaints where
necessary.</div><a name="09031816000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to young people aged 19 to 24 with learning difficulties and
disabilities, the changes in proposed new section 508G in clause 54
take us a step forward by ensuring that they will be given the
information that they need about the transport provision available
to
them.</div><a name="09031816000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to new clause 3, we agree that complaints are usually best
addressed locally, as they can be resolved more quickly and
effectively, but we need to reflect further on the points made by the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. I ask the hon. Lady not to
press it to a vote, because I shall reflect further on
that.</div><a name="09031816000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 4, I am sure that the hon. Lady would agree that we trust
local authorities to manage and review their own transport arrangements
for young people of sixth-form age. When there are complaints about
transport arrangements, the changes made in the Bill will ensure that
there are effective arrangements in place to resolve them. In cases
where a local authority is acting unreasonably in how it is fulfilling
its sixth-form transport duties or has failed to produce a transport
policy statement, the Secretary of State already has the power to
direct a local authority to review its policy or to produce a policy
statement. Therefore, an additional power for the Secretary of State to
direct a local authority to review its statement is
unnecessary.</div><a name="09031816000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measures in clause 53 have an important part to play in ensuring local
accountability in the implementation of the transport duty. I hope that
clause 53 can stand part of the Bill
unamended.</div><a name="09031816000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000791"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for her comments,
particularly as far as new clause 3 is concerned. I look forward to the
results of the further reflection on that point, because it seems as if
something has been left out. I am relieved that there is already a
power, which exists simply as a backstop, because I would be one of the
first to say that we should trust local authorities. However, there
appear to be variations between authorities and it is important that
the power exists. Since I have been reassured on that point, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the two new
clauses.</div><a name="09031816000305"></a>

the Opposition&#146;s

Gibb:</b> I want to speak to amendment 105, which is tabled in
my name and that of my hon. Friends. Clause 57 creates the Young
People&#146;s Learning Agency as part of the range of quangos
replacing the Learning and Skills Council. As the National Union of
Teachers so pithily put
it:</div><a name="09031816000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned about the creation of a plethora of new agencies, with
the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People&#146;s Learning
Agency. We are in danger of exchanging the bureaucracy of the LSC for
two new
agencies.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">And
the rest. As my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)
said,</div>
<a name="09031816000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government&#146;s answer to more bureaucracy is another bureaucratic
reorganisation. They are going to replace the Learning and Skills
Council with the Skills Funding Agency...and a sub-quango, the
National Apprenticeship Service, as well as with another quango, the
Young People&#146;s Learning Agency.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 23 February 2009; Vol. 488, c.

that that reorganisation may lead only to greater bureaucratic
overload.</div><a name="09031816000643"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) described
this as</div>
<a name="09031816000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a good example
of a Government running out of steam and having to reorganise their own
reforms...They inherited the Further Education Funding Council,
which they abolished in 2001 in order to create the Learning and Skills
Council. In 2008, the 47 local learning and skills councils
were abolished and replaced by nine regional bodies and 150 local
partnerships. In 2010, the Learning and Skills Council that this
Government created is to be abolished and replaced by the Skills
Funding Agency, the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency and the
National Apprenticeship Service. This is an example of endless
reorganisation.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 February

the YPLA and the SFA will, I understand, occupy the same premises as
the LSC in Coventry. In fact, the very same people will occupy the very
same premises in Coventry.</div>
<a name="09031816000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LSC
employs 3,300 staff. 1,000 of them will transfer to local authorities,
500 will transfer to the YPLA and 1,800 will transfer to the SFA. In an
evidence session, the Under-Secretary of State for Innovation,
Universities and Skills, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington
(Mr. Simon), in answer to a question put by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings about the
cost implications of this reorganisation,
said:</div><a name="09031816000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
cost is already set out in the impact assessment; we have not memorised
it. It is on the
record.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again
in response to my hon. Friend, he went on to say:</div>
<a name="09031816000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
change is not a cost-saving exercise; that is not why we are making it.
In the immediate term, it will be cost-neutral; in the long term, my
expectation is that the new structures will be more efficient and
cost-effective than the
LSC.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister for Schools and Learners
said:</div><a name="09031816000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
clarity&#146;s sake, the administrative cost of the new system,
including staffing and on-costs, will be met...by the LSC&#146;s
current staffing budget. We expect that to be revenue-neutral, but
there will be some additional transitional costs. Savings will be made
by operating from a smaller estate of office premises...the SFA
will require fewer premises...Sharing will be facilitated by the
fact that the SFA and YPLA head offices will be located together in
Coventry.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
my hon. Friend asked again what the &#147;transitional costs&#148;
would be, he was, alas, referred again to the impact assessment. As the
right hon. Gentleman said in the same evidence
session:</div><a name="09031816000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
is certainly set out in full in the impact assessment. We can obviously
return to that during our
debate.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

429.]</div><a name="09031816000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here we
are, returning to it during our
debate.</div><a name="09031816000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have the impact assessment here. On page 33, under a heading of
&#147;Transition costs&#148;, it
states:</div><a name="09031816000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
on-going costs of the new system will be revenue neutral there are
likely to be transition costs relating to premises and pensions and,
potentially, the transfer of the people from the LSC to their new
employers. There will be assets that can be realised to offset these
costs, such as the premises, though the current economic climate will
make the calculations more complex. Work on calculating these is
on-going and will proceed alongside the development of the designs for
the Young People&#146;s Funding Agency and Skills Funding
Agency.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
YPFA appears to be another quango that we are not aware of, unless
there is a typo in the impact assessment, because I thought that it was
called something else.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000797"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The Young People&#146;s Learning
Agency.</div><a name="09031816000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000798"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> So we now have another agency, or it is a typo in
the impact assessment. However, the key point about this impact
assessment is that, regarding these
costs:</div><a name="09031816000616"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Work
on calculating these is
on-going&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I would have thought that they were set out in full in the impact
assessment, which both the Minister for Schools and Learners and the
Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills
assured us about during the evidence sessions. Therefore, I hope that
the Minister for Schools and Learners will be able either to explain
his comments in the evidence sessions or perhaps he could write to
members of the Committee, setting out what those &#147;Transition
costs&#148; are, which we were assured have been calculated, so that
they can be put on the
record.</div><a name="09031816000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for costs in the long run, the impact assessment
says:</div><a name="09031816000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
expect ongoing costs of operating the new system to be revenue-neutral
compared to the current system in the short term, with savings and
efficiencies through a more integrated service at local authority level
in the medium to long term.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div><a name="09031816000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 105
says:</div><a name="09031816000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
YPLA is not permitted to employ more than 500
people&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the number of LSC employees that will be transferred to the YPLA.
Now, I have just read out the statement from the impact assessment
that</div><a name="09031816000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
expect ongoing costs of operating the new system to be revenue-neutral
in the short
term&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
this prohibition should not be a problem for the Minister. Furthermore,
the impact assessment says that it is expected that there will
be</div><a name="09031816000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;savings
and efficiencies...in the medium to long
term&#148;,</div><a name="09031816000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
500 staff will be more than the YPLA is expected to
employ</div><a name="09031816000621"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the medium to long
term.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would help the Committee if the Minister could set out not only his
estimate of the transition costs but an estimate of the declining costs
that he expects over the medium term, as the efficiencies start to
yield savings. It would help if that was put in terms of staff numbers
as well as money.</div>
<a name="09031816000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fear of
most commentators on the Bill, including the NUT, the Association of
Colleges and my hon. Friend, is that the reorganisation will create
more bureaucracy, more bodies for colleges to deal with, more meetings,
more consultations, more costs and more distractions. This is the
Minister&#146;s opportunity to set out the facts and figures against
which the implementation of the reforms can be judged in the short,
medium and long term. If he cannot provide the numbers, we will
know that the expectations set out in his evidence and in the impact
assessment are nothing more than assertions based on
hope.</div><a name="09031816000349"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031816000799"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): It is a pleasure to join the
debate as we start the scrutiny of part 3. I do not want to detain the
Committee for too long just as we have started to make some swift
progress over recent
clauses.</div><a name="09031816000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will touch on amendment 105, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton has commented on. He raised many important issues that we
aired during the evidence sessions. As the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings said, we will return to many of the issues
raised by amendment 239 under later clauses. However, this
is the obvious time at which to raise the concerns that the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton touched on in relation to amendment
105.</div><a name="09031816000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
105 initially has the appearance of a probing amendment, but it raises
two fundamental issues about many proposals in the Bill, including the
YPLA. First, are the Government&#146;s cost estimates realistic and
serious? Secondly, what is the scale of the YPLA&#146;s role expected
to be and will that change over time? According to the Government, the
academies programme is growing rapidly. That will surely have
implications for costs and staffing at the
YPLA.</div><a name="09031816000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman mentioned, we had an interesting series of exchanges
with the Minister during the evidence session on whether there will be
cost savings from the reorganisation, the abolition of the LSC and the
establishment of the YPLA and other agencies. The Under-Secretary of
State for Innovation, Universities and Skills admitted that there would
not be net savings, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>but that there would be broad neutrality apart from the set-up costs.
Whenever a Minister admits that there will be no cost savings, many
people immediately suspect that the changes could end up costing much
more than the Government
suggest.</div><a name="09031816000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
one exchange in the evidence session, the Under-Secretary of State for
Innovation, Universities and Skills indicated that at the least there
was a lack of clarity over whether the existing savings that are
assumed by the LSC and perhaps by the Department are embedded in the
cost estimates that the Government are proposing in relation to the
Bill. In other words, does the neutrality in the cost of these changes,
including the YPLA, take into account the proposals and measures
already in place to reduce the LSC&#146;s estate and staffing? Those
have been significantly reduced over recent years. I understand that
those changes are expected to continue over the next couple of years,
not just in the rather unclear period after the existing spending
review, but between now and the end of the existing spending review in
2011.</div><a name="09031816000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000800"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s interesting remarks
follow from the discussion of these matters in the evidence session.
The implication is that the savings might be counted twice: once in the
Learning and Skills Council&#146;s estimates, and again by Ministers,
who want to emphasise just how reasonable the changes are. Surely the
Minister would not be responsible for such double
counting.</div><a name="09031816000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000801"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am reassured that not only has the hon. Gentleman
spotted the point, but that he is clear that this Minister would not
tolerate such double counting. I hope that the Minister will assure us
in a moment that his partner Department is engaged in no such double
counting. Both hon. Members to whom I have just referred will know that
there are serious concerns about whether the
Government&#146;s cost estimates are realistic, and whether
the additional agencies that are being established with their regional
presence will involve an additional cost that the Government
are masking by trying to bank the savings that are already in place
from scaling down the LSC and setting them off against the additional
costs that will arise from the
changes.</div><a name="09031816000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know from the notes that the Government have circulated that they
anticipate additional costs when, for example, the YPLA is set up and
some of the responsibilities of academies are transferred from the
Department to the YPLA. Indeed, in the notes on the transfer of
academies under the section on finance and staff, the Government
acknowledge that moving the finance team to separate locations will
lead to loss of economies of scale. There is a further acknowledgment
towards the end of the notes on this section that the regional presence
of the YPLA&#151;for example, in the oversight of
academies&#151;will involve an additional cost, which is estimated at
&#163;670,000 specifically for this narrow area of the YPLA&#146;s
remit. I hope that the Minister will give us a cast-iron assurance that
there is no double counting, and that the Government&#146;s estimate
of net neutrality in the cost of the changes in the Bill does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>already count the reductions in the number of staff and the size of the
estate, which would have taken place from 2009 to 2011
anyway.</div>
<a name="09031816000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also hope
that the Minister will tell us whether he can provide reassurance about
the future scale of the agency. Amendment 105 not only seeks to
constrain the up-front costs of establishing the YPLA and the other
machinery of Government changes, but it presumably also intends to cap
the size of YPLA&#146;s staffing for the foreseeable future. Does
that sit happily alongside the Government&#146;s future role for the
YPLA, which we will discuss on some of the later clauses? In
particular, is it consistent with the Government&#146;s plans to
increase the scale of the academy programme, which will apparently
involve more staffing for the YPLA, and presumably more than would have
been the case if the functions  had remained within the
Department, for the reasons relating to the higher regional costs that
are set out in the Government&#146;s assessment of the cost changes?
Amendment 105 is useful, and I hope that it will flush out
some interesting data and comments from the
Minister.</div><a name="09031816000358"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000802"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> As we have heard, amendment 239 would make the
Young People&#146;s Learning Agency part of the Skills Funding
Agency, effectively recreating the Learning and Skills Council. Going
down that road would confuse the distinct roles of the two bodies and
dilute their focus and effectiveness. The focus of the Skills Funding
Agency will be completely different from that of the YPLA, because it
is an adult learning agency, and will have a clear brief in that
regard. It will allocate funds to colleges and providers according to
the purchasing decisions of employers and individuals through Train to
Gain and skills accounts. Learning choices will reflect the specific
circumstances and skills needed by the employer and individual
concerned within a wider framework of national skills priorities.
Crucially, colleges&#151;I have heard the concern expressed about
bureaucracy and/or the confusion for colleges&#151;will have a single
account, which will reduce the conversations and commissioning that
they currently have to undergo with the Learning and Skills
Council.</div><a name="09031816000644"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="09031816000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
approach to adult skills does not fit with the arrangements needed for
young people. Setting up the YPLA as part of the Skills Funding Agency
would not deliver the transformation in services that we want for
either group. Colleges will have a single conversation with local
authorities, so what are at present multiple conversations with the
Learning And Skills Council will be replaced by two conversations: one
with the SFA and the other with local authorities. The hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton worried that we were adding quangos. He
will correct me if I am wrong, but his party&#146;s policy in respect
of academies and expansion, with the example of the Swedish model,
would involve the establishment of new schools with a new licensing
authority, which would have to be set up. It sounds as if it would
perform fairly similar functions to the academy functions performed by
the YPLA. I do not really understand why he makes that criticism when
it is his own party
policy.</div><a name="09031816000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
YPLA will support local authorities in fulfilling their new duties to
secure enough suitable learning places for all 16 to 19-year-olds in
their area and ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>that the &#163;7 billion budget that is being transferred is properly
managed. It is an enabling body. It will provide funding for local
authority provision of 16-to-19 learning, ensuring national budgetary
control and making sure that plans are consistent with the concept of
the 14-to-19 entitlement. It will consult on and provide a national
commissioning framework. We are planning next month or soon after to
publish the first framework for consultation that will help local
authorities&#146; commission provision. It will provide data on
participation, attainment and economic progression in local,
sub-regional and regional areas, preventing the need for that to be
done repeatedly at local
level.</div><a name="09031816000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need funding and administrative frameworks that are suitable for the
circumstances of the two distinct sectors while ensuring co-ordination
and progression between them, and setting out the YPLA and the Skills
Funding Agency as separate organisations achieves that. It is
fundamental to the fulfilment of what we set out in the Education and
Skills Act 2008 about raising the participation age that we should have
local authorities for ages 0 to 19, or up to 25 for those with learning
difficulties, commissioning decisions supported by the YPLA, separate
from the SFA as an Executive agency of the Department for Innovation,
Universities and
Skills.</div><a name="09031816000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
105 seeks to limit the number staff at the YPLA. I accept that at one
level, it is a device to ask a series of important questions, and I
will seek to address them as best I can. As a non-departmental public
body carrying out these functions, it is appropriate that the YPLA has
the flexibility to allocate administrative resources as its board
determines appropriate. The pay, terms and conditions for that body
will be accounted for to the Secretary of State and hence to
Parliament. Its funding will be accounted for in the
Department&#146;s expenditure plans. The YPLA, like other NDPBs, will
be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor
General.</div><a name="09031816000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect about 500 staff to transfer from the LSC to the YPLA to perform
the LSC functions, as part of our strategy to ensure that the expertise
in the LSC is retained for the benefit of 16-to-19 education and
training. As the hon. Member for Yeovil said, we would also have to
transfer some staff from the Department to perform the academies
functions, and they are currently required to administer the number of
open academies that we have at the moment. That number is set to
increase dramatically, as we set out at the last departmental questions
in the House. We have agreed more than 100 new academies in the past 18
months, many of which will open in September. We will seek to ensure
that if the YPLA needs to grow staff, as an efficient organisation it
does so on a basis proportionate to need. On those grounds, I do not
think that it is appropriate to enshrine this or any other number of
staff in primary legislation. That aspect of the functions of the YPLA
is set to change and a cap on staff numbers would not allow the YPLA
and its board the flexibility to manage its staffing in a responsive
and appropriate manner.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000803"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> When the estates of the National Apprenticeship
Service, the YPLA and the SFA are combined, according to the Minister,
the new estate is likely to be smaller. He spoke in the evidence
session on 10 March about operating from a smaller estate, so
collectively will those bodies employ fewer people than the LSC does
now?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div><a name="09031816000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000804"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Across the numbers of those transferring to the
local authorities, the SFA and the YPLA, I do not expect a reduction in
the head count. I expect it to be neutral. There may be some small
variation on the margins, but we are currently agreeing with staff that
there will be no compulsory redundancies, and attached to that is the
notion that, consistent with cost neutrality, staff will transfer. As I
said, we do not want to lose their
expertise.</div><a name="09031816000366"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000807"></a>Jim

raised in the initial debate, but I shall give way, first, to the hon.
Member for Beverley and
Holderness.</div><a name="09031816000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000808"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am extremely grateful to the Minister. Would he
confirm that the quantum of people employed by the SFA and the YPLA
will be less than the number currently employed by the
LSC?</div><a name="09031816000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000809"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I would certainly think so, given that a number of
staff will be transferring to local
authorities.</div><a name="09031816000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000810"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his patience and
for the comments that he has made about what he expects to be a neutral
staffing position. Just so that there is no doubt about this, because
such organisations sometimes tend to grow rapidly if left uncontrolled,
how will he ensure that there is not a big increase, and is he
confident that a year or so after the bodies have been established we
will not find that staff numbers have gone up by 10 or 15 per
cent.?</div><a name="09031816000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000811"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I shall come on to that when I address the
questions that have been raised about the impact assessment and my
evidence.</div><a name="09031816000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
assist the Committee, in broad-brush terms, the LSC currently employs
some 3,300 staff. We expect about 1,800 to transfer to the SFA and
about 500 to transfer to the YPLA, leaving about 1,000 to
transfer  to local authorities. That is a substantial
difference, to return to the question asked by the hon. Member for
Beverley and
Holderness.</div><a name="09031816000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000812"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those figures.
They cover the number of people who will be transferred to the new
agencies but do not specifically cover any plan to hire additional
people on top of that. For the elimination of doubt, I thought that I
would provide him with an opportunity to put our minds at rest on the
matter.</div><a name="09031816000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000813"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I do not anticipate that the organisations will
take on significant numbers of staff beyond those who transfer. Many of
the details on staff transfers are being worked through and negotiated
at present. There may be some staff who choose not to transfer, whose
function may need to be replaced. I cannot put a straitjacket on the
bodies. It is important that they perform their function, but it is
equally important that they perform them within a restricted cost
envelope.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div><a name="09031816000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">On what is
said in the impact assessment and what I said in evidence, it is fair
to say that the impact assessment reflects in full where we were at the
time that it was written. The picture is ever-changing as we refine
costs and get closer to implementation. I commit myself to update the
Committee in writing on where we are as the figures are refined,
because it is important that it have more clarity about them. When the
Bill completes its passage through the Commons and goes to the Lords,
assuming that it does, there will be a refreshed impact assessment in
which I would want to see much more detail in this regard. If I gave
the impression in my evidence to the Committee that there was fuller
information in the impact assessment than there is, I regret
it.</div><a name="09031816000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000814"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> In that spirit of openness, will the Minister or the
Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills undertake to provide
the Committee with a note on the Government machinery costs of the new
arrangement, compared with the costs of the old arrangement, not only
for 2008-09 but projected to 2009-10, and 2010-11 to the end of the
spending review? We can then compare what would have happened if the
Learning and Skills Council had continued with the cost estimates under
the new
arrangements.</div><a name="09031816000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000815"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I want to be as helpful as I can to the Committee,
and I will set out something as close to what the hon. Gentleman asked
for as I am able. The Committee will understand that since the impact
assessment was published, we have been working on issues of staff
pensions and the movement of staff to the three bodies, and there is
still some negotiation going on. However, I can assure the Committee
that the measure will be
cost-neutral.</div><a name="09031816000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within
the comprehensive spending review period, there are limitations on the
size of the budget to be spent for this, and every part of Government
will have to make efficiency savings as per the announcements in the
pre-Budget report. Furthermore, the Department&#146;s accounting
rules and the Treasury rules on efficiency savings are being followed
and scrutinised externally by the National Audit Office, which puts
constraints on us to deliver our promise that the measure will be
cost-neutral, as our fulfilment of that promise will be scrutinised. I
can assure the Committee that there will be no double-counting, as
described by the hon. Member for Yeovil. The measure will be genuinely
revenue-neutral. I hope that on the basis of those assurances&#151;to
some extent promises&#151;the hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings will not press the
amendments.</div><a name="09031816000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000816"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I find that response unsatisfactory. The
Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills
said:</div><a name="09031816000622"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
cost is already set out in the impact assessment; we have not memorised
it. It is on the record&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, </i>10 March 2009; c. 179,

the Minister for Schools and Learners
said:</div><a name="09031816000623"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;That
is certainly set out in full in the impact assessment. We can obviously
return to that during our
debate.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>10 March 2009; c. 180, Q429.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div><a name="09031816000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact assessment is
full of statements that the figures were too complicated to calculate,
so the assumption is that the cost is nil. That is an unsatisfactory
way to produce an impact assessment. When the House implemented
arrangements for impact assessments, their purpose was not to become an
obfuscation document that considers things too hard to
calculate.</div><a name="09031816000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about replacing one quango with three, and the Committee
deserves to know the best estimate of the costs arising from that
transfer, the long-term or medium-term costs of staff transfer, as well
as the transition costs. I do not believe that those transition costs
do not reside somewhere in one of the two Departments. If they do, the
Minister should promise today to write to members of the Committee so
that we can return to the issue on Report. If the figures do not reside
in either Department, something incompetent is going on in the
administration of the transition. To transfer 3,300 people to the two
bodies and to 150 local authorities and have no idea of the removal
costs, the pension arrangements, or the compensation needed for moving
people around the country is negligent Government administration. I
hope that the Minister will provide us with those figures. He assured
us that they existed when he gave evidence. That is the only way out
for the Minister in dealing with the inaccurate evidence he gave in the
fifth sitting of the
Bill.</div><a name="09031816000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000817"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for
putting the case on amendment 105 so clearly. He spoke in his final
remarks like the accountant that he is. He wants detail. He wants
things to be specific, and he is right to do so. He speaks for the
people of Britain and expects taxpayers to be assured about these
matters. We know that when this kind of Government reorganisation
happens&#151;and they have happened primarily under this
Government&#151;costs escalate and things get out of control. They
swell and mushroom. There is no better example of that than the
Learning and Skills Council, which grew as it took on additional
responsibilities and additional people, becoming ever more bureaucratic
and finding new functions for itself as it interfered in the work of
further education colleges and extended its scope  and range. I
suspect that the new organisations will do the
same.</div><a name="09031816000645"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="09031816000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can say one thing with certainty. The new system will not be
streamlined. It is a not a slimmed-down new structure. Indeed, the
Minister has finally acknowledged that it will not be any smaller. He
said that there will be no compulsory redundancies, but what he
probably meant to say is that there will be no redundancies at all, or
at least no reduction in staff numbers. I suggest that staff numbers
will grow. Although my hon. Friend spoke in firm&#151;I will not say
&#147;lurid&#148;&#151;terms about the matter, I acknowledge the
Minister&#146;s humility in accepting that he may have got it wrong
in the witness session. He said that he regretted giving the wrong
impression. At least he is not like Edith Piaf: he does have regrets,
and humility too. As Chesterton told us, &#147;humility is the mother
of giants&#148;, for one sees much more from the valley than from the
mountain top.</div>
<a name="09031816000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now need
the Minister, having regretted what he said originally, to regret what
he has failed to say today and provide the Committee with more
information at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>the earliest opportunity. That would be a fitting and appropriate way to
resolve the differences between us. We do not like to disagree; we like
to progress with equanimity and good will. I am sure that that good
will might be re-established if we receive more detail. It is
inconceivable that the detail does not exist in the Department. No
responsible Minister would fail to model the costs. No responsible
Government would fail to say to their officials, &#147;We want some
estimate of what is likely to happen as a result of these significant
changes.&#148; The figures must exist. The modelling must be
available. It should be made openly available to members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09031816000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the witness session, I pressed the Minister hard for precisely those
reasons. I am grateful for the support, both then and today, of the
hon. Member for Yeovil and my hon. Friend, who as ever brought his
remarkable diligence to these affairs. I hope that we can move on and
that the Minister, even at this late stage, will commit to do as my
hon. Friend asked and write to the Committee about amendment
105.</div><a name="09031816000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
239 is pertinent to this discussion. I mentioned at the outset that it
was a probing amendment, but nevertheless, our mission in moving
it&#151;it has been our mission throughout our considerations and
will ever be thus&#151;is to try to make the changes as
cost-effective as possible. We want a simpler, less complicated, more
responsive, streamlined structure, but my goodness, that is not what
the Bill gives us. It gives us ever more cost, ever more complication
and an increased likelihood of contradiction and incoherence. It is not
just more costly; it will not work, and that is even worse, because it
is young people&#146;s futures that we are dealing with, and with
which the Minister is
toying.</div><a name="09031816000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis that the amendment was a probing amendment, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment. I hope that the Minister will do
better in future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000820"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Amendment 319 changes the requirements for the
appointment of members of the YPLA, other than the chief executive,
with the effect that such members will always be appointed by the
Secretary of State, and amendments 320 and 321 are consequential to
that change. Amendments 330 and 331 provide that the chief executive
will be an employee of the YPLA, and amendment 332 provides for the
YPLA to determine the conditions of service of members of staff, other
than the chief executive, with the Secretary of State&#146;s
approval. Those changes are largely technical in nature, will ensure a
strong line of accountability for the role, tenure and responsibility
of the board members and the chief executive, and will achieve greater
consistency with similar provisions in the Bill relating to the
Qualifications and Curriculum Development
Agency.</div><a name="09031816000396"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000821"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Did the Minister say that the amendments were just
technical? Surely, some of them will have quite a serious
impact.</div><a name="09031816000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000822"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I said that they are largely technical in nature,
but also that they ensure a strong line of accountability. They are
important, otherwise we would not make them, but they are sufficiently
technical to allow me to be brief.</div>
<a name="09031816000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, I shall say a little more about amendment 121, tabled by the hon.
Gentleman. I think that I understand the intention behind the
amendment, but provision has been made for the matter that it deals
with elsewhere in the Bill. In the White Paper, we made the commitment
that the YPLA will be a sector-led body, the governance of which will
include representatives of key delivery partners. Paragraph 2(5) of
schedule 3
states:</div><a name="09031816000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
appointing a person as a member, the Secretary of State or the YPLA
must have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has
experience relevant to any of the YPLA&#146;s
functions.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would include representations from further education and sixth-form
colleges, and other relevant organisations, such as local authorities
and academies, in respect of the various functions that the YPLA will
perform. As the board will have between five and 15 members, there is
ample flexibility to ensure that key partners have a place at the
table. However, our priority must be to ensure that we have the right
calibre of board members, not to set quotas from particular
sectors.</div>
<a name="09031816000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000823"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Hopefully my question will enable me to shorten my
speech later. Will the Minister clarify his comments in which he
appeared to indicate that there would be a place on the board for
individuals representing the different sectors, academies, colleges and
so forth? How much of an undertaking was that? Towards the end of his
comments, he appeared to veer away from that, towards an indication
that it would simply be based on an assessment of ability, and that
therefore there might not necessarily be representatives of each sector
on the
board.</div><a name="09031816000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000824"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> As ever, with board appointments, it is important
to ensure that the board has the skills necessary to do its job. First
and foremost, it is responsible for making appointments. Above and
beyond the skills and competences required to be a board member, we
have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>signalled, through paragraph 2(5), that we want to ensure that the board
is broadly representative of the bodies relevant to the
organisation&#146;s functions. On that basis, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s speech will be short and that he will not press his
amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="09031816000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000825"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments on
amendment 121. I shall not labour my point too heavily, because I hope
that he and those involved in selecting the YPLA board will think it
obvious that somebody from the sector highlighted in the amendment
should be represented. However, I hope that, in his final comments, he
will be a little warmer, cheerier and more positive about ensuring that
further education and sixth-form colleges are represented on the board.
Although I appreciate that it is important that individuals selected
for the board have the ability to &#147;do the job&#148;, as the
Minister put it, it is difficult to believe that it would not be
possible to select somebody from those sectors with exactly those
skills and abilities.</div>
<a name="09031816000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will know that the colleges sector is concerned to ensure that it is
represented properly on this body, and that its interests and
legitimate concerns are taken into account as the machinery of
Government changes takes place. Although the Minister commented on the
current drafting of the schedule regarding the composition of the
board, the undertakings were rather general and did not offer the type
of assurance that I am looking for.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I wonder whether that noise comes
from the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings.</div>
<a name="09031816000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn from
amendment 121 and the background bleeping to make some comments on
Government amendment 319, if that is in order. I thought that the
Minister said that the amendments in this group were somewhat
technical. Perhaps he could confirm that. In my vocabulary,
&#147;technical&#148; normally refers to fairly minor provisions
that Opposition Members do not need to pay much attention to. However,
the amendments in this group seem slightly more fundamental.</div>
<a name="09031816000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless I have
misunderstood it, amendment 319 appears to represent a significant
change from what is currently in schedule 3, lines 10 to 12 on page
155. It seems to give enhanced powers to the Secretary of State
regarding the appointment of future members and chief executives of the
board. There must be a reason why the Government have made that type of
proposal, which appears to tighten the grip of the Secretary of State
on the board of the YPLA. I am willing to hear the arguments for that
tighter grip before making a judgment about whether it is justified,
but it would be useful to hear something about why the Government have
changed their mind since the original drafting of the Bill, and why
they have decided to give themselves increased powers in respect of
amendment 319 and the others in the group.</div>
<a name="09031816000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000826"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
assiduous scrutiny. On his last point about the powers of the Secretary
of State, the Government amendment will ensure that all members of the
YPLA board, not just the first chief executive, are appointed by the
Secretary of State. It is a necessary amendment required as a result of
advice from the Cabinet Office 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>that appointments should be made by the Secretary of State. That is so
that the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments can
regulate it. It also ensures consistency with the membership provisions
for the QCDA elsewhere in the Bill, and essentially ensures proper
regulation of the appointments through that
route.</div>
<a name="09031816000407"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000827"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the Minister saying that it would not be possible
for the Government to implement what was originally in the schedule
because of the rules and regulations? Without labouring the point,
although this is described as technical, it is an important change.
Under the original provisions in the Bill, future chief executives and
ordinary members could potentially be selected by the YPLA on terms
determined by it with the approval of the Secretary of State. Now that
will not be possible. I seek clarification on that
point.</div>
<a name="09031816000408"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000828"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. There is a Division in the House. It is
obvious that the Committee wishes to carry on its deliberations. I
propose that we suspend the sitting until 8
pm.</div>
<a name="09031816000646"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="09031816000409"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Sitting

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000829"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I think I was bringing my comments on the amendment
to a close and inviting the Minister to give further reassurance on the
representation of further education colleges and sixth-form colleges on
the YPLA board. I invited him to acknowledge that there will be more
than enough people in that sector who have what he described as the
ability to do the job. I also invited him to say more about why
amendment 319 and the related amendments had to be tabled by the
Government. Was it a requirement that the Bill team and the Minister
stumbled upon or does it represent a more fundamental reassessment of
how much of a vice-like grip the Minister and the Secretary of State
want to exercise on the independence of the
YPLA?</div><a name="09031816000412"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000830"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am grateful for that reminder of the invitations
the hon. Gentleman issued prior to dinner. On membership, I cannot
conceive that it would be possible for the board to do its job properly
if it did not have proper representation from the FE sector, academies
and the other sectors that it is concerned with. I hope that that is
sufficient
reassurance.</div><a name="09031816000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have reminded myself of the reasons we decided to make the board
members Secretary of State appointments in amendment 319 over the tort
and bolognaise I enjoyed for dinner. This is the
South-Holland-and-The-Deepings moment when I inform the Committee of my
consumption. We made the change to get the right balance of autonomy
and accountability. We want to ensure that the Secretary of State has
confidence in the figures who will be accountable for &#163;7 billion
of public money. Crucially, only Secretary of State appointments are
regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>It is important that that regulation is in place to assure the public
that the appointments are above board and beyond
suspicion.</div><a name="09031816000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000831"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the Minister saying that we cannot trust members
of the YPLA board to appoint members and chief executives? That appears
to be the implication. As it stands, is the Bill consistent with the
way in which any other bodies that are overseen by his Department
appoint their ordinary members and senior
officers?</div><a name="09031816000415"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000832"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I would trust the board in the same way that I
would trust Ministers to make the right appointments in a way that is
beyond suspicion. However, we established the Office of the
Commissioner for Public Appointments to ensure that the process is
beyond doubt for the public. It is right that the appointments to a
body that is responsible for &#163;7 billion of public money have
that level of public scrutiny. On that basis, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will not press amendment
121.</div><a name="09031816000416"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000833"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for both replies. I am
very pleased with his response on amendment 121. I will
chalk that up as a triumph and an important concession that I hope will
be reflected in future
boards.</div><a name="09031816000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not as convinced by the explanation of the Government amendments.
Rather than being technical amendments, it seems that they would put
back into the hands of Ministers the power to determine all the board
members for the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency rather than
allowing the YPLA itself to select those individuals in the future.
There seems to have been something of a change of heart and mind by
Ministers on the matter, which as far as I can establish goes beyond
what is absolutely
necessary.</div><a name="09031816000418"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000834"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not consider that there
comes a point at which Ministers who are accountable to the public for
delivering a quality of service need to have the powers to deliver what
they promised in their
manifesto?</div><a name="09031816000419"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000835"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but there is no
reason why there could not be provision under schedule 3 for there to
be intervention when the individuals were acting in an improper way or
were not consistent with the Government&#146;s policy. Indeed, under
schedule 3 the terms of the appointments have to meet with the approval
of the Secretary of State. I regret that the Government have gone back

We have had dinner, as the Minister reminded us, but there is time to
squeeze in at least one more occasion to wine and dine. With that
ambition in mind, I shall try to speak to the amendments as a
whole.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div><a name="09031816000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments

witnesses in the evidence sessions of the Committee pointed out that
the transition was likely to be long, arduous and costly, and that the
resulting structure might not be fit for purpose in any case. The
amendment proposes a more streamlined structure, in which the SFA
oversees the work of the YPLA, delivering a more coherent line of
responsibility and accountability, and easier translation of funding
goals. The weakness of the proposed system is that it has three
delivery agencies where just one would do. The amendment seeks to do
the best that it can to tie the agencies together in terms of their
performance and accountability, in an attempt to minimise the impact of
the proposed organisational changes and, instead, concentrate on what
is good about the existing
system.</div><a name="09031816000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000854"></a>Mr.

that I should speak to it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>even though the Minister is looking slightly distressed at my
intervention, perhaps anticipating a second dinner or even a supper.
Amendment 256 seeks to clarify how the YPLA will discharge its duties
in the future and who will be in the driving seat when it comes to
commissioning. On page 26 of the explanatory notes to the Bill, it says
that Clause 40, with which we have already dealt,</div>
<a name="09031816000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147; imposes a new
duty on local education authorities to secure that all young people in
their area who are over compulsory school age but under 19, and persons
aged 19 and over but under 25 for whom a learning difficulty assessment
has been carried
out&#148;.</div><a name="09031816000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes go on to
say:</div><a name="09031816000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government propose to create a small non departmental body, the Young
People&#146;s Learning Agency for England (&#145;the
YPLA&#146;)&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09031816000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
we have just been
discussing&#151;</div><a name="09031816000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sponsored
by DCSF and reporting to the Secretary of State, whose core purpose is
to provide the funding to enable local education authorities to fulfil
this
duty.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, it is fairly clear from the explanatory notes, that the
principal responsibility lies with the local authority. The local
authority is the one that is being funded and that will be in the
driving seat when it comes to commissioning. However, when we look at
clause 58, we can see that it is the YPLA that is mentioned first as
having to</div>
<a name="09031816000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;secure the
provision of financial resources.&#148;</div>
<a name="09031816000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
introductory part of the clause, it appears that the YPLA will be in
the driving seat in relation to commissioning and providing. Subsection
(b) refers to local education authorities which will also receive
financial resources for what is described as their functions in
relation to education or training. What amendment 256 seeks to do is
put local authorities back in the driving seat in relation to
commissioning and receipt of funding in the way in which the Government

notes.</div><a name="09031816000478"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000855"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Could we be clear about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
principal concern? Is it one of duplication or one of confusion? Is he
suggesting that because of the way in which the Bill is drafted, both
local authorities and this new agency would have overlapping
responsibilities? Or is he suggesting that the Bill is clumsily worded
and it does not do what the explanatory notes say that it
should?</div><a name="09031816000479"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000856"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b><b class="B"> </b>Until I hear from the Minister, I am afraid
to say that it is both. I am not sure whether the Bill is deliberately
confusing, whether there is a risk of duplication or whether the
intention in the Bill as drafted is not rather different from what is
in the explanatory notes, because the Bill appears to give more
commissioning power and responsibility, in relation to funding, to the
YPLA to commission directly, rather than engaging through the locally
elected authority, which according to the explanatory notes would be in
the driving
seat.</div><a name="09031816000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
256 is designed to turn around clause 58 so that it comes into line
with the intentions stated in the explanatory notes and to make clear
what the distinct roles of the YPLA as a funder and commissioner will
be in comparison with local authorities. Is the intention, as stated in
the Bill, that the YPLA will have quite a lot of power to commission
directly and outside 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>the local authority control or agreement, or will this body have as one
of its prime responsibilities or its prime responsibility the funding
of local authorities so that they can discharge those duties? At the
moment, the Bill is rather confusing on that point. It would be helpful
for the Minister to end that confusion and to clarify the circumstances
in which, for example, the YPLA might ignore the wishes of the local
authority in discharging its functions under clause
58.</div><a name="09031816000481"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000857"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I shall deal first with amendments 240 and 242 to
245. Clause 58 ensures that the financial resources that local
authorities need to deliver on their new duties under the Bill are
transferred to them from the YPLA. That is the beginning of an
explanation, but I will go on at greater length for the benefit of the
hon. Member for Yeovil a bit later. These amendments would make all the
YPLA&#146;s duties and powers with respect to securing financial
resources subject to guidance from the chief executive of the Skills
Funding Agency. Together with amendment 239 to clause 57, which we have
already discussed, they would mean that the YPLA was set up as part of
the SFA rather than as a separate non-departmental public
body.</div><a name="09031816000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I have once before set out the position to the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings in respect of the barmy proposition that the
YPLA be part of the SFA, I will give it another go. As he knows, the
adult skills world is demand-led; the learners&#146; decisions are
very much what is provided for. The SFA will deliver through Train to
Gain and a number of other things that have been set out and will be
discussed when we reach that part. The situation for FE colleges, which
I know he is concerned about, is very different from the planned,
commissioned provision, which is what happens on the 16-to-19 side of
things. They are very different and the accountabilities for them
should be very
different.</div><a name="09031816000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to make sense of the Education and Skills Act 2008 and the
policy to raise the participation age to 17 and then 18 in 2015, it is
important that the accountability for nought to 19 should rest with
local authorities. That is the fundamental reason why we need separate
agencies. We need an agency for adults. We then need accountability
locally through local authorities for nought-to-19 education and
provision up to 25 for people with learning
difficulties.</div><a name="09031816000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
we have made that decision, we need to be able to deal with the problem
that FE colleges in particular would have, which is that without some
sub-regional and regional arrangements that can be brokered if there
are problems, they would have lots of conversations with lots of
different local authorities. A precondition to accepting the
institutional infrastructure that we have designed and which is
reflected in the Bill is agreeing with raising the participation age. I
know that in Committee on the Education and Skills Bill, the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s party voted against that. If he opposes RPA, it is
perfectly credible for him to oppose this proposal. If he supports RPA,
I cannot see how he would not see that local authorities should have
responsibility for 16-to-19 commissioning and therefore that there is a
need for an agency to be able to broker and facilitate the
commissioning, alongside passing  the funding from Government
to local authorities,  according to the decisions on
commissioning that local authorities make.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div><a name="09031816000485"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000858"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The key issue is where we think most of the extra
young people who stay on will be educated. My assumption&#151;perhaps
it is not the Minister&#146;s&#151;is that most of the extra people
who stay on, who do not currently, will be educated in the FE sector. A
very substantial number will, at least. Given that we think that the FE
sector should be largely independent and self-regulated, with a slim,
streamlined funding agency providing it with the funds to respond to
need, it is not surprising that we do not support the establishment of
the new agency.</div>
<a name="09031816000486"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000859"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We discussed last year where the growth might be,
but FE will be responsible for a significant part of that provision. A
certain amount will take place in sixth forms, and, elsewhere in the
Bill, we legislate to give sixth form colleges their own legal status,
which they largely welcome. They will then have more of a relationship
with the local authority, but other training providers will grow
significantly, too. Apprenticeships will grow significantly, so the
process will involve not simply FE colleges. The most important thing
for the hon. Gentleman and others to understand is that we need
seamless provision from 0 to 19 and to end the break at 16, Reinventing
the Learning and Skills Council would, in institutional terms, keep the
break at 16 and provide a substantial obstacle to increasing
participation successfully&#151;even if the hon. Gentleman disagrees
with us about the enforcement of
participation.</div>
<a name="09031816000487"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000860"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Following the logic of the Minister&#146;s
assertions, I must say that he is right that other, private training
providers will absorb some of the growth, and right about
apprenticeships, but neither they nor private further education
training providers&#151;those providing what FE colleges
do&#151;should come within the orbit of a young person&#146;s
learning agency. They would be better off under a skills funding
agency. That seems reasonable and logical; and why LEAs have to be
involved at all is beyond me.</div>
<a name="09031816000488"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000861"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman does not like local
education authorities, even though his party is democratically
responsible for most of them, but we should put Connexions and the
information, advice and guidance duties on local authorities for 0 to
19-year-olds, and the commissioning responsibilities in the hands of
local authorities, too. That is the progressive move that will make the
process work, and it was a voice that we heard form the Local
Government Association, the Association of Directors of
Children&#146;s Services and others, when we took evidence from
witnesses.</div>
<a name="09031816000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth pointing out to the hon. Gentleman that participation in school
sixth forms is rising faster than in FE colleges, so it would be
difficult for us to design something that anticipated things as he sees
them; we must design something with flexibility. There is no single
body that will deliver to both young people and adults the intensity of
support and advice that our future prosperity demands, and we should
create that autonomous, non-departmental public body.</div>
<a name="09031816000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 256
would prevent the YPLA from funding providers directly and
independently of local authorities when it is necessary to do so, as
the hon. Member for Yeovil set out. For the overwhelming majority of
young people, local authorities will commission places in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>way that we have discussed at length today&#151;through the
sub-regional groupings. Clauses 58 and 63 are intended to deal with a
number of exceptions where the YPLA may have to play a different role.
It is necessary to create those powers to enable the YPLA to pass
funding to local authorities to support their own commissioning plans,
and there is no doubt that they will be in charge of the vast majority
of that commissioning. They will be in the driving seat, which I think
was the phrase that the hon. Gentleman used, but they will need support
from the YPLA to ensure consistency and value for money. The YPLA will
fund the commissioning decisions of local authorities, and they will
also have a subsidiary role in the YPLA to ensure coherence and
budgetary control across the country.</div>
<a name="09031816000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers in
clause 58(1)(a) and clause 58(3) are necessary in respect of
examples that we will discuss later, where there is a need to
commission from some providers&#151;the Royal Ballet School, for
example&#151;that are genuinely national institutions that need a
national funding arrangement rather than something that would make
sense in terms of a single conversation with a local authority, because
so few of the learners would come from that local authority
area.</div><a name="09031816000649"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30
pm</div><a name="09031816000492"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000862"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Surely amendment 256, tabled in my name and that of
my colleagues, does not in any way impede what the Minister is
describing. All it does is to make clear what he has already made
clear, which is that the local authority is the overwhelmingly dominant
provider. But proposed clause 58(1)(b) makes it clear that other
persons or agencies can be used to provide the education or training
necessary, provided that it is in pursuance of arrangements made by
local authorities in the discharge of those functions. There is no
reason why local authorities should not be involved in that process,
surely.</div><a name="09031816000493"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000863"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Of course, local authorities will be involved. It
is just that there are circumstances in which certain
providers&#151;the case has been made to us&#151;have a
relationship with so many local authorities and are not dependent on
any individual local authority that having that single relationship
does not necessarily make sense. The YPLA will also be required to
undertake similar functions using these powers, where, under the
intervention strategy agreed with the Secretary of State under
clause 70, it has evidence that a local authority is failing
or is likely to fail in its duties under clause 40 to commission
suitable education or training. There may also be circumstances and
instances where sub-regional groups of local authorities are not ready
to take on their commissioning role and where the YPLA needs to act on
their behalf. So there are three different sorts of circumstances where
these powers may be
needed.</div><a name="09031816000494"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000864"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for being typically
generous in giving way, but can he describe any circumstances in which
the YPLA would want directly to commission against the wishes of the
local authority? That is, after all, all we are calling for in
amendment
256.</div><a name="09031816000495"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000865"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> In the case of intervention, where there is
evidence that the local authority is failing or is likely to fail in
its duties, there may be circumstances where a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>local authority would disagree with the commissioning decisions that are
in the best interests of learners. There might be issues in respect of
those with particular needs, where there is a disagreement about what
is reasonable or disproportionate expenditure. We explored some of
those matters earlier in
debate.</div><a name="09031816000496"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000866"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="09031816000497"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000867"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I will, but we need to make some
progress.</div><a name="09031816000498"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000868"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am sorry to labour this point, but it is quite
important. I am happy to leave aside the cases where a local authority
clearly is not capable of carrying out its duties, because that is not
what we are talking about. We are talking about circumstances where the
YPLA might, even with a local authority operating perfectly properly,
intervene to become the direct commissioner against the wishes of the
local authority. I am not convinced yet that the Minister has explained
why that would be necessary, unless the local authority was a failing
authority.</div><a name="09031816000499"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000869"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman has asked us to leave aside the
very scenario where it would be necessary to use these powers. In the
vast majority of cases the normal practice will be for the YPLA to fund
the local authority&#146;s commissioning decision. I want to be
really clear about that. However, we want to hold these powers for the
YPLA in those unusual circumstances where it is necessary for them to
intervene. I can only see the YPLA acting against the wishes of the
local authority if it was failing to deliver its duties under clause
40.</div><a name="09031816000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
122 would restrict the YPLA&#146;s duty to provide funding in respect
of 16 to 19 learners and learners with learning difficulties. The
extension of the duty on local authorities to be responsible for
specific learners over 19 reflects the Department&#146;s recognition
that some learners with learning difficulties who are subject to a
section 139A assessment of their needs may require more time to
complete their education, so would remain in lower-level provision for
longer.</div><a name="09031816000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that Committee members may be concerned that some specialist
colleges, such as residential colleges, that serve learners from a
number of local authority areas may need separately to contract with
those local authorities. I reassure the Committee that that will not be
so. The overriding principle is that each provider should have one
commissioning dialogue for the provision being commissioned by local
authorities and that dialogue will be with the lead local authority,
decided by the sub-regional
group.</div><a name="09031816000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
241 would go even further and remove the YPLA&#146;s duty to provide
financial resources to local authorities for any education and training
provision that they secure under section 15ZA and would result in an
even unfunded burden falling on local
authorities.</div><a name="09031816000650"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.35

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000870"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Before we were interrupted by the bell, I think I
was about to say that I hoped that I had reassured hon. Members that
none of their amendments to clause 58 was necessary, and I hope that
they will not press them to a vote. Government amendments 308 to 311
are consequential to amendments made to part 2 about young
offenders.</div><a name="09031816000506"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000871"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I still think that the Minister&#146;s explanation
is rather odd and at variance with the early part of clause 58. He has
described the circumstances in which the YPLA would fund provisions
directly, which seem, in his view, to be only when the local authority
is completely failing to discharge its responsibilities. The impression
given by the first few lines of clause 58, particularly lines 5 to 12,
is rather different. However, I accept what he said about the
intentions in this part of the Bill, so we will save any further
amendments to this section until we have had an opportunity to reflect
on what he said.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000873"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I beg to move amendment 135, in clause 60,

Ofsted.&#146;.</div><a name="09031816000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Colleges is concerned that further education colleges
will have to respond to at least two funding bodies: their local
authority and the SFA. It is vital that those agencies and the new
Young People&#146;s Learning Agency have a default position of
sharing information to ensure that colleges do not spend even more time
dealing with bureaucratic burdens and can concentrate their efforts on
teaching students.</div>
<a name="09031816000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the
YPLA, under clause 60, and the SFA, under clause 99, can carry out
performance assessments on colleges and use those assessments when
making funding decisions. It is particularly important that the
assessments are carried out in a co-ordinated and coherent way in order
to avoid duplication of the agencies&#146; work with that of any
other funding or inspection bodies. Given how clearly the evidence in
the Committee sessions highlighted that the proposed system is likely
to be loaded with red tape and bureaucracy, surely the Minister will
see the wisdom of the amendment.</div>
<a name="09031816000519"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither the
nature of the financial relationship between local councils and
colleges nor audit arrangements are included in the legislation. We
would welcome clarification of whether local authorities, the YPLA and
the SFA will each be able to audit colleges and whether the audits will
be co-ordinated. Will they be arranged chronologically? Will they
overlap? What kind of shared endeavour will occur in that regard? With
those few words, I will be delighted to hear what the Minister has to
say.</div>
<a name="09031816000520"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000874"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We certainly agree that in many circumstances, the
YPLA will want to consult as proposed in the amendment and draw on
existing practice. A number of bodies are already tasked with assessing
the performance of providers, of which Ofsted is the major one, and
local authorities are already scrutinised by the Audit Commission,
among others.</div>
<a name="09031816000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
areas, the YPLA might need to develop additional systems to enable it
to do its job. It will need to performance manage directly when
commissioning directly, and, in the unusual circumstances that we have
been discussing, it can take provider quality into account when
assessing a local authority&#146;s commissioning plans. It will be
able to adopt and develop schemes for performance assessment to support
a local authority&#146;s performance management functions. It will,
of course, work with the SFA to develop a common assessment framework
to provide consistency for providers. By and large, of course, the
performance management of colleges will be carried out by the SFA and
that of schools and sixth form colleges by the local
authority.</div>
<a name="09031816000522"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have set
out some examples of when the YPLA will want an assessment framework,
and I have said already that a national commissioning framework will
set out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>the common framework, for example in respect of a framework for
excellence. We are looking to simplify audit arrangements to ensure
that no extra burdens are put in place and to avoid duplication.
Obviously, we expect the YPLA to consult the most appropriate bodies,
and we have levers to ensure that the consultation will take place. On

Holland and The Deepings will feel free to withdraw his

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000875"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The Government&#146;s argument in favour of this
convoluted structure and rather clumsy organisational arrangement is
that it reflects clumsy thinking. There is no use saying, &#147;We
think clumsily about such matters, so we have had to construct a system
to match our own failures and faults.&#148; The arrangement is
evidence that, rather than reducing the number of bodies with which
colleges have to deal, the Government are likely to retain or grow the
existing number. In 2005, Andrew Foster, whose report I have mentioned
once or twice, identified 17 bodies with which colleges are obliged to
deal in respect of inspection, funding, monitoring, planning, and
improvement or standard setting. Will the Minister tell us which of
those bodies further education colleges no longer have to deal with, or
will not have to deal with, as a result of the Bill? What extra bodies
will they have to deal with? According to my calculations, FE colleges
will have to deal with at least 17, possibly 18, bodies, as a result of
this legislation, which directly contradicts Andrew Foster&#146;s
call for a slimming down of the structure, a reduction in bureaucracy
and a clearing up of what seems to me to be a bit of a
mess.</div><a name="09031816000524"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000876"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I have heard the hon. Gentleman&#146;s Andrew
Foster speech several times. Will he respond to any of my points? I
know that he is a legendary multi-tasker, and I am sure that he was
capable, in the middle of the conversation that he was having with the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, of listening to every
word that I said. Will he respond to anything that I did
say?</div><a name="09031816000525"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000877"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is not my job to respond to my own amendment, as
the Minister will understand. I have tabled the amendment, and it is
his job to respond to that. I made it fairly clear that the amendment
was tabled after consultation with the Association of Colleges. He made
it clear in his response that he thought that in some circumstances the
YPLA would still have to audit or inspect colleges. He also said that
he anticipated that that would not be a routine matter; he claimed that
my assertion that there would be a confusion of auditing and inspecting
was unfounded. None the less, the Government have done nothing to strip
down the multitude of bodies that inhibit the performance of further
education, because they force the professionals running our colleges to
spend an immense amount of time and energy dealing with red tape and
paperwork. That is not my analysis. It is the analysis of Andrew
Foster, who was commissioned by the Government. He said that the
Government should do something, and the Bill is the sorry
result.</div><a name="09031816000652"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000878"></a>Mr.

performance or completion of course
work.&#146;.</div><a name="09031816000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed as a helpful probing amendment. I shall speak
briefly. It invites the Government to withdraw any powers there might
for the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency to make bonus payments
under the existing educational maintenance allowance or any other
financial provision that the Government see fit to introduce. If the
Government were to accept the amendment, they would be able to free up
the &#163;100 million or so that is used each year to make
bonus payments. That money could be used instead to close the
long-standing gap between funding those youngsters aged 16 and 17 who
go to college and those who attend school.</div>
<a name="09031816000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look
forward to hearing what the Minister has to say; I hope that he will
accept the amendment.</div>
<a name="09031816000532"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000879"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We heard a good explanation of what the amendment
would do. Bonus payments are an important element of the educational
maintenance allowance scheme, which provides a financial incentive to
help young people from lower income households to participate in
post-16 educational training. EMA has been shown to have a significant
and positive impact on participation and attainment, particularly among
the more disadvantaged groups. That is something of which we are
proud.</div>
<a name="09031816000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">When EMA
pilots were introduced, participation in full-time education increased
significantly for 16 and 17-year-olds, following a decade of little or
no increase. Those increases have been sustained since the national
roll-out. More recent analysis found that EMA increased attainment at
levels 2 and 3 by about 2 per cent. for male learners and about 2.5 per
cent. for female learners.</div>
<a name="09031816000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">EMA is a
something-for-something scheme. To receive EMA, a young person must
sign a contract with their learning provider, setting out what is
expected of them if they are to earn weekly payments and bonuses. In
September 2008, we amended the criteria for EMA weekly payments and
bonuses to include not only attendance but behaviour, achievement and
effort.</div>
<a name="09031816000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">Learning
providers have welcomed that change. It strengthens the
something-for-something aspect of the scheme. By providing a further
incentive for learners to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>fulfil the expected standards of behaviour set out by the learning
provider, and getting them to put effort into the course, we are
encouraging attainment and progression among young people from less
well-off backgrounds.</div>
<a name="09031816000536"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000880"></a>Mr.

<a name="09031816000537"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000881"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I therefore believe that bonuses are an important,
integral part of EMA. I shall indulge the hon. Gentleman and give way
yet again.</div>
<a name="09031816000538"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000882"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister is being his usual generous self. I did
not hear anything in his speech indicating that the Government have
measured the effectiveness of the EMA bonuses, rather than the
underlying EMA, which is what the amendment is
about.</div>
<a name="09031816000539"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000883"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> We believe that the bonus system is working well;
as I said, it provides a significant improvement in participation and
attainment. We do not have independent quantitative evidence about the
impact of bonuses. We will consider it in our review of financial
support for young people that we announced in the White Paper on social
mobility, which was published at the beginning of the year. Anecdotal
evidence from providers, particularly those offering the entry to
employment programmes or provision targeted at harder-to-help groups
has stressed their importance for attention and for maintaining
motivation of learning. That is why, at this stage, I would not want to
remove the possibility of continuing with
bonuses.</div>
<a name="09031816000540"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000884"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> In contrast to the impression that the Minister gave
at the start of his answer, it sounds as if the EMA bonuses are rather
evidence-free parts of the financial support system for students.
Bonuses also lead to a great degree of bitterness among students who do
not receive an EMA; they find it difficult to understand the fairness
of other young people on their courses being rewarded and taking it for
granted. After all, such bonuses are paid on top of payments that are
already being made for the primary purpose of supporting young people
from lower-income backgrounds to remain in education and
training.</div>
<a name="09031816000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed at the Minister&#146;s refusal to accept the amendment,
particularly as the Government do not seem to have a strategy for
closing the gap in funding for young people in schools and colleges.
The Secretary of State&#146;s predecessor made that commitment a long
time ago, but it is yet to be delivered. I fear that I will not
persuade the Minister, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000887"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The clause that the amendment seeks to alter
enables the YPLA to secure provision of education in particular
circumstances; it may, for instance, secure provision while
sub-regional groups of LEAs are being established. The amendment would
constrain the YPLA, because we believe that it should be a funding body
rather than one that plans and secures provision. We want to encourage
providers to meet need, so the amendment essentially means that
provision would be organised by the YPLA, but only where there are no
external or underperforming providers. The amendment therefore seeks to
limit the extension of the YPLA&#146;s
competence.</div><a name="09031816000549"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
237 attempts to remove intervention rights from the YPLA and ensure
that it redirects funding to other providers instead. Its objective is
not to inhibit provision, but to direct from where it emanates. We are
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s perception of what the limits
on the YPLA&#146;s powers will be in that
regard.</div><a name="09031816000550"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000888"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Government amendment 312 is consequent to the new
local authority duties in relation to young offenders and will extend
the YPLA&#146;s powers to enable it to secure the provision of
education and training for children who are subject to youth
detention.</div><a name="09031816000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 236, clause 63 provides a critical element of support to the
system. In those, it is hoped, rare circumstances, which the hon.
Member for Yeovil discussed earlier, where a local authority is
failing, or likely to fail, to fulfil its duty to commission suitable
education or training, or where sub-regional groups of local
authorities are not ready to take on that role, the YPLA will have the
power to ensure that the education and training required to secure the
outcomes for our young people is effectively commissioned. As the YPLA
will not itself be a training provider, all providers will be external
to it, so the amendment is problematic in that it would create a
situation where the YPLA could never intervene in that
way.</div><a name="09031816000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 237, intervention in the context of the YPLA&#146;s powers
under clause 64 means stepping  in and supporting a local
authority to develop a commissioning plan, ideally before any financial
resources are transferred. In essence, such support would be a
back-office function and would not affect the business planning of a
local post-16 provider. Our whole direction here is to give as much
decision making and accountability as possible to local areas,
supported by the
YPLA.</div><a name="09031816000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of amendment 237 would be that when the YPLA felt the need to
intervene in that way, it would only be able to withdraw funding from
one provider  and direct it to a different one, which seems a
clumsy response. When a local authority is failing in its duty to
secure suitable education or training opportunities for young people,
that will become apparent through its commissioning plan for the coming
year and not  through the performance of an individual
provider. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>Through clause 64, we want to ensure that we retain the ability for a
suitable education place for our young people to be commissioned, and
that the YPLA can then ensure that the local authority tackles the
capability issues in its commissioning process. A further safeguard is
that the YPLA must consult the Secretary of State on the use of the
provisions, so there should be no hiding place for local authorities.
Local authorities have the duty and they have accountability to their
local communities. They will also have the resources through the YPLA,
but we do not want to see the YPLA, which will be a national body,
overriding that accountability. Yes, it will support it; yes, it will
challenge it; but no, it will not replace it altogether. I hope that,
by reason of all that clarity, the hon. Gentleman will not press the
amendments.</div><a name="09031816000554"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000892"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> It is essential that every young person is able to
access high quality learning. That means that we must provide for the
event that a local authority is  not able to carry out its
commissioning functions, and ensure that young people and providers in
the local authority area are not disadvantaged because of that.
Government amendments 313 to 315 support new local authority duties in
relation to young offenders by giving 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>the YPLA the power to intervene if a local authority has failed, or is
likely to fail, to perform its duties in respect of people subject to
youth detention. Without the amendments, the YPLA would be powerless to
ensure that those young people receive the education that they deserve
under the
circumstances.</div><a name="09031816000566"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
393 to 395 would give the Secretary of State rather than the YPLA the
necessary powers to give directions to a local authority, when the YPLA
was satisfied that the local authority was failing or likely to fail in
its duty under new section 15ZA and the amendments to it. However, the
YPLA is far better positioned to give those directions. The YPLA has a
remit to ensure that funding achieves the best balance of provision to
meet young people&#146;s needs and that overall budgetary control is
maintained. Clause 64 gives the YPLA supporting power to ensure that it
is able to fulfil that remit. Fundamentally, the YPLA will work with
local authorities, and it will have a strong regional presence and that
understanding of what is happening on the ground. As we have discussed,
the Secretary of State will appoint the members of the board and ensure
that there is good accountability for the decisions that the YPLA
makes, and therefore rather than having to pass these issues up to the
Secretary of State I hope that the Committee agrees that it is more
appropriate for the YPLA to make the
decisions.</div><a name="09031816000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind amendment 120 is to ensure that colleges have a right
of appeal to the YPLA if they are unhappy with the funding or
commissioning decision taken by the local authority. I have already
mentioned the provisions in clause 70 under which the YPLA must prepare
and consult with appropriate persons on a policy statement that sets
out the details of its policy on its powers of intervention. That
consultation will give stakeholders such as the Local Government
Association, local authorities, the Association of Colleges, individual
providers, and other parties that have a stake in the success of local
authority commissioning processes, the opportunity to ensure that the
intervention policy is suitable and that the triggers for intervention
are appropriate. The effect of the amendment would be to enshrine in
legislation the ability of further education colleges in particular to
inform the YPLA when they are concerned that a local authority is
failing.</div><a name="09031816000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we understand the potential concerns of colleges in particular, this
amendment does not provide sufficient latitude for others with a
similar interest to have that same degree of statutory influence.
Instead, we believe that the combination of clause 64 and
clause 70 will mean that the intervention process ensures
that there are the right triggers and levers for all concerned, not
just colleges. We are working with those partners to develop a draft of
such a strategy and I will be happy to share that with the Committee at
the earliest possible
opportunity.</div><a name="09031816000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that, having given all those fine assurances and indeed continuing
with the theme of clarity that I spoke about when we were discussing
the last amendment, hon. Members will agree that their amendments are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000893"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for anticipating a lot
of what I might have said about amendments 393 to 395, amendment 120
and, if you will allow me, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>Mr. Chope, because it covers similar territory,
amendment 396, although obviously we will be formally
debating that amendment later under clause
69.</div><a name="09031816000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to turn to amendment 120 to start with. This is the amendment that
would give colleges a right of appeal to the YPLA if they are unhappy
with a funding or commissioning decision taken by a local authority,
which shows that even the Liberal Democrats can accept that
occasionally local authorities will not be perfect.</div>
<a name="09031816000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the Minister was saying two slightly different things. They are not
necessarily inconsistent, but they are two slightly different reasons
why he does not want to accept amendment 120. I think that he was
saying, first, that amendment 120 would give appeal rights to one
particular group that would not be available to others. However, I
think that he was also saying that he felt that elsewhere within the
legislation there would be mechanisms for dealing with local authority
failure. I was not quite clear, though, whether he feels that the
existing legislation formalises those rights of appeal  for
bodies such as colleges, or if they really rely upon the YPLA itself to
identify from other information circumstances in which a local
authority would be failing.</div>
<a name="09031816000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably,
there is nothing to stop a college writing to or notifying the YPLA
about concerns that it may have. However, perhaps I could ask the
Minister to clarify whether he really thinks that the existing
legislation gives appeal rights that are clear enough and I also want
to ask him if he would be willing to accept amendment 120 if
it was more even-handed in relation to other bodies that might also
want to exercise such appeal
rights.</div><a name="09031816000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments&#151;amendments 393 to 395, and the later amendment
on clause 69, which is amendment 396&#151;all seek to
strike what we feel is a better balance between the authority of the
YPLA and that of the local authority, which would essentially place a
duty on the YPLA to seek a democratic mandate from the Secretary of
State before exercising powers over a democratically elected
council.</div>
<a name="09031816000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister,
perhaps understandably, expressed some concerns about whether all of
these matters that a local authority was not delivering on would
appropriately be passed up to the Secretary of State or the Department.
However, I draw to his attention the fact that, in clause
64(4), there is already a requirement for the YPLA
to:</div><a name="09031816000633"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;consult
the Secretary of State before exercising the power conferred by this
section.&#148;</div><a name="09031816000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
given that there will be a duty on the YPLA to consult, will the
Minister consider whether it is appropriate for the YPLA, particularly
as it is an unproven organisation, to use the quite considerable powers
that it will be granted by this Bill to exercise powers over a
democratically elected tier of government, in circumstances where the
Government are supposed to be championing what senior members of the
Government have often talked about as &#147;a new localism&#148;?
Here,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div>however, we seem to be giving really quite considerable powers to an
agency, without there being any proper democratic oversight or any
other democratic
check.</div><a name="09031816000577"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031816000894"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> In respect of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last
point, it is important that the Secretary of State is consulted, in
order to deal with the point that he has just made that these are
democratic organisations and that the Department should be properly
aware of what the YPLA might do. As we see elsewhere, if we want an
agency to be listened to, it needs to have some teeth&#151;some
sticks in the background alongside its carrots of funding, which it
will be distributing liberally in accordance with local authority
commissioning plans. That is, in essence, why the balance is right. I
always reflect on what the Committee has debated to make sure that hon.
Members have not pointed out a weakness contained in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09031816000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
working to develop a complaint and issue resolution process in relation
to 16-to-19 provision and we are working with stakeholders, including
the AOC, in the discussion and development of that complaints
procedure. There are a number of broad principles that have been agreed
with them about how that might work. It is important that that process
is in place for the reasons that have been set out, beyond the
fundamental principle, as set out in the clauses. It is important that
there is an intervention policy which has been properly and formally
consulted on&#151;it is set out in clause 70&#151;and that
everybody understands how those processes will operate so that if
interventions are then used, they follow a proper process and, if they
are not followed, they can then be challenged in the
courts.</div><a name="09031816000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope, on that basis, that the hon. Gentleman will be
happy.</div><a name="09031816000580"></a>
