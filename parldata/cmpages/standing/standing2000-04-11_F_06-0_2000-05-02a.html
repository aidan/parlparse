<P>
Amendment proposed [20 April]: No. 57, in page 3, leave out line 29.-[Mr. Boswell.]
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 77, in page 3, line 29, at end insert ``appropriate to their needs''.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> Before we adjourned for the Easter recess, we were treated by the Opposition to an extraordinary cornucopia of references from Quintilian, Solon and P.G. Wodehouse. When I looked back through Hansard, the title of one of that unsurpassed humorist's most famous books struck me. That title was ``Heavy Weather'', and I thought that the Opposition made a meal of one of the simplest clauses in the Bill.
<P>
The provision is precisely what it seems. It is a straightforward, positive, statutory duty for the Learning and Skills Council to encourage individuals to participate in learning. It is the first time that a public body has been given such a statutory duty. I had hoped that Opposition Members would welcome such a simple, straightforward and clear clause, and would recognise that such encouragement is vital to meeting the challenges that lie ahead. I think that everybody in the Committee would agree that there are challenges and that such encouragement is necessary. We need to raise demand for learning, to build a new culture of lifelong learning and to ensure that each individual has the opportunity to develop his or her potential. I think that there is common ground between members of the Committee on those issues. I hope that we can welcome the clause and move on, when I have addressed the concerns that the Opposition raised before the recess.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked whether the LSC would actively or passively encourage people to undergo education or training. The LSC must take active steps, but it is for that body to decide what those steps should be. The LSC prospectus gives an outline of the broad range of activities that it will undertake. For example, there will be advertising and marketing activities, research into the benefits of learning and dissemination of the results of that research. The LSC will be responsible for the planning and funding of information, advice and guidance and other services to adults in connection with learning opportunities, and will promote individual learning accounts. It will encourage people to return to learning by improving the supply and accessibility of education and training opportunities with the close co-operation of institutions such as the university for industry.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also questioned whether it was right that all individuals should undergo education and training, and his right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it would be a mistake if that process became too rigorous<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and served to ``dilute  entrepreneurial spirit''. If I had time, I would counterpoise several examples to those he gave of entrepreneurs who left school early. For example, Dr. David Potter, a distinguished academic who is now spearheading the thrust of Psion plc into the new world of e-commerce and mobile technology, is an entrepreneur who benefited from extensive higher education.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I concur with the Minister's view of Dr. Potter. However, the contribution that higher education made to Dr. Potter's career was of a technological nature and not to do with starting and running a business.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I think that we should move on, rather than debate the particular merits of Dr. Potter. We agree that he has made a huge contribution to the economy, as have many other entrepreneurs, but perhaps we can continue the debate about their enjoyment of higher and further education some other time.

<P>
We want the Learning and Skills Council to cater for the learning needs of all individuals, and we need to find ways to show the benefits of learning for the learner as well as for the wider economy and community. We are right to talk of lifelong learning and continuous updating of skills as the key to promoting personal and community well-being and bridging the skills gaps. I hope that that is common ground in Committee and among all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. We must never forget that many people have lost the learning habit, or may never have had it. The most learner-friendly provision, such as recreational learning that is fulfilling in itself, can offer opportunities for individuals to re-connect with learning in time to move on to courses that they may never have dreamt of taking. We want the LSC to promote that ladder of opportunity.

<P>
The LSC will have to balance the interests of work force development and personal fulfilment through learning; I do not accept that the two interests will necessarily always be in conflict. That is why we want to encourage a broad spectrum of interests in the national and local councils and in the committees on adult and young people's learning.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked whether the reference to post-16 education and training meant that there was no longer an adequate anchor to define the further education section as provided by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. I shall reassure him. If he consults schedule 10, he will find that much of the 1992 Act remains untouched. A further education section will continue to be defined by section 91(3) of the 1992 Act, which will remain in force.

<P>
Amendment No. 77 is identical to an amendment debated at length in another place. We agree wholeheartedly with its sentiment, which is that the LSC should promote participation in learning that is appropriate to the needs of individuals. However, as Lord Bach said in another place, the amendment is unnecessary. Post-16 education and training has a specific meaning in the Bill. Clause 3(5) and (6) give the definition for part I of the Bill, by reference to the main LSC's duties, as a provision that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``suitable to the requirements of persons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The duty of the council in clause 4 is to encourage individuals to undergo education and training suitable to their requirements, so to add ``appropriate'' would be tautologous and unnecessary.

<P>
Practically, the LSC can succeed in its duty only if it promotes educational training that individuals understand as being appropriate to their needs and aspirations. People will reject learning if it is remote from their interests, circumstances and wishes.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made it clear that he had no intention of implying that individuals should not be encouraged to undergo post-16 education and training. Given my explanation and reassurances, I therefore hope that he will feel able to support the provision and to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry); I welcome the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), whom I think is recovering from illness. I hope that no dreadful plague has struck the Liberal Democrats.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is called Romseyitis.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I cannot comment on that, except to say that it may be necessary to produce a home-to-Committee agreement with them to see a Liberal Democrat presentation.

<P>
The Minister has an excellent bedside manner, which he has well exhibited today. Anyone who begins his speech with a relevant quotation from P. G. Wodehouse rapidly raises my expectations, and I accept his implied approval of our proposal. He understands two matters: first that it is the duty of the Opposition to unpick the provisions to gain an understanding of them and, secondly, that it is the duty of the Government, particularly when producing general aspirations in legislation, to be aware that the Bill is not simply an aspiration, but that such high words and excellent sentiments may be tested in the courts. We live in an increasingly litigious society in which individuals-to use the word that we want to delete-like to test their rights.

<P>
I do not dissent from the Minister's wish that the Learning and Skills Council must grip post-16 education and encourage individuals to participate in it. I certainly do not want the Committee to gain the impression that anyone should be deemed a hopeless case. I am not suggesting that categories of people should be marked as ``DNE''-do not educate-as is happening under the current health debate-and that applies particularly to persons with special educational needs and learning difficulties.

<P>
However, when setting out such a general aspiration, we must pause for a moment. If we go back far enough in legislative history, we will find that general duties clauses are not unprecedented, but they seem to have grown in the past 30 years in parallel with the growth in judicial review. I can imagine a disaffected individual, on receipt of a nasty letter from a minor official in the Learning and Skills Council, saying, ``This has discouraged me from education. You are not helping me and I shall take you to court.'' Some advocacy interests will be only too pleased to do that. We must test what the Minister is about. With the exception of his reference to individual learning accounts, he is setting forth a programme for the Learning and Skills Council to provide general encouragement to groups of people to be educated rather than specific encouragement to individuals, as a result of which there will be a danger that someone may seize that as an opportunity to fight his individual case.

<P>
I recognise that the Minister's definition of post-16 education and training is keyed in with other definitions under the Bill. We shall discuss that later, but it has been right for us to rehearse such matters and to receive the hon. Gentleman's assurances about them, for which I am grateful. We have a lot of work to do today, so I shall not pursue the matter further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 3, line 33, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that it shall at all times make clear to employers whether there is or is not a legal obligation to contribute'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I hope that the Minister will take this relatively simple amendment in the spirit in which it is intended. Given his good bedside manner to which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred, I have every confidence that he will do so. I hope that he will share our diagnosis of the problem and reconsider what treatment may be necessary. We all share the objective of wishing to promote participation in post-16 education and training, and we want to encourage employers to become involved in its support and delivery. That is an important concomitant objective.

<P>
When it comes to encouraging employers to contribute to the cost of post-16 education and training, some issues still need to be explored. It is worth noting that clause 4(c) places the Learning and Skills Council under a duty to encourage employers to contribute to the costs of post-16 education and training. I stress the word ``encourage''. How does the Minister envisage that the Learning and Skills Council will discharge its duty to encourage employers to contribute to the cost? The amendment is designed to explore that issue. It would require the Learning and Skills Council to make it clear to employers whether there is a legal obligation to discharge its duty to encourage employers to contribute. Employers have a right to know whether they are under a legal obligation to contribute when such a request is made. That is especially important for small and medium-sized enterprises. They may share the objectives of providing good post-16 education and training, but, unlike larger enterprises, will not have access to legal and personnel departments. We look forward to the Minister shedding more light on the matter, especially in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> We are conscious of the needs of businesses. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the interests of small and medium-sized companies are at the forefront of our mind in any proposed legislation. I hope that I can shed further light on why the amendment is not necessary.

<P>
It almost goes without saying, given that it has been the policy of successive Governments for a considerable period, that employers should be required to make an appropriate contribution-in some cases, 100 per cent.-to the costs of training from which they benefit directly. That already happens in relation, for example, to further education colleges that provide dedicated training courses for employers. The Further Education Funding Council has assumed, depending on the circumstances, that employers will meet a high proportion of the costs, and, in many instances, the full cost. Training and enterprise councils have combined the resources of the public purse and those of private employers in running work-based learning programmes to great public benefit and the benefit of individual employers.

<P>
There is nothing novel in the proposition that employers should meet the cost of training when they benefit directly; indeed, doing so undoubtedly helps to ensure that training meets their commercial requirements. Similarly, there is nothing novel in the idea that the state should be prepared to contribute to the costs of training in transferable skills and portable qualifications, which help labour markets to function efficiently. Again, that is common ground between the parties.

<P>
In a debate about employer contributions, it is important to distinguish between the arrangements for work-based training for young people and those for other job-related training. When young people are training on advanced or foundation modern apprenticeship schemes, it is right that the state should pay for the costs of obtaining those qualifications, as it would if they were studying for A-levels or vocational A-levels. The requirement on the employer in relation to such schemes is to meet costs such as employees' salaries and the opportunity costs of trainees taking time off to train. That is different from job-related training for other workers. Further proposals for the new funding system will be set out in an additional consultation document, which we intend to issue shortly. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
We have already listened and will continue to listen to views on the extent to which local LSCs should have scope to adjust contributions to the cost of provision in accordance with individual and local circumstances. Five detailed proposals involved in the next consultation are of particular relevance to the issue, and I hope that it will reassure the hon. Gentleman if I briefly detail them.

<P>
The first proposal is that the state should carry all costs relating to the achievement of qualifications for work-based training for young people, with the exception of salaries and employers' opportunity costs. The second is that employers should be responsible for a bigger investment in other job-related training for their employees. The third is that employers should pay the full costs of dedicated training for their employees, with the exception of work-based training for young people. The fourth is that, if the LSC contributes, providers should charge employee contributions at rates that the LSC sets. The final proposal is that the state should be prepared to fund the assessment costs of employee training that would increase the number of people with transferable qualifications. Those are the proposals on which we are consulting.

<P>
If an employer and a training provider make an agreement between themselves about employee training for which the employer will pay in full, there is no reason to involve the LSC. However, if the LSC contributes to the cost of training that raises the question whether it should stipulate the amount to be collected by the provider, or whether that should be left as a matter between the provider and the employer. We shall invite views on the issue in the consultation paper, which we shall publish shortly.

<P>
I hope that hon. Members will agree that those are balanced consultation proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is providing some helpful information, but he has not dealt with the point about the use of the word ``encourage''. He is describing circumstances in which he expects employers to contribute if the LSC contributes. What will the word ``encourage'' mean in such circumstances?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> It means exactly what it says: the LSC has a statutory duty to encourage employers to contribute in the circumstances that I have just outlined. Balances must be struck, which is why we are consulting on the proposals. We have already listened to a wide range of views. Further issues need to be resolved, but only after appropriate consultation. That is the purpose of issuing the document.

<P>
The statutory duty is to encourage employers to contribute. I hope that my comments this morning explain the circumstances in which we shall expect employers to make such a contribution. We do not expect them always to contribute, but for the reasons that I have just described they will sometimes be expected to do so, and we propose that the LSC should have a duty to encourage them in that.

<P>
The proposals are coherent in policy terms, whereas the amendment is less so. We must consider the effect of the amendment if it were adopted. What message would we be sending to employers if we were to encourage them to contribute to the cost of training but placed no significant obligation on them to do so? That would seem a confused message that, judging by what hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have said, none of us want to send.

<P>
What would we expect employers to conclude? That they should spend less on training? That training is not important? That the state is taking over responsibility for all training? We do not believe that that would be appropriate or desirable. We believe that employers have a major contribution to make, not only financially but in tailoring training to meet their commercial needs. It is important to encouarge companies, especially small and medium-sized firms, to have the right approach to training. As we all know, in the past many have not. That is an important part of the focus of the proposals.

<P>
If we were to adopt the amendment, firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, may be tempted to draw such conclusions. We should avoid that and, in that context, the amendment could be damaging. It would send the wrong signals about the importance of training. In the light of that, and of my comments about the consultation document and our overall approach, I hope that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I hoped that the Minister would bring his soothing bedside manner to our proceedings and I was not disappointed; I hope that he will not think me a difficult patient if I take issue with some of his remarks. I am not sure whether he has grasped the point about encouragement. The clause places on the council the duty-a duty about which we should continually ask questions-of giving encouragement. It is a duty to encourage, not secure, contributions towards the cost of training. The Minister said that consultation on that was taking place and set out in some detail the circumstances in which he would expect employers to contribute. I am sure that the Government will think carefully about he results of that consultation and I encourage them to listen carefully to the views expressed, especially by small and medium-sized enterprises.

<P>
As the patient, I became a little concerned, if not slightly feverish, when the Minister spoke about what firms should be told. That does not necessarily send the message that the Minister expects. We are at one with the Government on the important point of not wanting to convey to employers the message that they should not invest in training. However, employers should be given accurate information.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the word ``encourage'' is wide and could mean nothing, or something specific? It will allow local circumstances to dictate the level of encouragement, from, ``It's an offer you can't refuse'' to, ``We'd very much like you to help us out''. That form of words will-without rehearsing the arguments on charging that will arise under clause 6-give sufficient leeway for local circumstances to dictate outcomes that will, to quote amendment No. 77, be ``appropriate'' to fostering relationships with large as well as small firms. It is hard to envisage circumstances in which a company will not externalise costs, where that is possible. A company will always prefer it if someone else pays, so encouragement, in the local circumstances dictated by local requirement, will square the circle between externalising costs and achieving a proper deal for students.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That was, in its way, an interesting and helpful intervention-although I gently point out to the hon. Gentleman that he missed my comment about the imposition of a duty to encourage. His wider point about local circumstances was a good one, but I do not want to go too far down that road. We have throughout our debates said that the LSC is not necessarily as well tailored to local circumstances as the system that it replaces, especially in regard to the needs of business; the local training and enterprise councils had strong business representation and leadership at their heart. I do not wish to go back over old ground, but the hon. Gentleman's contribution was germane to that.

<P>
On the point about what firms should be told, telling a firm its legal position does not necessarily exclude giving it the right message. It is, after all, a matter just of telling a firm the legal situation-something that the firm could and would find out if it were a larger employer with the benefit of a full legal department, with in-house lawyers, a personnel department and so on. There is no harm in telling a firm the legal situation. That does not exclude sending the message that it is important for the firm to contribute to the cost of training its employees, through work-based training or other forms of training and education. There is no great harm in informing those who are the subject of legislation of their legal position; indeed, it is in the interests of openness and transparency to do so. It may save a firm trouble and expense and would remove the possibility of any slight ill-feeling arising from a firm being under the misapprehension that it had to contribute when it did not have a legal duty to do so-although it may of course want to make a contribution in any event.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend comment on
 the case of a firm that believes that there is general encouragement to contribute but is unclear about its leval obligation to do so? It may be tempted to do nothing unless and until it is the subject of proceedings for failing to discharge those legal obligations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The scenario that my hon. Friend sets out would not arise if the firm were in possession of accurate legal information. We tabled the amendment with the intention of being helpful. Providing accurate information would particularly benefit SMEs, which do not want the expense of finding it out themselves.

<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's response, which we will study carefully. It contained a lot, including some helpful information on matters other than that strictly concerning the amendment. The patient was given quite a lot to think about after the doctor has gone, and we will ruminate on it. We hope that the diagnosis is no worse than we believe it to be, but we shall wait and see. We may want to come back to the issue but in the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I rise to support clause 4 and to address in particular subsections (b) and (c) on the encouragement of employers. My constituency has many small and medium-sized employers, mainly involved in the tourism and leisure industries, and the Blackpool and The Fylde college, an excellent further education college that has done sterling work in that area and which has been recognised as a beacon college by the Government. I therefore come from the standpoint of the crucial work that the new LSC must do to involve SMEs. Blackpool and The Fylde college does much training through its leisure and management degrees, and has what may be described as a virtual restaurant-although one can eat in it-to train people going into hotel management and other courses. The relationship and business links between SMEs and the new LSC are therefore crucial.

<P>
Blackpool also has the greatest number of applications in the north-west by lone parents under the new deal. The effect of seasonal employment on learning and training also has to be taken into account in my area. Many SMEs have to allow employers to undertake training out of season, and that will cause particular challenges for LSC initiatives. It is therefore vital that learning and skills councils make links with SMEs and that the Federation of Small Businesses and the Small Business Service are closely involved with them. Small and medium-sized enterprises do not always have the resources and time to do their own training and they must be properly brought into the new framework at both national and local level. For example, Horizon Biscuits, a company in my constituency, has set up a learning centre on site where mainly part-time and relatively unskilled women workers in their 30s and 40s are acquiring skills via computer courses in a way that would not have been possible a few years ago. Local learning and skills councils must initiate and encourage such activity.

<P>
Flexibility must be preserved at local and regional level in the relationship between providers and employers. As the recent Employment Sub-Committee report made clear, there is still a north-south divide with regard to employability. It is important that assumptions that might be made in one part of the country about what can be done by small or medium-sized employers, their margins for profit and how that will affect the money that they put into training are not automatically carried through to other parts of the country. For example, the introduction of the national minimum wage was particularly welcome in the north-west, precisely because so many workers had previously not received that level of income. That needs to be taken into account throughout the entire process. I support the clause and I urge the Government to realise that local learning and skills councils must be given proper initiative and flexibility. It must be recognised that people in small businesses in Blackpool do not necessarily come from the same world or work on the same assumptions as a senior civil servant travelling into Whitehall from Sutton or Cheam.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I know the college to which the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) referred and I share his high opinion of it. He has made important points about the outreach of the Learning and Skills Council and the local councils to small and medium-sized enterprises. If there is one structural problem in the country that no Government have ever fully succeeded in resolving, it is that of transmitting the debates between large organisations and the organs of government and their agencies into what goes on, not at the coal face, but in the delivery of the economy. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that there were many small employers in his constituency, not necessarily all of whom had the time or the inclination to take the training and education of their employees seriously. His constituency is no means unique in that; small employers should share a common interest in proceeding.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman rightly, in a sense, established a litmus test for the work of the local councils, which is whether or not they will succeed in such a process. One of the reasons for the Government's move from training and enterprise councils was that TECs' performances were somewhat uneven. I concede that. Many have done extremely well, while others have done less well, but one of their great strengths has been their ability to respond to local conditions, given that their membership is grounded locally. We do not need to debate such wide issues now, but it is important that the Committee collectively sends a message out to employers of all sizes about the new venture on which the Government have embarked. It should deliver a more effective acquisition of skills, and underpinning educational requirements, at all levels-in the workplace, or locally, as well as in the worlds of Whitehall and this Committee.

<P>
My other point, which is a rehearsal of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and I tried to make in our amendments, is about the word ``encourage''. When I moved my amendment, something was buzzing through the back of my mind, but I could not think what it was. It was, of course, the conventional statement of the monarch's responsibility vis-a-vis the Prime Minister of the day-to advise, encourage and warn. That is a good motto for the council and local councils-to advise, in relation to later clauses on research and information; to encourage, as both sides of the Committee want to bring people into the process, and, above all, not put them off; and, to warn, because, as my hon. Friend said, people should not be put in a false position in terms of whether they have a legal obligation to their employers. Those who are learners or trainees should not be strung along on the prospect of a rosy future when that future may not be especially good, although it is still better for them to obtain skills than not to obtain them. A proper dialogue is necessary, involving advice, encouragement and, when necessary, warning.

<P>
Given the Minister's comments, and subject to the light and shade that the hon. Member for Blackpool, South and-modestly-I have tried to bring the context of the debate, we shall prepare to give the clause a fair wind.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> A number of important points have been raised, to which I shall respond briefly.

<P>
When we discussed the main duties of the LSC, under clauses 2 and 3, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) made a telling point. He said that there was not an excess of demand for learning. One of the LSC's principal responsibilities must be to generate that demand, which is precisely the purpose of the clause. Many people have lost the habit of learning, if, as I said, they ever had it. They fail to make the connection between their learning and skills and their economic success and prosperity. The LSC must not only focus on improving provision of education and training of the highest quality-which is vital-but challenge the chronic lack of demand for learning, and encourage those who might benefit from it, especially those in small firms and adults with low skills, to take advantage of it.

<P>
Employers and individuals should be fully aware of the benefits to be gained from lifelong learning. This is the first time that a public body has had such a positive duty. The FEFC and, further back in the past, the Manpower Services Commission were primarily concerned with supply. From the outset, the LSC must have wider ambitions. I have already referred to the steps that we expect it to take, and we have debated the balance between the needs of individuals and work force development priorities. I am confident that the LSC will attract the range of expertise that it needs to make those crucial judgments on the balance of priorities. I continue to be hugely encouraged by the amount of interest that has been generated.

<P>
The clause also reflects and reinforces our belief that employers have an important and proactive role to play in the promotion of learning. They spend more than £15 billion each year on work force development, and the LSC has the crucial job of working with employers to support those efforts. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South illustrated the issues arising in his constituency, which are important. I can assure him that we appreciate the importance of local circumstances, which is precisely why such a relationship was established between the national LSC and the local learning and skills councils. Locally, learning and skills councils will work closely with the Small Business Service, and will contract to provide advice to SMEs on work force development services, including support for Investors in People, access to modern apprenticeships, national traineeships and management development. The LSC will remain accountable for meeting the national learning targets for Investors in People. I hope that I can reassure him that the LSC will address the real needs that he has identified in his constituency.

<P>
The clause recognises the need for a proper balance, and I hope that Opposition Members are reassured on the point that employers should meet the cost of training when it benefits them directly and they are able to do so. That seems to us a wholly reasonable approach. The state will continue to contribute to the costs of training for more transferable skills and portable qualifications that will help labour markets to function effectively. There will be a partnership, in which the resources of the private sector and the public purse will be combined to best effect in the provision of workplace learning.

<P>

<P>
The Government want employers to do more to develop the skills of employees. As we have often said, investment in human capital is crucial to economic success in the modern world. However, the question is not whether the employer should do more at the expense of the state; both sides of the partnership need to do more. The record levels of public spending that we are reaching for education and training demonstrate the Government's commitment to the partnership between employers and the state. The new arrangements provide an opportunity to draw together, for the first time, all the existing strands in post-16 education and training. The LSC will be critically placed to identify and respond effectively to the needs of individuals and businesses. The local arms of the LSC will have discretionary funding; they will be able, for example, to pump prime work force development initiatives designed to support employers' training and skills needs. They will, of course, build on the success of TECs in that regard. TECs have had a patchy record, but we need to build on the areas in which they have succeeded.

<P>
There are a great many activities in which the LSC will be expected to secure new and imaginative learning opportunities. That role will be strengthened by the clause, which concisely sets out the LSC's duty to encourage individuals to undertake post-16 education and training and to encourage employers to participate in the provision and cost of such training.

<P>
No. 82, in page 3, line 39, leave out ``post-16''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 24.

<P>
No. 83, in page 3, line 41, leave out ``post-16''.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 25, 26, 41 to 44, 29 to 31 and 45 to 48.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is the first occasion when I find myself more amended against than amending, as it were. There is a great collection here; it reminds me of nothing more than the strapline on the Sunday newspaper that read, ``All human life is here''.

<P>
The clause is an appealing one, in that anything about the spending of public money looks appealing, save perhaps to Treasury Ministers. The Minister has taken an educationally high route to explain the importance of the LSC, and the flexibility that it has been given. That translates into the general powers that it has been given to spend money. Of course, it is the common wish of the Committee that that should be done in a cost effective and sensible way.

<P>
The clause defines the scope within which the LSC can spend money; further on are listed some of the conditions, which, as Ministers know, are more controversial, especially the ones that relate to school sixth forms. The clutch of amendments would ensure that the scope with which moneys can be spent and the institutions on which they are spent should be as comprehensive and effective as possible. That is certainly the aim of our amendments, and I imagine that it is the aim of the Government's as well. We would not want to find that, through some slip in the wording, a sensible proposal could not be implemented or that money that could have been better spent elsewhere had to be diverted in a particular way.

<P>
The amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and I have tabled are designed to define the matter in a way that can be explained reasonably briefly. Amendment No. 100 is designed to probe the possibilities available in meeting the objectives of the LSC-and, indeed, in encouraging school attendance from the hon. Member who has arrived on the Liberal Democrat Benches. It is nice to be reinforced on this side of the Committee by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). Will the LSC be able to spend money in the private, or non-maintained, sector? I have not checked, but it would also be helpful, as a sub-text, if the Minister could remind the Committee whether the definition of the further and higher education sectors in the 1992 legislation embraces the expenditure of money outside institutions so constituted. I suspect that it may, but it would be helpful to ensure that they have not slipped out.

<P>
As I said in a different context, not many cases remain in which the Government continue to discriminate against the private sector in education. There was a time when, although grant-maintained schools were in the public maintained sector, they were treated as pariahs by schools that were maintained directly by the local education authority, and could not even play games against LEA schools. I hope that we are moving on from such circumstances. However, one of the remaining anomalies relates to information and communication technology courses that are not available to people in the private sector but are available to the maintained sector. The Minister might like to diverge for a moment to explain why that is so. If private sector provision is sensible, and is the best or the most appropriate provision, it should not be precluded, subject to appropriate rules.

<P>
I remind the Minister that we heard some interesting and rather striking revelations over the weekend-when revelations tend to be made under the present Government-about health policy. The Secretary of State for Health was quoted as having said that, having conducted an appriasal, he had found that private nursing home beds might be a sensible adjunct to the national health service and might release resources for better purposes. In exactly the same way, and congruent with such thinking, if Ministers and their party are now considering using the private sector, I hope that the wording of the clause will not rule out their doing so. That is the purpose of amendment No. 100.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 81A, 82 and 83 would remove the requirement to confine financial support to institutions that provide post-16 education. As we said in discussing clauses 2 and 3, the council has a general duty to promote post-16 education, and we have a definition of that, of which the Minister helpfully reminded us this morning. These are probing amendments, as it is not clear to me in what circumstances institutions that provide education for other people-pre-16 education, which, by definition, means schools, and possibly one or two specialist institutions-will receive support from the council. The Minister may want to refer to a later subsection. It would be useful to examine how the provision will work, especially in cases involving adults who attend maintained schools and receive instruction in, for example, A-level subjects. Some people might receive education alongside others in the class who are below the age of 16. That may be a perfectly sensible educational solution. We do not want institutions to be seen not to provide post-16 education because their primary purpose is to deal with young people, and then find themselves unable to receive funding for mature students.

<P>
Amendment No. 101 is slightly different. It seeks to widen the definition in another way, by saying that persons receiving post-16 education and training should be able to be ``of any age post-16''. I do not propose to re-open the debate that we have had and to which we shall return about the cut-off age for clause 2 duties and the pick-up point for clause 3 duties. However, we are not solely talking about those aged 16 to 19. There is an important duty for adult and continuing education, which should not be precluded in that context. I have read the Government amendments to which the Minister will speak in a moment, and feel that he, too, is concerned about finding the right definition. We do not have a difference of philosophy or principle about that.

<P>
I seek reassurance on another matter that was touched on in earlier debates, which relates to support activities for the delivery of post-16 education and qualifications. Subsection (1)(d) is a provision to fund
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>persons providing or proposing to provide courses,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which means ``professional examinations'' and so forth. However, awarding bodies are not mentioned. The likes of Edexcel receive fees for the service that they provide to educational institutions. Those fees are for younger students and may be rebated for older students.

<P>
I am thinking not only of awarding bodies. Representations have been made to me by the national open college network, which is almost entirely dependent on receiving fees for the accreditation that it provides. Clearly, it may not be appropriate to fund the network directly from the LSC, although I think that it is the common wish of the Committee that it should be supported and encouraged. If we are not to fund it in that way, we shall need the Minister's assurance that it would not be improper to do so indirectly through support for the fees that it may charge for people who might otherwise be discouraged, disadvantaged and cut off from education. Those are the people whom we are anxious to bring back into the system. I am not sure whether the rubric of clause 5 can be expanded to include that in some way, but I am sure that all members of the Committee regard it as educationally desirable. I would like the Minister to think about that and reassure us.

<P>
If we are to have a learning and skills council, it should be inclusive rather than exclusive. It should be able to fund where most appropriate, and should not be ruled out from funding institutions simply because of some provision. That would not be open housekeeping for wasteful expenditure or for expenditure largely without regard to output. We should not seek in the clause to rule out sensible provision, whether for conducted and maintained bodies, private sector bodies, different groups by age or institutions that may be directly funded, such as awarding bodies, that support education.

<P>
We are attempting to give the Learning and Skills Council as much flexibility as the Minister wishes. Naturally, there will be a price tag to ensure that that is delivered properly, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider our amendments and explain the thinking behind the extensive number of small, technical Government amendments.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> To use a cricketing metaphor, it is a pleasure to break my duck. Before the Easter recess, we discussed cricket a lot, so I took a copy of Wisden on my break-but to no avail, because it did not make any sense to me. We have now left the cricketing metaphors behind and seem to be concentrating on health and the bedside manners of doctors and other such matters referred to by the hon. Member for Daventry. I know as little about health and medicine as I do about cricket, so I shall not refer to either.
 
<P>
I shall deal first with the Government amendments. It is a large group, but I hope that I can deal with them quickly and simply. They address three straightforward technical points that apply to the LSC in England and the National Council for Education and Training for Wales, in which I have a particular interest. Amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26 relate to clause 5 and the LSC, and amendments Nos. 29, 30 and 31 are identical in respect of clause 34 and the CETW. They are concerned with allowing both bodies to fund work prior to the commencement of actual learning or other services.

<P>
If I refer to Wales under clause 34, the same will apply to clause 5 with regard to the Learning and Skills Council in England. However, members of the Committee will see that clause 34 is inconsistent. In some cases, it permits the council to fund preparatory work while, in others, it does not. Amendment No. 29 would allow the councils in both England and Wales to support the purchase of books or other learning materials. Alternatively, it might involve support for travel costs to attend a college. The potential uses of powers to fund preparatory expenditure are important and wide. I hope that the principle is clear in both cases.

<P>
Amendment No. 30 deals with persons who are proposing to undertake research, as does amendment No. 31 in terms of advance payment of fees and charges, including those for transport and child care. Allowing payments to be made before a course has started is an important part of securing wider access to learning. It will enable the CETW and the LSC to offer assistance to individuals who do not have much money. I hope that such a provision will help them to widen the scope of the educational opportunities under the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I welcome the Welsh Minister to the Committee. Will he explain a little more about the circumstances in which an initial grant might be made available? Will a grant include resources for travel to the first stage of a course? Will it cover crèche facilities that may have to be paid for up front? Conversely, will the initial grant be made in relation to education or maintenance allowances as an inducement?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> All such issues will be included. Child care facilities, transport and the purchase of books and other learning materials are so important. The amendments are designed to help individuals break the barriers to entering the course and they will give the LSC additional powers to suppoort those individuals.

<P>
I shall now deal with amendment No. 100. The hon. Member for Daventry made clear his concern to ensure that the LSC and, in due course, the CETW should be able to fund maintained and independent schools and colleges for the provision or proposed provision of post-16 learning. The LSC can certainly consider that. If it so wishes, it can undertake the funding of independent schools or the funding provision by independent or maintained schools. However, I do not anticipate that as a matter of course, but the LSC could do so if it wished. For example, if there were a facility at a school that the LSC wanted to make use of, or if there were maintained or voluntary aided schools to which the LSC wanted to provide provision or gain provision from, that would be of equal importance. Although not as a matter of course, such a facility will be in place and we shall encourage the LSC to consider how it can support such individuals accordingly.

<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we intend the LSC to be able to fund any person who is providing or who is proposing to provide post-16 education or training. That may include independent schools and colleges. Indeed, that may be essential when making provision for those with special needs, perhaps in a specialist independent college. At present, the Further Education Funding Council can only fund schools that offer provision indirectly via an FE college. The LSC's more direct funding relationships could avoid unnecessary layers of bureaucracy and the administrative costs that go with that.

<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not necessary for us to include in the Bill the specific issues outlined in amendment No. 100. The 1978 Act defines ``person'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a body of persons corporate or incorporated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In plain English, the term ``person'' means legal people, such as companies, further education colleges or other bodies as well as natural or real people. That is a standard approach in legislation and is a wide-ranging definition. Amendment No. 100 will not help to expand on that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances and withdraw the amendment in due course.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 41 and 45 deal with separate issues under clauses 6 and 35. The hon. Member for Daventry may wish to note that, in connection with his amendment, I shall consider both the LSC and the CETW. As the clause stands, the LSC may seek information only from post-16 education and training providers. However, its funding powers under clause 5 extend to other matters, such as the provision made for work experience for pre-16s under clause 8 or collaborative work between a college and school at key stage 4. Public money from the LSC will be involved, so it must be right that the council can seek information about the way in which that money has been used, as it can do for post-16 education and training.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 44 were tabled in respect of the LSC and clause 6, and amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48 concern the CETW and clause 35. However, they make the same point. The LSC and the CETW have principal duties in relation to post-16 education and training, but their funding powers under clauses 5 and 34 go wider when relevant to their responsibilities.

<P>
As drafted, clauses 6 and 35 relate only to post-16 education and training that the councils fund, not the other provision or services that they have the power to fund. The amendments would ensure that both bodies can attach conditions to any of their funding, not only their funding of post-16 learning. They are technical proposals. I appreciate that there is a significant number of government amendments to this section of the Bill, but they are important in relation to the whole spectrum of the councils' funds rather than a specific part of them.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 81A, 82 and 83 would allow the LSC to fund any form of education. In a genuine spirit of helpfulness, I point out to the hon. Member for Daventry that if the Government had come up with such proposals, we would have faced angry representations from local authorities throughout England and Wales, which would view the extension of the powers of the LSC as a severe threat to their own powers.

<P>
I hope that we can give the amendments sympathetic consideration, while realising that they will not achieve what the hon. Member for Daventry intends. They would widen the funding powers of the LSC beyond the focus of its duties. The purpose of both the LSC and the CETW is to provide, for the first time, a single, coherent post-16 education system to replace the present tangled and convoluted system. Their duties are clearly set out, within which they are given powers in clauses 5 and 34 to support funding. Where appropriate, those funding powers go beyond that main focus into areas at each border, as it were, of the council's main duties and functions. That flexibility is important for the collaboration that runs through our proposals for England and Wales and, at the other end of the spectrum, can support a higher level of professional and vocational qualifications, as the Further Education Funding Council can at present. The LSC and the CETW can also fund activity that would assist delivery of their main duties-by, for example, giving support to students who may face financial hardship.

<P>
I appreciate that the hon. Member for Daventry may have been prompted to table the amendments by the Government amendments to clause 6, which remove the words ``post-16'' in various places. I shall explain at greater length later why it is appropriate to remove those words from clause 6 but not clause 5. The essential point is that, as clause 6 stands, it does not allow the LSC to attach conditions of grant to a broader spectrum of its activities but only to those activities that it may fund as part of its main duties. The amendments to clause 6 do not in any way extend beyond the scope of the actitivies that the LSC may fund. If a concern that we are trying to change that by the back door lies behind the amendments, I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is not the case. Clause 6 is limited to the funding powers set out in clause 5. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can accept those reassurances and not press his amendment, which widens the clause beyond the limit that the Government, and I am sure hon. Members, want.

<P>
Clause 5(1)(c) gives the LSC power to make direct provision of financial resources to any person receiving post-16 learning, but amendment No. 101 seeks to restrict that power so that the LSC could grant such funds only to those over 16. It may at first glance seem odd that the council would want to fund someone under 16 in their post-16 programme. However, ``post-16 education and training'' is a shorthand term. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Employment, said earlier, the full explanation of the term, for the purposes of part I, is found in clause 3(5) and (6) and refers to the description in clause 2(1) of the suitability of training
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to the requirements of persons who are above compulsory school age,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with specific exclusion for higher education.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Daventry said, A-levels are an example of learning provision that is generally suitable to the requirements of persons over compulsory school age. We all know of cases of gifted individuals who are able to take one or several A-levels earlier than usual. Such young people could be under the age of 16 but participating in what is defined as post-16 learning, perhaps in a sixth form college, and the LSC should be able to fund such provision. So there is essentially little between me and the hon. Member for Daventry on that point. However, the amendment would not limit the LSC's power to give funds to the individual learner of 16 or under who is engaged in post-16 learning. The LSC might use that power to make payments to support such a young person's learning; we return again to the questio of travel costs, books and perhaps subsidising meals.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The points that the hon. Gentleman made and the clarification that he sought are important. We want to consider whether subsection (1)(c) gives the LSC all the powers that it will need in such circumstances. We are talking about a small group of learners under 16, and the LSC should perhaps be able to make payments to a young person's parent or carer, rather than directly to the person receiving post-16 education or training. I thank the hon. Gentleman for bringing the point to the Government's attention. With his agreement, I should like to examine in detail the wording of the provision to which the amendments relate to see whether we can table an amendment to meet the needs of both him and me.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the LSC and the funding of awarding bodies. Such bodies will count as a service in connection with the provision of post-16 education and will therefore be covered by the Bill. I hope that that is helpful.

<P>
The Government have tabled important technical amendments that will improve the Bill. With the caveat that we will consider amendment No. 101 further and table a government amendment accordingly, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To put together the analogies that
 have characterised the Committee, the Under-Secretary of State for Wales might reasonably say that he has had a good knock in his first appearance at the wicket. It is not given to many Ministers to score, if not a century, at least a half-century in their maiden innings. The Minister has been helpful. As regards the second part to the analogy, I say that he has scored only a half-century, because my old master used to tell me that he never gave a straight A for work that I or anybody else submitted-not that he often had occasion to. The best that I could hope for was an A minus, because he only gave himself an A. The Minister has done well by the Committee in his response to the amendments.

<P>
It is encouraging that the Government are thinking about details in the framework of our wish to be broadly inclusive. I am especially grateful for the Minister's response to amendment No. 101. I am equally grateful for his response to amendment No. 100, because it is important for the Committee to know-I am not speaking from an ideological point of view-that it should be open to the LSC to use all the educational resources available without regard to any ideology about public or private provision.

<P>
On the general issue of the LSC's irredentism, I, too, would have reservations if the LSC blazed in and tried to take over the school sector. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere-who will talk about school sixth forms later-and many LEAs will share that view. My concern in raising the issue was to ensure that the Committee paid attention to the circumstances in which a mature person could be co-educated with somebody who was below the compulsory school age and to ensure that such persons were not ruled out. The Minister has given some helpful general assurances. We will want to study the record and it would be helpful if he and his officials could go through it as well as make sure all the points are covered. There is no material dissent as to the objectives of the clause. We are anxious to make sure that the details are correct. I think the Minister has made significant progress, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The mover seeks leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment, but before we consider that I thought I should say that the Minister was verging on match fixing when he tabled these amendments. I also looked at ``Wisden'' over the Easter holidays to check whether any of the games on which I had had a bet had not been fixed. I was hoping ``Wisden'' would cast some light on that and give me some reassurance that I had lost money in good faith rather than through stupidity.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Amendment made: No. 24, in page 3, line 41, after ``receiving'' insert ``or proposing to receive''.-[Mr. Hanson.]

</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendment No. 23.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am slightly worried by the fact that we agreed with the hon. Member for Daventry on the essential point of match fixing with regard to the last set of amendments. When I first joined the Labour party I was told that the first rule was never to agree with the Conservative party. Sadly, after 25 years of membership, I seem to have broken that rule.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 seek to correct a deficiency in the drafting of the funding powers of both the LSC and the CETW, as set out in clauses 5 and 34. I shall return to amendment No. 102 when I have heard what the hon. Member for Daventry has to say on it.

<P>
The Government want to allow greater collaboration between schools and colleges in providing secondary education for those aged 16 and under. That is important for children of compulsory school age, especially in relation to vocational learning. Colleges can supplement the school curriculum, thus making the overall package more attractive or relevant to the needs of an individual pupil.

<P>
It may be helpful if I consider in more detail some of the explanatory material that we have provided on clause 115. Young people can benefit from a range of provisions, and are likely to fall into one of the following three categories.

<P>
They could be young people registered at a school but who undertake some studies at a local FE college and for whom part of the national curriculum may be disapplied to allow them to spend more time on work-related learning. The hon. Member for Daventry, when discussing the previous set of amendments, raised issues relating to this circumstance. There may be young people who are not registered at a school, perhaps because they are being educated at home, have been excluded from school, or are being educated at an FE college under arrangements made by an LEA. There may also be young people who are not registered at a school and who may be educated at an FE college but not under arrangements made by an LEA.

<P>
Both the LSC and the CETW's power to fund such provision is contained in clause 5(1)(e) and clause
34(1)(e). However, as currently drafted, by referring only to ``corporations'', these clauses could and would exclude a very significant group of providers in the further education sector; namely designated institutions. We have already debated their important contribution to education and training, and it was certainly not the Government's intention to exclude them from participating in such activity. Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 correct this anomaly so that all institutions in the FE sector will be able to receive funds from the LSC and the CETW for the purposes designed in the amendments.

<P>
I have mentioned only the FE sector so far, but these amendments will also bring into the scope of the LSC and the CETW the funding of those institutions in higher education that are not HE corporations.

<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) is not present today, but Harrogate college is an example of the type of body that the Government amendments will include in the Bill. Harrogate college works closely with local secondary schools, but has formally been part of Leeds Metropolitan university since August 1998. I believe that the university, which is part of the higher education sector, is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central. Although it is a higher education corporation and would therefore be covered by clause 5 as drafted, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would have been concerned to ensure that it could play its part in collaborative and tailored secondary education, had it been constituted in some other way.

<P>
I hope that all members of the Committee see the importance of the Government amendments, which would introduce collaborative arrangements, and will agree to them. They will enable all further and higher education institutions to be funded by the LSC or the CETW for the relevant work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise briefly to speak to amendment No. 102, and to respond to the Minister's remarks on the Government amendments. I have no problem with them. He has sought to maximise the flexibility available to the LSC; we have debated that and generally think that it is sensible.

<P>
Amendment No. 102 is, in a sense, a probing amendment to enable us to debate whether schools should be directly funded by the LSC. The matter is contentious. There will be a series of debates on clause 7 about the funding of school sixth forms, but amendment No. 102 would preclude post-16 secondary education. It would confine the grant-giving powers-the provision of financial resources-to

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>schools providing or proposing to provide secondary education (other than post-16 education).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could apply to a school with a sixth form, in connection to its pre-sixth form provision, or to a school that had no sixth form but that might want to provide support or assistance to adult learners within the general duties that we have debated.

<P>
It is a matter of remark that a little more than half the maintained schools in England have a sixth form, and we shall no doubt want to return to that fact from time to time. The amendment is essentially probing and would ensure that nothing reasonable would be ruled out when examining the council's powers to make financial provision. It is no more than that; there is no agenda for an assault by the further education sector on the maintained sector in any sense. We would be grateful if the Minister would respond to the amendment and any matters arising from the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I rise to welcome Government amendments Nos. 22 and 23. The Government are moving in the right direction on an important subject. Colleges such as that in Harrogate mentioned by the Minister are expanding their range of courses and moving into the HE sector, which has enhanced provision in communities that have previously had much more limited post-16 education. We want to encourage that further, and to encourage institutions at the purer end of the HE spectrum to become genuine community organisations and community universities that work in schools and other sectors. It is important to break down some artificial barriers to enable youngsters to have a full range of access to all the educational institutions in their communities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman, and the Minister when responding, might care to tell the Committee whether the term of art that used to be described as ``mission drift'' places a restraint on the process. We are all interested in flexibility, but not in institutions making themselves completely different for no other reason than to pick up a new fad or chunk of funding.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that it may be a problem if an institution develops a lack of focus, but historically it has been the other way around: institutions have been too focused and have missed out on fulfilling crucial roles, especially in the community. The higher education sector, in particular, has at times seemed detached from the local community. It is keen to become involved and, especially, to talk to and work with youngsters of school age, which should be welcomed. If my understanding of the amendments and the Minister's comments is correct, that is what the Government propose through learning and skills councils.

<P>
Such developments will take place only once funding is available. Historically, some funding streams have been placed in silos, giving institutions an excuse not to engage in such work because they simply cannot afford to do so. That excuse is not their fault but a genuine problem. If our understanding is correct, the proposals should be welcomed.

<P>
The Minister's comments about the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough are appreciated. I am sure that my hon. Friend, as a strong supporter of Harrogate college, will encourage it to obtain access to funds that will be made available under the Bill as we expect it to be amended in due course.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful for the support of the hon. Members for Daventry and for Hallam for Government amendments Nos. 22 and 23. It is rare to have a full house on side. I especially welcome their support for the objective of the amendments, which is to widen the scope of the LSC and the Welsh council for funding opportunities.

<P>
Amendment No. 102, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry, would have an unintended effect. As the Government made clear in the sixth form funding consultation, we ruled out from the start a system of direct funding of schools by the LSC. Nor do we-nor, I am sure, does the hon. Member for Daventry-intend the LSC to fund schools directly for pre-sixth form education.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry is looking for reassurance on how funding will reach schools that collaborate with FE institutions to provide secondary education for under-14 to 16-year olds. I hope that he will be relieved to hear that schools will be funded for their part in such innovative and desirable collaborations. Funding will work in different ways according to the nature of the arrangements, but it will involve his objective.

<P>
For example, a school that approaches a local FE institution to buy that institution's services to support the school's own secondary education might fund that provision with money that it receives from its LEA for the individual pupils involved. Different arrangements may be involved under which an FE institution and a school together develop proposals for collaborative secondary educational activity. In such circumstances, the FE institution could approach the LSC for funding for the project, some of which the FE institution might pass on to the school as part of the agreement.

<P>
Funding of such initiatives will inevitably, and rightly, work in different ways, which is part of the creative approach that the Government want to promote. That is why clause 115 secures all the powers that FE institutions will require to engage in such joint working with schools.

<P>
I hope that the Government's general approach to amendment No. 102 reassures the hon. Member for Daventry, and that he will, as he suggested, support Government amendments Nos. 22 and 23.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 4, line 19, after ``any'', insert ``reasonable''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 103, in page 4, line 20, after ``training'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if at any institution of that preson's choice''.<P>

<P>
No. 87, in page 4, line 21, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(such as transport or childcare)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can move the amendments briefly, as some of the issues arising were touched on in earlier debates. However, it is worth spending a little time on examining the provisions.

<P>
The amendments relate to clause 5(3). Clause 5 gives the LSC powers to make financial provision to providers and to individuals receiving education and training. Subsection (3) deals especially with resources being made available to those receiving education or training. We make no bones about it; that is an important aspect of the Bill. We agree that the Learning and Skills Council should have powers available to meet the needs of individuals receiving education and training. The Government's amendments have gone further by giving the council powers to provide funds for those who are proposing to undertake education and training, thereby allowing initial funding. It is important that the needs of such people are met. However, one or two questions remain, which amendments Nos. 85 to 87 and 103, which are probing, are designed to explore.

<P>
Subsection (3) allows the council to pay for any fees or charges payable by the person receiving education and training. It refers to ``any fees or charges'', which should be explored a little. Clearly, a great deal of public money will be at stake. What mechanisms are available to ensure that only reasonable fees and charges are paid by the LSC? Likewise, in what circumstances will remuneration payments be available? The Bill stipulates two examples-transport and child care-and the Minister also mentioned payments for educational materials and books. We would like to hear a little more about what learning and skills councils can be expected to provide payment for, and, perhaps, what they cannot be expected to provide payment for. It is curious to give transport and child care as examples-important though they are-without providing a framework for making payments to which learning and skills councils can refer. Amendment No. 103 links the council's provision of financial resources to providers by reference to individual choice, which is important. Will the Minister comment on the role of individual choice?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful for the clarity with which the hon. Gentleman set out the reasons for the amendments. I accept that they are probing amendments. The purpose of subsection (3) must be seen in the context of the LSC's power in subsection (1)(c), which enables the LSC to give financial assistance to learners. The hon. Gentleman will no doubt be familiar with access funds, which we have expanded considerably since coming into office. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced last November that their expansion in 2000-01 will be up to £54 million, which is significantly more than our previous plan to allocate £38 million. Subsection (3) clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, the support for which the LSC may give financial assistance to learners.

<P>
Amendment No. 85 would restrict the fees and charges payable by the LSC on behalf and in support of those learners to those that are considered ``reasonable''. I appreciate the point that fees should be reasonable, but the amendment is in essence unnecessary. The LSC may not take on unreasonable fees or charges for a learner, because it must, by definition as a statutory body, act reasonably. If it proposed to take on unreasonable fees or charges, or if it acted unreasonably in any way, under clause 25 the Secretary of State and, ultimately, the courts might intervene. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
On amendment No. 86, I think that the hon. Gentleman wants an assurance that the wide range of other matters for which the LSC might give financial assistance to learners will be relevant to its functions. He will not be surprised to hear that we consider this amendment unnecessary, too. Clause 5(1)(c) is concerned only with post-16 education and training, which is a defined term deriving from clause 3(5) and 3(6), and by definition-

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Before the Minister goes too much further, I make it clear that the word ``relevant'' refers to ``any other matter''. The link is not to the LSC's functions as much as to the education and training that is received by the individual learner.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> By definition, the LSC may give financial support for other matters only if it is relevant to its main duties of post-16 education and training. It cannot give financial support to a learner for anything that simply takes its fancy.

<P>
I understand the purpose behind amendment No. 87. It would remove the examples of the matters for which financial assistance may be given. Transport and child care are significant areas of expenditure which support the direct provision of education and training, and which are both covered by FE access funds. Although it would probably not be actively harmful to lose the words in the way in which the amendment suggests, it might cast doubt on whether financial assistance could be given for both those areas. It might be helpful to remind ourselves that in some circumstances the deliberations of Parliament, including those of our Committee, can be taken into account by the courts. If Parliament removed those references, a court might take the view that it did not intend support to be given for transport and child care. I accept that that is not the hon. Genetleman's intention; it is certainly not ours. He can be assured that transport and child care are given as examples, and not as an exhaustive list of the areas in which the LSC can use its powers to offer financial support to learners.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have followed the Minister's logic, and I understand his response to my hon. Friend. Why, as a matter of interest, did the Government put in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such as transport or childcare<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when they continually resist any addition to such lists on the grounds that they are not appropriate to Bills? If the Government had not added those words in parentheses, the issue of Pepper v Hart would not arise at all.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I thank the hon. gentleman for his intervention. I understand his concerns, but I reiterate that such costs are important and that we want them in the Bill to avoid any doubt that they are covered. They are already covered by the FE access funds. We do not want there to be any doubt that they are critical to the provision of learning and support for learning for the groups of people to whom we have referred a great deal in Committee. I am talking about those people who have found it difficult in the past to participate in learning because of various barriers. We have found through long experience that such matters can create barriers for those whom we most want to reach through LSCs.

<P>
I stress that such matters are simply examples; they do not make up an exhaustive list. The LSC is subject to flexiblity. Both nationally and locally, it will be subject to the constraints that we have been talking about. They must be reasonable and consistent with the main duties of the LSC, and I hope that I have reassured the Committee about our intentions.

<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 103. Of course, we hope that all students will be able to attend the college or institution of their choice. I am sure that that is common ground between us, but also hope that it is common ground that realistically that will not always be possible. In large cities such as London in which there are many providers, most learners will have their choice accommodated. There are parts of the country, however, where such a choice will not be possible. It would be unfair to bar such students from what may be essential funding in support of their learning simply because of where they live.

<P>
The word ``institution'' may exclude support given to those who are engaged in learning in the workplace. For example, it may be difficult to describe a large manufacturing company as an institution, which carries rather different connotations. I am sure that neither of the points that I have mentioned was the intended effect of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. He wants an assurance that the financial support arrangements secured under clauses 5 and 6 will not be used to limit choice. I can, within reason, give him that assurance. We must ensure that public money is spent wisely, and we cannot guarantee support for a person who decides to attend an institution that is some distance from his home when there are many other more local and equally appropriate providers. In many cases, however, it may be entirely right to support someone to attend distant, specialist or residential provision when that is justified, and that will be a matter for the LSC. I hope that I have offered Conservative Members a sufficient explanation and reassurance on the various points that have been raised, so that they withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I welcome the Minister's response to amendment No. 87. As the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, we have seen a pattern whereby the Government resist putting anything in the Bill, so that they cannot be challenged subsequently, yet here they are being explicit both in the Bill and in their arguments in Committee about exposing the LSC to challenge by an individual consumer if it declines to provide assistance, especially with child care or transport. The individual consumer would have stronger right when seeking to assert, through whatever means are available, his right to such provision if the council denied it to him.

<P>
I agree with the Minister about the importance of transport and child care, and I welcome the fact that the Government are being so explicit. We have challenged them through amendments to other Bills to be more explicit about the rights of consumers, but they have declined to do so and said that they wanted the discretion to be left to Ministers and not put into the Bill. Perhaps they can take on board a positive leasson and establish clearly for the individual consumer what he has a right to expect and how he can legally challenge public authorities if such a service is not provided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The debate has been short, but worth while. I accept the Minister's assurances about amendments Nos. 85 and 86 and I am glad that we have been able to obtain them. He said that the provisions about meeting reasonable fees and restricting payments are covered elsewhere and need not be in the Bill, which I also accept.

<P>
Amendment No. 103 raises the question of choice. I welcome the Minister's comments on the subject. Individual choice is important, and I hope that the message will go out from the Committee that LSC institutions will do their best to meet individual choices when there are reasonable grounds for them. That seems desirable, and much weight should be given to it.

<P>
We have had a worthwhile debate on amendment No. 87. The Minister's response was slightly pre-empted by my opening remarks, in which I made it clear that I seek not to remove transport or child care as matters that can be funded but to clarify the position and to explore other matters that can be funded. We do not want to exclude them from the Bill and to prevent the LSC from funding them, but we are curious about why they were given as examples when other matters were not. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster made an entirely appropriate point about the subject. The Government's approach seems inconsistent.

<P>
I note the Minister's general attitude on the matter, but a problem might arise from judicial interpretation of it. It might be argued that other matters should be included in the provision so that they can be paid for by the LSC. Those who read our debates will say, ``Ah, but they weren't in the Bill.'' Including only some matters in the Bill leaves in a slightly weaker position those arguing for other matters to be paid for.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the remarks that I made. I said that the list was not exhaustive; we were simply drawing attention to the matters on it because they were important. I hope that he will reflect and acknowledge that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was going to acknowledge that our managing to extract from the Minister the fact that the list was not exhaustive was a worthwhile result of the debate. However, the problem remains.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way, and I apologise for not expressing my gratitude earlier to the Minister when he gave way to me.

<P>
Has it occurred to my hon. Friend that the fact that we are so used in opposition to being told that we cannot include things in lists-Ministers tell us that time and again-could lead us to keep our breath to cool our porridge and not table amendments to that effect? If we had not tabled amendments, it could then be argued that such subjects should not be considered.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend has touched on another inconsistency arising from the Government's stance. I do not think that the Government can maintain their position. I shall pocket for the future the Government's approach and the Minister's remarks in relation to the provision. I shall pray them in aid and ask the Government to distinguish future situations from this one.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 26, in page 4, line 20, after ``receiving'' insert ``or proposing to receive''.-[Mr. Hanson.]

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My question will be extremely brief, and might reflect on my lack of attention or my ignorance. I apologise if Ministers have dealt with the issue. The briefing from the Local Government Association mentioned the fact that the Bill has significant financial implications for local authorities. It referred to the transfer of funding for adult, community and sixth form education from local government to the LSC. It says that a further consultation document on finance is expected in early May. It would be helpful if the Government could shed light on that part of the process and on the likely timing of the consultation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I refer the right hon. Gentleman to my earlier remarks about the consultation document that we will shortly issue. I will not rehearse the five propositions again, but refer him to Hansard; I spelled them out at length earlier, perhaps when he was temporarily absent from the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Will the Minister respond to my question about the length of the consultation period, which obviously has an effect on future deliberations on the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I will do my best to answer it. I will issue the document shortly: I cannot give a precise date now, but it will be a matter of days rather than weeks. We intend that the consultation period will be completed in July. I hope that that gives the right hon. Gentleman enough reassurance.

<P>
This important clause has a simple purpose. It sets out the powers of the LSC to fund a variety of people in the fulfilment of its duties: legal persons, for example companies or F.E. governing bodies; and natural persons-in other words, real people. It would clearly be nonsense if the LSC had a duty to secure post-16 education and training and no power to pay anyone for providing it. The clause goes further than the funding of provision and gives the LSC the power, but not a duty, to fund other matters, some of which we have considered. I shall not rehearse now the benefit that some of those activities-including, for example, collaborative activity between schools, colleges and certain types of vocational, professional and higher education provision-would deliver to learners. I shall not rehearse all the details now. I hope that members of the Committee agree that the issue is set out in sufficient detail in the explanatory notes; I would be happy to refresh their memories by reading that out to them, but in the absence of any such clamour, I shall refrain from doing so. The clause is clearly important and it is important that it should stand part of the Bill. If it did not, the LSC's ability to carry out its core functions would be undermined.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 4, line 25, leave out from ``require'' to end of line 28 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any person receiving financial resources from the Council to provide the Council with such documents as requested by the Council as relate to their application for that financial resource;'.<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Clause 6 allows the LSC to impose conditions on the resources that it makes available to providers. The first group of amendments deals with the conditions that may be imposed under subsection (2) which, broadly speaking, are designed to enable the LSC to police the resources being made available to institutions and providers of education and learning.

<P>
We have in earlier debates demonstrated our interest in ensuring the proper use of public money. We are not opposed to appropriate policing mechanisms to achieve that. However, the sweeping powers in subsection (2) catch one's eye and it is important to examine them, their ambit and the way in which they might be used. Paragraph (a), in particular, contains a sweeping power that would allow wide intrusion into the affairs of the recipients of funds from the LSC. It enables the council to impose a condition requiring recipients to give it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>access to a person's accounts and documents<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>rights in relation to a person's computers and associated apparatus and material.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would give access to all an institution's documents and records, not only to those relating to the financial resources made available by the council.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I appreciate that the Minister may respond that we need such a power to ensure that resources are used properly and that everything is done appropriately. However, we should like to hear a little by way of justification, in particular as regards cases where a modest amount of funding would allow access to a wide range of financial records and documents. There is a nagging worry at the back of one's mind that giving the LSC or persons authorised by it such a sweeping power might act as a slight disincentive for some institutions to come forward as providers of learning and education. We should like to hear a little about why a general trawl through all the financial records and documents is justified.

<P>
Amendment No. 104 brings us to a slightly different issue. Clause 6 states that the council or person designated by it should be allowed access. We want to know a little more about the identity of persons designated by the council. We are talking about an important power, so we should examine exactly who might be authorised to use it. Who will those people be? How will they be authorised? What training will they receive before they are given authority to use the sweeping powers in the clause? It would also be interesting to know how the institution that is being investigated will know that the investigator is properly authorised.

<P>
Amendment No. 106 deals with the important issue of confidentiality, which also arises from the sweeping powers in the clause. Providers of education and learning will want to know that documents, records and materials will be considered confidentially by the council or a person whom it brings in. The Minister may say that the amendment is unnecessary because the duty of confidentiality arises elsewhere. If so, where? Is there any protection for confidentiality in the Bill or does such protection come from another source? The LSC or persons designated by it are being granted sweeping powers, and the Minister should say something about the important issue of confidentiality.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Some important issues arise in relation to amendments Nos. 78 and 105. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere discussed the powers given by the Bill, which are perhaps too sweeping. The restriction that amendments Nos. 78 and 105 would put on those powers is entirely reasonable and would benefit the Bill.

<P>
I see no immediate reason why access to documents and computer information should not be limited to aspects directly relevant to an application under the Bill for a financial resource. Does the Minister believe that there is a genuine reason why such a sensible constraint cannot be imposed?

<P>
Amendment No. 105 perhaps becomes more important if amendment No. 78 is rejected. If sweeping powers remain for learning and skills councils to investigate all aspects of the financial, computer and other documents held by the providers of education and training, there is surely a need for such information, once it has been handed over, to be handled with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality. The amendments are sensible. As I said, amendment No. 105 is more important if the Government resist amendment No. 78.

<P>
I wish to raise a further concern, to which the Minister should provide a specific response. The problem may not be an immovable obstacle, but the matter should be in the public domain and the Minister should be clear about it. Under the Bill, the learning and skills councils take direct responsibility for the funding of school sixth forms, which is presumably why those councils are allowed such wide and perhaps unfettered access to the documents and computer systems of local education authorities-the providers of the eduction and training resources that the councils wish to purchase.

<P>
My previous comments give rise to concern over the independence of FE colleges. Learning and skills councils might erode that independence or take advantage of and abuse the powers conferred on them under the Bill to obtain information in certain circumstances. However, concern must be even greater if the powers in the Bill apply to local education authorities and allow unfettered access to the documents and computer systems of LEAs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I, likewise, will be brief. Concern was expressed on Second Reading about the Bill's centralising tendencies. In due course, we shall need to test the Government's confidence that the Bill will result in bottom-up rather than top-down control. The Leberal Democrats have tabled amendment No. 50, which touches on similar issues, and we shall come on to it in a few moments. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere said from the Front Bench, and my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) from the Back Benches, the clause confers considerable powers on the Government.

<P>
About 25 years ago, I led a management buy-out of a firm for which I worked. The company had been founded in the United States and conducted about half its business there. It was important for the buy-out to transfer the central ownership and control of the firm out of the United States in order to give everyone the feel that it was a global business in which all parts of the world could play a part. That reflects what I call bottom-up rather than top-down control. I admit, however, that the powers on the Interanl Revenue Service allowed investigation of any subsidiary of an American company anywhere in the world if it was directly owned by that American company. That was a considerable power, but it so happened that the move that we made protected us from it, with some other adjustment. There is a considerable hazard in such arrangements, including those of the Internal Revenue Service in the United States. It is the fear of what is described by those on the receiving end as ``fishing expeditions''. The Government will need to produce fairly clear reasons and arguments for thinking that the powers are necessary, rather than the more moderate ones proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere.

<P>
<B>Mr Wills:</B> Until now, the Committee has taken a pragmatic and constructive view of the Bill. Many of the amendments have shown considerable ingenuity in their construction and in their probing to tease out the purpose of the Bill. With this amendment, I am afraid that we lapse into more familiar terrain, where ideological preconceptions are leading hon. Gentlemen astray. A great deal of needless worry and anxiety is being conjured up. If I may address the concerns in detail, I hope that hon. Gentlemen will see that they are becoming anxious about nothing, not least because amendment No. 78 was tabled in the same form in another place and exhaustively debated. Much reassurance was given then that has bypassed hon. Gentlemen. As a result, I make no apologies for repeating some of the same arguments, in the hope that they will be addressed directly and hon. Members will no longer have idealogical worries about the Bill that bear no resemblance to the facts.

<P>
It is important that all hon. Members have a clear grasp of what is at stake-the rigorous oversight of taxpayers' money, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere said. That is the central issue, and nothing should detract from that position.

<P>
I am slightly baffled by the anxieties that hon. Gentlemen are expressing about our desire to make sure that public money is properly accounted for and that the present Government-indeed, all Governments-have proper stewardship of it. I remind hon. Gentlemen that the provisions were also imposed by the previous Government. They not only apply to all further education colleges, universities and other higher education institutions, but form part of the contracts between the Department and TECs. Under present arrangements, further education colleges are required, as conditions of funding, to allow their books and records to be open to inspection both by the FEFC and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Colleges are also required to allow access to the Department's internal auditors to undertake inquiries and review books and records. They are necessary precautions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, not least because I did not participate in the earlier debate, when I thought that our concerns were well put. Will the Minister describe what would happen if information, however well-intentioned, was acquired inadvertently and then published for another purpose? One of our concerns is that a document may be paper-clipped by mistake or be part of a computer file that is not relevant to the inquiry and is then brought into the public domain and used for another purpose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for his characteristically constructive intervention. I shall come to that point in a moment.

<P>
The provisions already exist. Although phrased in slightly different words, virtually identical arrangements apply between the HEFC and all universities and other institutions in the higher education sector. Similar arrangements apply to TECs, their subsidiaries and any providers funded by them. It is part of the standard TEC licence that was established under the previous Administration. TECs are required to permit, and to require their subsidiaries and providers to permit, examination of the documents and records of the TEC, its subsidiaries and providers and provide oral or written explanations. They are also required to provide all other reasonable assistance at any reasonable time to representatives of the Secretary of State.

<P>
I repeat that the central issue is accountability for proper use of public funds. The relevant bodies that are responsible for such matters, or that monitor the way in which the responsibility is discharged, must be guaranteed access to the relevant data and information in whatever form it is held. The arrangements are well precedented, and there is nothing unusual in them. We have made it clear before that access rights are essential and are a long-standing part of the accountability framework for public funds. The only change in the present formulation in clause 6(2)(a) is an update to recognise the fact that, nowadays, financial documents and accounting records are frequently held in electronic form on computers and other forms of IT equipment.

<P>

</P>

<P>
I stress that the powers are limited only to information that is relevant to the purpose for which the funding was given. If the LSC were investigating expenditure outside its powers, it would be acting ultra vires. It can act only within its duties and powers. I hope that that reassures hon. Members. The hon. Member for Hertsmere made a specific point about investigators, who they would be, how they would be qualified and how they would identify themselves. Specialist investigators, forensic auditors and, perhaps, a special investigation unit from the Department will be employed. The contract between the provider and the LSC will specify that the provider must open its books to designated people, such as auditors, whom the LSC will specify. All of that is essential for the proper monitoring of the use of public funds, the proper prevention and detection of fraud, and the subsequent recovery of any misused funds.

<P>
Despite their explanations, I am baffled about why Opposition Members should continue to plough this furrow. The provisions are unexceptionable, and, if they were not made, we would be rightly castigated for being cavalier in the use of public funds.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister might be about to make this point, but will he confirm that the power given by the Bill will apply to local education authorities' documents and computer systems? Will he also confirm that it will extend only that far? Alternatively, will it also apply to schools that have sixth forms? Will it be possible for their books and computer systems to be examined directly, or will the power of investigation end at the local education authority?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I repeat what I said to the hon. Gentleman. The powers will be relevant to the purposes for which they are required. The powers will apply in relation to the provision of public funding by the LSC, but only to the purposes for which the funding has been given. If the LSC were to go beyond that, it would be acting ultra vires. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister is being generous, but this is an important point. He has confirmed, in a roundabout way, that the Bill provides a power to investigate the books, records and computer systems of local education authorities. As I said, that is not necessarily an impediment. However, will he confirm that the LSC will have the power to go only as far as LEAs, or will it also have the power to go into individual schools that have sixth forms to examine their books, records and computer systems?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I repeat the point that I made-[
Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman should concentrate on what I am saying; the powers will be given only where funding is given, and the LSC does not give funds to schools for the purpose of post-16 education. The powers do not apply where there is no direct funding but only where the LSC gives funding, because, as I have said many times, the purpose of the clause is to show that public money is properly protected.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is it not clear from clause 7(1)(b) that the council may make a grant
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>with a view to the grant being used for the purposes connected with the provision by schools of education<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does not the council have a right and a duty to discover whether an individual school is adequately fulfilling those purposes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Clause 7 starts by stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council may make a grant to a local education authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the powers of investigation relate to the fact that funding is being given, to ensure that there is proper stewardship of public money. I am sorry to keep returning to the point, but it is clear that the clause is about ensuring proper accountability of public funds. I am baffled by hon. Gentlemen who, characteristically, are-

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There have been five interventions on the same point. The hon. Gentleman may intervene if he wishes to clarify another point rather than to go over ground that has already been covered.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Benton. I do not question your judgment, but I put on the record that each of the five interventions drew further information from the Minister, which shows that the Committee is operating as it should.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My recollection is that the Minister repeated himself on two occasions when he responded to interventions. Subsequently, Opposition Members raised the same points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to get something clear, not to go over old ground. My understanding of the Minister is that the LSC will be able to ask the LEA to open up its books, but will not be able to ask schools to do so. If the Minister answers in words of one syllable for my simple brain, and if it is clear, I shall be satisfied on that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> In words of one syllable, yes.

<P>
I want to revert to the central matter of the clause; we are concerned to protect considerable sums of taxpayers' money. In practice, amendment No. 78 would deny the LSC the ability to inspect the relevant provider's records, whether written or held on a computer, in order to establish whether taxpayers' money had been used properly. It would substitute a power for the LSC to require providers to supply supporting information to their funding application. I assure hon. Members, however, that the power already exists in subsection (2)(b). The amendment is damaging for those reasons and, in the light of our extensive discussion on the matter, I hope that the hon. Member for Hertsmere, having received repeated reassurances, will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I feel slightly less forceful about amendment
No. 104; it is similar to an amendment tabled to clause 5 and, once again, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the word ``person'' includes individuals and any group of persons, whether incorporate or unincorporated. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales explained when we debated amendment No. 100, the definition of ``person'' is in the Interpretation Act 1978. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. We are clear that the LSC may designated either an individual or another institution to act on its behalf in the exercise of its power to impose a condition requiring that it be allowed access to a provider's account, documents, computers and associated apparatus and materials under the terms of clause 6. Again, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I am slightly baffled by amendment No. 105. If hon. Members follow its effect through carefully, they will realise that it seems to suggest-I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if this is a misinterpretation-that the council may impose a condition on itself to respect the confidentiality of information that it receives. Clearly the council does not need powers to impose conditions on itself, and so I assume that that is not what the hon. Member for Hertsmere meant. Indeed, he did not seem to suggest that it was.

<P>
Although the amendment is unnececssary and possibly defective, we fully support the notion that information provided should remain confidential if appropriate. There is already legislation to protect such rights-in the Data Protection Act 1998, for instance. However, it would be quite wrong to insist that the LSC should keep confidential all the information that it receives under the clause. If, for example, it found evidence of criminal activity or information that should properly be passed on to other authorities such as the police and the Secretary of State, it would have a duty to do so and should not be constrained by a provision in the Bill.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand our reluctance to put the LSC in a position where, on one hand, it has a duty to pass on information that it has received but, on the other, it has a duty to respect confidentiality in all circumstances. As I have already said, we are talking about the use of large amounts of public funds and the educational provision for millions of students. The LSC must be free to report problems as it sees fit. I am afraid that we can accept none of the amendments, although I hope that the explanations and reassurances that I have given will satisfy the hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am slightly puzzled by the Minister's response. I thought that I had presented the amendments in a reasonably moderate way and made it clear that I was trying to explore some issues that arise. The suggestion that there is some ideological motive behind them leaves me even more perplexed. I am not given to sudden and inexplicable outbursts of ideological frenzy. Even if I were, I am not sure what sort of ideological frenzy I am being accused of in these circumstances.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is inviting an intervention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I had better not take the matter any further, but I was not consciously contributing to the debate between capitalism and anti-capitalism that is raging all around us. I was trying to find out a little bit more about how the council would exercise the sweeping provisions that it has been given under subsection (2)(a). I am well aware of the debate in another place and of the justification and the explanation that existing institutions already have these powers. As the Minister will accept, the LSC's writ runs further than that of existing institutions; it has much wider functions. It has wide functions under clause 5, and subsection (2)(a), as the Minister has conceded, goes further than existing provisions. It gives
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>rights in relation to a person's computers and associated apparatus and material.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
One does not need to be the world's greatest computer buff-I certainly do not plead guilty to that-to know just how important, wide ranging and comprehensive the material stored on computers is these days. Often, if one has access to the computer of an institution or an individual, one may find out all that one needs to know about them. I make no apologies for exploring the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister may be more familiar with technology than I am.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman explain the difference in principle between access to a filing cabinet in which some files are relevant and therefore appropriate to be inspected, and access to a computer on which some files are appropriate for inspection but others are not?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As I have conceded already, the Minister is more familiar with computers than I am, but I understand that a far wider range of information is instantly available on a computer, and Parliament has seen fit to regulate their use. There are specific provisions relating to the use of computers, which answers the Minister's questions for him.
