</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister to move the sittings motion, it may help members of the Committee if I advise them of the arrangements that will apply to the tabling of amendments during the Easter recess. Amendments received in the Public Bill Office before 3 pm on Friday 9 April will appear on the blue pages in the vote bundle on Monday 12 April. They will accordingly be unstarred and may be selected for any sitting on Tuesday 13 April. Amendments may also be tabled before 4.30 pm on Monday 12 April, but such amendments would be starred for any sitting on Tuesday 13 April.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Immigration and Asylum Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is with great pleasure that I move the sittings motion that will enable us to consider the detail of the Bill. I am particularly pleased that the Committee will sit under your able chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, and that of your colleague, Mrs. Roe. As a result, I am sure that our debates will avoid tediousness and repetition and that we shall make progress on this important Bill.
<P>
I also welcome other members of the Committee. Some of them are new Members who joined the House at the general election. It is important that everyone has the opportunity to consider the detail of this long Bill. The sittings motion should give us adequate time to do that while enabling us to make progress and to deliver the Bill.
<P>
I particularly wish to welcome my hon. Friends to the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) takes a detailed interest in the matters before us as do other colleagues. I will be joined by the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) who will assist me and will deal with matters covered by his Department.
<P>
I welcome Opposition Members to the Committee, especially the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) who is a distinguished former Home Office Minister. He will be whipping for the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): It will be privatised whipping.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Indeed, and we understand what the right hon. Gentleman means by that. I am sure that he will be able to bring his distinguished knowledge of the issues to the Committee.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), who will lead for the Conservative party. He made a sensible speech on Second Reading that showed that the Opposition intended to be constructive during our consideration of the Bill. We look to them to fulfil that commitment. We hope to make progress, but we will accept constructive criticism when that is due and probing of our intentions when that is necessary. However, I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that most of the Bill is in excellent condition. The sittings motion will provide time to enable Ministers to justify their proposals to the Committee and will ensure that the Committee gets through its business quickly.
<P>
Not all Conservative members of the Committee have arrived here yet. They include the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) who was described in one of the Sunday newspapers&#151;I think that it was in The Observer&#151;as being more left-wing than me. That comment greatly amazed me, but I suspect that it will be more damaging to the hon. Gentleman's reputation than to mine as a new Labour Minister. However, I was certainly amused by it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is easy to be more left-wing than Labour now.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
<P>
We intend to listen with great care to the points made. The sittings motion gives us the opportunity for such a proper and constructive debate.
<P>
We have already shown that we are willing to listen to constructive criticism and to consider appropriate amendments to the Bill. We are anxious to develop, in so far as it is possible, a consensus approach to issues that have been enormously controversial in the past. One thing greatly heartened me before the Bill was introduced was that the leaders of the political parties signed up to a declaration that divisive and racist issues would not be raised. The hon. Member for Hertsmere made a commitment to that effect in his closing speech on Second Reading, as did we and the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
It is important that we have a sensible discussion about immigration and asylum issues, and that we consider in detail how to provide a system that is firmer, faster and fairer. We are committed to such an approach. I suspect that hon. Members will agree that we all seek such a system. If we examine the Bill in detail and consider the points raised during previous sittings of this Special Standing Committee&#151;the hearings at which we took evidence&#151;we will create a Bill of which we can be proud when it returns to the Floor of the House.
<P>
The scrutiny of the Bill by the outside bodies that gave evidence to the Committee was important. We are looking in detail at some of their criticisms and are also considering whether some of their proposed amendments are acceptable. I can tell hon. Members that we can respond positively to one or two points that were made. I will outline those points to the Committee when we reach the relevant clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I hear what the Minister says about the Government being prepared to accept amendments. He has conceded that the Government are considering introducing amendments as a result of the evidence that the Committee heard. Will he give an undertaking that he will table those amendments as soon as possible, so that we have a chance to scrutinise them before they are debated?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government will table their amendments in the proper way. I hope that we will be able to consider and to scrutinise properly all amendments. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, and I am sure that he will ensure that all his amendments are tabled at the earliest possible opportunity, so that the Government may consider them.
<P>
In many ways, the Bill represents the most comprehensive and radical reform of immigration law for decades. One of the main reasons for the failure of the current system is that, for too long, change has been piecemeal. The sittings motion gives us a chance to look at a comprehensive Bill and to examine whether it delivers on the Government's commitment to a firmer, faster and fairer system of immigration and asylum control. We need fundamental and comprehensive reform to tackle the issues that encourage abuse of the system, and to ensure that we are fair to those who make applications for immigration status or asylum.
<P>
The Bill is good news for genuine asylum seekers in terms of the speed with which it will deliver changes to the asylum process. It is bad news for those who seek to abuse the system. Our aim is to ensure that we balance the Government's commitment to a strong human rights record with our manifesto commitment to firm immigration control. Large, complex and detailed as the Bill is, we believe that it achieves that balance.
<P>
We want to speed up the system, make it fairer and strengthen the control. We have set challenging targets to ensure that the system is speeded up. On average, the initial decision on asylum will be dealt with within two months and appeals within a further four months. We aim to reach that ambitious target by April 2001, although hon. Members will be aware that there will be difficulties. We are also investing a substantial amount of additional money&#151;&#163;120 million over the next three years&#151;to speed up the process of dealing with immigration and asylum cases.
<P>
The Bill, which hon. Members will have an opportunity to consider in detail, introduces not only a single, comprehensive right of appeal, but other important appeal rights, particularly for those who wish to visit their families in this country. The right of appeal was abolished in the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. We do not seek to restore the old system of appeal, but to create a new system that ensures that those in this country who want visits from members of their family living on the Indian sub-continent or elsewhere have a right of appeal, if they believe that a decision not to grant a visa was unfair. We need time to discuss how it will operate. Hon. Members will also want to discuss our proposals to pilot a bond system.
<P>
Asylum will be the main issue that hon. Members will want to debate. The current support arrangements are a shambles; the pressure on London and the south-east in particular is enormous. We seek to introduce a new and more comprehensive system of support for asylum seekers that will reduce the cash incentive to some economic migrants, while supporting those making genuine applications. During our proceedings, we shall discuss the detail of the new system.
<P>
We shall offer accommodation on a no-choice basis. Hon. Members will no doubt want to question the way in which the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country will operate. The sittings motion will provide an opportunity to do that. We also want to set up a system to review or withdraw support. No doubt hon. Members will want to consider that in detail.
<P>
We also want to put in place stronger controls. The proposal to introduce a new civil penalty for those caught bringing clandestine entrants into the United Kingdom in lorries and other vehicles is tough but fair. Eight thousand people come into the country in the back of lorries, illegally and undocumented. A tough policy is necessary to crack down on that abuse. The proposals are controversial, and hon. Members will no doubt wish to debate them at some length, but I think that they are fair and can deliver.
<P>
We also want to enhance the powers of marriage registrars to tackle sham marriages for illegal immigration purposes. It is a difficult issue that we shall need to explore in depth, but we want to put laws on the statute book to enable registrars to deal with such marriages.
<P>
We must also deal with removal, on which previous Governments have not effectively delivered. Very few people have been removed. We have doubled the number since we took office, but we must still improve immigration control. Therefore, we are increasing immigration officers' powers to enable to them to undertake operations in relation to suspected illegal entrants without police officers being present.
<P>
We are strengthening the carriers' liability regime to include buses and coaches, and are providing new powers to facilitate debt recovery. There will be safeguards, too, which hon. Members will wish to discuss during the course of our debates. We must balance firm immigration controls with a strong human rights policy. We must regulate unscrupulous immigration advisers who exploit their clients and undermine immigration control. Hon. Members will wish to bring their own experience to bear on discussions of that issue. Providing advice in breach of the scheme that we are setting up will be a criminal offence punishable on indictment by up to two years' imprisonment, or a fine, or both.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill provides additional safeguards for those held in detention, including the introduction of a judicial element in the detention process, which will be implemented through a system of routine bail hearings and putting the management and operation of detention centres on a statutory footing.
<P>
The Bill seeks to modernise the system of immigration control and the processing of asylum claims, while ensuring a necessary degree of flexibility. The Committee will find the Bill lengthy and complex. We have already examined criticisms by outside organisations who gave evidence; the nature of that process encourages people to focus on criticisms of the Bill. However, I noted that substantial parts of the Bill were not the focus of criticism, and I hope that that signifies broad support for some of its provisions.
<P>
Maintaining the status quo on immigration and asylum is not an option: we all agree on that. I hope that we will make progress under the sittings motion and ensure that we produce a Bill which delivers the firmer, faster and fairer system that we all want.
<P>
I hope that the Committee supports the sittings motion, which allows adequate time to consider the Bill. I look forward to the Opposition's constructive engagement with many issues raised by this important measure. I trust that our considerations will do justice to the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I join the Minister in his remarks about your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, which we appreciated when the Committee took evidence.
<P>
Given what we were used to, we are now in reduced circumstances, although it may be wrong to admit that. I have not served on a Special Standing Committee before, and I suspect that many other Committee members are in the same position. However, I am sure that your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, and how committee business is conducted under it will be models of their kind. In addition, I am grateful for the Minister's kind remarks about my hon. Friends and me.
<P>
In light of the evidence that we have taken and the submissions that we have received, we must consider whether the sittings motion will enable us to do justice to scrutinising and amending the Bill. We must move with diligence on that matter, because we have a big task before us. I suspect that the Bill is the longest and most complicated measure ever to come before a Special Standing Committee. Other Bills that have been considered in such Committees have been shorter and less complex and have covered smaller areas.
<P>
The Bill is complex. The Minister has already adverted to its length; no doubt he is keen to present it as a fundamental overhaul of the system. Having examined the Bill clause by clause, I have reached the conclusion that much of it concerns bolt-on additions to existing legislation, which, in some respects, make only marginal changes. In other respects the Bill resembles nothing so much as a blank cheque that the Committee is being asked to sign for the Minister and the Secretary of State. It contains many order-making powers with no clue about how they are to be exercised. The Committee will want to know how the Secretary of State will use those 50 or so powers. The Minister owes it to the Committee to say more about that than is revealed in the Bill or the White Paper.
<P>
Careful scrutiny will also be necessary for us to digest the submissions from many different organisations. Useful evidence was given in the four evidence-taking sessions. Something like 120 other written submissions have also been made. We owe it to the organisations and individuals who took the time and trouble to respond to the press notice to read them carefully and reflect on them.
<P>
The Minister described the Bill as being in excellent condition. He also said that he would be prepared to accept some amendments. As to the first proposition, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. Perhaps comment should be saved until later when the Bill has been subjected to careful scrutiny and amendment. No doubt the Minister knows that a substantial number of mistakes seems to have been made in the text of the Bill. Perhaps he and his civil servants will look for them and remove references to schedule 15 and the like.
<P>
Above all, we owe it to the people who have given evidence to examine the Bill carefully. The Government will have to listen to them. Not many of the groups concerned were entirely uncritical of the Bill&#151;far from it. Many important suggestions were made for improving it. In particular, witness after witness criticised the asylum support and carriers' liability arrangements and the one-stop shop procedures&#151;to name just three important issues.
<P>
The asylum support system is clearly of great public interest. We shall be considering it against a sombre background. It was pretty sombre on Second Reading, but of course events have overtaken us and today it is even more so, given the terrible stories of thousands of refugees crossing borders in the Balkans as a result of appalling atrocities.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on reports in The Daily Telegraph today, and tell us whether the country has any contingency plans for receiving refugees from Kosovo. The Committee would probably appreciate knowing that. According to The Daily Telegraph,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Home Office said applications for political asylum would be considered on a `case by case' basis.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	`As far as I am aware, we are not making any provision to receive refugees,' said a spokesman.''
<P>
What is the position?
<P>
The Committee would also probably appreciate hearing a little from the Minister about what is now happening at Lunar house. He spoke of the Government's targets for dealing with asylum applications and appeals. Clearly, those depend on efficient administration. Nothing that has happened at Lunar house in the past year instils confidence that the targets will be met. Matters have greatly worsened. Last month we heard reports of the Home Secretary stepping in because of the problems at Lunar house&#151;the chaos of files having been lost and reorganisation having gone awry. In view of those serious problems, I would welcome a comment from the Minister, whose ambitious targets in turning round applications need to be set against that background.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about enforcement and he referred to changes in the removal system. However, he did not refer to deportation, which we will have to debate carefully&#151;and reflect in the sittings motion&#151;because the Bill makes important changes to the deportation system. Many cases that would have been eligible for deportation in the past will be eligible for removal in the future.
<P>
It appears that the deportation system has collapsed over the past few months. According to figures that the Minister gave me yesterday, as many as 67,000 cases may require enforcement actions. The number of actions enforced in October, November and December last year collapsed, reaching a figure of 45 in December&#151;set against tens of thousands of cases where deportation enforcement is needed. Will the Minister provide further comment on those figures? We will need time to consider what best to do about the chaos at Lunar house.
<P>
The Minister also mentioned carriers' liability, which we will also need time to debate. Those in the transportation industry are at the hard edge of the problem and they are, as yet, far from convinced by the Government's proposals. The Minister regards the Government's action as tough, but if he really wants effective action, he will have to carry lorry drivers with him. That will also have to be debated at length.
<P>
We shall also need time to debate the so-called one-stop shop approach to appeals&#151;an extremely complicated subject. It is easy to call it a comprehensive, single right of appeal but, on careful scrutiny of the Bill, it creates at least as many new avenues of appeal as it takes away. We shall need to consider how they fit into the overall picture and whether we are creating a multiple rather than single system of appeals.
<P>
All those matters will require careful scrutiny and our sittings must not be rushed, even though we should move expeditiously. It would be a mistake for the Committee, in attempting to examine so many complicated issues, to take on too much at once. I hope that we will not spend hour after hour going through all the complexities without having an opportunity to reflect on and digest the debates. We must do justice to the task before us.
<P>
We heard what the Minister said about amendments and we look forward to the Government accepting them&#151;not just tidying-up amendments or amendments at the margin, but amendments that show that the Government have listened to the considerable volume of criticism that has been directed at the Bill. The Government should show some sign of wanting to change the Bill to meet at least some of those legitimate and constructive criticisms. That will take time and if I were the Minister I would save any boasts about the Bill for later in our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I am also pleased that you&#151;as well as Mrs. Roe&#151;are in the Chair, Mr. Maxton. We have already experienced your able chairmanship in the evidence-taking sitting.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) said, this week's events are instructive in showing how refugee problems can arise and graphically bring home to us the human misery that can be caused to those who flee oppression. I hope that in our consideration of the Bill, we will remember that many asylum seekers have similar stories to those told by Kosovar refugees. At a time when the Government are keen to weed out those who do not have a founded claim under the 1951 convention, I hope that they will treat with humanity people who have suffered experiences similar to those of the people now fleeing Kosovo. We should not go too far down the road of the teacher who gives the whole class detention because one pupil has done something wrong. I hope that we continue to treat people as individuals. The situation in Kosovo also sets the context for this debate in that it highlights the problems for the countries that border Kosovo and other refugee-receiving countries around the world&#151;problems that are of a different magnitude from those faced by this country.
<P>
<H5>11.0 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Another key aspect mentioned by the hon. Member for Hertsmere was that we need to be told how Britain will respond. It is clear, notwithstanding the new provisions in the Bill, that refugees from Kosovo will, generally speaking, not arrive in the United Kingdom in any legitimate fashion that will enable them to claim asylum. Therefore some sort of co-ordinated European approach&#151;for example, taking only asylum seekers&#151;will be necessary if we are to play a part. If the Bill is enacted, that will increasingly be the approach that seals us into fortress Europe and, within that, fortress Britain, which will make it hard, if not impossible, for many of these people who face such terrible difficulties to arrive at these shores and claim their 1951 convention rights.
<P>
The sittings motion sets a timetable for lengthy consideration of the Bill. We found the evidence-taking sessions extremely useful. I hope that they will assist our debates by giving them a focus and that this part of the Standing Committee, having been informed by those sessions, will be more focused than others which have not had the benefit of hearing evidence. It confirmed for me the validity of many of my original worries about the Bill and made it clear that they require further explanation. I am pleased that the Government are to reflect on the evidence and I hope that they will take heed of many of the points that were made.
<P>
We hope to make progress and not misuse our time, but I hope that our progress will not be so rapid as to prevent our drawing on the wisdom and experience of many Government Back Benchers. There is sometimes pressure on time and an inclination to move the Bill through without the Committee hearing from experienced Back Benchers, many of whom I know have much to offer.
<P>
I am not sure that we would agree that the Bill is in excellent condition but it may at least be in reasonable condition at the end of our deliberations if the Government are as open to sensible amendments from any quarter as the Home Secretary implied in his oral evidence to the Committee in which he also said that he did not wish to play too partisan a game.
<P>
We do not wish to break away from the consensus, but, notwithstanding that and the need to avoid racist language and anything that would disrupt race relations, it is my duty to put my case from my political perspective of genuine Liberal concern for those who face oppression. That may mean that at times we shall need to be fairly robust in trying to persuade the Government to change their mind about measures that we consider contrary to that Liberal tradition of which this country can rightly be proud.
<P>
We are not convinced that the Government have got right some of the fundamentals in the Bill, but, where we are unable to change their mind, we shall try to ensure that the systems that will eventually be adopted are as good as we can get them. We do not wish the Immigration and Nationality Directorate or the new systems to fail, although we have many worries about whether they will succeed as prescribed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere mentioned the current position in IND. That must cause concern to hon. Members with constituents who have immigration business&#151;which must be all of us&#151;never mind those who want the Bill to end up with a faster asylum determination system. By pointing out that the system may fail, we are offering the Minister a helpful warning and encouragement to turn things round rather than an oppositionist wish for it to fail.
<P>
The key themes that we look forward to discussing cover three essential areas. The first are the measures that we genuinely believe are discriminatory. In this context, we are especially concerned about the Government's failure to use this opportunity to repeal section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 Act on account of which, when in opposition, they were extremely critical of the previous Government. They now seem to be failing to do anything about that.
<P>
The second key area is the overly deterrent measures in the Bill. Our aim is to have a system that processes claims speedily but not to make it impossible, or near impossible, for oppressed people to claim their rights under the 1951 convention. That will be our angle on carriers' liability although I suspect we may have allies on that who come from a slightly different angle. The third key area will be the breaches of the European convention on human rights now incorporated into UK law in the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
We were concerned in the evidence-taking sessions to see how many areas in the Bill some eminent legal minds working in refugee and asylum law feel run the risk of breaching the ECHR. We certainly would not wish to see this Government, who have committed themselves to implementing the Human Rights Act, being regularly dragged before the courts for introducing a measure that contravenes those provisions. Of particular concern in that regard are the rights to privacy, certain legal processes, such as the bail process for those held in detention and the Government's withdrawal of support where people take certain types of legal action.
<P>
We hope that the Government will listen to our concerns which we believe will be shared by many of their supporters both outside and inside the House. I am sure that under your chairmanship, Mr. Maxton, the arguments will be properly aired, but it is in the Minister's hands whether they are properly heard.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have no quibbles with the sitting motion. It is perfectly adequate for our purposes for the time being. I merely wish to make a small administrative point which is entirely at your discretion, Mr. Maxton. Room 14 is a large Room and many people may come to hear our deliberations. I wonder whether part of the bottom third of the Room be cordoned off for some of those people? It is entirely at your discretion and it depends what the Government think, but I am relaxed about it. I am particularly conscious that the Minister may have others in his back-up team and space at the top table is rather limited. I am quite happy if the part of the Room with the writing desks is allocated to the Minister's team who may wish to take notes and so on. I hope that that is a helpful suggestion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I will take that as a point of order so that I can reply straight away. That thought had already occurred to me. The strangers are a long way from us and it would be better if they were closer. The Clerk may be able to look at this to see whether we can put up a barrier at the next obvious stop down the Room so that they can sit on the other side of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Many of the issues flagged up by hon. Members will be dealt with in debate and so should be left for later. However, a number of points were made, particularly by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, to which I should like to refer now. He was right to draw attention to the current worrying situation in Kosovo. We need to ensure that we have plans in place to deal with any situation that may arise. Indeed he and his right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, who has also been a Home Office Minister, will be aware that the Home Office has contingency plans for such circumstances. They need to be adapted to the particular problems that arise.
<P>
We will meet tomorrow morning to finalise some of the details of how that adaption will take place. I am also seeking an urgent meeting with the UNHCR to look at its requests and also to consider any proposals that it makes. We have been receiving applications for asylum from Kosovo for about a year and a half. We have been able to deal with those cases quite satisfactorily and they are being processed in the normal way. We do not face large numbers at present, but the hon. Member for Hertsmere is right that we must be prepared for such an eventuality. Indeed, we shall put mechanisms in place to ensure that we are. We do not believe that many will come to this country in the immediate future. The countries that will receive the initial exodus of refugees are likely to be those on the border of Kosovo, and perhaps Italy as well. I know that Italy and other countries on the borders are making contingency plans.
<P>
This is perhaps not the place to go in detail into the difficulties at Lunar house, but perhaps I may refer to them briefly. We moved offices from Lunar house to the Whitgift centre earlier this year. The move caused some disruption, which is now being overcome. The public caller unit, for example, is seeing more people than it did in the latter part of the last year. I understand that it is breaking records for the number of people whose claims it can process in a day.
<P>
The backlog of post to which a number of hon. Members referred&#151;two weeks ago there were about 16,000 unopened letters&#151;has now been cleared. By and large the post is being opened on the day of arrival and then put into the system. Some of the letters are not being opened because they clearly relate to passports: they are processed in the normal way, but in any event would not be opened until they reach the case worker.
<P>
A far more difficult problem is that the computerisation of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, which was due to be completed 14 months ago, is still not in place. The targets for the contract, which was signed in 1996, have proved to be unrealistic and over-ambitious, and have not been met. Siemens has assured us that the system will be in a piloting position by June and hopes to have an effective system in place by January 2000. We await developments, but it is clear that it has not been the most successful of contracts, to put it mildly. We must now work through the difficulties that have arisen with Siemens and the IND managers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere is right that the problem may have an impact on the way in which we can initially deliver on our targets. We are still being advised by officials that we should be able to do so. We shall have to watch developments with the computer contract closely to see how it affects us, but we shall need to recruit many more staff not only to deal with the problems arising from the failure to computerise but because we are setting ambitious new targets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is not the place to debate all the issues arising from Lunar house, but much of the evidence suggests that in the new asylum support arrangements speed is of the essence. The Government have said in terms that what makes the new system acceptable is that people will be in it for only a short time before their case is dealt with.
<P>
If, for whatever reason, reorganisation and computerisation do not turn out as planned and things are not on an even keel for some time to come, will the Minister be prepared to consider delaying implementation of the new asylum support system, as, on his own view, its acceptability depends on the efficiency of the system?

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We have not yet reached the position where anything like that needs to be contemplated, so I am not prepared to give such a commitment. However, we are working with Siemens on a programme to ensure that the difficulties experienced as a result of the failure of the 1996 contract to deliver on time will be minimised and dealt with. That programme will help us to deliver our commitment.
<P>
To some extent we are in others' hands. For example, we depend on the ability of Siemens to deliver on the contract entered into by the previous Government, which we decided to continue and were bound by on taking office. It has proved a difficult contract to deal with. Siemens had some difficulties with its sub-contractors, as is well known. It is important for Siemens to deliver on that contract and we will do all that we can to ensure that it delivers so that we can process cases in good time.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about deportation. There are two types of removal from the United Kingdom&#151;deportation and administrative removal&#151;and statistics should show both. Deportees are people who came to the country lawfully and have to be lawfully removed by an order; whereas those removed are largely people who have entered unlawfully and do not have a lawful residence here. It is effectively an administrative process carried out by the enforcement section of IND.
<P>
We inherited circumstances in which many people had not been removed and we are trying to work out how best to deal with that large backlog. We inherited a shambles from the previous Government, which everyone now acknowledges. We now need to ensure that we put in place a system that works. That is why we are all here. We want a system that works not only for the Government and the taxpayer but for the genuine refugee. The taxpayer will be helped as a result of the Bill deterring those who seek to abuse the asylum system.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
