296, in

must consider making an order to participate in a restorative justice

so.</p>
               <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2AB) Where a court makes
an order under (2AA) it shall consider the views of the victim of the

               <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Sheridan,
on such a beautiful sunny morning. It is appropriate that clause 53 is
the first clause under part 3 of the Bill. It relates to the
needs of victims, and I am sure that all members of the Committee are
worried about how victims are treated under the criminal justice system
and wish to improve that
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000013">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment is to ensure that restorative justice is
considered in each case. Restorative justice is much spoken about
across all parties, but I fear not so much acted upon. Unfortunately,
the Green Paper “Breaking the Cycle” hardly mentions
victims. Considering where the criminal justice system is now, it is
unrealistic for us to jump to what we might call “victim-centred
justice”, and the purpose of the amendment is to take steps to
redress the balance, which is what the amendments on restorative
justice and the compensation fund are designed to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are three models for restorative justice. The first is when
the offender and the victim meet. The offenders make reparation and
offer an apology to the victims of their crime. The second model is
when offenders meet victims of similar crimes, not their own
crime, to make reparation to someone who was put in similar
circumstances. The third is when offenders undertake a course to enable
them to see things from the point of view of victims by learning to
empathise with other people. When they can do that, they are in a much
better position to deal with their own behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000015">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Sycamore Tree course, which both my hon. Friend and I are aware of,
enables a group of 20 offenders to think about the impact of their
crime on their victims. They meet a surrogate victim, and at the end of
the six-week course make a contract of restoration. It is the most
widely used restorative justice course in prisons in England and Wales,
but at the moment it has reached only about 2,000 offenders a year. Its
effectiveness is currently being evidenced by the Institute of
Criminology at Cambridge university, but the evidence report for the
Bill from the Ministry of Justice found that restorative justice
reduced the frequency of reoffending by about 14%. That is the
Minister’s own figure, and he knows that the course is a good
way forward. The most substantial reductions are for repeat offending,
serious crimes and crimes involving personal victims. The
Ministry’s research also demonstrated that restorative justice
saves £9 for every £1 spent, through reductions in
reoffending. That calculation was done using a cost-benefit analysis
and the Home Office’s standard model for the full cost of
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is evident
that this is one of the areas of the criminal justice system where we
will achieve long-term savings if we make a bit of short-term
investment. That is one of themes running through what will, I hope, be
short debates on this part of the Bill. All the time, Ministers are
saving money in the short term, but I am concerned we will end up with
higher rates of offending in the long term, with higher costs to the
criminal justice system and the community.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In our
evidence sessions, restorative justice was supported by the Magistrates
Association, by Victim Support and, with some caveats, by the victims
commissioner. The Minister will also be aware of the positive
experience of restorative justice in Northern Ireland.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000024">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
experiences of restorative justice are positive, we need to be
sensitive to the views of individual victims. Not every victim wants to
get involved in a personal restorative justice experience with the
person who offended against them. I held a seminar about the Bill in
Durham at which Support after Murder and Manslaughter gave me its
views. It strongly felt that restorative justice could make things
worse if it was badly handled. I therefore inserted the second proposed
new subsection so that the court must take account of the individual
victim’s views when deciding whether to go ahead with
restorative justice and what kind of restorative justice approach to

right when she notes that all members of the Committee should, as I am
sure they do, share enthusiasm for restorative justice, given the
evidence we have seen in all our constituencies, including mine. I do
not wish to strike a discordant note, but I can foresee one problem. If
the court is required to start considering the victim’s views
before sentence is passed, the problem is that the sentence might be
delayed. A better approach might be to pass sentence, make a
restorative justice programme part of any alternative to custody and
allow the victim to be consulted at that point. We should involve them
at that stage of the decision-making process, rather than cause a delay
between conviction and sentence, which is what the amendment could
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000026">&#160;</a>

there might be an opportunity to do so earlier in the trial.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000027">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend anticipates my point. Usually,
people think of restorative justice as something that is appropriate to
lower-level crimes, such as breaking into a car or bashing down a
fence. However, it has, as my hon. Friend says, also been used for
serious crimes. Personally, I cannot imagine that if I or a member of
my family had been subject to a violent crime, I would be particularly
enthusiastic about taking part in a restorative justice scheme.
However, some people are capable of great forgiveness; they are capable
of doing that. Obviously, that is admirable, but because these are very
sensitive issues, the important thing is to take account of the
victim’s
views.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
only experience of restorative justice was with a constituent who was
obviously an extremely troubled person. He went into the benefits
office and threatened the staff with a knife. He went into the council
office and threatened the people who administered housing benefit. He
poured petrol over himself and threatened 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 568<a class="bkMark" name="Column568">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to set himself alight. The following week, he came to my surgery, and
hon. Members will understand that I was slightly alarmed because he
started to threaten me. Obviously, I called the police. He was
sentenced and must have gone through an RJ process, because about nine
months later I received a very nice letter from him in which he
apologised and explained to me that what was driving his offending
behaviour was the fact that he drank too much. He now understood that
and was tackling
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
did not exactly feel that the way the man had behaved towards me and
towards other people previously was okay, but it was quite reassuring
to receive the letter, because I then knew that he was a much less
risky person than he had been previously. I offer that as a small
example of how the victim can benefit from restorative justice, in
addition to the improvements that we hope it will bring about in
offending behaviour patterns. With those few remarks, I urge the

                  </span> I want briefly to
support the hon. Lady’s amendment, which is entirely sensible.
Restorative justice is not an airy-fairy thing at all. It works in many
instances. I remember—this is a true story—a young boy
who had committed an arson offence in the constituency that I
represent. I was defending the young man. The owner of the property met
him and was appalled at what he had done, but they developed a
relationship whereby the owner gave him an excellent character
reference. The young man went on to take a first-class honours degree
at the university college in Aberystwyth. He is now one of the best
young poets in Wales. I shudder to think what would have happened to
that young man had he gone to prison. Would he have gone completely the
other way? Would society have faced another huge bill because another
young man had lost his way in life completely? That is one example with
which I am
familiar.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Not
so long ago, the all-party group on policing was told by a person who
had suffered a disturbing burglary at his premises and the burglar
himself what had happened; they were sitting together presenting their
case to us. The burglary took place in central London during the day,
which was pretty serious, but it also included violence, with the old
man being pushed to the floor as the burglar was making his way to
stealing whatever he was after. The elderly gentleman suffered a cut to
his forehead and hurt his arm, and the burglar left with his ill-gotten
gains.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000034">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
burglar was a career burglar; for more than 12 years all he
did was burgle and steal, and one would have thought that he was
totally beyond the pale and incorrigible. However, when it came to
sentencing it was considered appropriate to see whether restorative
justice would work. Although he served a sentence for the burglary and
the violence that it involved, it was a lesser sentence because the
victim was prepared to go through a scheme of restorative justice. The
index offence occurred eight years ago, and the burglar has not
committed an offence since. Indeed, he has become friendly with the
other man, they contact each other from time to time, and he helps out
with one thing and another.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000035">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The point
surely is this: diverting a career burglar by means of restorative
justice can work. I hasten to say that it will not work in every case.
In some cases, the victim will plainly never want to confront the
offender, but in many instances—as the hon. Member for Bishop
Auckland says, they are not only minor offences but serious offences of
the sort to which I have referred—it can and does work. At the
end of the day, society wins if we are able to divert career criminals
from serious offences, because it costs a lot of money not only to keep
those people locked up but in insurance premiums, compensation and so
on. It is huge amount of money. That is one example, but there are many
others. That case struck me as astonishing, but I have been told by
friends in the probation service that it is not unusual for that path
to be taken with such offences, and that it works.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I urge the
Government to accept the amendment. I say yet again that it will save
money. I fear that we are all labouring to save money. Crucially,
however, it will save a lot by not having to lock up people who are
prepared to follow the path of restorative justice. It is not a panacea
for all ills, but I firmly believe that in many cases it can and does
work. I therefore fully support the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000037">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Sheridan. I am sure that all hon.
Members will support the spirit of the amendment. It is generally
recognised that restorative justice can make an important contribution
to achieving sentencing objectives and reducing further offending. It
is an evolving area of law. It is not new, but it is developing and I
believe that we should do all that we can to encourage it. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland and the right hon. Member for
Dwyfor Meirionnydd said, it has been shown to be effective in a
significant number of cases. My hon. Friend mentioned that it was in
early use in Northern Ireland. The Prison Reform Trust examined the
practice of restorative justice and produced a report that shows what a
positive impact it can have on offenders and victims.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When I
visited Styal, I was struck by the impact the programme there was
having on women. I am not predicting that none of those women will ever
reoffend or that their lives will be easy when they are released,
because women in prison typically come from very disadvantaged
situations in the first place, and one restorative justice programme
will not deal with all the issues we face. However, a couple of things
struck me as a result of my visit.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First, my
hon. Friend rightly alluded to the fact that victims might be reluctant
to meet the perpetrator of the crime against them, but that was not the
case at Styal. A woman who had been the victim of a crime—her
son had been murdered, and I have huge admiration for a woman who has
lost her son in that way and is willing to participate in such a
programme—came in to run a session with all the women in Styal.
She was not their victim, and she was certainly not a typical
victim—she was an extremely remarkable victim—but she was
an impressive representation of victimhood. It is not essential and
necessary, therefore, that the specific victim of the crime should meet
the specific perpetrator, if that is likely to cause them great
distress; we can still design restorative justice solutions that work
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000040">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 570<a class="bkMark" name="Column570">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
there may be a concern, perhaps not in this Committee, where Members
are informed and understand the issues, but among members of the public
more generally, that such restorative justice is a soft option. As
everyone here knows, it is not a soft option, but even if that is a
concern, the fact that restorative justice can be combined with a
custodial sentence, for example, makes it clear that the punitive
element of sentencing need not be removed when we include a restorative
element.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have one
final thing to say. In the recall debate at the time of the riots, the
hon. Member for South Swindon suggested that restorative justice might,
in such circumstances, have a particularly appropriate place, and I was
struck by that insightful suggestion. Restorative justice enables us to
make a better connection between the crime and the penalty that the
perpetrator pays. As I said, this is an evolving area of sentencing,
and we can think imaginatively about the sorts of restoration that
could be included as part of a restorative justice order. It need not
be just a meeting and a talk with the victim; it could involve putting
things right physically.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I welcome the
amendment, which will be welcomed on both sides of the Committee, at
least in spirit. I very much support my hon. Friend in moving
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000043">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for referring to
remarks I made in the recall debate. She makes an important point about
restorative justice being wider than the defendant and the victim just
having a meeting or, indeed, meetings—it can take several
meetings to reach a resolution—but being about the need to
include actual physical reparation to the community that has been
damaged or
destroyed.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
my mind, restorative justice takes three forms. First, it can be
employed as a direct alternative to prosecution. That is not strictly
in the Committee’s remit, but we must remember it, and as we
speak it is certainly taking shape in local police areas, including
mine. That is a welcome innovation. Secondly, there is restorative
justice in the community. That could be part of a programme requirement
under a community order, and it could be at the discretion of the
probation service to organise that. Thirdly, as Opposition Members have
helpfully reminded me, there is restorative justice in a prison
environment. Those are the three areas where restorative justice is
relevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My concern is
that the amendment, although well intentioned, prescribes something
that, at this stage, is still better left to the discretion of
probation officers when they determine the form and content of a
programme requirement or a specific requirement under a community
order. Similarly, in a prison environment, such things should be left
to the discretion of probation officers, who will have daily or weekly
contact with prisoners. They will see and know how prisoners develop
and will know whether a restorative justice procedure would be
best.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000046">&#160;</a>

referred several times to probation officers. Across the country, we
are seeing a tremendous reduction in the number of probation officers.
Would it not be better to have something specific in the Bill that

                     </span>
                  </strong> The problem with the point
that the hon. Gentleman properly makes is that we will be
placing more burden at sentence stage on the authors of pre-sentence
reports. That is a problem because it is probation officers who write
them. It would be far better to allow probation officers, who are
working with the offender after sentence, to assess the offender,
particularly if they are a young offender, to see whether they are in
the right place to take part in a restorative justice
session.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland is absolutely right when she says that the
system has to be victim-led, but the offender has to be in the right
frame of mind too. It would be regrettable if restorative justice
measures were implemented at perhaps a premature stage in either a
community sentence or a prison sentence. We all know that most
prisoners or defendants on community orders will change their attitudes
over time, but I am afraid that some do not. Young offenders often
display a change in attitude and in maturity over the course of quite a
short community order or prison sentence. That has to be borne in mind
when we look at the merits of these well-intentioned
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments give parliamentarians a welcome opportunity to raise issues
of restorative justice in the House. It is vital that we keep on doing
that. As hon. Members have said, in this debate we allow the Minister
to focus his mind and the mind of the Government on practical ways in
which restorative justice can be expanded and enhanced.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Swindon
youth offending team have told me many encouraging stories about how
young offenders have been brought face to face not only with the
victims but with the consequences of their offending. In conclusion, I
reiterate the point to which the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston
alluded; this is not just some soft option but part of the punishment.
By bringing young offenders face to face with the consequences of their
actions, we are teaching them a proper hard lesson, which may be
something that they have never learned before. Let us not leave this
debate thinking that this is a soft option. It is part of the
punishment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000051">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I agree with what the hon. Member for South
Swindon said about restorative justice being an alternative to
prosecution, and that is particularly true for young offenders as it
will, where appropriate, keep them out of the criminal justice system.
What this debate has shown is that we are underusing restorative
justice because it covers a wide range of things. The right hon. Member
for Dwyfor Meirionnydd mentioned its use in quite serious offences,
which is an area that is not so commonly explored. If we think about it
in an international context and look at truth and reconciliation
commissions in countries around the world, we see that forms of
restorative justice have been used for the most serious offences over
many years. Therefore, we need to take it more seriously, which is why
I support my hon. Friend’s amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000052">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We have a new
Minister answering in this debate. I hope that he will be less
trenchant in refusing all amendments. Perhaps the shadow Minister will
be more persuasive than we have been used to over the past few days. I
urge the Government to support the amendment because we need to be much
clearer about the role of restorative justice. That may involve more
resources, which could be the reason why the Minister wants to resist
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000053">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
hope to go to Northern Ireland to see the scheme there. The Minister, I
think, has already seen it. Successful schemes involve an investment of
time, money and resources. We discussed mediation not being an
achievable alternative to litigation, and restorative justice is not a
cheap alternative to other forms of sentencing and punishment. Will the
Minister tell us what expanded role the Government see for restorative
justice, what resources they will provide, and whether it forms part of
the proposals for payment by
results?<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may have the figures to hand, but I understand that only a
small percentage of victims attend restorative justice sessions. That
must be a matter of choice for victims, but I suspect that, unlike the
Northern Ireland scheme, which has a much higher attendance rate, not
enough is done to prepare the ground or to make the circumstances
comfortable for the victim. Although that is not the be-all and
end-all, it is clearly an important part of the restorative justice
programme. We cannot have it on the cheap as a casual alternative to
other sentencing methods. Will the Minister explain what the Government
intend to do to ensure better facilities and a better environment for
victims taking part in a restorative justice
programme?<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000055">&#160;</a>

come to her assistance. Should she wish to visit Her Majesty’s
prisons Downview and High Down in my constituency, she is more than
welcome at any time to see the work that is being done
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000056">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
am delighted to reply to this debate, because it is clear that all
parties represented in the Committee are in the same place on the
desirability of a significant widening of restorative justice in the
criminal justice system. My right hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton
and Wallington is not in his place, but he and I have had several
conversations about that, and he has intervened many times on the Floor
of the House in support of restorative justice. Every party and every
member of the Committee are in the same place, and the Government are
sympathetic to the ambition behind the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of my personal objectives as Minister was to identify three
priorities for real focus and leadership from me. One is to deliver
work in prisons; the second is payment by results, and the third is
restorative justice. Those are relatively new, and have the capacity to
make substantial changes in how we deliver our criminal justice system.
Drive and focus will be required to deliver them and to bring them to
scale. I want restorative justice to be brought to scale, and the
assistance and support from the country’s political leadership
representing all the parties here will be immensely helpful in that
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000058">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am delighted that we are in the same place as 95%
of the public. That is an unusual position for me, but I am happy to
enjoy that level of support. The great thing is that the desirability
of widening restorative justice has been widely accepted by hon.
Members who take a keen interest in the matter, and the argument is
being won throughout the criminal justice system. As more and more
people become aware of it, it is being deployed more and
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are formally committed to increasing the use and
availability of restorative justice right across the criminal justice
system. It is an important tool to help repair the damage caused by
crime: it offers victims an opportunity to explain the impact that a
crime has had on them and it helps ensure that offenders face up to the
consequences of their crime. We are taking several steps, such as
improving its use in community resolution so as better to tackle
low-level crime, including through neighbourhood resolution panels. We
are also improving its use as part of, and in addition to, out-of-court
disposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are working with criminal justice partners to decide how best
pre-sentence restorative justice can be made available, when the
offender admits their guilt and all partners are willing to
engage—the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland made that important
point—to inform the court’s decision about the right type
of punishment. We are also building capacity for the use of
post-sentence restorative justice in the community and in
custody.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Crucially,
alongside that, we are looking at victims’ access to restorative
justice as part of our wider work to review the role of victims and
witnesses throughout the criminal justice system. The hon. Lady began
by saying how vital it is to focus on victims in the criminal justice
system. Of course, I absolutely endorse that. We should look at the
criminal justice system through the eyes of victims, and to a degree
that is what the criminal justice system is about. The hon. Lady chided
the Government for the lack of focus on victims in the “Breaking
the Cycle” Green Paper. All I can say is that, in their own
right, victims justify having a policy focus, which they will get when
we introduce a victims strategy later this
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the formal role of restorative justice in our system, which the
amendment attempts to reinforce, the courts already have powers to
consider its use as one of several criminal
disposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000064">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are trying to move away from enforcing top-down approaches on the whole
criminal justice system, because we have gone through a period during

line. 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>That particularly applies to restorative justice which, by its nature,
is most effective when it is based on how practitioners, victims and
communities want to respond to crime in their
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Increasing
the use of restorative justice is not about imposing rigid legal
duties; it is about supporting a culture change in the mind of
practitioners to develop and deliver effective restorative justice
practices that are rooted in local need and responsive to local crime
and reoffending, all of which can be achieved through existing
legislation. Indeed, restorative justice is not so much a course, which
is what the amendment states—the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland
said that the amendment relates to only one element of it—but
much more a process and an
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to reassure the hon. Lady and the Committee again about the needs
of victims, and I do not wish us to lose sight of the important benefit
to victims if they take part in the restorative justice process. The
hon. Lady is quite right to say that the engagement of victims must be
a voluntary exercise and will not always be appropriate. However, the
evidence from Northern Ireland, where there is a more formal approach
to the youth system, is that the levels of victim satisfaction for
those taking part are more than
85%.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000069">&#160;</a>

before the new system was introduced in Northern
Ireland?<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Back in 2001, I had the pleasure of sitting on the
Committee considering the Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill, and of
speaking for Her Majesty’s Opposition. The system implemented a
formal conferencing process. When considering whether that option was
appropriate for England and Wales, we had to wrestle, regrettably, with
the issue of resources. A formal conferencing system is expensive, and
we do not have growing resources. The huge difficulty with trying to
advance things through mandate and legislation is that that would
impose costs on the system that it cannot afford at the moment. We want
to deliver the changes through a different approach, by winning the
argument for a change of culture on restorative justice in the system.
As we can see, that has happened in this Committee, and it is happening
throughout the criminal justice system as people start to consider
whether they can deploy restorative justice in their area.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
good examples. The Thames Valley probation trust, for example, is doing
good work on the issue, and the same is happening in Norfolk. We have
heard examples from Committee members of the use of restorative justice
in their areas. Courses are being given in prisons, as the hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston told the Committee. It is happening all over
the system. We are trying to extend the practice, and I will explain
how we want to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000073">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Part of the
process must focus on the victim. I am interested in how the
involvement of victim and offender at the end of a successful
restorative justice process could be extended in the criminal justice
system. When the process has taken place between offender and victim,
that should be included in the pre-sentence report to help inform the
court’s
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
we are only beginning to create restorative justice capacity in our
system. The first graduates of the Ministry of Justice-supported
programme completed the programme on Tuesday. Had I not been here, I
would have been there. Unfortunately, as I was detained here, they had
to put up with a filmed version of my speech congratulating them. I was
told that it went extremely well, and I was happy to write to all the
graduates of the scheme to thank them for taking part and acquiring
those qualifications.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Alongside
that first course, the National Offender Management Service is
accelerating plans to build capacity for training staff to deliver more
restorative justice interventions in the community and in custody. We
must reflect carefully on how to widen the application of restorative
justice using a law, and whether it will prove possible to take that
approach. I will keep the matter under review as we continue to build
capacity and look for and deliver resources to support it. That is what
the Ministry of Justice is doing. We are one of the principal funders
of the programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000076">&#160;</a>

am pleased that the Minister supports restorative justice. I do not
doubt his sincerity, but I am worried that his approach will not
deliver the goods. He argued that he does not want legislation and that
he has no money, but that he wants to change the culture. When people
talk about culture change, it often means that they want something to
happen, but they do not quite know what. It is a catch-all for not
taking action. Sometimes, changing the law is an instrument for
changing culture; it is not a result of a changed
culture.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000079">&#160;</a>

have had conversations with magistrates in Sunderland. They were dead
keen on restorative justice, but could not understand why victims did
not all rush forward and go for it. I know why they do not rush forward
and go for it, and I appreciate the Minister’s remarks about the
importance of professional judgment. I also share the concern that the
criminal justice system, if we do not take a uniform approach, will
have pockets of good practice and pockets of bad practice. If we
explore the criminal justice system, we will see pockets of good
practice in all parts. The trick is how to turn them into common
practice throughout the whole system. I hope that that is a major part
of how the Minister conceives

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is one of those provisions that replicate, in the Armed

on when Government amendments replicate provisions in the 2006 Act I
shall move them formally. If members of the Committee want to question

                  </strong> As we had notice of the amendments very late, I
want to ask the Minister whether he proposes to make changes that
exactly translate provisions of the Bill so that they apply to the
armed forces. Are there any
differences?<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000104">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> There should be no differences. The technical
amendment inserts in section 175 of the 2006 Act a provision very
similar to the one that clause 53 inserts in section 130 of the Powers
of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. The effect of the amended
clause is that both civilian criminal courts and service courts will
have a duty to consider making a compensation order in any case where
they have the power to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As with other
Government amendments to part 3 on armed forces legislation, the
resulting clause is designed to ensure that sentencing law and the
practice of the service courts will, where practicable, be aligned with
the law and practice of civilian courts in England and Wales. The hon.
Lady will have noticed the minute qualification that I entered. To all
intents and purposes the effect will be the same, but such is the

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendment and new clauses would establish a
compensation fund for victims. We have heard numerous complaints from
victims and victims organisations about the way compensation is
paid—or rather is not. It is frequently not paid at all, and
often it is paid only in part. The money comes, as Victim Support told
us in its evidence, in dribs and drabs.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is not
just a financial problem but an emotional one. A cheque for small
amounts such as £5 or £10 a week is a constant and
regular reminder to the victim of the crime—a reminder that,
frequently, they do not
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Magistrates’ Association has provided some numbers, which it
says are from the Ministry of Justice. At the moment 16% of all
offenders are ordered to make compensation payments, and on
average they are required to pay £418. In the case of summary
offences only, the figure is 24% of offenders, whose average payment is
£86. About 40% of the compensation is paid in the year when it
is imposed. However, because of the poor payment record, the amounts
outstanding are now between £120 million and £150
million. That is money to which victims are entitled and that they are
missing.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
our evidence sessions, Victim Support, the national organisation, said
quite clearly that it wanted a compensation fund, as did the victims
commissioner, the official who is meant to represent the interests of
victims. The Magistrates’ Association gave particularly
interesting examples of the kind of problems faced at the moment, of
which this is
one:<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000114">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“Alan

               <p class="hs_brev">The

of the goods. This was not given. Instead a Compensation Order was made
for the goods that had been stolen and that were not
insured.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">As

‘whistle for his money’, that he’d already packed

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">So
far, the victim—Alan—has received £35. He has
engaged a private detective to investigate Sean. He discovered that
Sean has moved to another part of the country, where he is earning and
also receiving benefits. He lives comfortably, drives a nice car,
which, in Alan’s view, is a real example of a situation where
crime pays. Not surprisingly, he is deeply unhappy with the criminal
justice system. Such cases undermine the confidence not only of victims
but of the public as a whole in the criminal justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000116">&#160;</a>

SAMM, the organisation I mentioned earlier, has described its operation
as “faceless” and “judgmental”. Louise
Casey, in her evidence to us in preparation for the Bill, said that
when she surveyed victims’ families in murder and manslaughter
cases, 50% of them said that complexity adds insult to injury.

get compensation because the state cannot run a decent

Minister will say that this is another example of the Labour Opposition
throwing money at a problem, and that he has to take account of the
pressures he is under from his Treasury colleagues, but the amendments
need not imply a cost to the Exchequer. We are talking about a cash
flow problem. This is not an additional public spending commitment; it
is a re-profiling, which is what victims want. We are not saying that
the state should pay; we propose a system in which the state
underwrites the payments to speed them up, and then recovers them,
which could be done in several ways. The voluntary sector groups that
gave evidence to us said that they wanted 100% of the money up front,
but we could give people 50% at the outset and 50% five years down the
track, thereby at least introducing some certainty into the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000125">&#160;</a>

think about that in more detail, and the Minister needs to consider how
he would do it in such a way as to sell the idea to his colleagues in
the Treasury. Alternatively, he could follow the proposal made by the
Magistrates’ Association, and wrap up the compensation fund with
the victim surcharge. The association has also suggested extending the
surcharge. All those measures would enable the Minister to do what
victims want, while at the same time satisfying his colleagues in the
Treasury.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000126">&#160;</a>

Insufficient priority is, and has been, given to the matter, and Her
Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service simply does not give it
the management priority it ought to have. By establishing a
compensation fund and, as it were, putting the compensation through the
Ministry of Justice accounts, we would change the incentives for
Ministers and officials—and consequently change their
behaviour—to sort the problem
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
clause, unamended and unadorned, is possibly the emptiest in the Bill.
No doubt the Minister’s response would be that under the Powers
of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 a court may make an order for
the offender to provide compensation, and that he is changing that
“may” to “must”. The officials might have
briefed him, and I do not know whether he has looked in detail at
section 130. If he looks at it more carefully, however, he will see
that the measure is disingenuous, because the court
already</p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“shall give

               <p>In effect, therefore,
it “must” give reasons for not making such an order. The
clause is empty; we want to give it some bite and we want an effective
compensation system. I hope that the Minister wants to be in line with
95% of the victims who have thought about the matter and that he will,
therefore, accept the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000129">&#160;</a>

problem of collecting fines and compensation. I have met the Minister
over the past twelve months in my role as Chair of the justice unions
parliamentary group, because there was much concern about the huge
number of uncollected fines and amount of compensation, which rather
makes a mockery of the law. That, at least, needs to be put right to
begin with. I hear what the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland has said.
Victims feel badly let down when they see perpetrators continuing to
live well-funded lifestyles while making those payments only in dribs
and drabs.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Whatever
comes of this debate, the collection of compensation and fines must be
improved, however the Government do it. We hope that they will not do
that by outsourcing, but by ensuring that each magistrates and Crown
court district has targets, and that officials apply their minds to
bringing in that money. With the purport of the amendment in mind, I
repeat what Sally Gimson, the then chief executive of Victim Support
told the Committee. Victim Support’s view is
that<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
Bill could have done more to make provision for the victims
compensation fund. We are happy that there is a duty for the
compensation fund, but we are worried that victims will not necessarily
get the money and that there is no means to enforce that better than at
the moment. The Government have not done that, and it is a missed
opportunity, because victims tell us that money comes through from
offenders in dribs and drabs. We would like there to be a compensation
fund, so that the money is funded up front and so that the fund would
get the money from the
offenders.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Legal

               <p class="tabbed">The reference
to an empty clause is not without force, because if current enforcement
is so bad, merely providing in the Bill that there must be
consideration of compensation does not take us very far down the road.
More must be done to underpin the clause, and the amendment would be
perfectly good at doing that. Perhaps, as the hon. Lady has said, we
must move money from one area to another, but in doing so, we must
ensure that people who have been through difficult situations do not
have to face the hurtful prospect of knowing that
there is a compensation order of £500, but they have received
only £5 a year. That happens—it is hurtful and it
makes people think that the criminal justice system is
falling apart. The Minister will appreciate that this is an important
subject. I, too, will be interested to hear his response.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000133">&#160;</a>

said that this particular provision is empty. That smacks of
contradiction in the presentation of her arguments. We are sending a
firm signal that we expect sentencers to hold offenders to account to
their victims, and that the first duty of the court in sentencing must
be to consider what compensation is due from the offender to the
victim. The purpose of the clause is to send the clearest possible

offenders to their

because, plainly, given the number of people who have made the case, it
needs to be taken seriously. I assure the Committee that I have
carefully considered the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment and the two new clauses seek to establish a compensation fund
from which court order compensation will be paid directly to a victim
when an order for compensation has been made by the court. We have
considered carefully the proposal to establish a new victim
compensation fund, as the idea undoubtedly has merit. Such a fund would
allow court order compensation to be paid immediately to the victim by
the Ministry of Justice and then recovered from the offender. That has
two challenges, one practical and the other a matter of approach or
what I call philosophy, but the practical issues are the most
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
let us be clear that the clause strengthens the duty to consider
compensation. That will have an effect, sending the clearest signal
about the intention of Parliament if the clause is passed. Today, we
have a situation in which £30 million in compensation is ordered
every year. I expect that figure to rise as a result of the Bill, but
we cannot predict by how much. Equally, if sentencers knew that the
Government would automatically pay compensation, they are highly likely
to impose much greater sums, knowing that the victim will receive
them, irrespective of the offender’s ability to pay.
That approach has superficial attraction, but the practical effect
would be to inflate significantly the £30 million in
compensation currently ordered each year. There would be a growing
shortfall between the amount paid by the state and what could sensibly
be recovered from the
offender.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000138">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Why does the Minister think that a court would
award a compensation level above what the individual could
afford? Why would that change? That does not seem correct, because the
court is currently duty-bound to look at the individual when awarding
compensation.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000139">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I agree with the hon. Gentleman to the extent that
that is what the courts should do, but sentencers are, after all,
human, and we have a substantial number of lay magistrates who are from
the community and who are not immune to an extremely deserving victim
appearing before them. I suspect that if they knew that the victim
would receive the compensation that they had ordered, irrespective of
the state’s ability to recover it from the offender, there would
be a change in behaviour. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that that
should not take place and the behaviour should not change. I just posit
it to the Committee that because we 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 582<a class="bkMark" name="Column582">&#160;</a>

sentences that are too tough is limited to a rather small number of
cases. Obviously, it would not apply in every case. In law, the hon.
Gentleman is completely correct. However, we are dealing with people,
who face highly deserving victims, whom everyone feels should have
proper compensation. All I am positing is that if they knew that
victims would receive that compensation, there would possibly be a
change in behaviour. That behavioural change might be quite
substantial. We do not know what would happen. That is the point that I
want to make to the Committee. We are dealing with what Mr Rumsfeld

the shortfall was, it would have to be covered, and inevitably it would
come from funds that would otherwise be available to help victims
recover from crime by providing emotional and practical help and
support when they need it most. Available funds are best used to
provide those services for victims. The Government are concerned that
these proposals would guarantee payments to some victims where there
was a successful prosecution, at the expense of services to all
victims, regardless of whether the criminal justice system could bring
the offender to justice to the standard of “beyond reasonable

but let us deal with the canard that no money whatever is recovered by
Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service. The Courts and
Tribunals Service is not as unsuccessful in ensuring that victims
receive what has been ordered as one might think from the tenor of the
debate. For the year to March 2011, the payment rate for all financial
penalties by value, excluding administrative cancellations, was 80%,
and the Department, led energetically by the Under-Secretary of State
for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, has a clear
strategy to improve that
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of
course, the enforcement of compensation orders is prioritised above all
other financial penalties; they come first. The Courts and Tribunals

deductions from benefits or attachment of earnings orders for all
offenders sentenced to pay compensation. We should not consider the

Pensions, to try to improve those arrangements further, which should
benefit victims of

me describe the general approach or what one might call the
philosophical approach to this issue. We, as a coalition, are trying to
widen the exercise of personal responsibility. To have the state step
in to exercise that function is not consistent with that. While I
accept that there is a problem with victims receiving limited payments
of compensation, as was adduced in the debate, for the state to take on
the delivery of that function is inconsistent with having citizens,
including offenders, face up to their individual
responsibility.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know that that argument is a matter of judgment and balance, but it is
relevant when we consider what we should do about the problem that some
victims face. Combined with the fact that we are not yet in a position
to know the extent of liability that the state would be taking on, the
current economic circumstances regrettably preclude us from accepting
the amendment and its approach today. In the light of the circumstances
that we face, I ask the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland to withdraw her

difficulties with that. I hoped that the Minister would explain his
strategy for collecting the moneys. I hoped that, because the victims
group has been raising the matter consistently over many months, both

turn their attention to it. The fact that the Minister does not even

in the public domain. Outstanding at 1 April 2008 was £126

involved in the matter. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to vote for the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11091556000151">&#160;</a>
