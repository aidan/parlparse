<H4><center>Tuesday 6 July 1999</center></H4>

<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>

<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>

<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/117/1999117.htm">Food Standards
Bill</a></center></H3>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Before we resume the debate on clause 5 stand part, it may be helpful if I remind the Committee that, although this Friday is a non-sitting day, the Public Bill Office will be open between 11 am and 3 pm to receive amendments. Amendments tabled by 3 pm on Friday will not be starred for our sittings next Tuesday, 13 July.

<P>
l have received a letter from the Minister for Public Health saying that other ministerial duties will prevent her from attending Committee this morning and for the first of this afternoon's sittings. Being made aware of that fact is a courtesy that I appreciate and I should be grateful if it could be made a matter of record.

<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>

<H4><center>Advisory committees</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed  [1 July], That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question again proposed.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I shall do my best to respond to the key points that were made in last Thursday's debate without encroaching on future debates on schedule 2. However, of necessity, I shall have to refer to certain issues that were raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown).

<P>
The idea of setting up advisory committees for Scotland and Wales is one that the Opposition have probed, and rightly so. We defend their establishment on the grounds that there are differences between the devolved areas, especially Scotland. Under the general committee structure, scientific advice will be given on a United Kingdom-wide basis, but it will refer occasionally to the devolved areas.

<P>
The regional committee structure that we are proposing will play a useful role in providing sources of local expression and will be a channel of advice to the agency. I do not have the figures to hand, but it is well known that there is a greater prevalence of problems associated with E.coli O157 in Scotland than in England and Wales.

<P>
A year ago, I sent all hon. Members a copy of our Food Research News, No. 4, 1998, which made it abundantly clear in one of its charts that food poisoning in Scotland is twice the rate per head of population as that in England and Wales.

<P>
Such factors go right across the divided committee structure, but the two examples that I have cited show good grounds for devolved areas to have their own advisory committee to concentrate on local issues and for them to be a channel by which to transmit issues from, say, the Scottish Parliament and Executive to the Foods Standards Agency executive director for Scotland and, hence, to the other United Kingdom bodies. That is an effective argument for having such advisory committees, particularly in Scotland. The argument could be put for Wales on the grounds of devolution and equality, but I do not think that there are grounds for arguing for a separate committee for England.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): In some ways, we have reached the key issue concerning the setting up of the agency. I accept what the Minister said about the outbreak of E.coli O157 in Scotland, but does he expect that such a situation would lead to different advice being given by the Food Standards Agency in Scotland or Wales, with different enforcement--in other words, different policies? The Minister assured us in earlier debates that it would be a UK-wide agency. Does he now suggest that, rather than there being different problems in various parts of the country, there may be variations in policy?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The short answer is yes, depending on circumstances. For instance, the inquiry into the outbreak of E. coli O157 that led to 22 deaths resulted in a change in national policy. Changes in the registration and licensing of retail butchers resulted from that one incident because national lessons needed to be learned. That is not to say, however, that different policies could not be imposed on specific areas. For instance, the number of reported food poisoning cases per head of the population in Scotland is twice the UK rate. The advisory committee may want to draw attention to particular factors. It is not a scientific advisory committee. It will act as a channel of advice for the agency for the problems of various parts of the UK.

<P>
The answer may be yes, but a UK-wide agency should reflect our differences and not impose totally uniform procedures. For instance, a different law has been in place in Scotland since 1983 for the drinking of raw milk. That is a classic example of the law being dependent on a decision made in Scotland. It will be nothing to do with the UK agency. It will be a matter for the devolved Parliament, which will obviously receive advice and consultation. Just because it is UK-wide agency does not mean that its decisions are uniform.

<P>
As a result of negotiations in Brussels, our obligations to the European Union are another reason for needing a UK-wide agency. However, the Bill provides that the devolved bodies have the right not to follow the agency's advice. The Scottish Parliament has only just assumed its powers, but from early debates it seems that it wishes to have the benefits of a UK-wide agency that respects the devolved Administration. Perhaps I should not call them regional committees, but they will have a useful role as a source of local advice and information. The agency can therefore touch base with Scottish and Welsh opinion in a way that would not otherwise be available to it.

<P>
As I said in an earlier debate, except for the chairman, the deputy chairman and the devolved members, the members of the board are not English members but UK members. The agency's headquarters may be based in England, but that is no justification for the English having a committee, as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have for their devolved authorities.

<P>
I do not criticise the hon. Member for Cotswold but it is a pity that he is not here. He and other Conservative Members made great play of the Library briefing paper, especially of appendix 4, which lists the committees. The Veterinary Products Committee and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides are statutory committees; the non-statutory committees are listed on page 85. The point is that, bar one, all of those committees exist now.

<P>
<H5>10.39 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended.

<P>
<H5>10.58 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> After the excitement of the fire drill, we shall now resume the debate on clause 5 stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I set myself a time limit to respond to the clause, but we were interrupted. The point that I was coming to was raised by the hon. Member for Cotswold and some of his hon. Friends regarding paragraph 7 of schedule 2. I shall not dwell on the schedule because we shall deal with it in due course.

<P>
All the committees listed in the Library briefing, save one, currently exist. None is new. Two are statutory and the rest are non-statutory. The one that does not exist is the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs, which we are in the process of setting up. Paragraph 7 will transfer the existing committees, all of which have their membership appointed under known principles, following advertisements or, sometimes, a trawl of up to a couple of hundred different organisations. When the Food Standards Agency is set up, the committees will be in place, so there is no argument about having to start them all again or about the terms of membership. Most terms of membership are for three years, usually two, with two sittings and, exceptionally, a third.

<P>
The rest of the schedule gives the FSA the power to abolish, merge and create new advisory committees on its own volition, without need of ministerial instructions. The purpose of paragraph 7 is to give powers not to the Secretary of State or the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but to the two Ministers to direct the advisory committees that are set up and which are listed in the Library briefing to become advisory committees to the agency. After that, the agency has exclusive say on what it will do.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Separate from that, there are procedures to set up the two commissions that were announced on 21 May; the board of the Food Standards Agency is the third commission, dealing with biotechnology aspects. The committees have a greater or lesser involvement in biotechnology, depending on the nature of the work they are doing. I want to convince the Opposition that there is nothing untoward in paragraph 7; it provides only for the transfer of existing advisory committees away from the current Ministries to the agency, so that they come under the ownership, as it were, of the agency, which will decide later the appointments process, again under the Nolan principles. It may decide that there is some overlap or new areas that it wants to deal with, but it will be up to the agency to make those changes without any ministerial instruction whatsoever. However, we can debate that in more detail when we discuss schedule 2.

<P>
I hope that I have explained the purpose behind the clause. It is a reasonable purpose in the circumstances and there is nothing to be unduly concerned about in regard to paragraph 7.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 22, in page 3, line 20, leave out subsections (2) and (3).

<P>
No. 25, in clause 9, page 4, line 11, leave out subsection (2).

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> It is not a criticism of the Chairman, but the amendments in this group are an odd assortment. Amendment No. 114 deals with the independence of the agency, whereas amendment No. 22 and amendment No. 25--which is clearly consequential on amendment No. 22--deal with devolution issues that we have discussed under other clauses.

<P>
At present, the Bill implies that the agency will react only to requests from the Government. The Minister may tell us that that is not the intention, but whatever the intention is, the reading is that the functions will be used as a result of a Government request. We shall discuss which parts of the Government will make such requests under amendments Nos. 22 and 25. Amendment No. 114 would simply insert after ``function'',

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether requested to do so or not''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We simply want to establish the agency's ability to develop policy or provide advice whether or not it has been asked to do so by a Minister of the Crown.

<P>
The agency's independence is one of the most central issues to our debates. We touched on it on Second Reading, under some earlier amendments, and will come back to it many times. If the agency is to be credible, it must be seen to be as independent as possible. The Minister said that it was not designed to be totally independent, and it is probably true that one could not design it to be so, inasmuch as it is ultimately an appointee of Government. There is however a case to make it as independent as possible. That is why we seek through the amendment to clarify whether it will be independent enough to give Ministers advice when it believes that that is necessary, rather than having to wait for a request from a Minister.

<P>
The agency might, for example, make recommendations to protect the public from certain types of genetically modified food, or about its labelling or for changes to its regulatory structure. It is key that the agency initiate such advice when information has come to it from its own or other advisory committees, rather than simply react to Government requests. I am sure that the Minister will say that the amendment is unnecessary but, whether it is or not, I contend that if the agency is to be independent, it should take the initiative itself and be seen to do so. The Bill, therefore, should be amended so that it is clear to everyone that the agency has independence and does not need a Minister's request before it can act.

<P>
Amendment No. 22 would leave out subsections (2) and (3) of clause 6. Subsection (2) deals with devolution, which we have often discussed. I shall not labour the arguments again now, except to say that the subsection's wording--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A Minister of the Crown or government department, the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Ministers or a Northern Ireland Department may request the Agency to exercise its powers under this section''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
leads us to ask how on earth the agency will be able to have any clear sense of direction if it is subject to demands and requests from all those different Ministers and bodies. That is why we propose under amendment No. 22 to delete subsections (2) and (3) to avoid the agency operating under far too many chiefs.

<P>
A body could act in isolation. For example, Scottish Ministers or the Welsh Assembly could ask the agency to operate in a way that proved to be in conflict with how it operated elsewhere in the United Kingdom. That could lead to the selective application of the agency's advice and guidance, and that is why we contend that the Secretary of State for Health, who is accountable to Parliament, should be the only person who can request the agency to exercise its powers.

<P>
If Parliament is to debate the agency and its annual report, we need to know who will answer for the Government and who will be responsible for the agency as a nationwide body. It is arguable that, under subsection (2), the Secretary of State will not have total control over the agency and, therefore, that any debate in the House will be compromised because Ministers in assemblies elsewhere can exercise their powers over the agency. In an earlier debate, I raised the issue of varying advice across the country.

<P>
We are debating two very different amendments: amendment No. 114 deals with the agency's independence from Government, but amendment No. 22 would ensure that a clear channel of communication exists, minimising the risk of confusion in the agency and the bureaucracy that could arise, and making it clear that all requests to the agency should come through one channel alone.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) has drawn attention to the combination of amendments selected for debate. I have noticed that the Committee welcomes the opportunity to have a wide-ranging debate on amendments, thus obviating the need for a clause stand part debate. These linked amendments provide a subtle mixture, designed to enable the Committee to have such a debate, while remaining in order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am so sorry that I missed that subtlety.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): In that case, I support all the amendments, but I wish to speak to amendment No. 22 in particular. If the agency is to be independent, and seen to be independent, we must take the risk that Ministers may want to tell it do something but cannot do so. They will be as frustrated as the rest of us, who may not like the agency interfering in matters in which we would prefer it not to interfere. One cannot have an agency that is independent, yet which Ministers can ask to do things.

<P>
Ministers may request the agency to take a course of action. If they do, is the agency to say, ``No. We are terribly sorry, we are not going to do that.''? Of course, it will be entitled to say that, but it is highly unlikely that it will do so. When a Minister of the Crown asks a Government agency--a quango--seriously to consider the need to ban paralytic shellfish, or whatever, the agency will pay more attention to that request than to that of ordinary members of the public, the British Medical Association, junior doctors or anyone else.

<P>
Therefore, the agency will appear to be not totally independent. It will seem independent to the hoi polloi, but it will not be independent in that it will acknowledge and sometimes act on Ministers' requests. When it acts on a Minister's request, it will be seen to be just another executive tool of the Government, doing what the Government want. Of course, some people will understand that that is how the agency works, and they will ask Ministers to intervene to stop the agency nagging them to death on nutrition, the salt content of Asda's or anyone else's foods, or whatever. When Ministers say, ``We cannot do that. The agency is independent, you know.'' They will say, ``Yes, but this is the independent agency which banned something last week when you asked it to.''

<P>
The Government are trying to have the best of both worlds, but they cannot. They must decide whether the agency will be the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health pooled to carry out ministerial orders, or whether it will be genuinely independent.

<P>
As the Government have embarked on this route, it must be the latter. It must be genuinely independent. If it is to be genuinely independent, it will not be able to act on Ministers' requests. If it will be able to act on anyone's request--mine, or any other member of the public or Member of Parliament--that should be included in the Bill. To say, ``the agency may act on the request of a Minister of the Crown, any Member of Parliament or anyone at all'' would make the provision meaningless, and should not be included.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Subsections (2) and (3) should be deleted, so that the agency is seen to be not a poodle of Ministers or an executive arm carrying out ministerial wishes, but genuinely independent. That means that Ministers will sometimes be frustrated, because they may want it to do something that it refuses to do because it has reached a different conclusion. However, that would be the sensible route.

<P>
The agency will usually agree with Ministers, and they will usually agree with it. If the scientific advice given to MAFF and the Department of Health on food remains as good as it has generally been, 99.9 per cent. of the time the agency and Ministers will concur that action should be taken. They may agree on the action, although all may dispute marginal elements. However, sometimes the agency will not want to do what Ministers say. Will Ministers have the right to tell the agency or to ask it? If the Minister says that they will not order it but will merely ask it, why bother including that in the Bill? Any Minister may ask any agency anything at any time.

<P>
If the Minister is building in a specific provision in law to request the agency to exercise its power, what is the meaning of the word ``request''? Does it mean tell? Can the agency disobey a request from a Minister? Subsection (2) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A Minister ... may request the Agency to exercise its powers''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I interpret that not as the question, ``Would you consider exercising your powers?'' but as a direct ministerial order. ``Request'' is a euphemism for command, as I think the Minister will tell us. If ``request'' means command, and the Minister can tell the agency what to do, it will not be genuinely independent. I rest my case for the moment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The Stalinist views expressed on the Opposition Benches surprise me. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) have both been Ministers, and the redefinition of the word ``request'' surprises me.

<P>
The clause's title is:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Development of food policy and provision of advice, etc. to public authorities.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That sets out the agency's primary function--developing policies. It will operate on its own initiative. The Bill presupposes that the agency will offer advice to public authorities without being requested to do so, on the assumption that the agency will be proactive. As the main provider of advice and policy to the Government on food standards, it will be expected to search the horizon, scan where problems may arise and be proactive in warning and advising Ministers.

<P>
On the other hand, it is entirely reasonable to enable Ministers to ask the agency for advice on a matter that may not have been on the horizon or the agenda--not to tell it how to provide advice, but to ask it to consider providing advice. If there is an underlying assumption that the Government are ordering it to act in a particular way, its power to put its advice in the public domain will be the backstop, that ensures that the Government are not seen to order it to provide advice in a specific way. Later clauses--clause 19, in particular--guarantee the agency's independence from day-to-day control by Ministers over the way in which it carries out its functions.

<P>
Amendment No. 22 could weaken the agency's position as the principal source of advice within Government on food standards and safety. Without the clause, devolved authorities that want advice might--for reasons that we explored in previous debates--go elsewhere. That could nullify the agency's UK-wide role, which we do not want to happen. We want devolved authorities, public authorities and Departments--whether the Ministry of Defence or the Department for Education and Employment--to understand that the Food Standards Agency is their prime source of advice. That is crucial.

<P>
There is no underlying threat to the independence of the agency's advice, and the agency will be staffed by civil servants. I will not define independence, but the agency will be legally constructed as a non-ministerial department. Its advice must be clear and independent, and it will, of course, be able to place advice in the public domain so that people will know if Ministers do not accept it.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Is the Minister seriously telling the Committee that, under the clause, the relevant authority may request the agency to provide advice? Is he saying that that provision has been included simply to signal to the authorities in Scotland and Wales that they should not go outside the agency for advice and to tie them into the agency? It is a little far-fetched to say that the agency in Scotland will go off and ask someone else for advice unless subsection (2) is in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> If legislative action is required as a result of advice, Ministers in Westminster, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be the vehicle, because the legislative process will remain in the Parliaments. It makes good sense for the advice to come from the key agency that is set up to give independent, transparent and open advice on food standards and safety. That fits in with the concept of a UK wide agency that works in devolved areas and operates openly and transparently.

<P>
From time to time, Ministries will go elsewhere for a second opinion or to initiate research. A good example of that is the report by the Institute of Occupational Medicine on organophosphates, which we published last Thursday. The report was a research project, which was commissioned by the previous Government; it was not advice to Ministers. Such advice will come through the advisory committee structure of the Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food and the Veterinary Products Committee, to which we referred the report.

<P>
The clause does not ban devolved authorities from seeking advice and information from research projects and other bodies. The provisions make sense in terms of obtaining advice that might lead to a legislative change, because the agency will draft the legislation, just as the joint food safety and standards group does now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am listening carefully to the Minister. As he said, there is nothing to prevent Ministers in Wales, Scotland or the United Kingdom Government from requesting advice from outside organisations. However, no clause has been built into the law to make it clear that Ministers may request advice from other outside organisations. They can request advice from the Food Standards Agency or from anybody else. Why must we have a clause in the Bill to permit Ministers to seek advice from the main agency that has been created to advise them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It would not be too fruitful to go back to our earlier debates. However, the agency will have the structure of a non-ministerial department--it will be a Department of Government. It will have its own vote in the finances of the House. It will not be mixed up with the Department of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or anything else. It will have its own vote, which is an absolute guarantee that no one will be able to move money around or rob another budget for the agency. It will be open and transparent. It will be a non-ministerial department that is headed by the commission, the board and the people for whom we are currently advertising. The agency will be at arm's length.

<P>
The nature of the legislative process is such that Ministers will want from time to time to ask the agency to consider particular issues. Nobody would want to argue that Ministers should not be able to consult the agency; that is its prime function. It will be the prime source of advice and information--and, in some respects, enforcement, as we shall discuss later--on food standards in Britain. That is what we are setting up.

<P>
The idea that the agency will not be able to respond to Ministers or that any difficulties would arise about that is completely declamatory. Ministers can ask the agency for advice and ask it to comply with their requests in so far as it is practical for it to do so. The agency is the prime national body for food standards, and will not be asked to do something that is outwith its powers or purpose.

<P>
If the agency could not be relied upon to respond to requests for information or advice, we would end up establishing another organisation within Government. We do not want to duplicate its role, and we want to ensure that its work is not duplicated in the Department of Health, in MAFF--although it has responsibility for food standards--or even on the margins of Government. There should be a complete transfer, confidence building and so on. We do not want units in the Department of Health or MAFF that resemble mini food standards agencies. The agency should do the job that it is being set up to do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have followed the Minister's arguments carefully, but he has not convinced me. Would it help to remove suspicion if subsections (2) and (3) of the clause were disposed of, and subsection (1)(b), which states that the agency has the function of

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``providing advice, information or assistance in respect of such matters to any public authority''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
were amended to include the words ``or Minister of the Crown or any of the devolved Parliaments''? If subsection (1)(b) made it clear that it was the function of the agency to provide advice to Uncle Tom Cobbley, public authorities and Ministers, subsection (2), which states that a Minister may ask the agency for advice, would not be necessary. Such a change would remove the suspicion that Ministers will steer the agency.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I ask the right hon. Gentleman to read the clause. Subsection (2) refers to the powers covered by subsection (1). It does not go outside the scope of subsection (1), as it refers to the exercise of the agency's powers ``under this section''. The clause--or section--is, in effect, subsection (1). The provision for which the right hon. Gentleman just asked is contained in the clause in the form that the parliamentary draftsman has thought appropriate. As a former Minister, the right hon. Gentleman will know that the parliamentary draftsmen have their own quaint, legalistic and efficient ways of drafting legislation to ensure that it is clear and unambiguous and that no court cases will arise in respect of any provision that they have drafted or that the House has passed.

<P>
I contend that subsection (2) deals with the right hon. Gentleman's request. The attachment to subsection (1)(b) of the provision that he suggests would make the clause unreadable. I rest my case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I fear that the Minister has sat down because he knows that he is getting into something of a pickle. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border pointed out, if the purpose of subsection (2) is merely to ensure that Ministers should be able to request information, it is clearly already covered in subsection (1)(b). One might as well conclude--as I think the Minister did--that subsections (2) and (3) refer merely to the intentions of the clause as encapsulated in subsection (1). It would be much clearer if we had just subsection (1), and that is one reason why we are proposing that subsections (2) and (3) be removed. Including them gives a clear impression of more than the ability to ask for advice. Stipulating that Ministers and other bodies

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may request the Agency to exercise its powers under this section''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
implies much more than that the agency might simply be asked for its advice on an issue. It would be more sensible to conclude the clause with the end of subsection (1)(b) and the words:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of such matters to any public authority.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That formulation is about as all-embracing a statement as is possible.

The Minister responded to amendment No. 114 much as I thought that he would, by saying in effect that it was not necessary because the Government intend the agency to initiate the activities described. I remain of the view that it would be better to include the proposed provision. I wish to move amendment No. 22 formally, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 114 in the light of the Minister's reply.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 3, line 16, at end insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 109, in clause 7 page 3, line 29, after `safety', insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and standards including nutrition and labelling'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and standards including nutrition and labelling'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> The amendments focus on the subject of an earlier debate--whether the agency is to be one for food standards or one for food safety. I shall not repeat previous arguments. The amendments relate to clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 and seek to insert the simple words:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and standards including nutrition and labelling''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That would be a relatively uncontroversial addition to what the Government claimed was the original purpose of the legislation, and would be a recognition of the agency's responsibility regarding those matters.

<P>
Nutrition and food quality are as important to public health as food safety. We should perhaps be having the debate after the ministerial statement on public health this afternoon. I would be surprised if, in meeting new targets for improving health, especially among the poorest of the land, reference was not made to nutrition or food standards. From where do people get independent advice? They certainly do not trust politicians or consumer interest groups.

<P>
Nutrition has always been a controversial area and has been seen to have implications for the agency. If healthy eating messages are communicated effectively, and consumers choose to act upon them, consumer demand for specific foodstuffs may change. It is thus essential that nutrition issues are handled as independently as possible within the open and transparent climate of the agency. The amendments would add a specific reference without taking anything from the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I regret to disappoint the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), but the Government cannot accept the amendments. We had a similar debate about nutrition on earlier clauses, which was dealt with by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health. I understand why the hon. Gentleman wants to insert the words, but his singling out of labelling and nutrition would raise questions about why other issues, such as the composition of food or diet, were not mentioned. That begs more questions than it answers.

<P>
We have already said that the agency will deal with nutrition, and we have discussed the relevant aspects of that. I have three examples, as set out in the White Paper, which we have not moved from in the past 18 months. First it will undertake surveys of the nutritional value of individual foods such as milk, bread and ready-prepared foods to determine nutritional and micronutritional content. That is already done by the joint food safety and standards group. Secondly, it will develop analytical techniques to assess the nutritional content of foods. Thirdly, it will provide policy guidance and regulation on matters relating to nutritional labelling of foods.

<P>
The amendments highlight the fact that people will be asking about other areas of policy, and why they are less important than those that are covered. In other words, what is in the Bill must be there for a good reason. The golden rule in drafting Bills is not to put in words in that are not really needed, or to put them in more than once. That will cause problems of interpretation later on. On the other hand, one must make sure that what is needed is in the Bill.

<P>
These issues are currently covered by the work of the joint food safety and standards group, and will be covered by the agency. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): Will the Minister clarify his remark about not putting words in the Bill more than once? Does that mean that he intends to accept amendment No. 22, which would delete subsections (2) and (3) because they are unnecessary as their provisions are already covered by subsection (1)?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, because they are not covered. Perhaps I should have said that an idea should not be put in a Bill more than once, because one can always find the relevant words. We shall not accept amendment No. 22, and when the time comes we shall vote against it.

<P>
Amendment No. 79, which applies to clause 9, is unnecessary. The agency's function in regard to animal feeds already covers all the relevant aspects, which certainly includes nutrition and labelling.

<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> The Minister referred particularly to issues of nutrition. I am grateful for his reassurance and the fact that he is putting on the record that the Food Standards Agency will be covering that area. However, he has not addressed the matter of labelling, and I would be grateful if he can confirm that the agency will cover that in the way that it would be covered by my amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes. The joint food safety and standards group has a labelling section that covers food labelling. Along with local authorities, it polices labels on foods very toughly. The claims that are made on labels have to be justified and tested so that the public are not conned. That work will continue, because the agency will have a labelling section. That applies to foods for human and animal consumption.

<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify and put on the record the importance of these matters, which I know are of great concern to consumers. I shall applaud the Government if they make a statement this afternoon about the health of those who have recently been left out in terms of health and nutrition policy. But the fact that the Minister has reassured me--on the record--on those two matters means that we now have a base from which we can pursue those interests in the future. I am happy, therefore, to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 3, line 19, at end insert--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) All advice provided under this section shall be published unless the Agency considers that there are overriding national or commercial interests which preclude its publication, in which case the Agency must publish its reasons for not publishing.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
 The amendment is all about a presumption in favour of providing information to the general public. The Minister said in earlier sittings that the commission and the agency would be able to initiate and issue advice and policy. That is what we want to see. However, I strongly contend that clause 6 is inadequate for that--although the Minister will no doubt respond by referring to clause 19, which relates to publication. I would like to see in the Bill a clearly defined
<P>
 statement to the effect that the presumption must be in favour of all advice being published, and that publication should be prevented only if the agency finds that there are overriding national or commercial interests, in which case it should be required to publish its reasons for not publishing. Thus, the onus would always be on the agency to publish.

<P>
The information that public authorities--including, for example, environmental health officers--will use to guide them must be authoritative and seen to be beyond reproach. There must be clear, two-way lines of communication between the authorities and the agency to create an atmosphere of openness and to ensure continual assessment of the quality and usefulness of the information. In my view, that means a clear presumption in favour of the publication of all that information unless, as the amendment states,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there are overriding national or commercial interests''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Special Select Committee recommended that the agency should be guided by a clear presumption in favour of openness, which is what the amendment would achieve. It addresses the doubt--which still exists--about the Government's attitude to transparency. We do not believe that clauses 6 or 19 are sufficiently clear.

<P>
If the agency is perceived by the general public or by any of the organisations with which it works to be in any way covering something up or acting under pressure--be it from politicians, a sector of the food industry or any other organisation--its credibility will be seriously damaged. That is why we argue that there must be a presumption in favour of the publication of all advice.

<P>
We all know that plenty of outside forces will be seeking to assert their influence--it is part and parcel of the job of special interest groups to do so. As the Minister kindly said, anyone who has been a Minister and probably every hon. Member--knows full well that that is what all those organisations are there for; indeed, some of those organisations are taking a special interest in the Committee's proceedings. It is essential, however, that the public can be confident that, whatever influence those organisations have sought to exert, it has not caused the agency to compromise what it is doing. It is important to require the agency to set out why it may fail to publish any advice, if it decides to do so, so as to try to avoid any hint of a cover-up or unreasonable pressure.

<P>
The amendment is central to what the agency is about. We have been trying, through a series of amendments, to ensure that the agency is as independent as possible--not simply of Ministers, but of every other sector or body in the world of food. That is why we are convinced that the amendment is necessary.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is an advantage from the Government's point of view as well as the agency's. It cannot be in the interests of any Minister or Government to stand accused of interfering in the workings of the agency, or of bringing unnecessary powers to bear. Amendment No. 21 would insert the presumption of openness in the Bill. I am sure that the Minister will tell us that it is already there, but it is not clear. We would like it clearly stated in the Bill that all information should be published. If the agency decides not to, it should publish its reasons for not doing so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> As this is my first speech in Committee this morning, may I start by apologising to you, Mr. Gale, and the Minister for not being present at the beginning of our proceedings. I have explained the reason to you privately, Mr. Gale. There was a fire drill, and we were all advised not to enter the building. That is why some of my colleagues and I were late.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That apology is accepted, but I am not sure whether it is entirely necessary. Following the information given by the hon. Gentleman, we are instigating inquiries to find out why hon. Members seeking to make their way to the Committee Room before the fire alarm was sounded were prevented from so doing. References were made to the hon. Gentleman in his absence, and that is not acceptable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I strongly support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire on amendment No. 21. The whole culture of openness and the independence of the Government is important in ensuring public confidence in the agency. If there is any suspicion that information that should be in the public domain is being withheld, I believe that confidence will start to ebb.

<P>
I do not want to stray into a debate on clause 19, but it is worth quoting two sentences from the explanatory notes on it which give an idea of the Government's thinking on publication. It says that the clause

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``also enables the Agency to publish any other information it holds.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency's express ability to publish any of its advice to Ministers will be an important factor in its influence and independence''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Those sentences suggest to me that the agency may publish, but is not obliged to do so. The thrust of our amendment is to add a requirement that the agency should, under all circumstances, publish unless there are very good reasons for not doing so. Given the prevailing culture, and as the Government are introducing a freedom of information Bill and want to place as much information as possible in the public domain, I should have thought that they would be delighted to accept our amendment. If they do not, we will be looking closely at the Minister's explanation for not doing so.

<P>
During the BSE crisis, we found that it was much better that information was made available from official sources in an official manner rather than leaked to the newspapers in an unofficial and sensational manner. In today's media culture, as sure as anything, any sensitive advice that the agency receives is likely to leak into the newspapers. One of the most damaging aspects of the BSE crisis was the uncontrolled leakage of information into the public domain.

<P>
I urge the Minister to consider the matter carefully. The agency should work on the presumption that it should publish information. The public will want to see an independent and thoroughly open agency. It should be not a creature of Government but an independent body. We should try to move away from the culture in which the nanny state dictates exactly what the public should do and what they should and should not know. The public should be treated as able to make up their own minds, no matter how serious the information in question. At every stage during the BSE crisis, the Conservative Government made the policy decision that robust information, backed up by research that could be replicated properly by peer groups of scientists--as opposed to one self-seeking scientist whose research could not be replicated--should be placed in the public domain as soon as possible so as to let people make up their own minds.

<P>
I strongly endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. Even if the Minister cannot accept the amendment, I hope that he will make it clear that it should be the definite presumption of all concerned that the agency will publish information unless there are good public interest reasons for it not to do so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I could not help but be reminded of the past by the hon. Gentleman's remarks about putting everything into the public domain. I do not want to trawl over the background of BSE, because a public inquiry is under way. One of the abiding complaints made after the crisis concerned the refusal to grant access to information to the Oxford academics in Professor Anderson's group, who wanted to examine it in respect of epidemiology and other studies. Those academics were not allowed to take a look at what MAFF owned at the time so as to make predictions for the future.

<P>
It was not all openness, sweetness and light in those days. I find the idea that the previous Government were a model of openness difficult to comprehend. I do not want to be boastful about the present Government, but it is a source of abiding concern and upset to me that MAFF has not received a Campaign for Freedom of Information award during the past two years. It has published a huge amount of information on food, including surveys on contaminants in food by brand name and pesticide residue surveys by brand name. Veterinary medicine residues surveys by brand name are to be published. We are publishing more information about food than ever before.

<P>
We have learned the lesson that if we want a food scare in this country, we should not tell people what we know. That is the culture that we have tried to imbue into the Department since May 1997, and its officials have embraced it. We want to transfer it to the agency. There should not be a big bang on the day that it is established, and we are not saying that all of a sudden we will have a Food Standards Agency that will tell us what is going on. The idea is to ensure openness now, in so far as we are able to do so under the law, as various issues come into play, including advice to Ministers. We want a seamless transfer of openness and transparency. That fits in with clause 19, which we shall come to later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Is the Minister saying that he found a culture of secrecy among MAFF civil servants when his Government took over?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, because the civil servants, bless them, were doing, as all good-quality civil servants do, the bidding of their political masters. The real problem was Ministers, or the political heads of the Department. I have said that the culture that we wanted was embraced by the Department. We have had no problems whatever since May 1997 in ensuring an open and transparent policy on food.

<P>
I am not putting words into anybody's mouth, but it was as if the civil servants felt that information was previously being bottled up in MAFF, and they wanted to get all of it out. The previous Government, however, were stopping them, and, as loyal civil servants, the officials did what the Government decided. That is the way in which the system works. If there are any problems, Ministers should get the blame because they should make the decisions. If there is a success, the whole team of Department officials should take credit for reaching the right decision.

<P>
In some ways, the amendment jumps the gun. I do not want to talk about schedule 2, and I have tried to avoid doing so. Under clause 19, the

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Agency may, subject to the following provisions of this section, publish in such manner as it thinks fit--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any advice given under section 6, 7 or 9 ...
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any information obtained through observations under section 10 or monitoring under section 12''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The only caveats are prohibitions by other enactments, incompatibility with European Community obligations, and contempt of court. The agency can even override the commercial confidentiality of information, but it must go over a series of hurdles before it decides whether to do so. If there was a duty to publish everything, however, as implied in amendment No. 21, there would be a shortage of information to the agency. Such a duty would mean that the agency did not have to go over the hurdle of checking details, which is set out in clause 19.

<P>
The idea of the agency having to publish its reasons for not publishing is seductive, but impractical. To publish one's reasons for not publishing is, in effect, to provide the information that one is not publishing.

<P>
There might be a time element, and the agency might want to publish at a certain time--perhaps after European Union negotiations.

<P>
It must, therefore, have control over the timing.

<P>
No one can argue that we are not committed to setting up an open and transparent agency, and clause 19 makes that abundantly clear. Locking in the agency in the way that the amendment proposes could create more problems than solutions. We want a successful and genuinely open and transparent agency that serves the public interest. Freedom of information issues are also public interest issues, and there will be freedom of information legislation on the statute book. In a way, the Bill contains a sub-group of its own freedom of information clauses, which will be on the statute book before that other freedom of information legislation. However, it is for the agency to decide what to publish; there will be no constraints from Ministers. The agency will make and defend the case for what it publishes and what it does not; there will be no ministerial diktat or interference whatever. That is a culture shock for those who were previously Ministers.

<P>
The clause goes beyond surveys and exercises to check different products, labelling and residues; it goes to the heart of the machinery of Government. It relates to what advisers, our officials and civil servants, as servants of the public, advise Ministers. The agency can put such advice in the public domain, and it, not Ministers, will decide if and when to do so. That is a big difference from the current legal framework.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Under Pepper v. Hart, the courts will carefully examine what the Minister has said about Parliament's intention in enacting the Bill as regards what the agency should publish. Is he really saying that one reason for withholding publication is that the agency might not receive confidential information? How does he square that with the case of the great whistleblower Van Buitenen? If he had not blown the whistle on the European Commission, the Commissioners would not all have resigned as a result of fraud. Surely such information should be in the public domain.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Such information will be in the public domain if the agency chooses to put it there. The amendment states that information will be published unless there are

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``overriding national or commercial interests''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Commercial interests is a pretty wide phrase and is not the kind of hurdle that we have in clause 19. We do not want those who must provide the agency with commercially confidential information to think that the agency might be able to publish it willy-nilly and without a second thought. However, it can publish such information if it considers it to be in the overriding public interest, under the terms of its functions. That would arise in very exceptional cases. Nevertheless, the agency has the power to publish all the information that it owns or controls.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Commission used everything in its power to prevent Van Buitenen putting his information in the public domain. Had he not acted, the huge fraud within the European Community would never have been uncovered and the committee of wise men would never have been established. It is important that Parliament clearly sets out what the agency is and is not expected to publish. There should be included a strong public interest clause, with the expectation that the agency will publish information unless it is strongly in the public interest for it not to do so.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Such a provision is contained in clause 19. The agency's functions are given in clause 22--one of the longest clauses in the Bill--which we shall consider later. The agency must prepare and publish a statement of its general objectives. The combination of clauses 19 and 22 meets exactly the point that the learned Gentleman made. I am conscious that the words used by Ministers in Committee may be looked at by the courts and that that happens more these days than in the past. I never expect to figure in a case based on the precedent of Pepper v. Hart because I had my name on the clause of an Act 20 years earlier, but I would be happy to have that as my epitaph.

<P>
I am confident that the combination of clauses 19 and 22 will meet the objectives that the hon. Member for Cotswold and I share--there is no argument between us on the matter. We want to put the provision in the right position in the Bill. Accepting amendment No. 21 would give us real problems about the degree of control the agency had over what it published. We must remember that the agency will be in control. It will not be headed by a Minister, but by the commission--its chair, deputy chair and by the commissioners to be appointed. That is the key test on how open the agency is to be, and it breaks the link between Government, who might otherwise have given it orders over what was or was not to be done, and the agency. The agency will have total control over what it does with the information at its disposal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Will the agency own the information when Ministers request it to provide advice under clause 6(1)(a) and (b)? Will the agency be able to publish ministerial requests for information, or whether it has said to the Minister ``Yes, Sir'' or ``Get lost, Sir''?

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I should perhaps start by referring to his comments about the previous Government and the bovine spongiform encephalopathy affair. He rightly referred to the current inquiry, but proceeded to prejudge its outcome by talking about the information that was not put into the public domain. I am interested in how he knows about that, given that I understand that Ministers do not see the papers of previous Governments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Let us not have another hare running. Current Ministers have no role in the inquiry--we see no papers and no officials talk to us about it. We simply pay the horrendously large legal bills.

<P>
I shall not say how much one bill for photocopying was--it was horrendous.

<P>
What I said about Professor Anderson's team is in the public domain. I find out about what is happening at the inquiry at the same time as everybody else--when I read the newspapers. I do not go to the inquiry--I have no access--and I am not checking links. Current Ministers play no role in it whatsoever. The role of Professor Anderson, who is now a member of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, of course, and his complaint about not having access to information, has been widely debated.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The inquiry that is taking place is not a judicial inquiry and it is not sub judice, but it is an inquiry and it would be better if we were to leave the matter there for the moment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I did not start this.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Methinks that the Minister protests too much. I was interested to hear him say that all that he does is pay the bill. In reality, of course, the bill is being paid by the fishermen and the organisations that have had their funding cut.

<P>
In replying to the debate, the Minister gave the strongest possible support for our amendment when he said that the matter is dealt with by clause 19, under which the agency will publish the information ``if it chooses to do so'', in his words. The amendment would take away that discretionary ``if it chooses to do so'' so as to require that the agency will do so, and if it does not it must explain why. We want to see a greater element of compulsion on the agency to publish. I know, Mr. Gale, that you will say that it is out of order to pre-empt the debate on clause 19.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Then do not do it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> When we come to that debate, I or my hon. Friend will challenge the Minister about whether the provisions go anything like as far as he is implying. I contend that they do not. Nothing in clause 19, or in clause 6, requires the agency to give its reasons for not publishing. The Minister said that that would be stupid, because one would end up giving away the information that one was trying not to publish. That is a non sequitur--the agency could easily explain why it had decided not to publish a specific piece of information, and it would then be subject to the judicial process if someone wanted to challenge it.

<P>
The Minister said that the phrase ``commercial interests'' in amendment No. 21 was very wide That would be the case if the phrase was merely ``commercial interests''. However, he omitted the word ``overriding'', which appears earlier in the phrase. The amendment refers to ``overriding national or commercial interests'', which is a much clearer definition.

<P>
I shall not prolong the debate at this stage. I am not happy with the Minister's response, and we shall certainly want to return to the matter when we reach clause 19. In the meantime, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in Clause 7, page 3, line 35, leave out `the Agency considers'.

<P>
We have arrived at an important clause about the provision of information to the public, which goes to the heart of the working of the agency. One of the strongest reasons for setting up the agency in the first place was the inaccuracy of information, and the consequent undermining of public confidence in food safety, that has occurred in the past. This is a matter that we must get right as we look closely at the provisions that will enact this part of the Bill. It is critical that producers, retailers and consumers have absolute confidence in the agency. In an earlier debate, we discussed what might be a real measure of success on the agency's part. We agreed that examining the rise or decline in the incidence of food poisoning would be just a crude measure, but if the agency is successful in restoring absolute confidence by giving the public information on which to base their decisions, we can say that it has succeeded.

<P>
The highest standards of impartiality must be the goal of the agency. Our debates show how difficult it is to try to set the agency free in the eyes of those who will use it and who depend on the information that comes from it. Our amendment would remove any subjectivity that might be implied by the phrase ``the Agency considers''. Removing that phrase would take away the barrier to a position of utter neutrality. We foresee a recipe for trouble if the agency is allowed to make its own decisions about the matters on which it should keep the public informed.

<P>
The advisory process, to which the Government have given a great deal of thought and on which we have already had much discussion, is more clearly the vehicle on which, plainly and transparently, consensus can be achieved with everyone involved, including scientists, producers, retailers and consumers about what information should be given to the public. If that does not happen, credibility will be lost. There are numerous examples from the past of that not happening. It is worth taking a little time to work through some practical examples about which we all know. We have the benefit of hindsight on how mistakes were made. By looking at these examples, we can throw light on how the agency can achieve credibility.

<P>
Let us consider the damaging controversy about the information that was given to the public in the autumn of 1997 on the consumption of red meat. We can learn from that--it is relevant to our argument on why the clause should be amended. The Secretary of State for Health made a statement advising the public to reduce the consumption of red meat on the ground that it might be linked to a higher incidence of cancer. A few days later, a corrective statement had to be issued jointly with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stating that additional clarification was necessary to make the advice to the public ``more easily understood''. The advice on red meat consumption, according to the second statement, should be seen in the context of the advice of the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food and  Nutrition Policy--COMA--on eating a balanced diet. It is common sense that if one eats red meat to the exclusion of a mixed diet of cereals, fruit and vegetables, one will store up trouble and there may be a higher possibility of succumbing to bowel cancer.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> May I express my apologies to the Committee for arriving late this morning.

<P>
The statement on the consumption of red meat was made not by the Secretary of State but by COMA.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. This is an important example because we can look closely at the process that was in play at that time and how the process under this Bill might be different and, we hope, better. At the time of the first statement made by the Minister, not all the members of COMA had seen the full report. A lesson can be learned from such an experience. It is so important that the agency alone should not be allowed subjectively to decide at what point and of what the public should be informed. Such a mistake could be prevented if we could be sure that all the members of the advisory committee had seen the full report and were properly consulted. Other advisory committees must work with the agency in a way that is based on a properly balanced consultative process to ensure that the right information is issued to members of the public in a way that is easy to understand and on which they can base their decisions. That is a good example of how the clause should work and it is the reason why we want it to be amended.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall cite a second, but different, example to shed light on the clause and our amendment. The Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food recommended a restriction of the availability over the counter of vitamin B6 to 6 mg a day. The Government announced their plans to follow that recommendation, and members of the Committee will recall how their mailbags swelled with letters from the general public who were concerned about the proposal to restrict their consumption of vitamin B6. In its report, the Select Committee on Agriculture was also critical of the Government's plans to follow COT's proposal. Indeed, several bodies said that it should be challenged.

<P>
A delay ensued between the Government's announcement of the proposal to restrict the sale of vitamin B6 and their decision to postpone it. In the end, the Government decided to wait until the expert group on vitamins and minerals had reported on the subject and the Library advises me that the report will take between a year and a half and two years to complete. That is a long time between concerns being raised about a product that is readily available over the counter on which many consumers, especially women, depend, and the final decision. All that such a delay in the decision-making process and the uncertainty over the results will do is to undermine public confidence.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to debate vitamin B6 again. The hon. Lady is talking about delay. It is not without significance that the American report on which the vitamin industry relied, as to a certain extent did the Select Committee on Agriculture, has not to this day been published--a year after everyone looked on it as gospel.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I do not wish to be caught on the technical case for or against the consumption of a particular level of vitamin B6, I simply use it as an example whereby we can consider the decision-making process under the Bill, so that we can improve on what has happened in the past. From the point at which the Government announced plans to act on the recommendation of COT, the delay that ensued and the perceived lobbying during the period of delay has simply undermined the credibility of the public in the neutrality of such a decision. I imagine that the volume of letters that hon. Members received from the general public must have been small in proportion to the vast quantity of letters that the Government received.

<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): Is the hon. Lady saying that scientific evidence is uncertain and that it takes a long time--often, it does not happen at all--to produce a level of certainty that we can communicate accurately to people?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I do not dispute the enormous pressure that we put on scientific committees to make clear-cut decisions. If the evidence about BSE had been clear from the beginning, vast sums of public money would doubtless have been saved. I simply urge the Minister to ensure that the Bill prevents the agency deciding, perhaps prematurely on the basis of one piece of scientific advice, to make information publicly available that is subsequently proved wrong. We are talking not about a nation with a clean sheet of paper but about consumers who have had poor experience of scientific information on diet.

<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> The hon. Lady seems to be saying that the agency should be extremely selective about the information that it gives to the public; but that is a rather dangerous path to follow. If it emerges that a precautionary step might have been appropriate, and if the risk is later demonstrated, consumers will blame the agency for not advising them sooner that there might be a risk and letting them make their own judgment.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands the purpose of the amendment. We want to prevent the agency falling at the first fence by subjectively following the decision of only one advisory committee without properly weighing the scientific information from the other advisory committees that report to it. One of our major worries about the advisory process envisaged under the Bill is that there are several players. The example that I gave of vitamin B6 could set one scientific advisory body against another, should they not come to the same view. That potential problem needs to be resolved to secure the credibility of the agency.

<P>
Another example that helps build our case for removing the phrase ``the Agency considers'' is that of green-top milk. The present inconsistency could cause problems for the agency. The sale of untreated milk was banned in Scotland in 1983. A consultation process on what should happen in England was announced in 1989 and, in 1995, green-top milk was restricted to being sold from farms only. In 1997, the Government commenced their consultation on the consumption of green-top milk, encouraged by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food. That took until January 1998; not until a year later did the Government decide not to ban green-top milk in England. They decided merely to restrict its sale further.

<P>
For quite a long time, all those who consumed or who contemplated consuming green-top milk were uncertain why the Government had reopened the question. They wondered why it should be banned in Scotland but not in England. That is an example of what could happen if the devolved parts of the Food Standards Agency made different recommendations about what information should be made public. Examples from the past are relevant to the future.

<P>
The last example is closest to the sort of process described in clause 7. I speak of the decision about beef on the bone. Clause 7 sets out the process clearly. The agency should provide advice, and it has a duty to keep the public adequately informed and advised on matters that could affect their capacity to make informed decisions. In December 1997, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food published the advice of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, which is known as SEAC. The scientific evidence that parts of cattle that were hitherto thought free from infection could be infected with BSE was new and was published ahead of the scientific literature--an important point.

<P>
The advisory committee suggested three courses of action: to make the research findings available and let the consumer decide; to prohibit the sale of all beef with bone and the sale of cattle over six months old or, the most draconian option, to debone all slaughtered cattle under two years old only in licensed plants. It is interesting that the Government significantly affected consumers' ability to choose by themselves deciding which of those three options--the second--to go for. The consumer was not told of the research findings and allowed to decide.

<P>
That example is from the past and we are discussing the operation of the agency in the future, but it is a particularly telling example because it demonstrates a Government action that did not inspire public confidence. The published information gave the option of the freedom to choose, which is the objective of the clause, but the Government removed it. We use the example in order to urge the Government, perhaps for their own sake, to seek a single recommendation from the advisory committees. Being given three recommendations would place the agency in a difficult position and would reinforce our point that enabling the agency subjectively to choose what information to give might lead to a repetition of the errors that occurred with beef on the bone.

<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): I am unclear about the Opposition's position. I had thought that they were arguing for an independent Food Standards Agency that could and should publish all the information that it has. I now understand that the hon. Lady is asking for a Food Standards Agency that has a Government override and for information to be published only when everyone agrees with everything. That seems completely contradictory. Which is the real position?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> With respect, the hon. Lady misunderstands, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) did earlier. The two positions are not incompatible. We are asking the Government to look closely at the way in which the Bill is crafted to make sure that the decision-making process that leads to the provision of information to the public is transparent, for the sake of the credibility of the agency, which is one of the main objectives in setting it up.

<P>
Our concern is that the phrase ``that the agency considers'' could allow too much subjectivity to enter the complicated decision-making process in which more than one advisory committee may be involved. In the examples that I gave, I did not repeat the name of any advisory committee; they were all different but all contributed to the body of scientific information that was ultimately passed on to consumers so that they could decide or that inspired the decision made by the Minister on consumers' behalf. Our concern remains that the total neutrality of the agency might be undermined, which is why we seek to amend the clause.

<P>
The explanatory notes state that under the clause the agency will have an important role in providing information to the public and in determining how food is labelled. The Minister confirmed in the debate on the previous clause that the agency will indeed have that function. For that reason, I shall turn later to the question of information on labels--an important area in which British food safety measure are distinctly weak. We have only to think of the athlete Ross Baillie, who recently suffered the fatal consequences of food probably not being labelled clearly. I have not had a chance to look at the label on a coronation chicken sandwich, but it is obvious from the name that it would not be apparent to ordinary consumers that such a product might contain nuts and that the consequences of eating it might be fatal if they unfortunately suffer from a nut allergy.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Another huge area of weakness in labelling is the declaration of country of origin. In the recent dioxin scare about Belgian food, consumer confidence was undermined because the initial statement that no chicken was imported from Belgium had to be corrected by several British supermarkets. The ordinary consumer taking home a pack of chicken breast from a supermarket could not be 100 per cent. sure that it did not contain contaminated meat. The agency must address such problems if it is to be responsible for labelling.

<P>
As a regulatory authority, the agency will have an important responsibility to deal with the arrangements for the labelling of GM food. People are very uncertain about those arrangements. We all know that, in order to cover themselves, supermarkets have tended to opt for blanket declarations stating, ``This product may contain GM food''. However, such declarations do little to inspire public confidence if they are not accurate. Will the agency have the power to approach that problem from the other perspective? Perhaps the consumer needs to know with confidence that a product is GM free. That may solve the problem of consumers, lack of confidence when buying products.

<P>
The United States Food and Drug Administration's centre for food safety and applied nutrition is regarded as an example of best practice in food safety matters. It deals with 240 billion of domestic food, 15 billion of imported food and, interestingly, 15 billion of cosmetics. Cosmetics are outside the scope of the Bill, but products such as face creams contain GM substances that can enter the body in other ways than being ingested through the mouth.

<P>
The centre leads the world on questions of food safety and labelling. Many lessons can be learned from the American experience, not least because innovative products start on the other side of the Atlantic and arrive in Britain before penetrating the wider European market. In revamping food labelling, the centre has carefully considered the information that the public should receive--importantly, information on nutrition, additives, daily values for vitamins in the diet and so on.

<P>
The vexed issue of nutritional claims would be an important area for the agency to consider. The FDA is very precise about such matters. For example, a product that is claimed to be low fat must contain 3g or less fat per serving, and serving is accurately defined.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Keeble:</B> If the hon. Lady is so impressed with the FDA, can she explain why food poisoning in the United States proportionately far outstrips that in this country? For example, 1,500 schoolchildren suffered food poisoning from bad, imported strawberries bought by a school purchasing programme.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I do not suggest for a minute that labelling food accurately is the panacea to the problem of food poisoning, but there is no doubt that accurate labelling can help. I genuinely believe that much of the real cause of food poisoning is consumers' lack of knowledge about how to prepare and store food, how long to keep it and how to stack it in the refrigerator. There are many modern methods of cooking, freezing and storing food that were not part of the domestic science curriculum even when I was at school. Labelling would not be the sole solution, but it would be an important part of it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> The hon. Lady admires the practice of the FDA. How has it set high standards in the labelling of GM products? Presumably she had some sympathy with its attitude to the subject. Will she set out her party's historical position on the labelling of GM foods?

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I think that Mr. Gale would probably rule a wide discussion on that subject out of order.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chairman has listened carefully and has already taken the view that the debate has ranged rather wider than the amendment. I shall of course reflect that in my decision on a clause stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The only important contrasting point to make is that American consumers have much less difficulty in accepting GM technology than any European consumers. The audience is different.

<P>
I do not seek to abuse your great patience, Mr. Gale, but the explanatory notes state clearly that the agency will deal with labelling, which the Minister confirmed. On this clause, I therefore took an opportunity to raise issues that I was not sure that we would be able to raise again.

<P>
There is no question but that the FDA is revered worldwide and is ahead of European food labelling in many respects. The relevant European food directive is in the process of rationalisation, a process which our Government agree. Under European law, the requirements so far on producers and retailers of food are not clear in relation to nutritional claims such as ``low fat'' and ``no added sugar''. The lack of clarity on such issues misleads consumers. It would not help the new agency's credibility in the public eye if that continued under its operation.

<P>
A new European Union regulation--I think that it is still under negotiation and is not yet in force--on novel foods and novel food ingredients will require food with genetically modified organisms to be labelled. Under that regulation, will the agency have the freedom simply to label a product ``GM free''? What would happen to the agency if, for example, the Welsh Assembly, which has powers to manage its own labelling on GM foods, recommends a different course of action from the agency in Scotland, England or Northern Ireland? I am concerned about the consistency of labelling across United Kingdom borders.

<P>
Outside the European Union, there are important international regulations that govern the labelling of food. A notable example is the Codex Alimentarius, which many industrialists feel will ultimately replace European and American food labelling by setting internationally negotiated and agreed standards for food labelling. The process is slow by dint of its scale, but it is open and transparent, and we want the new agency to achieve a similarly open process. Such international directives and regulations do not pre-empt national labelling, which still has a long way to go in this country.

<P>
The amendment presents a great opportunity to amend the Bill to ensure that the agency will be completely objective, neutral and effective in the information that it gives to the public, to remove the subjectivity that might otherwise be present.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we proceed, I reiterate that the discussion has ranged rather wider than the amendment. That is perfectly in order, and I have no problem with it, provided that hon. Members understand that that will be taken into account in the clause stand part debate, and that in considering such Bills, in which several clauses relate to similar matters, I do not expect the same arguments to be rehearsed again when we reach later clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I hear what you say, but in taking that into account, I hope that you will also take into account that some of us may not want to speak to the amendment, and have not moved amendments to other parts of the clause, but may want to make brief observations on earlier parts of the clause not specifically covered in any of the amendments.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is precisely why I said that I am prepared to tolerate a fairly wide-ranging debate on the amendment, on the understanding that we shall not have a clause stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Following that ruling, I shall take up that point. The clause states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Agency has the function of--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) providing advice and information to the general public''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
these are the important words--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(or any section of the public)''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am worried that pressure groups will bombard the agency with information in order to try to influence it to formulate advice and, eventually, policy that suits their objectives. Will the Minister clarify that matter, to prevent the agency from being even pressured, let alone hijacked, by pressure groups? The food industry contains pressure groups--which I shall not name--with a particular objective. I hope that the agency will be completely immune from them, and will act only on the basis of sound scientific advice. However, under clause 7, it could be subject to huge pressure to give in to such pressure groups. I hope that he will clarify that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> As this may be my only opportunity to make these observations, I am trying to link them tenuously to the amendment. The phrase ``the Agency considers'' appears in subsection (2), which refers to the functions under subsection (1)(a). However, I am worried about the provisions in subsection (1)(b), which are not covered in subsection (2).

<P>
Subsection (1)(b) provides that the Agency will provide advice and information

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to any person who is not a public authority.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I wonder how many judicial review cases the Minister expects not only from big, legitimate pressure groups, which are all right, but from others. The danger will come from individuals, the cranks--those constituents whom we all have, who have a determined bee in their bonnet about something. They write to us all the time, and we pass their letters on to Ministers all the time. After three or four letters from the Minister, from which we conclude that nothing further can be done, and after the ombudsman has ruled against them, thankfully most of them, with insufficient financial resources, let the matter drop or pester the new bishop or whoever is new to the area, to try to raise the subject.

<P>
The Bill states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Agency has the function of--
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) ... providing advice, information or assistance ... to any person who is not a public authority.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In my 15 years of dealing with correspondence, both as a Minister and as a constituency Member of Parliament, I have come to recognise letters from general letter-writers, who write to every Member of Parliament using green ink and writing up the side of the envelope. If such people, who have a bee in their bonnet, decide to go to judicial review because the Minister has not given them the assistance that they want, the agency could get bogged down. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, said that they would bombard the Minister and the agency to try to get them to work on their case and some will do so, but others may have recourse to law. Some legitimate pressure groups, too, may go to law. I see a lawyers' paradise in clause 7(1)(b). Individuals, not a public authority--

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Everything that he said about a lawyers' paradise will come to pass if he persists with the amendment, which will remove the agency's discretion, with the result that its key decisions will be made in the courts. That is the direct implication of the amendment.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I will correct the Minister: the amendment would not do what he claims, because clause 7(1)(b) is excluded from clause 7(2), which states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The function under subsection (l)(a) shall be carried out without prejudice ...).
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is a very good point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Minister speaks with frankness and honesty. He would have had a good point if the clause had included subsection (1)(b), but it does not.

<P>
I ask the Government seriously to consider the amendment. I know what they are trying to do; under clause 6 the agency will give advice to Ministers when they ask for it. Under clause 7, if members of the public or an individual who is not part of a public authority, ask for advice the agency must do its level best to help them, provided that that is not to the exclusion of everything else and does not destroy the agency's objectives or overload it. I can understand that; but my experience in government and as a constituency Member, makes me worried that the agency may be overloaded with thousands and thousands of requests that it cannot cope with. There will be a handful of highly unreasonable requests and if people have access to funds, the agency will constantly have to defend itself in court, saying that it was not unreasonable to refuse to provide Mr. Snooks with all the information that he requested. He may have demanded that the agency carry out advice on the effect of passive smoking on sausages. Such people have bees in their bonnets and if the agency does not pander to their latest theory--I am not suggesting that these are legitimate scientists as we all know the sort of people who hold these views; ordinary constituents too--clause 7(1)(b) will give them right of access to the courts to say that the agency was acting unreasonably because it did not give them sufficient assistance or the advice to which they were legally entitled under clause 7(1)(b).

<P>
Of course, the agency must be seen to be advising the public, for example, through a telephone helpline. When members of the public telephone and say, ``The sausages I have bought say that they contain 85 per cent. meat. Does that mean 85 per cent. is lean muscle and 15 per cent. is fat?'', the agency will be able to explain the composition of foods, saying that fat may be a certain content; 85 per cent. meat is not necessarily meat, and so on. The agency will have to give people advice, but when there are persistent or potential troublemakers, it may get bogged down, but not with the tens of thousands of ordinary members of the public who will call when there is a food scare. Telephone lines will get overloaded on such occasions and there will be systems, such as helplines, to deal with it. The danger will be small cranky pressure groups or small cranky individuals who have access to money taking the agency to court. That is my only point; it has a tenuous link to the amendment, but I mention it as there will be no stand part debate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I intended to confine my response to the amendment. The hon. Member for Meriden spoke about the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy on red meat, COT on B6, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food on green-top milk, SEAC on beef on the bone, the Food Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes about GM labelling, something about which Opposition Members should be apologetic. She widened the debate considerably. I take the point that I made in my intervention: it was a small own goal. To some extent, the agency would be required to give information that it was reasonable to give to people who requested it, but there is no presumption in the Bill that the agency would have to answer every jot and tittle that was put to it.

<P>
Phone lines were given as an example. MAFF runs an extremely helpful consumer helpline and would answer people's questions about, for example, the fat content of sausages. We may even tell them, heaven forbid, what constitutes mechanically recovered meat, which I think the public should know more about. We get those calls. The consumer helpline was blind tested and came out top of a series of consumer helplines late last year. All the issues listed on page 8 of the explanatory notes on the Bill are work that goes on now. There is not a lot that is new there.

<P>
The work will be much more concentrated in the agency, but it is done at present by the joint food safety and standards group. It runs campaigns, publishes information, produces leaflets, runs the consumer helpline and issues advice to people with food allergies, as we mentioned in our short debate last week on peanut allergy. The clause is not about the decision-making processes of the agency but about the provision of advice.

<P>
The amendment seeks to limit the discretion of the agency. Every time that Opposition Members quoted subsection (2), they missed out the word ``significantly''. It reads:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that members of the public are kept adequately informed about and advised in respect of matters which the Agency considers significantly affect their capacity to make informed decisions about food.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Some of the examples that the hon. Lady gave were wrong, such as SEAC's giving three options. On an issue that does not require legislation, the agency may well tell the public that they can choose between two options. Ministers had to decide on the advice about beef on the bone because legislation was required. We do not blame SEAC for that. I am fully prepared to accept the responsibility for that. I do not simply accept but I agree with the chief medical officer's advice on that issue. We were given three options. The matter was not dumped on Ministers' desks in December 1997; we were alerted in June or July of that year, just after we came into office, that some research had shown BSE infectivity in the dorsal root ganglia, a part of the nervous system where it had not been found before. It was no good making a decision on the basis of what we were told in the summer of 1997. SEAC and the researchers checked that research at vast expense and in December 1997 confirmed the findings of infectivity in the dorsal root ganglia.

<P>
I said that we were given three options. I do not want to take up the Committee's time debating beef on the bone again. We did so when the ban was imposed and we shall no doubt do so again when we can lift the ban. One of the choices as I recall was slightly impractical; we could not have policed it in the abattoirs. If another had been adopted, the public would not have known the age of the animal, particularly in restaurants, which led us to the conclusion that if we did not wish knowingly to put BSE infectivity into the food chain, we had no choice--at that time--but to opt for a total ban.

<P>
That helps to explain why no animal older than 30 months goes into the food chain. The only known source of infectivity other than the suspected feed is maternal transmission. If we add 30 months for the food chain and nine months for the calf to August 1996, it follows that 39 months after August 1996 there should be no known cause of BSE infectivity in the food chain. That is why the chief medical officer, in the best written document that I have seen as a Minister--it came fully into the public domain on 18 January--said that he would revisit the issue in the summer. We are duty bound to rest on his advice. The agency will be no different.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I do not wish to get caught up in the rights and wrongs of beef on the bone. However, the Minister seems to be admitting that at least one of the recommendations was flawed because it was not practically possible. My point was simple. Informing the public about a range of options and pre-deciding one for them created the impression that they could have chosen another option. The recommendations should have focused on what was practicable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. It was not possible because we did not have the resources for checking abattoirs. That is not SEAC's function but that of MAFF's Meat Hygiene Service. SEAC provided three options--It was not its job to perform the other functions, but it was our job to decide. Policing the abattoirs was impractical. We made that clear at the time. There was no secret; it is nothing new. The agency will, like MAFF and the joint food safety and standards group, be coerced by food faddists and pressure groups. Those groups have a right to exert pressure, but it is also the right of the agency and the joint food safety and standards group not to be bowled over by it, but to take decisions on the basis of the best science available and risk assessment.

<P>
The Bill makes it clear that the agency will reflect on proportionality when issues arise--nothing wrong with that. Removing the words ``the agency considers'', however, would water down the agency's independence. That is the bottom line when it comes to clause 7(1)(a), and it would be open to people to challenge the agency in the courts. Frankly, the decision should be made in the agency. If it is not accepted by Ministers, this House will then decide. That is our function and that of the devolved Parliaments. It should be done openly. I do not want judges to decide what people can eat or what should be in the food chain. As I said, decisions should be based on good science and risk assessment. We should make a judgment and proceed openly and transparently on behalf of our fellow citizens. The courts are not the ultimate place for taking those decisions.

<P>
If we fettered the agency and removed its discretion, how would it make its decisions known? If the three words were removed, on what basis would the agency give advice? The amendment may not be a nonsense, but it would entrap the agency and reduce its capacity to be proactive and independent. The agency would feel as if it had no control over its decisions, and the lines of accountability from the agency through the Secretary of State to this House--and to the devolved Parliaments, for we must not forget those important institutions--would be broken because the courts would intervene. I do not believe that any hon. Member who thought about the issue for more than a couple of minutes would view that as sensible.

<P>
I cannot guarantee that speedy decisions will be made as a result of research. The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food advised on green-top milk as a result of research that it had commissioned, which found massive contamination, and recommended action. We consulted. We took a long time to take the decision. I am sorry, but the decision was nevertheless taken reasonably and rationally. Decisions cannot be speeded up and guaranteed to work at a tidy and convenient time for the administration and bureaucracy. No one can make such guarantees. The agency cannot guarantee that, and I am not guaranteeing it on behalf of the Government.
