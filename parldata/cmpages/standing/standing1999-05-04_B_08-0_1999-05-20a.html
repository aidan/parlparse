<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/062/1999062.htm">Finance Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>(Except clauses 2, 28 and 99)</center></H4>
<H4><center>Schedule 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>New Schedule 13B to the Taxes Act 1988</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [18 May]: No. 127, in line 23, to leave out from the word ``partner'' to the end of line 25 and insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) otherwise the Children's Tax Credit shall be divided equally between the two claimants.'.--[Mr. Michael Jack.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, that the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing amendment No. 72, in page 97, leave out lines 24 to 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) if they do not make an election, each partner will be entitled to a credit, calculated by halving the amount in section 257AA(2)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 118, in page 97, line 28, leave out from ``if'' to end of line 29 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`no part of either partner's income for the year falls within section 1(2)(b).'.--[Dawn Primarolo.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 99, line 43, leave out `other'.
<P>
I am quite excited by the amendment--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is keen to make progress, but he must not entice the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Perhaps I was over-egging the pudding, but I said that because the Government might want to accept the amendment, which would be an interesting innovation in the Committee. It is a technical amendment that would not change policy or the direction of the Bill. It was suggested to me by the Law Society, and would clarify the mechanism for assigning to a taxpayer a proportion of the credit.
<P>
Paragraph 6(9) of proposed new schedule 13B to the Taxes Act 1988 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For the purposes of any assignment to a taxpayer under sub-paragraph (5)(b) above--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Commissioners shall hear and determine the case in the same manner as an appeal, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any of the other taxpayers shall be entitled to appear and be heard by the Commissioners or to make representations to them in writing.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with the Law Society that that seems to suggest that the taxpayer to whom the assignment is to be made would be excluded from the hearing. It may be contestable, but sub-paragraph (9)(a) implies only that the taxpayer could be heard, and that is not explicit. The amendment would make it clear that the taxpayer who hopes to have the credit assigned to him would be able to be heard before the Commissioners.
<P>
The amendment is simple, and I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, this technical amendment, which would make no substantive change to the Bill, would clarify the rights of the taxpayers concerned. I am pleased to advise the hon. Gentleman that his enthusiasm for and excitement about the amendment, and the fact that it will improve the Bill, mean that we are happy to accept it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 3, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 29</center></H4>
<H4><center>Further provision about married couples allowance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 15, line 29, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless sections 257A(2) or 257A(3) apply to the husband (in which case the amount specified in sections 257A(2) or 257A(3) as the case may be).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would eradicate an injustice that already exists in the tax system and in the tax code. The huge changes to the married couples allowance presented the Government with an opportunity to eradicate that injustice.
<P>
The Conservative Government did an enormous amount to remove discrimination against women in the tax system--they introduced separate taxation and independent taxation. However, one or two small injustices remain, one of which relates to married women over the age of 65. When at least one spouse in a married couple is over 65, the couple can claim an enhanced married couples allowance, which is higher than the normal married couples allowance. The previous Conservative Government felt that it was important that reductions in the married couples allowance should not apply to retired couples whose financial plans were based on the existence of the married couples allowance. The Labour Government do not appear to share that concern--they will abolish the married couples allowance for couples who reach the age of 65 after next April. That is a great pity and a great injustice.
<P>
A wife can, jointly, elect to claim all of the married couples allowance, but if she does not, she is permitted to claim only 50 per cent. not of the full married couples allowance applicable to people over retirement age, but of the married couples allowance applicable to couples under 65 which is £1,970. The husband can claim the remainder, which is more than 50 per cent., although the couple might want to split the allowance 50:50.
<P>
The restriction applies only to women, and it is clearly therefore discriminatory. The amendment would deal with the injustice, so I hope that all Committee members will support it; there cannot possibly be a good justification for opposing it.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment. He referred to a ``small injustice'', I shall ask the Committee to reject the amendment because there is an impediment, which is called independent taxation, which we debated at considerable length on Tuesday. I am also surprised that the Conservative party is trying, at this late stage, to change the rules for the married couples allowance, which they introduced. The amendment should be rejected.
<P>
It has always been the case that a husband who is eligible for the age-related additional married couples allowance, which we are preserving for today's pensioners, has been able to transfer only the basic level of the married couples allowance to the wife, excluding the age-related element. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) seeks to enable the age-related element to be transferred as well.
<P>
That is how the rules introduced by the previous Conservative Government for transfer of the married couples allowance work. The reason why the full amount of age-related married couples allowance cannot be transferred to the wife is that the age-related element can be tapered away--does that term sound familiar?--depending on the level of the husband's income, as is the case, for the higher tax rate payer, with the children's tax credit. If the full married couples allowance were transferred to the wife, it might be necessary to reclaim some of the relief from her if her husband's income proved higher than expected. That would be a breach of confidentiality and add another layer of complexity to a system that is already far from simple.
<P>
Clause 29 does not change the way in which the married couples allowance rules work. However, it substitutes the new definition of the minimum level of the married couples allowance--the point beyond which the allowance is not tapered away--introduced by clause 28, into the transfer rules. Instead of defining the basic married couples allowance by cross-reference to the allowance for couples under 65, which is to be abolished, clause 28 introduces a new monetary floor for the minimum level of the married couple allowance. The change will make no difference to any pensioner's tax liability.
<P>
It is a little late in the day for the Opposition to decide that they do not like their own rules. Changing them in the way that the amendment suggests could cause difficulties for pensioner couples because of the way in which the age-related married couples allowance can be withdrawn on the basis of the husband's income. It is always possible for any surplus married couples allowance that the husband has to be transferred to the wife after the year end. Clause 29 leaves the present married couples allowance rules on transfer unchanged. There are no good reasons for changing them, so I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is a pity that the Paymaster General is taking such a partisan and party-political approach to this probing amendment, which seeks to raise the worries that exist outside the House about the discrimination that applies only to women. She is right to point out all the difficulties, but the Government should have come to terms with those, as they are making such radical changes to the married couples allowance legislation. This was an opportunity for the Government, who pride themselves on promoting equal opportunities between men and women, to deal with the one remaining injustice against women in the tax system.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that the rules were introduced by the previous Government--but they represent a residual discrimination left after huge changes had been made to the tax system by that Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amended rules were put in place in 1993-94, as a consequence of independent taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady makes my point for me. The tax code in place when the Conservative Government left office was far less discriminatory than the code that we inherited from the previous Labour Government. When changing legislation as complicated as this, there will always be residual provisions that have to be left in, or have to be put in, as a consequence of changing the whole system. The Government have missed an opportunity to eradicate the final element of discrimination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): It is rather flattering that the Paymaster General finds it a sufficient argument in support of a principle of taxation to say that the previous Government supported it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. The Government have advanced that argument throughout consideration of this Bill and others. It is a pity that they did not use their resources to end this injustice by changing the structure of the married couples allowance, which will continue to be claimed by ``today's pensioners''--to use the Paymaster General's phrase-for many years to come.
<P>
However, the point has been made, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall tell a story about a caring Chancellor of the Exchequer. During last year's Budget statement, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I have one further announcement: for hundreds of thousands of men and women, care within the family extends beyond caring for children to caring for disabled or elderly relatives, so, valuing families means valuing carers--spouses, grandparents, and all the carers who contribute to the family. As a first step to recognising the importance of carers within the family, I can today announce that I am ending an injustice that the previous Government tolerated. The tax allowance that has been available only to men with children whose wives are incapacitated will be extended to mothers with dependent children and incapacitated husbands. Because of the importance that I attach to ending this unfairness, I will backdate this additional help to April 1997.'' [Official Report, 17 March 1998; Vol. 308, c.1108]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Marvellous! We all applauded that announcement, which was the Chancellor's first step. His second is to use clause 30 to abolish the allowance altogether. One year the allowance was extended, but the next year it is abolished. That seems rather odd, and suggests not a carefully planned strategy but a tax policy in disarray.
<P>
The Carers National Association is concerned about that. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the recognition of the costs of caring and therefore the increased financial demands on carers is lost''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I regret to say that the hon. Gentleman yet again shows his lack of understanding of the changes. The additional personal allowance has always been available only to people with children. That includes married people with totally incapacitated spouses. Most will be eligible for the new children's tax credit, which will be worth more. Such people should still make a net gain from the Budget. The Government are determined to ensure that the tax system is fair.
<P>
Extending the additional personal allowance to married women with incapacitated spouses corrected a long-standing discrimination, over which the Conservative party presided. However, the time is right to reform the allowance as part of a wider package. As I said, the additional personal allowance was available only to people with children, and the children's tax credit will be available to those families. Therefore the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is simply wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not accept the Paymaster General's argument. The abolition of the allowance is collateral damage arising from the Government's decision to abolish the married couples allowance Opposition Members and the charities that have briefed us are concerned about that.

<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of widow's bereavement allowance</center></H4>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall be amended as follows--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`be amended in accordance with subsection (1A).
<P>
``(1A) In subsection (1) of that section for `section 257A(1)' there shall be substituted ``section 257A(5A)'''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is a great pity that the Government are abolishing the widows bereavement allowance. That modest tax allowance is available in the year of the death of a husband and the following year. Its purpose is to help a widow in the transition period when she has to equalise her income and expenditure. Household expenses do not decline significantly when a woman loses her husband, but her income often does.
<P>
The abolition of the widows bereavement allowance is another of the Government's disgraceful sleights of hand. Inland Revenue press release IR 1 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Widows will be more than compensated for the loss of the allowance by the proposed Widows bereavement Payment in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. This will be available to widows and widowers, and will help taxpayers and non-taxpayers alike.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement, which was issued by the Government on Budget day, was widely reported in the press. We now know that it was untrue. Some 100,000 widows--about half of those who claim the widows bereavement allowance--will not qualify for the widows bereavement payment because they are over 60. As Age Concern said in its evidence to the Treasury Select Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are also concerned at the abolition of the widow's bereavement allowance ... given to widows of all ages in the year in which their spouse dies and the following tax year. The Inland Revenue has stated that `widows will be more than compensated for the loss of this allowance by the proposed bereavement payment in the Welfare Reform and Pensions bill'.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Select Committee goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``As we understood the bereavement payment was normally only going to be paid to women widowed under the age of 60, can we therefore assume that the DSS will be extending this to older widows?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That has not happened, and, as the Select Committee went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``some widows who would have been eligible for the allowance (those aged over 60 when widowed) will not be eligible for the bereavement payment. The Chancellor agreed to write to us and in their note the Treasury stated that the bereavement payment `will not generally be available to people over pension age'.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That confirms the view expressed by Age Concern. On budget day, it was stated that a transfer payment introduced in other legislation would provide full compensation, but that has turned out to be completely untrue. The spokeswoman for the Inland Revenue, quoted in The Daily Telegraph, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The press release is wrong ... and is misleading.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was no mention of the abolition of the widows bereavement allowance in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget statement to the House of Commons. A factually wrong and misleading Inland Revenue press statement had to be rescinded by Treasury officials, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to write to the Treasury Committee to put the record straight. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to apologise to the Committee for yet another example of the Government giving one impression in the Budget, while the small print conceals a different consequence. As Joe Warlow, the director of the National Association of Widows, has said, the Budget changes make it seem as if the Government are targeting widows. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government is attacking a very weak target because very few people know before they become widows what the situation is and, of course, if they become a widow after these changes they will not know what they have lost.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's argument. Would he be prepared to extend the allowance to widowers if he had the opportunity to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady makes a valid point. It is important that discriminations are removed from the tax system. The Chancellor made no announcement that the allowance would be abolished, and all the Government's statements implied that everybody who previously qualified for the allowance would receive the widows bereavement payment. That is not the case, and the Government's policy is wrong. First, they are picking on a vulnerable section of society. Secondly, they are not fulfilling the promise made in Inland Revenue press releases and the impression given in the Budget statement.
<P>
The amendments would maintain the widows bereavement allowance in an attempt to alleviate some of the harm that has been done to those in--or approaching--retirement. A catalogue of harm now exists: the abolition of the married couples allowance for the elderly for newly retired pensioners from April next year; the abolition of the repayment of dividend tax credits to non taxpayers, including 300,000 pensioners; a higher rate of savings tax compared to the marginal rate of tax that many pensioners will face; the abolition of tax relief for home income plans, which are specifically devised to assist the elderly; and, now, the abolition of the widows bereavement allowance. The Government should be ashamed of that.

<P>

<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Will the hon. Gentleman not take into account the fact that his party in government dealt the worst blow to widows by halving the rates of widows SERPS? Not only did it introduce that change but it did not provide people with the necessary information. Many married couples now say that they made all their financial plans for retirement on the wrong basis. Until last year, the DSS was still giving them wrong information. The Conservative Government made no attempt to give widows correct information for 14 years, not eight years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady's Government continue that practice. Such things are unfortunate, but they are as nothing compared with the catalogue of deliberate Government decisions that have penalised that sector of society. They take away with one hand far more than they give with the other. They take away £500 a year in income from many people who are approaching retirement or who are newly retired. That is money that those people were expecting to receive. In one decision, they abolish married couples allowance and replace it with £100 winter fuel payment. That is what is happening, and people outside the House are beginning to notice. People approaching retirement are beginning to see a pattern in the Government's actions. They believe that they are sitting ducks, vulnerable to attack by the Government as a means of raising revenue with little opposition. That is disgraceful.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that Labour Members are noticing--as we are--that their postbags contain an increasing number of letters from people in their early-60s or mid-60s who are very angry about the abolition of married couples allowance, the dividend tax credit issue, the abolition of widows bereavement allowance and the abolition of home income plans tax relief. All those issues will come home to roost--
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Can I bring the hon. Gentleman back to the amendment, the clause and the allowance? Does he not agree that there should be consistency in the tax system and equality of treatment between genders? Does that not lead us to conclude that we should either extend the allowance also to men or recognise that there is now equal treatment in relation to widows and bereaved people's benefits under the new welfare reform legislation. One or the other must be the case. If the hon. Gentleman would extend the allowance, has he costed it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> What I do not agree with is the way in which the Government are dealing with this injustice by abolishing the allowance altogether and not replacing it for widows over 60. Whatever way it should be dealt with--and that is for the Government to decide--that is not the way, because it is grossly unjust to a vulnerable section of society at the most vulnerable time of their lives. If the hon. Lady really cares about widows, she should vote for the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> May I associate myself with almost all the remarks made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton? Of course I do not accept his defence of the previous Government because I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) that their policy on the state earnings-related pension scheme, the way that affected widows, and their failure to publicise the measure was a disgrace. I believe that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), who spoke on the Floor of the House on this issue on Monday night, actually apologised. I would have expected the hon. Gentleman to do likewise.
<P>
However, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has a significant point: people over the age of 60 who are widowed should be protected and should receive some support from the Government, either through the tax system and widows bereavement allowance or through some other payment. Whether that is achieved through other measures that we will discuss on the Floor of the House or by accepting the hon. Gentleman's amendments, the Government must do something about it. As the hon. Gentleman said, pensioners seem to have become a target for the Government's tax increases. I believe that pensioners are noticing that, and I say quite openly to Labour Members that it is in their political interests not to allow the Government to keep chipping away at different allowances and tax credits.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am sorry, but I will keep labouring this point because I thought that the changes in welfare reform were correct. Hansard will show what I said in Committee. On that aspect of widows allowance, does the hon. Gentleman agree that equality between genders should remain in taxation and benefits? If so, would he extend the allowance and has he costed it? Opposition Members have still not answered that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Lady is right to talk about equality. I should have thought that she would want her Government to introduce measures to promote equality, which I, too, would favour. I should have thought that there would be some agreement between us on promoting that and protecting widows over 60. Such people are at a vulnerable stage in their lives and might not have huge amounts of savings. They probably hope to spend their retirement with their husband--or, to move down the equality line, with their wife. In such circumstances, it is important that we do not allow a sudden, unexpected and traumatic shock to leave them financially bereft.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman in his long and wide-ranging digression, but I want to bring him back to the question that was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). Does he agree with extending the benefit? If so, has he costed that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I believe that we should extend to widowers the payments that are made to widows. We could consider alternative ways of doing that. For example, we could reduce the level to ensure that the payments are shared by men and women. That is one possible approach. We should also consider the costing. However, that is not the issue before us today.
<P>
Labour Members are trying to divert us from considering whether to provide support to pensioners who are widows and over the age 60. They might want to throw us off course, but they must answer their constituents who will ask them whether they want to leave that group unprotected. I think that their constituents would want us to retain the protection.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for tabling the amendment. I certainly support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Like the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), I support my hon. Friend's amendment.
<P>
One or two Labour Members have let the cat out of the bag. They no doubt think that they have been helpful to the Paymaster General. However, if I were her, I would be cringing at every successive intervention from Labour Members, because they have revealed the Labour party's instincts.
<P>
Of course, there is a problem with the different treatment of widows and widowers, and the fact that widowers do not receive an allowance. So what is the answer of Labour Members? Their answer is to stick up taxes. Because the allowance is available to some, but not to all, they do not consider what we should do to remove the distortion. They do not examine different ways of providing the allowance on a gender-neutral basis to everyone who might be entitled to it. They want to remove it, so that they can raise more taxes and put the tax burden up. They have revealed the instinct that the Paymaster General and, certainly, the Chancellor of the Exchequer tried to conceal. No doubt, they thought that they were being helpful.
<P>
The Government's decision to remove the widows allowance is another manifestation of the application of false logic. We saw the same false logic when we discussed corporation tax. In this case, the Government's logic is that, because the widows allowance is of an equivalent value to the married couples allowance and because the Government have chosen to abolish the married couples allowance, it therefore follows that we should abolish the widows allowance. That is a complete non sequitur for the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton gave.
<P>
The widows allowance was not introduced at the same time as the married couples allowance. It was introduced at a separate time for a separate purpose. It was not introduced, as someone suggested, in 1993, but in the early 1980s when Lord Howe was Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was introduced to reflect the reality that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described. When a husband or wife dies, the costs of the household do not fall immediately or automatically as a result of that death. That fact was therefore reflected in the tax system. That was the basis on which the widows allowance was introduced and that is the basis on which the Committee should consider whether it should be withdrawn. It is a separate matter from the presence or absence of the married couples allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the amendment would perpetuate unfairness to widowers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The purpose of tabling amendments, as any hon. Member who has sat on a Committee for any length of time will know, is not to prepare precise drafting. When the hon. Gentleman becomes a Minister he will learn of the existence of someone called the parliamentary draftsman. The parliamentary draftsman reserves as a monopoly to himself or herself the right to draft amendments to legislation. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will be more than content to seek to withdraw the amendment if the Government propose to commission the parliamentary draftsman to deliver a revised future for the widows allowance, which reflects the policy arguments that the Committee will have the opportunity to accept by a majority vote in a few minutes' time.
<P>
I look forward to the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) making it clear to the Government Whip that on this occasion he has been persuaded by the policy arguments advanced from the Opposition Benches and will vote for the amendment, and that he looks forward to the Paymaster General tabling an amendment on Report that will deliver the policy that he will have the opportunity to support.
<P>
[Interruption.] I am advancing a policy that I invite Labour Members to support.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Yes, I shall give way to the hon. Lady. She has been so helpful to the case that it would be perverse of me not to give way and to invite her to offer further assistance.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right: he has experience of Government. I am surprised that he wants to hide behind the argument of the parliamentary draftsman. In Government, would he not have had to listen to the European Court of Human Rights, which says that the current position is irresponsible and wrong?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Another piece of advice, which comes from a former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Healey, is that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging.
<P>
The hon. Lady has made the fair point that there is a distortion in the present tax system. She appears to believe that merely to point out a distortion is to make the argument for a tax increase. It is a preposterous suggestion. The only way to remove the distortion is by raising the tax burden. It speaks volumes for Labour Members' instincts that they appear to believe that that is true.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to move on to other points and not make too long a speech.
<P>
Secondly, I want to underline the dishonesty of a Government who issue on Budget day a press release that says that widows will be ``more than compensated'' by the introduction of the bereavement payment, when it is abundantly clear that many widows will receive no compensation from the bereavement payment. Many widows--I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton quoted a figure of roughly half of all widows--will not be entitled under the rules of the bereavement payment to any compensation. Therefore, it is not true--
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No. I shall give way in a moment. It is not true to say that widows are more than compensated? Half of them will receive no compensation at all. If the hon. Lady is persuaded by her own argument that there should be a link between the widows allowance and the married couples allowance, I put a simple question to the Paymaster General: why is the widows allowance being abolished on a different time scale from the married couples allowance? The married couples allowance continues, as she knows, where one partner was born before 1935, but the widows bereavement allowance is being withdrawn with effect from 6 April 2000. If the hon. Member for Colne Valley believes that there is a link between the two allowances, why does she not honour her own commitment and ensure that the widows allowance continues to be available with the married couples allowance for those born before 1935?
<P>
I give way again to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's generosity. I do not want to go into the issue of welfare reform again, which I supported, but he must understand that that is the compensation. If the hon. Gentleman is convinced that compensation is an issue, can he tell us what compensation he put in place when he reduced the allowance by 20 per cent.?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall not return to debates on previous Finance Bills. Every Finance Bill, this one included, has a substantial number of clauses and every package has to be considered as a whole. I am considering as a whole the package being offered to widows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman must contain his impatience. I am dealing with his hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley at the moment. The Government have proposed a package for widows which they say more than compensates them. Let us examine that proposition. First, half of all widows get nothing out of the package. Secondly, widows who will continue to benefit from the married couples allowance because they or their partner was born before 1935 will not receive the allowance either. Thirdly, the most remarkable aspect of the Government's package is that the targeting of assistance through the widows payment excludes from benefit all widows or widowers over the age of 60.
<P>
At what stage in our lives do the h Lady or I stand the greatest chance of being widowed? Surely our chances of that fate are greater once we pass our 60th birthdays. Can the Paymaster General explain how the Government can say that widows will be more than compensated by the package that they propose when they are withdrawing it from those born before 1935 and from men or women who are widowed after the age of 60? The Government cannot show that, in the substance of their package, they are delivering what their press release claims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Would the right hon. Gentleman apply his estimable intellect and look at how the first part of his argument has been undermined by the second part? He said that interventions from Labour Members had shown the Government's true intentions, which are to raise taxes by withdrawing the allowance. Yet the second part of his argument where he accepts that widows benefits will be given shows that the money that the Government have taken in one area is being more than given back in bereavement benefit. It is wrong to accuse the Government of embarking on a tax raising enterprise when the money saved in one area is being more than given back to those people in bereavement benefit. His argument--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions are meant to be brief. A member of the Committee can readily make a contribution to the discussions later, and responses can be made then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am glad that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman, because I have never heard my own argument made for me so persuasively. The way that he put it was not quite as clear as it might have been, so let me clarify what he said so that the Committee can appreciate the extent to which he was supporting my proposition.
<P>
He rightly pointed out that it is the Government's policy to collect more tax from widows over 60 in order to pay out benefits to widows and widowers under 60. There may be policy arguments in favour of more generous benefit payments to widows and widowers under 60, but I will not get into them now. However, there is no argument for saying that the extra burden on the taxpayer should be borne exclusively by widows, which would be the effect of the Government's package. That is why I oppose it.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not surprised that the right hon. Gentleman sat down so quickly. If I were advancing his argument, I would have sat down quickly, too.
<P>
May I deal first with the press release? Opposition Members have sought to allege deceit on the part of the Government--that the Government intentionally provided information that they knew was incorrect. For the record, let me make it clear that there was a genuine misunderstanding in the press release. We have acknowledged that and confirmed that no existing claimants will lose out. The Chancellor was questioned on this matter in the Treasury Select Committee, and subsequently wrote to acknowledge the error and to make it clear that no existing claimants would lose out.
<P>
I do not want to try your patience, Mr. Cook, by venturing into discussions of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. However, the changes need to be viewed in parallel. Conservative Members have a blinkered approach: they are able to judge the Government's policy only in respect of this aspect of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Was it also a mistake when the Chancellor failed to mention the abolition of the widows bereavement allowance in his Budget statement?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was going to come on to that. The Chancellor referred to the withdrawal of the married couples allowance, with which these allowances are closely linked--so he did mention that in his speech. I do not mind the cut and thrust of debate on points at issue in Committee. However, it is a poor show for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton continually to impugn misrepresentation in the Chancellor's Budget statement. In every instance advanced by the hon. Gentleman, we have demonstrated that he, not the Chancellor, misunderstands.
<P>
Let me deal with pensioners and the background assumption that pensioners' rights are being chipped away and attacked. I remind the Committee that it is this Labour Government who introduced the minimum income guarantee, made a fivefold increase in the winter allowance, increased personal allowances above indexation and introduced the 10p starting rate for taxation. We are retaining the married couples allowance for the over-65s as we reform in order to protect. The Government have also sought to help pensioners through national savings.
<P>
We should add those to our achievements in cutting VAT on fuel, reintroducing free eye tests, introducing new travel concessions, putting an extra £21 billion into the national health service and uprating from April the basic state pension to £66.75 for a single person and £160.70 for a married couple. The Government have many other achievements to their credit and if we contrast that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. I contrast that with Opposition Members' record when they were in Government. They put VAT on fuel, restricted tax allowances, broke links between pensions and earnings, messed up the State earnings-related pensions scheme, introduced charges for eye tests for pensioners, presided over mis-selling of pensions, ran down the national health service--the list goes on. I know that you do not want us to discuss the merits of Government policy towards pensioners, Mr. Cook, but it is right to put the record straight, in view of the spurious argument that Opposition Members seek to advance.
<P>
Before I talk about the amendment, I shall answer the questions asked by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He asked first why we did not extend the widows bereavement allowance. He did not want to say how he would extend it. I keep returning to the point that the widows bereavement allowance had to be reformed in the light of the reform of the married couples allowance. A system of allowances that recognised marriage only when the spouse died would make little sense. That position, which the hon. Gentleman has adopted is not logical.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said, secondly, that to scrap the allowance would hit pensioners. As I have already explained, the Government are protecting that position by keeping the married couples allowance for pensioners, and by introducing the 10p starting rate. I shall not go over that ground again.
<P>
Opposition Members must decide whether they want to eliminate discrimination or keep it in the system. In the previous debate they talked about eliminating it from the system, and in this debate they talk about keeping it. I know that their policy development is in chaos, and that even they recognise that consistency is a little thin on the ground, but to have inconsistency in their approach to two clauses within half an hour stretches credulity.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Paymaster General talks about inconsistency, but she has just been inconsistent in the space of two minutes. She has argued for the link between the widows bereavement allowance and the married couples allowance, but her policy is to break that link in respect of those born before 1935. Can she explain to the Committee why the widows bereavement allowance is being withdrawn in respect of those who are entitled to maintain the married couples allowance?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I was coming to that later, but I shall deal with it now.
<P>
The aim of the reform of both the married couples allowance and the widows bereavement allowance was to ensure that existing claimants did not lose. [Interruption.] The right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) does not like the argument, but it is perfectly logical. The date of abolition reflects the different criteria.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also said that the widows bereavement allowance was not associated with the married couples allowance. One does not need to go far back in history to see that the widows bereavement allowance was introduced to compensate women for not having a married couples allowance in the year the spouse died, whereas men did get one. Therefore the allowance is directly connected to the married couples allowance.
<P>
The issues that Opposition Members continually advance in our debates illustrate that they do not understand the nature of discrimination, the content of the clauses or even how the system worked before the changes were made. They cannot see the line of logic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may make a couple of comments about the amendments first, I shall be happy to give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The widows bereavement allowance is an anachronism. It is available to a widow but not a widower, and it is available to a widow for no more than two years, after which time she can no longer claim the allowance, regardless of her financial position. That is why the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill will provide a better package of benefits for widows and widowers.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Budget delivered a package of measures designed to target more help to where it is needed most--to families, children and pensioners. As part of the package, we shall replace the married couples allowance and associated allowances with the new children's tax credit. We have already discussed that, and Conservative Members did not vote against the clause that introduced the children's tax credit. Therefore, they accept its provisions. The widows bereavement allowance is one of the associated allowances. On 28 April, the Committee of the whole House considered and approved clause 28, which deals with the reform of the married couples allowance.
<P>
To retain the widows bereavement allowance after the married couples allowance had been largely abolished would make no sense. It would leave us with a system of allowances that recognised marriage only when a husband has died. That is nonsense. What are Conservative Members thinking of? Why would that make sense?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is the Government who are abolishing the married couples allowance; Conservative Members did not propose that. The Paymaster General and the Government are creating a tax system that would be nonsense without the abolition of a relief to very vulnerable people. We voted against the abolition of the married couples allowance and we shall vote against the abolition of the widows bereavement allowance. They are both stealth taxes that have been imposed on society by the Government.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks utter rubbish. The Opposition did not vote against the creation of the children's tax credit, which replaces the married couples allowance. Their approach is not just cherry picking; it is crazy. At one point they tell us that we should simplify the system and remove complexity and discrimination from it, but they then want as much complexity and discrimination as suits their case when they want to grab a headline.
<P>
I advise the Committee that the amendments are technically deficient in a spectacular way, despite the fact the Conservative Members made several attempts to decide what they wanted to do. The amendments would retain the widow bereavement allowance, but would leave it outside the rules governing income tax reductions. That means that it is not clear where the allowance would fit in the order of setting-off allowances.
<P>
Amendment No. 129, which specifies a monetary amount for the widows bereavement allowance, would also leave it outside the rules that limit the amount of tax relief outside statutory indexation. Those points are not made just for tax anoraks. The technical deficiencies in the amendments would confuse people trying to work out their tax liability.
<P>
The new element introduced by amendment No. 129 is the idea that the widow would be able to use the widows bereavement allowance against her late husband's tax liabilities. That would overturn the rules for the transfer of allowances that the Opposition put in place when they were in government. Do they accept any responsibility for tax system that they presided over for 18 years? It is not unreasonable to expect them to agree that they applied those rules, and that they were right to do so--or are they saying that they cheated the taxpayer for 18 years?
<P>
The amendment would not only overturn the rules on transfer of allowances, but would extend the reach of the widows bereavement allowance beyond the grave. That would make it even more discriminatory, yet Conservative Members are the ones complaining about discrimination.
<P>
The amendments would leave the tax system in the absurd position of providing relief for most married couples only when one of the spouses died. They would do nothing to tackle the problem of discrimination against widows, and they would undo the carefully balanced package of reforms announced in the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Would the hon. Lady be kind enough to say, in the spirit of clarification, whether a Library research paper is right or wrong in asserting:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Department of Social Security has also confirmed that the payment will not be introduced when the tax allowance for widows is abolished in 2000-01. It will only be paid to people who are widowed from April, 2001 leaving all the newly bereaved widows in 2000-01 with neither tax relief nor an increased cash payment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I ask a simple question: is that right or wrong? Will a particular group at a particular time have neither tax relief nor an increased cash payment?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have not had the benefit of recent study of that specific point in the research paper. However, I have told the Committee that no existing claimants will lose. The case is quite clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am more than happy to let the hon. Lady have a look at my copy of the research paper now. Hon. Members have made several important points about discrimination. In that spirit, and in recognition of the wish to remove anomalies, if the paper has spotted a lacuna, and a particular group in a particular year will suffer by the removal of current benefits but be unable to gain from the new benefits, will the hon. Lady agree to look further into the problem and take steps to help that particular group?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As I have told the Committee, the carefully considered proposals in the clauses will ensure that no existing claimants lose. That is the position. I do not need the hon. Gentleman to give me a copy of the report; I can assure him that, as I said, no claimants will lose.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose-- 
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I think that I have demonstrated that. [hon. Members : ``No.'']--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We are debating amendments Nos. 129 and 122. I have responded to those amendments and demonstrated not only that Opposition Members do not have a policy but that they are incapable of understanding the policy before us. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to oppose the amendments if they are pressed to a Division.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must a correct a mistake; we are debating amendments Nos. 129 and 112, not amendment No. 122 as the hon. Lady suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I rise with some reticence to make a further speech, because it does not serve the interest of the Committee to go round and round the same point. I shall not mention any of the arguments in my first speech but pick up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) about the lacuna in the provisions for those who are widowed between April 2000 and April 2001. The Paymaster General did not respond to the question that my hon. Friend asked. If nothing else, the purpose of my speech is to provide her with time to equip herself with the answer to that question.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that no existing claimant will lose. But we are talking about a bereavement allowance, and men and women who will be bereaved between April 2000 and April 2001 are not currently claimants. Will they be entitled, under the rules of the Government's widows payment, to what the Government claim is the off-setting benefit for the abolition of the widows bereavement allowance? If not, my hon. Friend the Member for Witney was right to say that there is a single year when they will not benefit from widows bereavement allowance and that that different group, who rightly or wrongly, will be entitled to different levels of benefit under the new system, will not be entitled to it either.
<P>
The Paymaster General cannot get away with answering a question that my hon. Friend did not ask her and not answering the important question that he did ask her. I will happily give way to her if she now has a piece a paper with that information. Whether or not the Committee is persuaded by arguments of principle that have been advanced by the Opposition about the bereavement allowance, there is a serious issue of practicality.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I understood that we were discussing the Finance Bill, not the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. The bereavement payment for widows will already be in place, and it is £1,000. Therefore, no existing claimants will lose. It is difficult when hon. Members want to go over legislation that is not even before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> We simply seek to pick up the argument that the Paymaster General and her hon. Friends have made since the beginning of the debate, that the package is one in which, to quote the press release, widows will be ``more than compensated''. The Paymaster General has the opportunity to resolve this issue at a stroke. She could simply tell us--
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I just did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With great respect to the hon. Lady, she did not. When does entitlement to the new bereavement allowance come into effect? Is it for widows bereaved on or after 6 April 2000 or April 2001? If she says 2000, she is saying that the Library research paper is wrong. That is not unheard of. It is wrong? Are we talking about people being entitled from April 2000 or from April 2001?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I referred to the bereavement ``payment'', which, although the right hon. Gentleman said ``allowance'', I think he meant. He asked specifically about 2000 and 2001. The £1,000 bereavement payment for widows will be in place at that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I shall gladly bring my remarks to a close.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Am I right in thinking that the £1,000 payment already exists in legislation? The previous legislation had the widows bereavement allowance and the £1,000 payment, and the Government are now abolishing the widows bereavement allowance and will not replace that element until a full year later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B>  It is totally unsatisfactory for the Paymaster General to come to the Committee to make the case that this is a package which should be considered as a whole and then to apologise that it is all frightfully difficult and that she does not have the details of the package as they are the responsibility of the social security system. Either this is a package or it is not.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman asked about compensation. The £1,000 is an extra amount. The lump sum payment is £2,000. I am answering the questions, but because the Opposition do not understand the issue, they are getting more confused.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> If we are confused, we are being ably assisted by the Paymaster General. As she has been unable to explain the nature of the package that she is commending she is, at the very least, under an obligation to write to the Committee setting out the detail of that package. She should also respond to the specific point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. He based his question on the Library research paper, which suggests that there is a time difference between the withdrawal of the widows bereavement allowance and the introduction of the full package that will replace the existing system. Is there or is there not a lacuna? The Paymaster General has not answered that simple question. We need to move on to other aspects of the Bill, but she owes the Committee and the public an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I rise to speak again because it is clear that the Paymaster General is not going to respond to my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. She will have another opportunity to speak after I have spoken.
<P>
Our concern is whether a group of people--I am sorry that the Paymaster General is sighing, because this is an important matter--will get caught out for one year. I am sure that she does not intend to catch them out. If the Library research paper has spotted that in the transition from one system to another, a group of people may be caught between a Finance Bill and a social security Bill for one year while the new payments come into force, would it not be appropriate for her to tell the Committee, in good spirit, that she will ask her officials to consider the matter?
<P>
I understand why the Paymaster General wants to sit here and prevaricate, but she has not said that the paper is wrong. Although she has given us a great deal of information about other matters, she has not given us a simple answer. The research paper says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It will only be paid to people who are widowed from April, 2001 leaving all the newly bereaved widows in 2000-01 with neither tax relief nor an increased cash payment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She has not said that that is wrong, or that she will consider it. She should be graceful enough to accept that the Library research paper--that statement did not come from the Conservative Benches--might have spotted something that matters.
<P>
Although our concerns about people who might get left out lie behind many of the proposals in the amendments, one other group concerns me.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I happen to have with me the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. It gives the date of 5 April 2000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for that. I look forward to the Paymaster General telling us that the research paper is wrong. If a group of people are caught by the detail, it would befit the Government especially in light of the principles that she has espoused this morning, to defend them.
<P>
The National Association of Widows has said that the Budget targets widows. The Government claimed that they were targeting widows fairly, but the association does not agree. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Those with children will also face cuts in their tax reliefs. A newly bereaved mother will lose the widow's bereavement allowance and the addition personal allowance for single parents with children. That is a loss of £394 in 2000-01 compared with 1999-2000. There have been reams written on the married couples allowance being abolished but very few people seem to have realised that the widows bereavement allowance is linked to that and will go too. And there will be a year's gap before the new child tax credit and the £2,000 payment come in. The Government is attacking a very weak target because very few people know before they become widows what the situation is and, of course, if they become a widow after these changes they will not know what they have lost.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it. The Government want to introduce the changes to make the position fairer, but they are introducing a less fair system because fewer people will receive the allowance; fewer of those who really need it will receive it. I remind the hon. lady that although I would be one of the last people in the House to support discrimination in any shape or form, the allowance was introduced in 1980 because, as the then chancellor said, he wanted to do more for widows in the difficult time immediately following bereavement.
<P>
The allowance has had a huge take-up rate--we know that widowers have been able to take it up--but we must be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Let us ensure that the change is for the better. Crucially--this is not a cheap political point--I ask the hon. Lady to say that she is absolutely confident that the House of Commons research paper is wrong in its conclusion.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We are not discussing or voting on a House of Commons research paper, we are discussing the Finance Bill, and I have answered the questions asked. The hon. Member for Witney added a new dimension to our discussion of the amendments, although it was raised constantly throughout discussion of the Budget. He quoted the case of a widow who loses the additional personal allowance. I must remind him that child benefit has been increased, working families tax credit child premium has been increased, income support child premium has been increased, and there will be entitlement to the children's tax credit. The child benefit increases are immediate. The working families tax credit for those in employment will be introduced in October. Income support is available now. The additional personal allowance was worth only £197, but the children's tax credit will be worth £416. The case that the hon. Gentleman advanced about the loss is simply not true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This has been a fascinating debate, which has revealed that the Minister does not have all the facts at her fingertips. It takes a lot to extract the facts from her, and we are still unclear about them. I believe that she confirmed that the £2,000 payment will be made to those who are widowed--widowered--after April 2000, but that conflicts with the conclusions in the House of Commons research paper and with The Daily Telegraph, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Department of Social Security has also confirmed that the payment will not be introduced when the tax allowance for widows is abolished in 2000-01. It will only be paid to people who are widowed from April''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>2000</H5>
</P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leaving all the newly bereaved widows in 2000-01 with neither tax relief nor an increased cash payment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is on the record that the Paymaster General believes that the payment will apply from April 2000.
<P>
The Paymaster General swaggers that the amendment is technically flawed, which may or may not be the case. It mirrors the position in the Taxes Act, although it was changed to reflect the fact that the Government have abolished the married couples allowance regime--a new facsimile had to be inserted into the amendment to reflect that fact. It is irrelevant to ask whether or not the amendment's wording is technically defective. We want to debate the principle that is involved in the abolition of the widows bereavement allowance.
<P>
The Paymaster General cited a list of benefits that she believes the Government have given to pensioners, including the minimum income guarantee. However, she did not say how many people the minimum income guarantee will apply to. This is a classic example of the Government's sleight of hand. They give the impression to pensioners throughout the land that all of them will receive the minimum income guarantee, but that is not the case. Many of my constituents have asked me when they will receive the minimum income guarantee. The answer, of course, is that they will not, because they are not on income support. The Government's proposal applies only to pensioners in receipt of income support.
<P>
The Paymaster General did not include in her list the abolition of the married couples allowance for those who will not be 65 by next April, but who are approaching that age. The measure will cost those people £500 a year. She did not mention the abolition of the repayment of dividend tax credits, which will cost 300,000 pensioners £75 a year in higher tax. She did not mention the discrimination in the tax rates that are applicable to pensioners' savings. She did not mention the abolition of tax relief in relation to home income plans, which will be expensive for the many pensioners who hope to benefit from the release of capital that is tied up in their home and to have a bit of extra income in retirement. She did not mention the abolition of retirement relief in last year's Budget, and she does not understand the impact that the widows bereavement allowance will have on society.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman proposing a new interpretation of the word, ``guarantee''? If I have a guarantee for a television, will I have to take it back for repair within a specified period although nothing has gone wrong with it? That is what his comments on the minimum income guarantee imply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am describing, for the benefit of Committee members, the impression that is given to people outside the House. It is not much fun when pensioners ask me when they will receive the minimum income--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No, I shall not. I want to bring my remarks to a close.
<P>
Many pensioners in my constituency ask me, ``When will I get the minimum income guarantee?'' I have to reply, ``Unless you are on income support, you will not get the minimum income guarantee.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can tell pensioners, ``You will not get the guarantee.'' Pensioners may not need to take up the guarantee, but it will be given to them. The point at issue is whether or not they will need to take it up. For the hon. Gentleman to tell pensioners that they will not get the guarantee is deliberately misleading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is the Government who are misleading. They give the impression that every pensioner will be given the minimum income guarantee. When one examines the small print, the hon. Gentleman may have given the correct interpretation--[HON. MEMBERS: ``Oh.''] But that is not the impression that is held by thousands of pensioners outside this House.
<P>
I shall not try your patience further, Mr. Cook, in this regard. I am very disappointed by the Paymaster General's response. She said nothing about the key issue: why will widows over the age of 60 be discriminated against by the abolition of the allowance and by the failure to provide a replacement allowance, which the Inland Revenue press release promised to do? She did not say why the Government will not replace the allowance for widows who are over 60. In view of that, I shall press the amendment to a vote.

<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maintenance payments</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 16, line 40, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 97, in schedule 20, page 157, column 3, leave out lines 23 to 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B>  We are used to stealth taxation from the Chancellor, but it is rare to find such a good example as clause 33. It is a specimen example of stealth tax, and should be put into a glass bottle in the Treasury and kept as an example of the Government's approach to taxation. It contains all the elements: it was smuggled out in the small print, after the Budget statement, and it will hit people retrospectively and unfairly. I refer to the withdrawal of tax relief on maintenance payments. It was such a stealth tax that even the Chancellor seemed unaware of it.
<P>
It was pointed out in The Sunday Times after the Budget that, at a press briefing, the Chancellor was unaware of the measure that he was proposing. It was pointed out to me by an aggrieved journalist who would, himself, suffer from the withdrawal of tax relief on his maintenance payments, that the Chancellor was unaware of the proposal even when it was explained that those affected would lose between £200 and £2,500 a year. The Government were so embarrassed by that gaffe that, according to The Sunday Times, spin doctors leaked the mistake to another newspaper to try to kill the story. Nevertheless, The Sunday Times ran the story under the headline,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Child maintenance gaffe shows Brown to be the father of spin''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is disgraceful that the Chancellor was so obsessed with covering up the damage caused by his budget that he failed to clarify the matter in his Budget statement or the subsequent press briefing. I shall return to the press statement on Budget day in a moment.
<P>
For settlements made after 1988, when the law was changed, each payer of maintenance will lose about £200 a year. However, our amendments deal with settlements made before 1988 because, in may cases, such payers will suffer much more. Before the Budget, they received 10 per cent. tax relief on the first £1,970 and full relief on the balance. That relief was mirrored in the treatment of recipients, who were not taxed on the first sum but were taxed fully on the balance. The Government intend to remove the tax relief and the tax liability. In many cases, it is the taxpayers who will be hit hardest, because they will pay tax at a higher rate.
<P>
Given that the relief has no logical connection with married couples allowance, it is disreputable of the Government to pretend that it is directly related to the abolition of that allowance. Many of those who have written to us on the matter are no longer married and are making maintenance payments to their ex-wives. The Government dress up the change as consequential and unimportant, but it will retrospectively hit many people who made court settlements in the expectation that the relief would continue.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee how we should describe the reductions in maintenance relief made by the previous Government during the 1980s and 1990s? Were they stealth taxes imposed in retrospection, or does he apply such terminology only to this Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The point is that, when we made those changes in 1988, we continued with previous settlements. However, such settlements will now be suddenly and arbitrarily ended.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B>  Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Lady will have a chance to make her points in due course. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Shipley, who is shouting from a sedentary position, has been here long enough to know that an Opposition spokesman makes introductory remarks, to which the Minister may respond. If he wants to intervene, I shall happily give way, but I have already given way to the Paymaster General and I am trying to reply to her point. Court settlements made before 1988 were specifically exempted from changes that we introduced in that year. Although the ending of married couples allowance for all except a certain category of pensioner should be an entirely separate matter, such settlements will be chopped by the Government on that specious basis.
<P>
As I said, payers of maintenance are likely to lose more through the abolition of the relief than the recipients will gain through the abolition of taxation on maintenance payments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): The right hon. Gentleman characterises the changes as stealth taxes and, on that basis, the Opposition intend to oppose them yet the Opposition seem to support all the new reliefs and concessions. Will that be their position throughout consideration of the Finance Bill? If so, can they give the Committee an estimate of the cost to the Treasury?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There are no additional tax concessions for the category of people that my amendment attempts to defend. Indeed, we have already discussed how the abolition of married couples allowance will be replaced eventually by a new children's tax credit, but it will not benefit the people whom I am describing because very few of them will still have dependent children. Leaving aside the fact that they must wait a full year before the alternative children's tax credit is introduced, they will not see the benefit of it. Thus they are being hit from every direction.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that the arrangements for the children's tax credit recognise the reformation of families and changing attitudes towards supporting stepchildren, with most support now being administered by the Child Support Agency? Those arrangements offer a much fairer and more realistic way of providing tax support for people who look after children in families?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, I do not accept that it is right to override deeds of covenant that have been set up in the expectation that the tax relief will be respected, bearing in mind that those people are doing the best for their ex-wives. Those people are paying maintenance, as the Government wish them to, rather than relying on handouts or benefits. Those private legal arrangements made between contracting parties are now being upset by the retrospective abolition of the tax regime under which they were drawn up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B>  The right hon. Gentleman is making an important point about restrospection. Does he think that the measure will apply only to court orders that were made when the original maintenance settlement was established or does he think that the Child Support Agency will have to reconsider some of the settlements that it established? Will he comment on the administrative burden, complexity and hardship that will result?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is true that this measure is not primarily about child support. Indeed, I have made the point that many people who are affected by this will no longer have dependent children. However, in some cases, the hon. Gentleman is right, children will be involved and the recipients of maintenance payments will have to look after the children of the former marriage. If that all goes wrong, it could end up with the Child Support Agency--and every member of the Committee has had enough trouble already trying to sort out the complex arrangements established through the CSA--

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me, but I want to make progress in my remarks. I shall give way a little later if I may first deploy my case at slightly greater length.
<P>
We are not talking about some unknown and invisible collection of taxpayers who may be sacrificed on the altar of the separate issue of withdrawing married couples allowance. We are talking about real people who have written to Committee members and other hon. Members. I want to quote an especially good example, which was drawn to my attention by my right hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk (Mr. MacGregor), because it draws together the problems. The constituent separated from his former wife in 1988, when he drew up a deed of covenant to pay her a regular annual sum. He considered that that was a responsible way of dealing with her material needs. He says that it now appears from the Budget--he used that word deliberately because he had great difficulty finding out the details from the press statements--that relief is to be abolished. He considers that, for people in his position, that represents a considerable increase in taxation. He points out that his ex-wife will no longer be taxable on the payment that she receives, so there is an unintended switch in benefit from him to his ex-wife. It would be wholly unreasonable to expect the parties to return to court to obtain a variation that is likely to be contested by the ex-wife. That would be expensive and impracticable. He points out that an existing relief will be withdrawn from a whole category of taxpayers with no regard to their circumstances, which, in his case, include a declining income. The press statement issued on Budget day does not describe the full damage that has been caused. He calls that ``misleading'', and I can see why.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>

<P>
Inland Revenue press release IR 1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The married couples allowance (MCA) for people aged under 65 and its associated allowances will be abolished from April 2000.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The maintenance payment change, and the additional tax burden, are therefore referred to as merely an associated allowance. That is a weasely and misleading way of describing such an important change. The ``Notes for Editors'' section of the press release is equally unclear. It refers to the withdrawal of relief for maintenance payments, but only in the context of it being worth the same as the basic married couples allowance. Again, a spurious connection is made with the married couples allowance.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not want to spoil the right hon. Gentleman's arguments, but I remind him that the link between maintenance payments and married couples allowance was established by the previous Government--of which he was a member--in 1994, when relief on the first slice was restricted to the equivalent of the married couples allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Lady makes my point for me. She pretends that, because one slice of the payment is linked to the same rate that applies to the married couples allowance, she can claim that the abolition of married couples allowance justifies the removal of all of the tax relief, on all slices of income, from all people, under all pre-existing legal agreements. She has made my case rather neatly.
<P>
To finish the point raised by the constituent of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk, the main paragraph describing the changes refers only--this is typical--to the abolition of tax on the payments in the hands of the recipient. It is completely silent on the effect of the withdrawal of the tax relief on people who make such payments. The lack of symmetry--to put it delicately--is highly misleading and has caused a great deal of anger and annoyance, not just to the people affected but in a number of professional bodies.
<P>
The Government must take more of an interest in the press statements put out in their name. We heard earlier this morning a rather grudging apology for the misleading descriptions of the bereavement payments introduced in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. The press release states that those payments will more than compensate for the loss of the bereavement allowance. We have heard that that is untrue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> To help my right hon. Friend and the Committee, I have looked at the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. Clause 46 of the Bill does not name a day, but merely refers to an appointed day. It is possible that, without intent, the Paymaster General may have misled the Committee in accepting that the day was put forward, because there is no named day in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. In his typically thorough way, he has checked the text, rather than accept it from a Government intervention. Like him, I look forward to clarification from the Paymaster General when she responds to the debate.
<P>
The same press release contains a clear factual inaccuracy. To be fair to the Government, they have conceded that. I am referring to something almost as bad in the description of the withdrawal of tax relief from those who make maintenance payments.
<P>
In summary, this is a retrospective and stealthy change. Our amendments attempt to repair some of the damage, and I look forward to the Government's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): I want to follow my right hon. Friend, because the aspect of this proposal that worries me most is the element of retrospection that it involves. The Paymaster General may base her argument on the technicalities of the link between the married couples allowance and the new arrangements, but it is the retrospective element that concerns me.
<P>
In her role as a constituency Member of Parliament, the Paymaster General will no doubt have had many representations, like all right hon. and hon. Members, about arrangements relating to the work of the Child Support Agency. In the same way, when we try in 1999 to unpick yesterday's arrangements, it is like pulling a loose thread on a jumper: the whole thing starts to unravel.
<P>
Paragraph 15 of the explanatory notes on clauses contains a seductive attempt to persuade us that only £220 is at stake. However, my right hon. Friend did not reveal in his remarks--I do not say this as a criticism--that, attached to the correspondence of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Norfolk was a further letter. It was written to him in confidence, so I shall respect that confidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend in a moment.
<P>
What I derive from that piece of correspondence is that, particularly for those who have arrangements under the so-called ``old rules'', under these proposals, if I have understood them correctly, there would be a loss of a much greater amount of tax relief.
<P>
The key point is that, when divorce and maintenance arrangements were originally entered into, they may have been part of a much more complex and comprehensive package. That package may have taken into account not only this tax relief but many other aspects of the previously entwined financial arrangements between the former partners in determining the levels of maintenance payments for the couple or their children.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> If I may finish this line of argument, I shall gladly give way to both my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) and the Paymaster General.
<P>
Therefore, the proposal puts into question the whole of the previous arrangement. That is why my right hon. Friend tabled the amendment. I shall give way, in the first place, to my hon. Friend on the Front Bench, if he is now ready to intervene. If he is not, I shall give way to the Paymaster General.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I wished to raise a point of order on a separate matter, but I was anxious not to disturb the flow of my right hon. Friend's argument.
<P>
On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I return to a matter that all members of the Committee will accept is of great importance. It relates to the phasing out of the widows bereavement allowance and the timing of the new bereavement payment. The Minister told us on the record that the payment will come on 5 April 2000. I have spoken to the Library which tells me that the Green Paper on the Bill refers to 2001 at the earliest. The Bill contains no date and no Minister has given us a date during debates. The costings in the explanatory notes attached to the Bill start from 2001, not 2000. As a matter of urgency, will the Paymaster General clarify the position?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let me be as precise as my intellect allows. The parallels between these clauses of the Finance Bill and the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill were clearly established by the Paymaster General earlier today. Any discrepancy between one set of measures and the other is not a matter for the Chair. It is a question for a Minister to answer either later in Committee or at later stage in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. Although this matter is not a point of order for the Chair, it might help the good order of the Committee if the Paymaster General undertook to write to Committee members to clarify precisely the Government's policy.
<P>
<B>The. Chairman:</B> The Paymaster General will have heard those remarks, but the action to be taken is at her discretion.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I did not tell the Committee that the widows payment of £1,000 would go up from April 2000, and the record will show that. I note the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Charnwood. Like everyone else, I shall read Hansard. I shall scrutinise it, but I think that it will show quite clearly what I said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. That is a disgraceful response. The Minister deliberately used words to convey one impression while the wording gives another. That is why my summing up to the debate gave her an opportunity to deny the impression that she had given. I said that she had given the Committee the impression that the payment would be effective from 5 April 2000. She did not deny that. That is a disgraceful way to conduct oneself in Committee.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This level of recapitulation might be very good for increasing one's vocabulary, but it is not good for the Bill's progress. The issue is not a point of order for me. The Paymaster General will no doubt have taken the comments made to heart and will clear the issue up at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is this a new point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> It is a point of order, Mr. Cook. As you rightly observed, this discussion does not further the Committee's progress. However, the Minister led us to believe that a certain set of circumstances would apply. It was because she led us to believe--partly by omission and partly by commission--that a group of people would not specifically suffer, we were happy to let the Bill progress in the way that it has. If we want ahead on the basis of a misunderstanding, we would like to give her the opportunity to clear these matters up.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Paymaster General has been given the opportunity. I am sure that she will have noted the remarks and will act accordingly. Can we now make progress? I call Mr. Jack.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Thank you, Mr. Cook, but I would rather allow the Paymaster General to speak.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have forgotten the question, but will the right hon. Gentlemen explain his comments about commitments already made? What does he say about the fact that the Government of which he was a member varied the arrangements on two occasion? That had the same impact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that when the reliefs were varied under the last Government that was never done retrospectively? That is why people subject to the pre-1988 arrangements continue to receive the benefit of the reliefs that existed before then?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend probably supplies a better answer than the one that I was about to give. Time has moved on and we have learnt from the experience of the Child Support Agency some of the problems associated with unpicking the past. Politicians should have the humility to learn and to acknowledge when matters have gone wrong in the past. However, the Government still have to face the problems--presented to them by the Opposition--of real people in the United Kingdom today. According to the Treasury's own analysis, about 300,000 taxpayers will be affected by the proposals.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I centre my remarks on retrospective legislation. The Paymaster General knows how important it is to examine how retrospective the Treasury is prepared for legislation to be. [Interruption] My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood reminds me from a sedentary position that we always try to guard against legislating retrospectively at all, and he is right. the amendment would address the problem.
<P>
I return to paragraph 15 of the explanatory notes, in which a figure of £220 is seductively mentioned as a guide to the impact of the proposals. However, the amount will clearly be much greater in certain cases. In her response, will the Paymaster General set out the range of current maintenance agreements in order to measure the top and bottom of the scale and gain an understanding of the impact on individuals? Some might have to return to court to unpick those complex arrangements. If my right hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, that problem would not arise.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I shall simply pick up some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood about the arguments behind the proposals, because the Paymaster General will deal with the financial details.
<P>
The Government's objectives are to bring the same logic to the system of maintenance payments after divorce as has been brought to the married couples allowance, child support arrangements and so forth. We are being prepared for a regime under which where the tax relief goes after families break down will relate more to who cares for the child than to arrangements made in court for maintenance payments to wives. Tax has to be adjusted to take account of changes in women's roles, and that has been reflected in several measures in the Bill, including this one.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) often referred to the Child Support Agency, as a result of whose actions I have had a huge amount of work. One important factor is that maintenance arrangements are made largely for children, and for women only as carers for children. That is a different concept from that of a man making maintenance payments agreed by the courts for his wife as his financial dependant. Many provisions throughout the Bill assume that women will be working to support themselves, except when they have specific child care or other care responsibilities. Tax relief arrangements are adjusted to take account of that.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde mentioned a man who wrote to complain about the injustice of his losing out. However, the change in arrangements also puts pressure on women, who will by and large be expected to support themselves by working. That also applies to some of the arrangements for widows payments and allowances that were the subject of the previous debate.
<P>
The changes are difficult. Obviously they affect real people's lives, often at times of great stress such as divorce or bereavement. In the long term they are right, especially as married couples will now get the relief not because they are married but to support the children. Arrangements are being made to ensure that that regime takes into account changing family circumstances such as those involving stepchildren, and shared care and custody. The Government are taking a bold step in saying that that is the road that we have to go down. It is difficult, and some people will find this an anxious time, but it means that in years to come we will not have to unpick many more difficult anomalies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I was just about to finish, as I had promised to be brief.
<P>
We will not have to come back to these issues later, when circumstances have completely changed--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Okay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am most grateful. Does the hon. Lady accept that the arrangements affected by the proposals will have been the subject of detailed court proceedings 10 or more years ago, and that by definition the proposed change in the tax regime was not known to the court at the time? Could that not lead in certain cases to a substantial rearrangement of maintenance--where, for example, no child element was involved?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> In a sense that point is fair; retrospection is always difficult. When the Child Support Agency trawled through court arrangements and overturned them it caused great grief and anguish. I suspect that the effects of this measure applied retrospectively will be far less traumatic. Certainly once the children's tax allowance comes into play, people will go through their personal circumstances again, and the new arrangements will bed down.
<P>
As the right hon. Gentleman said, many people who divorced before 1988 will no longer have dependent children, so their financial circumstances will have changed. The Government are right. They are dealing with an issue which, if not tackled now, will be a nightmare to unpick in years to come. The anomaly would also bring the tax system into disrepute because it would so obviously be addressing circumstances that no longer existed. As part of a package of measures, this is the right choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The pre-1988 cases mostly involve older parties without children. Even if there were children to be cared for when the settlement was made, they will no longer be in the picture, given the time that has elapsed. We are talking about a group of predominantly older men, paying older women spousal maintenance. The reasons for that are likely to be that the woman has not worked during her married life, or cannot currently work. When the wife can work, it is always possible for the husband, if it is a conventional case, to apply for the maintenance to be stopped or lowered.
<P>
As most such cases will involve older men, the issue of pensions should not be forgotten. It has not been possible to share pensions over that period. I look forward to that change in the law taking place. Many older women receive maintenance payments from husbands who are pensioners, and the spousal maintenance that they receive is, in effect, the equivalent of their share of the pension.
<P>
In such circumstances it seems wrong to take away the tax relief, which is often paid at the marginal rate, and replace it with a system in which the woman receives the payment tax-free. The effect will be to reduce the amount of money that the couple have. Many settlements, some of which are 10 or 11 years old, will have to be re-examined, and a considerable number of court cases will be brought in order to vary the terms of such settlements. Those made before 1988 covered not only maintenance but capital and many other issues relating to a divorce. They are sophisticated agreements that have been sensitively and delicately arranged to meet the needs of the parties.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is so concerned about that issue, what does he say about the fact that it was the Conservative Government who set up the Child Support Agency, which did not recognise clean break agreements where there were capital settlements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> As the hon. Lady knows, there was a convention that one could not oust child maintenance in settlements made before the courts. None the less, child maintenance was often pitched at a level that reflected the overall capital settlement in a case. It was a failing of the original Child Support Act 1991, which both sides of the House supported, that that was not adequately taken into account. The rules were changed to remedy that failing. Do the Government want to be so ignorant that they fail to learn from past mistakes?
<P>
Has the hon. Lady consulted the Lord Chancellor's Department to find out the possible effects on the courts, and the number of cases likely to come before the courts over the next few years? All too often, the Treasury fails adequately to consult other Departments when making such changes. It will be a great pity if a substantial proportion of the 300,000 cases have to return to court, putting elderly people to the trouble of going through court proceedings and changing sensitive arrangements made 10 or 11 years ago, all for the sake of a small amount of money.

<P>

<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain where the figure of 300,000 comes from, and what it reflects?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> It is the figure that has been used during our debate this morning. If the hon. Lady has a better estimate, I will be happy to accept it. A substantial number of pre-1988 cases may have to be re-examined by the courts if the change is carried out, and that would be a pity.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I thought that 300,000 was the number of elderly couples who lost out because of the withdrawal of dividend tax credit. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the number of divorced elderly women whose court settlements from their husbands are still in existence--and whose husbands have been paying, which is quite another matter--is exactly the same as the number of people who lost out over dividend tax credits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Another figure used in the debate was 15,000 and if the hon. Lady tells me that that is the true figure, I am willing to accept it. I am concerned not so much with the exact number of people as with the principle. If thousands of elderly people are to be dragged back before the courts, it will cost the country money and upset a great many elderly people unnecessarily.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall now deal with the amendments and respond to the points raised by the hon. Members who have spoken to them. Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 would retain the special favourable tax relief for those who pay maintenance under arrangements set up before 15 March 1988, which is known as ``old rules'' relief. The amendments would not involve any other maintenance relief--neither the new rules nor the people in the Child Support Agency would be involved. About 40,000 people enjoy relief under the old rules.
<P>
I shall return to the points raised by Committee members about the abolition of the relief when I have dealt with the amendments, which were apparently intended to initiate a general debate on the principle. The amendments do not explain why maintenance relief should be kept only in relation to ``old rules'' relief.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, when the Conservative Government changed the rules, maintenance relief has been a tax relief for separation and divorce. It is closely linked to the married couples allowance, which we will withdraw from 6 April 2000. The Committee of the whole House approved the latter measure. In line with the withdrawal of the married couples allowance, clause 33 will withdraw maintenance relief, too, from 6 April 2000. Clearly, it would not be right to retain maintenance relief while abolishing the married couples allowance. That would mean that the rewards received by people whose marriages had broken down would be greater than those received by people who remained married.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Does the Paymaster General agree that there was no link between the married couples allowance and the pre-1988 cases, which involve a separate group? That group consists of the elderly, and she is seeking to disturb their matrimonial arrangements.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is wrong. Since 1988, maintenance relief has been firmly linked to the married couples allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> But not before that.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The previous Government underlined that link in 1994, when they restricted the relief. Various other matters need to be considered in that context--although the hon. Gentleman suggested that maintenance relief stood in splendid isolation, and was never connected with the married couples allowance, which is not the case.
<P>
It would not be right to retain maintenance relief for divorce while abolishing the married couples allowance. Instead, we want to modernise the personal tax system and to bring in a new relief, the children's tax credit, which will focus tax relief on families with children. We have discussed that at length.
<P>
People receiving the more generous relief available to those with pre-March 1988 arrangements will by April 2000 have enjoyed special favourable treatment for more than 12 years. It would not be right to go on giving them very generous relief when such relief is not available to others whose maintenance arrangements were set up after the change in the rules in March 1988.
<P>
Retaining the old rules would also mean that recipients of maintenance under the ``old rules'' arrangements would continue to be taxable on their payments. We believe that one of the benefits of withdrawing the relief is that the charge to tax will also be withdrawn. It would not be right to retain the old rules relief after withdrawing both the married couples allowance and the new rules relief, which the hon. Gentleman did not mention. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendments.
<P>
The point has been made again and again that the married couples allowance and maintenance relief are not connected--but I have explained to the Committee that they were consistently connected in the previous Government's policy.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) referred to retrospection, but the right hon. Member for Fylde was right to say that I would argue that the change was not retrospective. It will apply only to payments from April 2000. The Conservative Government restricted and withdrew parts of the old rules relief in 1994 and 1996. The need to reconsider maintenance arrangements was discussed then.
<P>
We are withdrawing the balance as part of a package of reforms in connection with the introduction of the children's tax credit. ``Old rules'' claimants will have enjoyed favourable treatment for 12 years by the time the relief is withdrawn. It was one thing to make special provision for old rules claimants when introducing new rules relief in 1988, but it is quite another to keep the old rules relief when withdrawing relief from everyone else. Anyone who sets up a long-term arrangement with tax implications needs to bear in mind the fact that income tax rules may not stay the same. The previous Government changed the rules twice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does not the injustice relate not to the first £1,900 of maintenance payments on pre-1988 settlements, but to what happens to maintenance above that amount, which could be £20,000 a year? This is not a revenue issue. A husband used to get a full tax deduction at his marginal rate on full maintenance payments minus £1,900, while his ex-spouse was taxable in full on the amount over £1,900. The Government are reversing that. A husband will not get a tax deduction and his ex-wife will not be taxable. There are no revenue implications to fund other benefit payments. Injustice and chaos have been created by a measure of which the Chancellor was unaware.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The Chancellor was aware of the measure, although the right hon. Member for Wells had some fun with what the press said about the issue. About 40,000 people will be affected. The average loss and the huge problems that hon. Members have suggested would arise should be put in perspective.
<P>
I remind hon. Members that no CSA assessment took place before 1993. Most people with arrangements made before 15 March 1988, who benefit from the old rules relief, will not have been assessed by the CSA. I was asked about the range of loss and who was consulted.
<P>
It is for individuals to decide whether to change their arrangements in the tax year 1999-2000. The relief would have been worth £220 for existing claimants. For the great majority, the effect will not be sufficient to merit a change, so there will not be a great rush to the courts. The CSA confirmed that it expects no significant impact on the arrangements for maintenance relief.
<P>
On the question of complexity, hon. Members argue different cases depending on the nature of their amendments. We already have complex arrangements: old reliefs, new reliefs, no reliefs; recognising support for wives, not recognising support for wives, recognising support for children, and not recognising support for children. The Government are simplifying the arrangements by concentrating relief through the children's tax credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I asked the hon. Lady whether her Department had consulted the Lord Chancellor's Department about the change. Did that happen or not?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I said that with the small number of cases involved, there was unlikely to be a rush to the courts, and the hon. Gentleman's forecast of disaster in the courts would not be fulfilled. However, in advance of his Budget announcement, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor did of course speak to his colleagues about the issues in the Budget.
<P>
Hon. Members asked about the range and detail of the average loss. It is important to concentrate on the 40,000 people; the amendment does not cover any other group. The Inland Revenue does not have access to court orders, so it is impossible to say what the top range might be. Of the 40,000 people who receive relief in excess of the new rules figure--£197--the figure of £220 in the explanatory notes is the average for all claimants under the old rules and the new rules.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 96 and 97 do not focus on retired people, although there was a lot of discussion about retired people. They would preserve a special favoured relief for all payers under the old rules. Those people would have enjoyed that relief for some time, and those aged 65 and over will remain eligible for relief under the new rules, because that is part of the protection in this package of reform. Anyone setting up a long-term arrangement with tax implications must bear in mind the fact that income tax rules may not remain the same for ever and ever. The Opposition voted through two sets of changes, which would have caused the same sort of reconsideration.
<P>
I am surprised that Opposition Members wanted to concentrate only on the old rules relief. Whether they agree with the Government or not, they can see that it would be ridiculous to give relief for not being married when no relief is provided for being married. Focusing relief through the children's tax credit for families with children is the best way to proceed. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That is one of the most unconvincing responses that we have heard so far. The Paymaster General used extraordinary logic when she said that abolition of the married couples allowance would reward marriages that had broken down unless she withdrew tax relief from maintenance payments. It would be insulting to tell people who, in sad circumstances some years ago, had to draw up arrangements whereby one would pay another a sum of money, usually under a court order, that they were being rewarded now because the Government were withdrawing the married couples allowance.
