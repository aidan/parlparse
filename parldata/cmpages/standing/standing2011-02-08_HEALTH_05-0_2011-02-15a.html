                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hancock,
and to serve on the Committee on this Bill, which is probably the most
important Bill going through Parliament. I also look forward to working
with Opposition colleagues. I know that the Minister, whom I shadow, is
a courteous and helpful man—I do not know how helpful he will be
during the rest of the Committee, but we will see. I am also grateful
for the support of my hon. Friends, who are all passionate about the
health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
want to spend some time today considering clause 1. We have
tabled a number of amendments, not least because we think that the
clause is fundamental in terms of the scope of the Government’s
changes to the national health service, and the accountability issues 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 172<a class="bkMark" name="Column172">&#160;</a>
                           </div>around both the Secretary of State and transparency. Accountability to
Parliament is absolutely essential for a health service that is
publicly funded—it is probably the biggest service that the
Government provide. For that reason, we will spend some time on the
clause, and my colleagues will speak
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
this stage, I am not saying whether we will press the amendment to a
Division, which will depend on what the Minister says in his response,
but we are concerned about accountability throughout the Bill, and one
of the first instances concerns parameters. We would like the Secretary
of State at least to be directly accountable to Parliament on most of
his new role. It will be interesting to see how the Minister explains
that in his response to the clause stand part debate. We want him to be
up front, and to confirm to what extent the Secretary of State will be
accountable to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is specifically related to public health, and although that
carries on throughout the clause, I am limited to speaking on the
amendment. It is a fairly straightforward amendment, so the Minister
can reject it and explain his reasons for doing so, if he believes that
the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament. That will be
interesting to hear, and if we are not satisfied, we might press the
amendment to a vote. I know that he will do his best to try
to reassure us as to the accountability of the Secretary of State, and
that he very much favours being accountable, as he has said in the
past. We may dig up one or two interesting quotes on that for later in
the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
public health functions, it is important that the lead is taken from
the top. Much has been said about the Government’s proposals,
and we welcome the focus on public health and the involvement of many
more organisations. With your permission, Mr Hancock, in the clause
stand part debate I will explore in more detail our concerns on
accountability and the role of the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment arises from concerns that the Secretary of State will reduce
accountability on his role in the delivery of health services. We
support the greater role for health authorities, with the director of
public health being given a role within the local authority, and for
local partners. We welcome the fact that there will be local leadership
in public health and, as the Minister and the Secretary of State have
said, that there should be greater co-operation and focus on local
improvements in our communities. Of course, collaborative working will
be an important part of that and one of our concerns about the Bill is
about fragmentation, lack of co-operation and the possible boundaries
being put up around the involvement of much greater private health care
and competition, which will impact on public health in different ways.
That is another part of the Bill that we will explore in later clauses.
It is important to raise the issue of how collaboration and
fragmentation, which we are concerned about in the Bill as a whole,
impact on the public health function. That will lead me a bit later in
my speech to the Secretary of State’s role and
function.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
accept and want to see public health improvements being driven locally,
but that cannot be done without commitment and drive from the
Government and the Secretary of State and the financial support which
is part of that. One of our concerns is funding for the public health
function. Will it be better if the Secretary 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 173<a class="bkMark" name="Column173">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of State is more directly involved, or will it be more of a problem in
committing funding and making sure that funding is sufficient to drive
through the public health care functions? The Secretary of
State’s role in that will be particularly important, and I hope
that the Minister will explain not only the technical details around
the amendment, but the Secretary of State’s role. The
improvements that we all want to see will not be possible, as far as we
can see, without the clear involvement of the Secretary of State and
the Department of Health. Central leadership is exceptionally important
here, which is what the amendment is about. If the Secretary of State
is going to be in leadership, what powers will he retain? We will
discuss that later. What will be his functions in terms of
accountability, and how will that relate to Parliament? I shall come to
that
shortly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have seen massive improvements in public health over the past 20 or so
years, but more needs to be done, as the Bill recognises. My
assumption—the Minister may or may not correct me—is that
the Secretary of State thinks that by giving much greater local
accountability, it will improve indicators around public health, with
which we all agree. To what extent will he be hands-off and how far
will he work with local authorities, the Health Protection Agency, the
Health and Safety Executive and all those other bodies that have an
important function in public health? We have seen that progress is much
slower in deprived areas. What will the Secretary of State’s
role be in central direction and central involvement in deprived
communities? We have seen a general improvement and an improvement in
deprived communities, but deprived communities are still struggling to
make the sorts of strides that we have seen elsewhere. Will that be
part of the Secretary of State’s remit, accountability and
reporting back to Parliament, which are important,
too?<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
cannot underestimate—this is the crux of our
amendment—the importance of the Secretary of State’s
accountability to this House on health in general, which we will
explore later in the clause, and on public health, which is crucial to
the health improvement of our population and improving people’s
lives. Parliamentary scrutiny is going to be very important, so the
Minister will have to explain—if he does not mind, of
course—how that will be done under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Secretary of State, for instance, provide an annual report to
Parliament? Will he be reporting regularly on various issues that occur
in public health? Will we be having debates about this and,
importantly, will he be answering questions, as he does now, on public
health? We need to be clear about that, because later, when we talk
about Monitor and other bodies, we will explore who will deal with
questions. Will the statistics and data, which are important now, which
we get through Parliament and which members of the public can access,
still be available and not be changed in any way? Will the Secretary of
State try to push responsibility for certain information on to local
bodies, which is an important question? What responsibilities will
local bodies have in providing information to MPs, which the Secretary
of State and the Department of Health currently do in response to
parliamentary questions and debates? That relates to our concern about
accountability and openness in the Bill. A lot of people—not
only the Opposition, but people outside this place—are still
concerned about what the details of the Bill will mean. I

                           </div>do not wish to be repetitive on that point, but I want re-emphasise it
in the strongest possible terms, because if the Minister had not got
the gist of our concerns on the clause, which I am sure he had, he
should have by
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a parliamentary focus on continuous improvement, which will be
important for scrutiny. Ensuring that the Secretary of State will be as
accountable to Parliament as he is now would send a strong message to
those who are delivering, or have the responsibility to deliver,
improvements to public health in the country, and give them a sense
that Parliament is involved in the matter, that we want to see it
driven forward and that the same emphasis and importance is placed on
it. Maximum benefit in this case can be achieved only if the Secretary
of State is fully accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
listen to what the Minister has to say. It is important and helpful
that he sets out any differences between the Bill’s proposals
and the current arrangements that we may not have spotted. Through the
debate, we are trying to get on the record the Government’s view
on such issues—I am sure the Minister will understand this,
because there is great uncertainty about large parts of the
Bill—so that we can make a well-informed decision about which
way we should vote in this important
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000035">&#160;</a>

of State will lose his current duty to provide or secure the provision

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
fundamental principles of the national health service under the current
arrangements is that at its head is an elected custodian who takes
responsibility for the provision of high quality health care
nationwide. Indeed, the Secretary of State is currently directly
responsible for securing the provision of all health services as set
out in the National Health Service Act 2006. Those functions
are largely delegated to bodies such as the strategic health
authorities and the primary care trusts, the abolition of which I shall
come to, because that relates directly to the establishment of bodies
in clause 1. Despite that delegation, the bodies remain under the duty
of the Secretary of State, who, most importantly, remains accountable
to Parliament for the provision of services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the new
commissioning structure in clause 1, which is set out throughout the
Bill, that duty will no longer be delegated and that direct
responsibility will be taken away from the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State will have duties, which have been described, but the
direct responsibility for securing the provision of health services
will be conferred on the NHS commissioning board and the general
practice-led commissioning consortia. Such provision is set out in
clauses 5 and 6, which insert proposed new sections 1D and 1E into the
2006 Act. I shall confine my remarks to clause 1 and the amendment, but
it is important to consider the fundamental changes to the Secretary of
State’s responsibilities when we consider the new structure of
the comprehensive health service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

studied the new structure for some time and have read the explanatory
notes, the House of Commons Library research papers and many other
related documents that have been submitted in evidence from a variety
of sources, such as academics, interest groups, trade unions and
professional bodies. I was surprised, therefore, to hear in the
previous evidence sitting the Secretary of State dismissing the
fundamental changes that he was making to his own responsibilities.

duty to provide the comprehensive health service, he rather

second duty is limited to the exercise of the Secretary of

There is a derogation of duty there. The exercise of such functions is
discretionary, so there is no requirement to provide comprehensive
health services. That is an important point, because under the amended
duties, securing a comprehensive health service is not necessary in
order to comply with the Secretary of State’s primary duty. All
duties derive from the Secretary of State’s duty, and it
therefore seems that under the clause no organisation will have the
duty to provide a comprehensive health service for the whole of

Let me take this opportunity at the beginning—you can rest
assured that I will be returning to this throughout our proceedings, Mr

founding principles of a comprehensive health service. Clause 1 retains
the overarching responsibility on the Secretary of State to promote the
comprehensive health service, a key duty which dates from the original

the point of use and that is based on clinical

hope he will be even more helpful than  he has been hitherto.
My question is specifically on amendment 31. We do not need our
researchers to trawl through the notes to discover some inconsistencies
because there are already are some. The amendment relates to the
insertion of responsibility and accountability to Parliament, in
respect of public health. Forgive me if I am mistaken, but I am sure I
heard the Minister say earlier that one of the things that he was
insisting should be in the Bill and which would increase the
accountability of the Secretary of State and the Department, was the
report that he would make to Parliament on the comprehensive provision
of the health service. Will that enfold his new responsibilities, split
out under the new Bill for public health, which, as I understand it,
will be delivered through local authorities? That is where we see
something novel in the Bill, and that is where we seek reassurance that
the Secretary of State will still be responsible to Parliament on
public health, as has been the
case—<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000102">&#160;</a>

to say. There was some material in his response that was helpful and I
thank him for that. However, we come back to the principle behind the
amendment. I did not hear from the Minister why he has a problem making
the amendment to the Bill. I did not actually hear an argument against
making the amendment. I am not a suspicious person but my suspicions
could be raised by the fact that he will not accept this amendment but
seems to have said, “Don’t worry about it, the Secretary

                           </strong> I was coming to that. As I mentioned in my opening
speech on clause 1, the problem is that it is not only Labour Members
but lots of people out there, including health bodies and
patients’ associations, who have concerns about the changes,
particularly in clause 1, with regard to the Secretary of
State’s responsibilities. Our amendments seek to tease out what
responsibilities will remain with the Secretary of State. So far I have
not been fully reassured about that point and I want to explore it
further with the Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I try to reassure the hon. Gentleman by saying
that the amendment would have no practical effect? The Secretary of
State’s accountability to Parliament is already integral to the
Bill. Including it explicitly in this clause would do nothing to add to
the powers, responsibilities and the duties that the Secretary of State
has. For that reason, it is unnecessary and will not achieve what the
hon. Gentleman wants it to achieve, because it is already an integral

                           </strong> Because of our general concerns about the clause,
we would feel reassured if the Minister accepted this amendment, for
the reasons that I outlined. However, given what he has said, let us
take matters a little further. He has said before that the clause will
be used to reduce political interference in day-to-day decisions. On
the face of it, that sounds okay, but what does it mean? Can he give us
examples of where political interference will be
reduced?<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000116">&#160;</a>

unsatisfactory, then in those circumstances some punitive action should

goes to the nub of things. The Minister makes the point about targets,
which I know, Mr Hancock, you will not let me go into too much in this
debate, because we will have that debate when we discuss the next
clause. These sorts of statements are made, but again they raise
suspicions about the Government’s real intent. They talk about
targets, but we have seen the lowest recorded waiting times in living
memory and massive improvements in cancer and coronary heart disease
care. That is why we are suspicious. We wonder why the Government want
the Bill, but that would mean delving into other matters—I
realise that I cannot speak on them now—such as competition and
Monitor. It is a real concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000122">&#160;</a>

to my comment on information given to parliamentarians, the Minister
mentioned parliamentary questions and healthwatch. Again, this comes
back to the direct responsibility of the Secretary of State for public
health information and statistics. Given the greater discretion and the
greater devolvement of powers to local health bodies, will the
information currently provided to the centre on public health
improvement and statistics—perhaps through healthwatch—be
maintained at the current level under the Bill? We cannot see it at
this stage, and I hope that the Minister will comment on

responsible for the framework that is set for commissioners. That will
include guidelines and targets, and the budgets provided for them. We
can still ask about that. Health questions should therefore proceed as

hope that the Minister will give the amendment serious consideration. I

It is an important amendment that will explore some of the

health service to patients in guaranteeing excellence in care under the
NHS constitution. As the Minister knows, we published the first NHS
constitution to form the basis of a new relationship between staff and
patients based on partnership, feedback, respect and assured
commitment, so that everyone knows what they can expect from the NHS
and what is expected of them. It has been an important moment in the

fundamental principle of the health service is clear in the Act that
set it up. We are building on that by giving people more rights and
promoting partnership, feedback and respect. Everyone wants assured
commitment to the health service, which is truly loved by the British
people. It has evolved over the years. Obviously, it is always a matter
of great concern, as we have heard today in the news, and we must
always consider how we can continue to improve the health service and
reform it so as to provide an even better service to the people of this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NHS
constitution guarantees standards of care and ensures that patients
know what they can expect from the health service. It is a change from
the old system in which patients were basically told what to do and did
not have much say in treatments or what went on in hospitals or the
health community. In a sense, the constitution was an important part of
the progression. People are now consulted much more and have a much
greater say in what health care is like, instead of being told to get
on with it and accept things. It is an important and valued part of the
development of the health service. It is a modernisation of the health
service that was originally set up.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
that we should enshrine the primacy of the NHS constitution up front
and ensure that the Bill makes it explicit that its commitments shall
be upheld in new legislation. Again, I will wait to hear what the
Minister says. I will be surprised if he has a problem with the
amendment, but we shall hear later. Like the previous amendment, it
would strengthen the legislation on issues in the health service that
we feel strongly about and that the Bill should take account of. The
NHS constitution included an important public-facing target of a
maximum of 18 weeks from GP referral to elective surgery and the target
of two weeks for cancer. Those were important pledges that we made in
government, and which we
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister talked of not deciding top-down targets and I want to tease
out his understanding of that and of what he has said previously about
targets as part of the NHS constitution. He might want to tell us
whether it is still the Government’s view that they do not want
the 18-week target to continue. I understand that they are committed to
the two-week target for cancer, and he might want to say why it would
be a problem to have it enshrined in the Act. He has already said that
they do not want top-down targets because they interfere with
clinicians’ decision making, and we wait to hear what he has to
say on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000162">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is interesting. As we are talking specifically
about constitutional targets, I am keeping within the parameters of the
debate, but I am sure that you will tell me, Mr Hancock, if I stray.
When I was elected Member for Halton in 1997, it was a common
occurrence to get complaints about people waiting not

			Column number: 186<a class="bkMark" name="Column186">&#160;</a>
                           </div>just 18 months but two years and longer for an operation or, in some
cases, to even get past the first stage—the consultation. I am
concerned, therefore, that the Minister thinks there is no clinical
reason for a target about waiting times, when people were dying because
they could not get hospital care in time. It is amazing that he should
say that the 18-week target has no clinical position
whatsoever.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000164">&#160;</a>

Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the point about the 18-week target
is that often it involves non-urgent cases, perhaps an orthopaedic case
of someone who has had a lump on their arm for three or four years?
Such cases were often prioritised ahead of some of the urgent cases
that he has just described, which meant that targets got in the way of
good clinical
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000165">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I know that, but I was talking to a very senior
consultant who said that, without the 18-week target, they would never
have got down to the standard wait for treatment that they have today.
I am not going to argue that the system was perfect—it was
not—but much quicker treatment time, with people receiving their
operations, has had a massive impact on people’s lives, often
for the right clinical reasons. The impact of the target on
people’s lives has been immense, and Members just have to go
back to their postbags to see that. Back in 1997, the Minister, like
every MP, no doubt had many people writing to him about hospital
waiting times. If he did not, he was one of the few. That has
completely changed, and we rarely get such letters now. There has been
a massive improvement in the health service and in care generally,
because of the
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000168">&#160;</a>

making, surely that could not be construed as a political target?
Waiting for a cataract removal or a knee or hip replacement are
quality-of-life issues. What does my hon. Friend think about
“removing politically driven targets”? Is that removing

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an important point. When I
last looked, the waiting time for cataracts was two to four weeks.
Going back 10 or 15 years, the wait was anything up to a year or even
two. The target has made, and continues to make, a massive difference
to the quality of life for those people. I do not accept the argument
about targets being politically driven; they are about improving
people’s health and access to health care, and making a
difference to their lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000170">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will say two things to the hon. Lady. First, I
have not recently heard any complaint from a clinician claiming that
targets are causing a drop in morale. In fact, I have seen the opposite
and operations that took place more quickly and were better planned
with the necessary resources. We are now starting to hear stories of a
drop in morale as a result of the changes that are being proposed to
the health service and the cuts that are being imposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, I
will make a bet with the hon. Lady. I am not a betting man, but I wager
that in a year or two she will find that her postbag is growing because
of the number of people complaining about difficulties in accessing
hospitals and operations. Time will tell, but I suggest that that will
happen as a result of the Government’s changes, not just in the
Bill but in terms of funding and other procedures.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s argument that targets are politically driven is
nonsense. Because of the funding issues in the health service, we are
concerned that the Government are using that argument as a sort of
cloak to cover an increase in waiting times. We are starting to see
that a little bit now, and I suspect that in a year or so we will see
it more. The NHS constitution has been important in that
respect.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Committee should be bold and make it clear that there will be no return
to the NHS waiting list quagmire of the 1990s. We should celebrate the
fact that the health service has moved on, and enshrine the principles
that have helped us get there in the first clause of the Bill. The
Government should leave no doubt about their intentions and commitment
to quality. I will be disappointed if the Minister does not accept the
amendment. It is perfectly reasonable, and most people in the country
would support it as part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000175">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
have a couple of questions. Do the Government plan to change the
constitution? How will the commissioning proposals in the Bill impact
on the constitution? Will that involve any changes? Are there any plans
to review the constitution? Finally, why was such a measure not
included as part of the original proposals in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000176">&#160;</a>

drafting of clause 1, which amends section 1 of the National Health

two parts. New section 1(2)(a) of the 2006 Act is about conferring
public health functions separately from functions in relation to health
care for the first time. The Secretary of State’s functions in
relation to public health are described in more detail later in the
Bill, and include the power to both commission and provide services. No
doubt when we get to that section of the Bill, there will be a more
appropriate opportunity to discuss the provision in detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000177">&#160;</a>

subsection (2)(b) covers the areas where other organisations will be
responsible for particular activities. This includes all NHS
care—that is, the services commissioned by the NHS commissioning
board and consortia—and the local public health responsibilities
of local authorities. In those cases, the functions of commissioning
and providing services are given explicitly to front-line
organisations, not the Department of Health, in line with our strategy
for liberating the NHS, which says that commissioners and providers

by acting through the NHS commissioning board and consortia, or local

slight problem, because if the Secretary of State has the

be a problem in relation to the current independence for foundation

hospital. Patients were concerned, and although, on the one hand, they
knew the governors had responsibility for the foundation trust, on the
other hand, they felt that the Secretary of State had responsibility.
They wrote to the Secretary of State, who said it was none of his
business and referred them

deal with two specific points that the hon. Member for Halton made with
regard to the NHS constitution. The first answer to the first question
he asked is: yes, we are committed to the NHS constitution. I hope that
reassures him. Secondly, he asked whether we would amend the NHS
constitution. Let me explain: the mandate, which we discussed in the
debate on the previous amendment, will set out what the Government
expect from the NHS over what is likely to be a three-year period, and
it will be updated annually. The Secretary of State will once again be
able to alter the mandate in-year if the board agrees to the change, or
there are exceptional circumstances that make it necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the NHS
constitution, I will give the hon. Gentleman a straightforward answer,
which is, in effect, the status quo. Just as it was under his
party’s Government, it is always under review. We have no direct
plans to alter it at the moment, but like any wise Government, we will
keep it under review, because who knows what may happen in the future?
It would be extremely foolish to say never—politicians are
extremely foolish if they use that word. Although I do not anticipate
dramatic changes, we will keep it under review in case the
circumstances change. For those reasons, I urge my hon. Friends to
reject the amendment if it is pressed to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000207">&#160;</a>

intervention, but I feel that I need to go into more detail on this
point, which is drawn from my experience. If the general public
understand that the Secretary of State has a direct responsibility for
the provision of services, rather than acting<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p>as the clause states,
and if they have a problem with the provision of those services, they

they were shrugged off. They were told that they should talk to

right. If we are to go down the route, which I firmly believe is right,
of local accountability for health services, it is vital that we do not
create confusion by having a clause that makes it clear—as I
believe clause 1 will, if the amendment is made—the Secretary of
State is directly responsible for provision or securing of health
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000210">&#160;</a>

previous Parliament we had the move towards foundation trusts, which
deliberately delegated—in fact, gave—responsibility to
local boards, and therefore we have that conflict. That is what led my
constituents to write to the Secretary of State. They felt that the
Secretary of State had ultimate responsibility under the original Act,
but were told that because they were dealing with a foundation trust,
which bodies were introduced by his colleagues in the previous
Parliament, the Secretary of State and his Ministers said that that was
no longer their responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000212">&#160;</a>

targets, which are important. The Minister says he does not think that
it achieves what it should, because of the commissioning issue, but we
oppose the proposals on commissioning. He seems to be assuming that we
have already passed them, and I am sure that he would never do that and
pre-empt a democratic vote. However, we do not really accept his
argument about commissioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000219">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
press the right hon. Gentleman on a point that I made earlier—I
am sure I will not get very far on it today, but I can assure him we
will return to it. He keeps talking about politically driven targets
and mandates from Ministers. As I recall, he has so far cited only one
target—the 18-week target—but the Committee needs to be
fully aware of the implications of the proposals. There are people
outside who have been involved in the health service for many decades,
but who, because of the Bill’s complexities, still cannot get a
grip on some  of the detail or what the implications of some of
the clauses will be down the line. I stress that point, because if
passing the Bill will mean that certain decisions will no longer be
taken by Ministers, Parliament should be aware of that. He could argue
that it is our job to scrutinise the Bill, which of course it is, but
we are unconvinced at the moment, and we are asking him for more
evidence. If he cannot provide that evidence today, perhaps he could
write to us, setting out which decisions would no longer be taken by
Ministers.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000220">&#160;</a>

a general argument for or against targets. The hon. Member for Central
Suffolk and North Ipswich said that what we really need are targets
with some clinical basis. If the hon. Member for Halton writes to the
Minister, he will suggest that there are additional targets, apart from
clinical targets set in consultation with clinicians, that politicians
alone should set. It will help the Committee enormously in its
deliberations if the hon. Gentleman spells out in that letter exactly
what targets he thinks politicians should be setting, which are
different from the ones that politicians would set in consultation with
clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000225">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Let
me be clear. We were in Government in May. The present Government have
now taken over and have made a big case about targets and about
reducing political interference. We are somewhat suspicious of
that—perhaps we are wrong, but I do not think so—and
think that it may be a cover for hiding, for example, a deterioration
in waiting times for patients. Only time will prove that—if we
can get the information, which is the other question. Will all that
information continue to be centrally provided? We keep hearing the
Minister say that the average wait is still about eight or nine weeks,
but within that there are some more interesting figures, and we shall
be scrutinising them very carefully. That is why we want to pursue this
issue further than we are talking about here. I say to the hon.
Gentleman: we are not in government now; you

issues with the Minister. I do not know how wide-ranging a debate on
commissioning

                           </div>you will allow, Mr Hancock, but I am sure you will provide guidance, if
needed. Our concerns, which also relate to the next group of
amendments, concern the changes that will hand responsibility for
commissioning from primary care trusts to a
national body and commissioning consortia. Concerns have been raised
not only by us, but by a coalition of organisations about the
commissioning
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000266">&#160;</a>

have the same debate twice, and this issue is covered mainly in clause
5, while amendment 34, which is in the next group of amendments,
relates to clause 6. We can have the debate only once. If we have the
debate now, we cannot have the same debate on clause 5—it is not
allowed under Standing Orders—so I will rule it out, as I am
sure will Mr Hood, if he is in the Chair at the relevant time. I hope
that hon. Members are clear about that. I do not want to stifle debate,
but the amendment is about the word “Commissioning”,
while the issue of commissioning relates mainly to clause
5.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000267">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Obviously, I will take your advice, Mr
Hancock. I will speak directly about taking out the word
“Commissioning” without addressing the wider issue of
commissioning. Clearly, we have difficulty with the Government’s
commissioning proposals, and this is a straightforward amendment that
takes out the word “Commissioning”. We are not
necessarily against having a board that could be more transparent in
relation to health service or management issues. That is why, at this
stage, we just want to remove the word
“Commissioning”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
lot of uncertainty about responsibilities in relation to the proposed
national commissioning board. The Department of Health has a permanent
secretary and the health service has a chief executive, and we will
have a national commissioning board, if Parliament approves the Bill.
We are opposed to the way in which the Bill sets up commissioning, and
I will refer to the PCTs and so on when we debate the next group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is an argument about how we can have more transparent management in the
national health service, and we will discuss some other amendments
later. We might be able to consider a board that meets in public,
produces minutes and has much more financial transparency, but we do
not think that it should be a commissioning board. We want to explore
the issue
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
key issue is how the NHS will be managed. The Minister may want to
leave that until we debate clause 5, or he may want to say something
about it now. We have a permanent secretary, the commissioning board
and the civil service management structure, which is an internal board
within the Department of Health. How will that all work as a result of
the proposal to set up a national commissioning board? We are concerned
about that and would like to explore the issue a bit more when
discussing clause 5. At this stage, that is what the amendment is
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Mr Hancock, it is right and sensible to have the
debate that the right hon. Gentleman has mentioned when we reach clause
5, because there will be far greater opportunity to go into detail. The
amendment that his hon. Friends have tabled is narrow and deals with
the name of the national commissioning board. Basically, it would
remove the word “commissioning” from the title, so that
if the amendment were passed, the body would be known as “the
NHS board”, rather than “the NHS commissioning
board”. I know that from the perspective of Opposition Members a
lot of important things flow from that, but the discussion on clause 5
is  a better time to have that debate, and we should keep this
debate to the narrow issue of the amendments before
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
assume that the intention of the amendments is to alter the function of
the NHS commissioning board, so that it would have a general system
management role in relation to the NHS, rather than being limited
simply to commissioning. Of course, changing the name of the board
would not in itself serve to alter its functions, but changing the
functions would fundamentally undermine the strategy set out in the
White Paper. As the hon. Member for Halton knows, the Government want
to create clarity of function between commissioning and providing,
although I will not go into that in great detail in considering the
amendment for the reasons that we have
discussed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000279">&#160;</a>

urge that the amendment is not pressed to a Division because, frankly,
if it were successful but other amendments—for example, those
relating to clause 5—were not, the change in the name of the NHS
commissioning board would have no practical effect whatsoever in terms
of the board’s effect, duties or function. However, what would
happen—perhaps the hon. Member for Halton will say that this is
fine with him—is that perceptions of the role of the board would
be changed within the health service and among the public. The
suggestion would be that its functions are not principally to do with
commissioning. From my point of view and that of my hon. Friends, we
would not like to see that happen. Having probed that narrow point and

there is nothing worse for a Chair than to have a disgruntled Member

Barron a chance to have a chat with the Chair and the Clerk at the end
of the meeting to clarify that point because it is seemingly unfair to
hon. Members who want to make a point when they do not like a ruling.

set out, but he will understand that we have a problem with the

my opening speech that our concern should be highlighted and debated
here, although it is a narrow point, as we now know. We will return to
wider discussion in clause 5, which I am sure will be a somewhat longer
debate than this one. However, I feel that it is a point of principle

                           </strong> Okay. Again, the amendments are straightforward. We
believe that the primary care trust should do commissioning. I will

                        <p class="tabbed">Having read
the coalition agreement about PCTs—again, we will refer to this
later—we see that the Bill and the White Paper propose removing
PCTs and handing commissioning over to consortia and to the national
commissioning board. We were surprised by such a fundamental change to
the health service. What we thought would be the logical progression
would be to put clinicians and local authorities in charge of the PCT
boards, and they could carry out commissioning via that route rather
than going through this huge upheaval in the NHS, which we have
obviously discussed in previous debates and on Second Reading. So we
were most surprised at that, following what the coalition had said and
the publication of the health White
Paper.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is entirely consistent with our view that PCTs should remain. We will
doubtless talk a lot about PCTs in subsequent debates, but we need to
say now that we accept that they were not perfect and that things could
have been done better. However, PCTs did a lot of good things and we
felt that the framework or structure was there to improve commissioning
by having clinicians much more involved than before.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is consistent with our view that we should return to the best approach
of using PCTs, with greater involvement clinicians, to drive forward
changes in commissioning. I know that what the Minister can say will be
limited, but I will be interested to hear why there was a sudden
change, because that is obviously fundamental to this particular aspect
of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000325">&#160;</a>

other points, but I said that PCTs were not perfect and that some were
better than others. However, they achieved a lot of good things. People
can read our manifesto. The Minister keeps drawing attention to his
party’s manifesto, but while I keep trying to find the
justification for this change in it, that somehow passes me by—I
cannot think why. I have read that document constantly but I must say
to the Minister that I have a somewhat different interpretation from
his.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000327">&#160;</a>

made it very clear that there would be greater clinician involvement,
which is something about which I think we all would agree. However, we
have the problem that we were faced with the coalition agreement, which
was written in May or June—I cannot remember when—but a
few months later the policy completely changed. We have still not been
convinced of the arguments for that, and we do not know why such a
sudden change was made in such a short space of time. Our proposal fits
with our view about how things should proceed, and of course it is
opposed to the Conservative and Liberal Democrat policy on
commissioning. PCTs have a lot of experience of commissioning. Indeed,
we will find that a lot of the GP consortia will employ commissioners
from the PCTs, so why could not the Government keep the PCTs in the
first place?<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000328">&#160;</a>

following the debate on Second Reading, when the House’s
decision was pretty clear, does he really want to go down the road of
waving a “Save the PCTs” banner and arguing to save the
unnecessary bureaucracy of the PCTs? Yes, there will be good people in
PCTs who will be re-employed in consortia, but that will not be
everyone and the savings will be ploughed back into the national health
service. Does the hon.

clinician involvement in commissioning by having clinicians basically
running the PCT board with, say, the local authority, although they
would be in charge. Obviously, we would have to work out the mechanics
and the details, but that could have happened. Instead, we are getting
rid of the PCTs and employing, in many cases, the same staff in what
might be many more consortia than there are PCTs. The cost might be
greater in the long

costs would be greater or less if the change did not take place. We

greater experience of the health service than the Minister or I, raise
serious questions about setting up the commissioning consortia and the
national commissioning board, so we have to listen to them. All I have

reasonable, and to express the concerns of many experienced people

we have received as a Committee; and bring in more clinical expertise,
including from the secondary sector, and clinicians from other areas,
such as nursing in particular, and let those people dominate the board.
We might also want to bolt on additional democratic accountability and
some outcome measures, although I am aware that the Conservative party
does not like targets, but that was what was outlined by the hon.
Member for Southport. If we followed that path instead of abolition, we
could keep the institutional memory—there is a risk that that
will be lost—of the PCTs, the acquired skills that they have
been built up, and their coterminosity with their local authority
boundaries. That would have the advantage of producing less upheaval
and risk, and we would save money while creating very few new
organisations. We still do not know exactly how many new organisations
will be created by the new commissioning arrangements, but that option
seems to make eminently good
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000340">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
shake-up is huge, and the costs of abolishing primary care trusts are
considerable, even without taking account of the risks of
organisational disruption. The Minister has calculated that the
redundancy costs of abolishing the PCTs and strategic health
authorities will be £852 million, and that figure rises to more
than £1 billion when one includes redundancies from
arm’s length bodies and the Department of Health due to
responsibilities being transferred to other
Departments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000341">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
34 would provide for only a change of wording—substituting
“primary care trusts” for “commissioning
consortia”—but I cannot help noticing that there is no
reason why a primary care trust cannot be a commissioning consortium,
or why a commissioning consortium could not be referred to as a primary
care trust. The amendment therefore goes no place, but it does raise a
substantive issue on to which I shall try not to stray too
far.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000343">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
seems that what unites the Committee is that commissioning should be an
administratively lean process. I hate to talk about cutting
“bureaucracy” because bureaucrats get such a bad time of
it these days from all of us. Some 80% of the people in this country
work behind desks and we think that there should be fewer bureaucrats.
The people in the back office must have been doing something before we
decided to get rid of them. We want administrative leanness, with
informed and democratically accountable commissioners, and with the
organisations in the commission dominated by clinicians. The dividing
line is whether we think that the best way of achieving that outcome,
which is accepted among the parties, is via GP consortia, as specified
in the Bill, or through a revamped, slimmed down PCT.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000344">&#160;</a>

to use the term “PCT”; very few people know what it means
anyway. “Primary care trust” means nothing to the general
public, and those who do know what PCTs are do not like them because
they have been associated with configuration battles or with demands
for services that have been rationed. I much prefer a phrase such as
“clinical care trust,” which gives the sense that an
organisation is dominated by clinicians. That would have all the
advantages that the hon. Member for Easington has spelled out and that
I have put to the

once again, albeit with the best of intentions, they are going down the
path of defending structures rather than considering what would produce
the best outcomes for patients. I refer to a meeting that I attended
about eight weeks ago with a group of senior clinical consultants at
the George Eliot hospital in my constituency. I wrote the observations
of two senior secondary consultants in my notebook at the time. One
consultant said, “At the end of the day, this is not about the
hospital or the PCT. It’s about the pathways to services for
local people.” Another consultant said, “Please can you
just remove the PCT as quickly as possible, and devolve the clinical
pathways as close to the patients as you can?” Those comments
were made at a crisis meeting between secondary care consultants, me
and the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones) about concerns at the way
in which the PCT and NHS Warwickshire were commissioning health
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000357">&#160;</a>

with the commitments on pages 45 and 46 of our election manifesto. I
have probably read the document far more often than the hon. Member for
Halton, and it is abundantly clear what we were saying. That was backed

                        <p class="tabbed">When this
Government were formed with a coalition between the two parties, we
signed up to a vision for the health service—because it had also
been mentioned prior to the general election—that PCTs would be
retained with a democratic element to them by including on their boards
some elected councillors or others elected to them, to give them a
democratic accountability. When we came into power, we started to flesh
out the vision as outlined by the Secretary of State and the Liberal
Democrats. In their election manifesto they wanted to save money and
cut excessive management and bureaucracy by abolishing the strategic
health authorities. When we fleshed it out and saw that the public
health role was to move towards local authorities and that the
commissioning was to go to GP consortia, it suddenly became clear that
there was virtually nothing for PCTs in their current state to do.
There is little point in keeping an organisation with all the costs
involved simply for the sake of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000375">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
fleshed out the details and looked at all the opportunities and the way
in which the system would work, the decision was taken by the
Government and Ministers in the Department of Health that it was
pointless and an utter waste of money to keep a structure that would
not have anything to do, given the cost involved. We decided that in
the interests of the NHS and patients, it was better to abolish PCTs
and reinvest the money saved into front-line services to improve and
enhance the quality of care and
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000376">&#160;</a>

would have thought that anyone who is committed to improving outcomes
and quality of care would welcome any saving of money from a redundant,
or almost redundant, structure. I cannot see the problem. I hope that
that reassures the hon. Member for Halton—I am sure it will
not—and that it reinvigorates his understanding of how the

taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000377">&#160;</a>

consultation process was on the contents of the
White Paper and five documents flowing from it. We would not,
therefore, necessarily expect the question to be asked. We were asking
for views on what the Government were proposing and, of course, because
of the processes leading to the White Paper, what the Government were
proposing by that point was the abolition of the PCTs, hand in glove
with the Liberal Democrat policy commitment to abolish the SHAs, so
that we could save money and reinvest it in patient care for the health
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000392">&#160;</a>

the point about fundholder commissioning and the partial justification
of saving money from the administration of the PCTs, may I remind the
Minister of the evidence of Dr Jennifer Dixon from the Nuffield Trust?
She cited a case study in north America involving 3,000 groups of
fundholder commissioners in the late 1980s and early 1990s—only
300 are left. The reasons she gave for the failure of 90% of those
commissioners were that: they were unable to sustain the financial
risk; they were torpedoed; they were too small, in part; and they had
invested badly in management and
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000395">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for North Warwickshire made a point earlier about the
commissioning structure. The question, which we will explore later, is
whether the commissioning improvements—which we all
want—could not have been done via the PCT structure, without
getting rid of the PCTs and setting up a new structure involving
consortia, which there may or may not be more of than there are PCTs.
We want to explore that, and shall do so later. We are not wedded to
any structure per se. We are asking a serious question about why we
needed this fundamental change.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000402">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">An important
point was made about pathways and patient care being delivered close to
the patient. Of course, what we are proposing and will discuss later in
other amendments is that GP surgeries will still be close to
patients—they are in the communities. There is no change to GP
surgeries under any of the proposals, whether what we did or what the
Minister suggests doing. The service will still be
delivered.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000403">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue is that the consortia will have a central body. They will have
some office—some building, I assume—and staff, many of
whom will have been PCT staff. So why go through all of this when
commissioning could have been done through the PCT structure? It is not
an issue of removing care from patients—frankly, that remains
the same. It is about the people who take the decisions about the
delivery of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000404">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not saying that the hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North
Ipswich misquoted me, but he should not put a different gloss on what I
said. Many PCTs have been successful and have done a good job, but
there have been problems in some, which, of course, continually need to
be looked at and improved. We have always said that. That is why we
said that we should have much greater clinical and local government
involvement in commissioning. I put the same argument to the Minister:
some doctors are better than others and some hospitals are better than
others—there are always differing standards. How do we get the
standards up  to the best, which is, of course, what we all
want to achieve? Again, we will pursue that point in later
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11021560000405">&#160;</a>

feel strongly that this change is completely unnecessary. The
improvements could have been made via the PCT structure, with some
innovative and imaginative thinking and determination to see it
through. We should oppose the upheaval that the Government are causing

principle, and that is why I wish to press the amendment to a
