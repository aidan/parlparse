31, in

out from &#145;so&#146; to the end of line
12.</div><a name="09062477000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased to be back under your chairmanship, Mr. Key. We
will try to make as much progress as we managed this morning, when we
rattled
along.</div><a name="09062477000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
31 again refers to the suspension of Monitor&#146;s executives. The
Secretary of State will not be obliged to undertake a review of
suspensions until three months have elapsed from the time of
suspension, and the amendment would remove that obligatory delay while
preserving the opportunity for review. Why was that apparently
arbitrary period chosen? Given, as I have said before, that suspended
non-executives are unlikely to have recourse to the courts, surely they
should be allowed a review as soon as is practicably
possible.</div><a name="09062477000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000473"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> We wanted to allow reasonable time for
investigations to take place; it is as simple as that. Investigations
may be concluded more quickly, but, depending on the circumstances,
they make take longer. The Secretary of State would not want to be in a
position whereby he was unable properly and fairly to conduct a review
of the suspension if requested to do so in an unrealistically short
time.</div><a name="09062477000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062477000474"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000475"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 184, in
schedule 3, page 49, line 36, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) The
amendments made by this Schedule apply to a condition occurring at any
time in the person&#146;s appointment which satisfies the Secretary
of State as a condition for
suspension.&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we arrive at the exciting point about paragraph 19,
establishing that the changes here are retrospective in that they
impact on anyone appointed at the time the Act comes into force,
regardless of when they were appointed. This is a probing amendment to
find out whether the legislation will operate retrospectively on
grounds for a suspension that may have arisen in the past but may no
longer be present, or will suspension be an option only on grounds for
suspension that arise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>after this legislation comes into force? The related question is whether
the Minister currently has any non-executives in his sights for when
the provision comes into
force.</div><a name="09062477000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000476"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The transitional provision in paragraph 19
as drafted ensures that the measures will apply to persons appointed at
any time. This already enables us to investigate any issues or
allegations about events that happened in relation to persons appointed
at any time prior to the Act coming into force. In answer to the final
question, I have no one in my sights at the
moment.</div><a name="09062477000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000477"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> That clears up the question about the
retrospective provisions, and clearly there is nobody in the
Minister&#146;s sights. The slight question that survives, which
perhaps the Minister could pick up at a later point, is whether the
actual grounds for suspension need to have arisen before the
legislation in order not to be caught or whether they can be caught
retrospectively. Does the Minister want to intervene on that
point?</div><a name="09062477000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000478"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> My understanding is that this enables us to
deal with any issue that arises at any stage, whether retrospective or
not. That seems to be the basis on which we are proceeding. If there is
anything different, I will write to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09062477000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000479"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am most grateful. I think the important
point on the record is that there is a degree of retrospection that
needs to be well understood by everybody who might be affected by it.
On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

21</h4><a name="09062477000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Prohibition
of tobacco displays
etc</div><a name="09062477000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062477000480"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): I beg to move amendment
89, in
clause 21, page 24, line 16, leave
out
&#145;requested&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will realise that we have reached a clause that, to be frank,
is controversial. There are many different views across the House about
how a product that is legal in this country can be sold while, at the
same time&#151;and I say this from a personal perspective&#151;we
cut the number of people, especially the young, who take up smoking and
continue to smoke.</div>
<a name="09062477000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a
member of the Health Committee when we looked carefully at evidence
relating to the legislation to ban smoking in public places. I began
that evidence session feeling very sceptical about banning smoking
selectively. By the end of it, on the basis of the evidence, I was a
signatory, with other hon. Members of the Committee, to the idea of a
total ban on smoking in public places. It is probably obvious that I
have no side with the tobacco industry. I would be happy if everybody
ceased smoking tomorrow morning. It would be great for their health and
great for the NHS, but probably not so great for the
Treasury.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div><a name="09062477000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in
mind, I emphasise the term &#147;evidence based&#148;. I have said
to the organisations lobbying brilliantly on behalf of this legislation
that my concern is not that I want fewer people to
smoke&#151;particularly children&#151;and to have access to
tobacco. That is a no-brainer for everybody, I am sure. It is that I
wonder whether the legislation will work and whether it is too onerous
on legal organisations that sell tobacco as part of their income
stream.</div>
<a name="09062477000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wonder
whether the legislation would provide more of a driver for the black
market. Currently, at least one in five cigarettes is either
counterfeit or sold on the black market with no duty paid and no one
taking the slightest bit of interest in the age of the person buying
that product. Age is something that I believe newsagents, tobacconists
and clubs should take notice of, and in most cases they do.</div>
<a name="09062477000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, I
will not press any of the matters related to tobacco to a vote in
Committee. That is a matter for the whole House to decide on. Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition will have a free vote, so they can express
their personal views. I hope that the Government take a similar view,
as, to be fair, they did on the legislation to ban smoking in public,
when we had a free
vote.</div><a name="09062477000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment, which deals with the prohibition of tobacco
displays. I said earlier that I doubt not the Government&#146;s
intentions, which I think are honourable, but the evidence base behind
the provision. It is, perhaps, a bit early to use some of the evidence
that the Minister has sent out in her letters&#151;today, for
instance. That, sadly, has left no option for her to be open-minded, as
we all were about the previous legislation. Instead, it is dismissive
of evidence counter to that being used by the
Government.</div><a name="09062477000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
89 seeks to provoke the debate on the statutory definition of a
requested display. For people who sell tobacco on their premises, what
that means is of great concern; they want to know when and if they are
breaking the law. &#147;Requested display&#148; relates to
retailers and staff as set out in the Bill, but it is very vague. It
needs to be defined, I am sure the Minister will agree. It needs a bit
more tweaking, even if the legislation is passed, so that people have
confidence that their display is not breaking the law under new section
7B.</div>
<a name="09062477000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">An individual
who wants to see the legal product that they are going to buy may have
a child with them in the shop. Under the clause, is it going to be
illegal for them to see the product? I hate to think that we will have
a situation where mums and dads who, sadly, still smoke leave Johnny or
Mary outside the door unaccompanied while they go in and purchase their
cigarettes. It will not always be possible for people to accompany the
children while their parents are in the shop purchasing their
cigarettes, which are a legal product. My point is that the
parents&#151;and the tobacconists&#151;will be concerned about
whether they are breaking the law if an under-18 is with them during
that purchase. That needs to be set out and defined carefully, because,
if we are not careful, people may unintentionally break the law or put
their children at
risk.</div><a name="09062477000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Someone
may, for instance, ask to see a new brand at a tobacco kiosk in the
middle of a large supermarket with significant footfall. If the new
brand is presented to them before they purchase and a minor walks past,
will that be an offence under the Bill? Under the wording at present,
it appears that it will. People will commit an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>offence unintentionally, and the effect on the proprietor will be
onerous, whether it be a large supermarket or a smaller corner
shop.</div><a name="09062477000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a whole debate to be had as to whether it is physically possible for
someone who is the only person working in a shop at a particular moment
to know what is happening out of their eyeshot when someone asks to see
a product. Shoplifting is a real problem for small businesses, and the
Association of Convenience Stores asked me to look into
that.</div><a name="09062477000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
arguments about the content of the amendment are for the Floor of the
House. What I am trying to probe with my comments now is what is
actually an offence in respect of a requested display. It is difficult
to see from the wording of the Bill exactly what is an
offence.</div><a name="09062477000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062477000481"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I thoroughly appreciate the
attitude taken by Conservative Front-Bench Members on how to deal with
this issue. It is such a big topic for parties, and people within
parties, that it is probably best discussed largely on the Floor of the
House. Therefore, fewer amendments will be put to the vote during
debates in Committee. In fact, there are variations within parties and
even within health teams. One of the reasons I am on this Bill is that
I reduced the variation that might otherwise have occurred if other
personnel had been put on
it.</div><a name="09062477000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the ban on smoking in public places was introduced, the argument was
largely about secondary or passive smoking, and the rights of people
not to be affected by other people&#146;s smoke, but I think that
there was a sub-text to it. I was well aware of a definite attempt to
marginalise smoking as an activity. That is what the legislation
succeeded in doing, and I do not think that it was necessarily a bad
thing, but it would be more honest when people are presenting their
argument to do so in precisely those terms. The more that smoking is
seen as a rather strange activity that people engage in in little
huddles outside buildings on cold days, the less people will smoke, the
better public health will be, and the less cost there will be for the
NHS.</div><a name="09062477000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
clause and successive clauses largely set out the possibility of
regulation that is justified by the suggestion that we can stop
children smoking by altering displays, or that we can stop people who
have given up smoking restarting. Evidence has been amassed to that
effect, but, as the hon. Gentleman just said, there is evidence moving
in both directions. Frankly, some of it looks a bit flaky; at any rate,
it is
inconclusive.</div><a name="09062477000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that one buys cigarettes on impulse. Someone might walk
into a service station and suddenly buy a packet of crisps, a chocolate
bar or a drink they had not expected to buy, but they would not
suddenly come out with cigarettes, not having previously intended to go
in there for that precise purpose. I think that the public health
arguments are not as honestly or as plainly put
here.</div><a name="09062477000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
being said, the definition of &#147;requested display&#148; as an
entity in law is a little obscure to me. I share some of the
reservations of Conservative Front-Bench Members about it and would
support the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000482"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Gillian Merron):</b>
It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr.
Key.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div><a name="09062477000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank hon. Members for their comments because it is helpful to probe
the intent behind the clause, and certainly the considerations that
have been put are useful. Perhaps I could clarify that the amendment,
if passed, would allow retailers openly to display tobacco to all
adults, which of course is not the intention of the Bill. It would also
require shops either to create separate adult-only areas just to
display tobacco or to remove tobacco displays entirely. I am seriously
concerned that that would put small shops at a serious competitive
disadvantage. They would be far less able to afford to create such
areas, whereas supermarkets and superstores would have no such problem.
Even if we put aside the competitive disadvantage, the amendment would
ignore the second and important part of our policy, which has perhaps
not been aired, but which is to support those who already smoke but
want to
quit.</div><a name="09062477000440"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000483"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I completely agree with the Minister that we must
make every effort to help people who want to quit smoking. May I take
her back to what she said about display? I understood that the
Bill&#146;s purpose was to prevent young people from seeing tobacco
advertised in a shop in a display, and then illegally purchasing it on
impulse. The Minister has just said that its purpose is to prevent
adults from seeing tobacco advertised in a display. That is an
imbalance. Is the purpose of the legislation to prevent under-age
people from smoking, or
not?</div><a name="09062477000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000484"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> Of course, it is both, and we will discuss that.
It is important not to ignore the second part, which is that we have a
duty to support those who want to quit, but we also have a huge duty
not to allow young people to be recruited into the ranks of smokers,
which is what the tobacco industry
wants.</div><a name="09062477000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
range of research studies has considered the effect of tobacco displays
on people who are trying to quit. Cancer Research UK&#146;s 2008
report&#151;I have placed a copy in the Library&#151; summarised
some of the published papers. Based on previous research, Cancer
Research UK says that display</div>
<a name="09062477000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;stimulates
impulse purchases and undermines the efforts to
quit.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
hon. Members want more evidence, I refer to the youth tobacco policy
survey, which was set up to measure the impact of restrictions on
tobacco advertising on children in the UK. The study began in 1999 and
took place five times over seven years with nearly 6,000 adolescents
with an average age of 13 taking part. Several papers have been
published based on the data collected. The survey showed a decreasing
level of awareness of tobacco among young people where tobacco
advertising has been
banned.</div><a name="09062477000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000485"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I referred at the outset of our discussion on
this part of the Bill to the work of Cancer Research UK, Action on
Smoking and Health and other contributory organisations that are
working so hard. However, it is obvious that they will be selective
about the evidence that they put forward and will choose what supports
their argument. They will not choose evidence that contradicts what
they are trying to do, which would be ludicrous. Quoting one side of
the argument does not give a balanced view.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div><a name="09062477000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Advertising
has been banned for a considerable time, and we do not want to go
through the Formula 1 debacle at the outset of the Labour Government.
The Minister is referring to evidence about advertising, which does not
exist in this country, unless the display of a legal product in a shop
is deemed to be advertising, in which case it is covered by existing
legislation.</div><a name="09062477000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000486"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> Perhaps I may make myself clear. I was referring
to studies by MacFadyen et al in 2001, who studied 15 and 16-year-olds
in the north-east of England, Grant et al in 2007, and a range of
others. Information is widely available, and I am happy to provide it.
The Cancer Research UK report pulls together a range of surveys. I
could refer to international evidence, but I thought it best to stick
to UK evidence on this
occasion.</div><a name="09062477000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to the more general point about why we allow requested displays.
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, tobacco remains a legal product,
and those who smoke should be able to see or handle the product before
they agree to buy it. The requested display provision means that
shopkeepers may show tobacco products to people who want information or
who want to buy the products. However&#151;this is the
key&#151;workability is important, and showing tobacco to one person,
as the hon. Gentleman has said, may mean that others catch sight of it.
I am well aware of the concerns about that. I reassure the hon.
Gentleman and other members of the Committee that we will use
regulations under new section 7B (3) to make sure that no offences are
committed when shopkeepers are selling, or showing, tobacco to a
customer and other people see it.</div>
<a name="09062477000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
working closely with retail organisations such as the Association of
Convenience Stores, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and
others&#151;for example, the local authority co-ordinators of
regulatory services&#151;to develop practical and workable
regulations, which will keep the cost of covering up displays to a
minimum. It is quite appropriate for those details to be made through
regulations, because we need to work through them, and work with
stakeholders to develop regulations that will be both effective and
workable. We need to talk to the retailers and to the trading standards
officers about how the provision will work in practice and what
detail should be in the regulations for consultation later this
year.</div>
<a name="09062477000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The requested
display provision is needed to make sure that people can see a legal
product before they buy it, but it needs to be requested only to give
power to those adults who want to quit smoking. I hope that with this
clarification of why we need to cover up tobacco displays for everyone,
and why requested displays need to be part of the Bill, that the hon.
Gentleman will, as he indicated at the beginning, not press the
amendment.</div>

fair, and I hope&#151;hint, hint to the Government Whips&#151;that
there is sufficient time on the Floor of the House to have a sensible

law-abiding citizens who are going

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000488"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I beg to move amendment 91, in
clause 22, page 26, line 3, leave
out &#145;may&#146; and insert
&#145;shall&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
91 would flush out more of the concerns that we, or rather I&#151;we
are on a free vote so I had better say &#147;I&#148;&#151;have
with the legislation. The evidence published to date, and the evidence
produced by the Minister today, is insufficient to support a ban on
point of sale displays. It is also clear that children use vending
machines. I am not just speaking from the evidence produced by Cancer
Research UK and ASH in videos showing young people going into licensed
premises&#151;close to where we are standing here
today&#151;putting coins in the machine and buying the product. In
recent weeks, I, too, have seen young people come into licensed
premises and purchase tobacco from vending machines. The important
thing here is whether the existing legislation has been enforced
correctly, because many of the premises in which I saw this taking
place, and some of the premises in the recent DVD and video, were
licensed premises, so those young people should not have been
unaccompanied in the first place. We need to address that
point.</div><a name="09062477000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
encourage more and more young people to come into the family-oriented
pub or bistro. I am a keen supporter of the British pub industry and do
everything I can to support pubs. At the same time, it is the
responsibility of those running such establishments and providing
vending machines to do everything that they possibly can to preclude
young people from purchasing cigarettes. They clearly cannot get them
from anywhere else at that time, otherwise they would not be paying
such huge amounts for cigarettes through vending machines. There are
myriad premises where that
happens.</div><a name="09062477000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation is already in place, and the assumption is that the
proprietor and those working in a bar or a pub should be able to see
the vending machine and whether a young person is approaching it. That
is fine if they are serving only one man and his dog occasionally. But,
in a busy, vibrant pub, which I am sure we all want our pubs to be, or
a leisure facility, similar to Jarman Park in my constituency, which
has myriad services from bowling to skating and swimming to nightclubs
and cinemas, it is physically impossible for the administrators and
owners to guarantee that every time under-18s walk to a vending machine
to purchase cigarettes they can be
stopped.</div><a name="09062477000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
considering the evidence, I have moved my position. I do not want
vending machine operators to go bankrupt. I used to be a smoker, and
given that it is so expensive I have no idea why anybody would buy
cigarettes from a vending machine. However, it is a choice that people
can make if they are over 18 and wish to purchase cigarettes. As is
suggested, in a lot of places there are no alternatives.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div><a name="09062477000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proprietors of
public houses in particular do not want loose stock to sell across the
counter. If they lose one packet of cigarettes&#151;stolen or
misappropriated by a member of staff or a customer&#151;that is the
profit margin on about two packets of cigarettes gone. They do not want
that and we moved away from it some time ago. I want the vending
machine manufacturers to have an opportunity to sell their legal
product in such premises without young people having access to them.
That can be done in numerous ways, but I do not think that it is the
purpose of the Committee to stipulate to manufacturers and proprietors
of vending machines how it should be done. It can be done with a token
or an electronic key system, so a person has to go to the
bar.</div>
<a name="09062477000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will be
surprised to hear me say this, Mr. Key, but I think that we
need to look at our European friends and take guidance from them. Some
22 countries in Europe do not permit the sale of tobacco from vending
machines at all. That is too draconian; it is a legal product and
people should have the right to purchase it, but it should not be
available to under-18s. The industry itself needs to come forward with
proposals.</div>
<a name="09062477000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062477000489"></a><b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman referred to 22
European countries having banned tobacco sales from vending machines;
why is this country different from others? Clearly the conclusion has
been that devices to limit access by minors to tobacco products in
vending machines have failed.</div>
<a name="09062477000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000490"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. If you
look at the evidence, which we are all doing, you see that when those
bans were imposed there was not the technology to do it another way. I
was living in some of those countries when bans came in. When I was a
British soldier in Germany in the &#145;70s, the vending machines
were still on the streets. That had been banned in this country years
before. Interestingly enough, they took them off the streets in places
where the British military were only because the old 5p was the same
size as the deutschmark and they were losing a fortune from British
soldiers spending 15p to buy a packet of cigarettes&#151;that is the
gospel truth. Frankly, as cigarettes were 25p in the NAAFI at the time,
it seemed immaterial; I think that soldiers did it for the joy of doing
it.</div><a name="09062477000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation has changed, and other countries in Europe and around the
world have moved to the technology that we are talking about. We have
to address whether we are going to stop law-abiding businesses selling
their legal product to British over-18s. If we can do that, there is no
need for a total ban. If we cannot, I will be one of the signatories to
the amendment on a subsequent Health Bill, but I want to give
businesses the opportunity, with the technology that we have today, to
keep going and sell their legal products. If they cannot do that, we
may have to go down another
avenue.</div><a name="09062477000441"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
Some hon. Members had the opportunity earlier this afternoon to see the
British Heart Foundation film that showed young children going into
pubs and buying cigarettes. It was clear in some cases that it was
done, if not with the active encouragement of the staff, with their
knowledge. They clearly did not think that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>was their responsibility to stop it. Even if there
are safeguards, they can be got around. As the example involves
machines, if the staff who are responsible for the machines do not feel
any responsibility, will that not stand in the way of the safeguards
the hon. Gentleman is
describing?</div><a name="09062477000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000492"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I have seen the video and think that the British
Heart Foundation is doing some effective lobbying. I did not need to
see it, however, because I have seen that happen in real
life.</div>
<a name="09062477000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two aspects
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments must be addressed. First, it is
a criminal offence to allow that to happen. If people are allowing
children to purchase cigarettes, we should check whether they are also
allowing them to drink, because they probably are. Such people should
not have licences and should be dealt with by existing legislation,
rather than by passing more legislation. Secondly, the vending machine,
or a smaller version, could be behind the bar. That way, checks would
have to be made. Rather than saying, &#147;Slap! Bang! You&#146;re
out of business,&#148; we should look at measures that were not
available when most European bans came
in.</div><a name="09062477000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that people do not want to ban tobacco sales altogether&#151;we
should be honest about that. I agree with the Liberal Democrat
spokesman that we did not have an honest debate on the legislation on
smoking in public places. Other Committee members served with me on
that Public Bill Committee. Health and safety legislation was used as a
back-door method to ban smoking in public places. It was not designed
to preclude people from smoking, but to protect people from passive
smoking in their place of employment. We should be honest about
that.</div><a name="09062477000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000493"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> My hon. Friend is giving an important
introduction to this broad area that will be discussed again on Report.
For those of us who have both smoked and given up twice, the only thing
that keeps us from starting again is the prospect of having to give up
again. I started relatively late, but it is clear that vending machines
are an easy source for those who are too young to buy cigarettes. At
that stage, people are not fussed about whether they are getting value
for money; they just want access to
cigarettes.</div><a name="09062477000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend is making the important point that we should consider
measures to ameliorate the problem, rather than be draconian and impact
on the freedom to choose. Vending machines tend to be on the corridor
on the way to the gents, which is out of sight of almost everybody.
That means that people are able to get cigarettes without any kind of
penalty or
fear.</div><a name="09062477000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000494"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I thank my hon. Friend. I started smoking when I
was 16 years old, as did the rest of the battalion I was serving with
in the British Army. Cigarettes in the Army are still almost tax-free,
particularly when one is serving abroad. On the ships of the Royal
Navy, people are given a quota and still encouraged to use it. Under
the previous smoking legislation, we considered why we continue to
allow people to smoke in prison, even though there are already so many
public health risks and it is a place of work for prison officers.
There are a couple of other amendments on these issues, Mr.
Key, but I will not discuss them for so long.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div><a name="09062477000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key is
accessibility. If people are breaking the law or ignoring existing
legislation, they are sure to get around this legislation as well. Such
people earn money when people purchase cigarettes because they get a
percentage of the profits. If people are happy to sell cigarettes to
under-18s, they will do so under the counter in future, if they do not
do so already. That would certainly be true in the part of Northern
Ireland that I come from.</div>
<a name="09062477000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
Government figures, one in five cigarettes sold in this country are
counterfeit or sold on the black market with no duty or safety
measures. Do we really want to drive that market even further before we
give vending machine manufacturers and operators the opportunity to
sell their products legally to people of the correct age? That is why I
have put forward this proposal. I stress that I will bring the
amendment back on the Floor of the House and push it to a
vote.</div><a name="09062477000091"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000495"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The problem with the amendment is that it does not
go far enough. The line that we will take both on Report and in
Committee is that cigarette vending machines are out of order and that
we support the British Heart Foundation&#146;s attempt to eradicate
them totally. Let me briefly explain why.</div>
<a name="09062477000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cigarette
vending machines are anachronistic and date back to the times when
shops closed at 6 o&#146;clock, and desperate smokers looking for a
cigarette could only get them from a vending machine. On Sundays, too,
it was hard to get a supply of cigarettes. As a result, the machines
came into being.</div>
<a name="09062477000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000496"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I apologise for taking up the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s time, but what a load of tosh. I have never heard so
much rubbish in my entire life. If someone goes into any pub in this
country, they are highly unlikely to be able to purchase cigarettes in
any other way. To say that it is something to do with the machines
being used late on a Saturday night and that they are an old-fashioned
anachronism is completely wrong. Whether we like it or not, it is the
only way in which cigarettes can be purchased in most premises these
days. That is because of the stock issue, to which I alluded
earlier.</div>
<a name="09062477000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000497"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Clearly, it would be a disincentive for people to
smoke if they had to leave the premises to get cigarettes. On a
personal note, my son recently gave up smoking. The most difficult
situation for smokers when they have given up is after they have had a
few pints and they are relaxed, so if we are looking at a measure that
will prevent people from going back to smoking, banning the machines is
probably the best one.</div>
<a name="09062477000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The machines
are not just anachronistic, but slightly odd&#151;after all, we do
not have alcohol-dispensing machines with controls on them. There must
be some reason why the Europeans, having explored the logic, have gone
down the route of largely abolishing them. We were talking about flaky
evidence and evidence pointing both ways, but the evidence here is
entirely clear cut. The machines represent a small section of total
cigarette sales, but one in six child smokers use them.
There is no doubt that the evidence shows that children
disproportionately use them. The evidence also shows that attempts to
get round that by having token systems or monitoring and other such
measures simply do not work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div><a name="09062477000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have talked about displays before. One of the great arguments for not
having displays is that it will stop people from going back to smoking
and it will stop children from smoking. Vending machines encourage
people to go back to smoking because, in the pub, they can be found
very easily. They are clearly used by children and will continue to be
used no matter what controls are brought in, because children, when
they want to smoke and get round legislation, are very canny at doing
so.</div><a name="09062477000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000498"></a>Gillian
Merron:</b> I appreciate the points that have been made, but I
will answer them under the next set of amendments or on clause stand
part, should debate on that.</div>
<a name="09062477000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The direct
effect of amendment 91 is that it would compel the Governments of
England and Wales to regulate vending machines. I can confirm that it
is the intention of this Government to introduce new regulations on
vending machines to ensure that under-age sales are prevented. The
Department is already working with key stakeholders in the vending
machine business and enforcement agencies to develop draft regulations
that will allow practical, effective and cost-effective solutions to
the problem. We will have the draft regulations ready for consultation
as soon as we can, and we are committed to commencing them from October
2011.</div><a name="09062477000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
confirm that Welsh Ministers will consult with relevant health and
business organisations and with members of the public in Wales before
determining how detailed regulation on the sale of tobacco products
from vending machines will be taken forward under their jurisdiction.
The effect of the tobacco provisions in the Bill is to devolve powers
on tobacco displays and vending machines to the relevant national
authorities. We note that the amendment will cut across that intention,
thereby imposing a legislative imperative on the Welsh Assembly
Government. Under the principle of devolution, we believe it is
appropriate to leave it to them to decide how and when to use their
powers. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead will
not pursue the amendment.</div>

its job. We have heard more from the Minister in the past five minutes

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000503"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Amendment 34 would place a duty on PCTs to take
into account the services of dispensing doctors in their assessment of
local pharmaceutical needs. We have now moved on to the clause dealing
with pharmaceutical services in England and the needs assessments as
they are proposed in the Bill. Amendment 35 would ensure
that patients are consulted as part of each pharmaceutical needs
assessment. Amendment 33 proposes pilot schemes for
PNAs.</div><a name="09062477000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
35 would ensure that each PNA includes patient consultation. The
principal purpose of the PNA should be to enhance local pharmaceutical
services for patients and ensure that the area covered by the PCT is
adequately provided for. We agree with the concept of giving
PCTs local control over the provision of pharmaceutical services, but
we want to make sure that patient choice is enhanced rather than
overruled. At present, the Bill does not make any provision for
patients to express their views in the assessment&#151;an odd
omission, given that patients are the users of the services provided
under a PNA. Will the Minister confirm that the regulations will make
provision for patient consultation? My amendment would ensure that PCTs
include the results of such a consultation in their published PNAs, so
that patients can be assured that their views were taken into account.
If a PCT goes against the wishes of patients, the general public will
be able to see that that is the case by examining the
consultation.</div>
<a name="09062477000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accounting
for the views of patients in PNAs is particularly relevant in rural
areas, where pharmaceutical services are less abundant. Many patients
have to travel long distances to access services, and consequently
people make extensive use of dispensing doctors, so that they can
combine their visit to the doctor and the collection of their
medicines. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent PCTs from cutting
those services. As my noble Friend Lord Howe argued in the other place,
many of the pharmacy community are concerned that the current PNAs
are</div><a name="09062477000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disproportionately
focused on cost-effectiveness and not enough on health
need&#148;.</div><a name="09062477000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that these services face a real risk of being
axed.</div><a name="09062477000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already fought a real battle on the subject in my
constituency&#151;with some success, I am glad to say. It revolved to
some extent around the definition of what is rural and what is
associated with an urban or suburban environment. Having said that, if
any sort of assessment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>militates against the extension of dispensing
doctors, it would be a very real threat to the rural community.
Amendment 34 would ensure that the services of dispensing doctors are
taken into consideration in PNAs, along with the views of patients, the
majority of whom want to keep the services of dispensing
practices.</div><a name="09062477000442"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09062477000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the management of dispensing practices, I am sure that the Minister
will come back to me with the same assurance that his colleague the
Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Corby
(Phil Hope), gave in December 2008: that the Government do not intend
to make any changes to the current arrangements for the dispensing of
medicines to patients by GPs. However, I am slightly less inclined to
trust the good will of the Government, given that they made that pledge
last year before the publication of the Bill but they have clearly left
a gaping hole in the legislation on that matter.</div>
<a name="09062477000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is of more
concern that the Government appear to be ignoring the wishes of NHS
patients. Some 62,675 patients registered with a dispensing practice
responded directly to the pharmacy White Paper consultation to express
their support for no change to GP dispensing. However, the Bill makes
no provision for PCTs to consider the services offered by dispensing
doctors in their needs assessment. What firm and evidence-based
assurance can the Minister give that patients who are registered with
dispensing practices will not see those services axed by their
PCTs?</div>
<a name="09062477000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to
say that many of the satellite surgeries of doctors&#146; practices
are, particularly in rural areas, cross-funded because they have a
dispensing practice. Far from doctors seeking to increase the drawings
from their own practice, it is cross-subsidy that enables them to have
a satellite service to reach out into the more remote rural areas. The
dispensing practice enables
that.</div><a name="09062477000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
33 proposes pilot schemes, which would enable the PCT and the
Government to investigate whether the local assessment of
pharmaceutical needs results in adequate provision of services. It
would also give PCTs a chance to experiment with the format and content
of the PNA to ensure that any complications are addressed and that the
assessment is wide ranging enough to be taken into account when a
provider applies to the pharmaceutical
list.</div><a name="09062477000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s own White Paper on pharmacy concedes
that</div><a name="09062477000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is considerable variation in the scope, depth and breadth of
PNAs&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062477000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
states:</div><a name="09062477000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
structure of and data requirements for PCT PNAs require further review
and strengthening to ensure they are an effective and robust
commissioning tool which supports PCT
decisions.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I realise that the Government see the Bill as the occasion for review
and strengthening, a pilot programme would be the opportune moment to
examine and trial the content of PNAs in a practical setting. PCTs
would also be able to adapt to producing more rigorous PNAs. Examples
of best practice could be disseminated before the scheme is rolled out
across the country.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div><a name="09062477000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anne
Galbraith&#146;s 2008 review of NHS pharmaceutical contractual
arrangements, which was published alongside the White Paper, made the
point
that</div><a name="09062477000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pharmaceutical
Needs Assessments...should have a consistent structure across all
PCTs and have national comparability in breadth and
depth.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
potentially negative consequence of localisation is that there will no
longer be a framework for ensuring that PCTs maintain that
comparability across the country. Of course, the regulations will seek
to qualify the information contained in the PNA and the manner in which
it is conducted. However, we have not had sight of those regulations,
so we do not know the extent to which they guide PCTs on the form and
content of a PNA. If the Government were to run a pilot scheme and
report back to Parliament with the results in 12
months&#146; time, they would have a solid evidence base
from which to move forward. In addition, PCTs would have
increased knowledge of how best to utilise the PNA to gain the best
possible access to pharmaceutical services for their
patients.</div>
<a name="09062477000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000504"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I have to apologise for the fact that my hon. Friend
the Member for Romsey is not here, because she is the expert on this
subject and would have a great deal more to say than I have. I have no
problem with the general tenor of what the Government are endeavouring
to do. Public authorities have always had to strike a balance so that
naked commercial interests do not dominate the pharmaceutical world.
The needs of the community are paramount, and there has always been a
need to structure the market publicly in some way. Anybody who has been
an elected councillor or any sort of elected representative will have
been lobbied at some point by a pharmacy or a dispensing physician
about their position, their share of the market and the placing of
other facilities close to
them.</div><a name="09062477000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Member for Eddisbury that whatever is done needs to
be properly and thoroughly evidence-based, and if it is not
evidence-based everywhere, it will not be well done. It cannot be
lobby-based, because there are plenty of powerful interests in the
pharmaceutical world and many prosperous commercial practices that will
weigh in heavily to get their way if left to their own devices. I
therefore warm to the amendments because they would preserve the rights
of dispensing practices, particularly in rural areas, and they make
clear that the market must serve patients rather than simply appear by
accident and as a result of commercial
happenstance.</div><a name="09062477000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000505"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I, too, represent a rural area where
dispensing doctor&#146;s practices exist and operate, and I very much
understand the concerns of some GP practices that, in order to maintain
satellite practices, they sometimes have to have funding from a
dispensary. Indeed, a dispensary provides a facility for local people
in such communities. At the same time, there is always a concern where
doctors both prescribe and dispense, and it is right to exercise
caution when dealing with that. Dispensing clearly offers an income, so
we need to be careful that we deal with the issue appropriately. I
believe that, in most cases, doctors act with a professional integrity
on which we can broadly rely. However, we need to be continually aware
that individuals may not always act with such integrity; the
appropriate disciplinary procedures for doctors will deal with
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div><a name="09062477000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, the hon. Member for Eddisbury
said:</div><a name="09062477000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
move to pharmaceutical needs assessments is
welcome.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 8 June 2009; Vol. 493,
c. 612.]</div><a name="09062477000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
glad that he said that. I make it clear that, as we announced before
Christmas, we will not change the current system for determining
whether doctors can dispense to their patients. On primary care trusts
in rural areas where most dispensing by doctors takes place, it is
important that such services are considered within their overall
assessments of
needs.</div><a name="09062477000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been asked whether services by dispensing doctors could be at risk
from bad PCT decisions on new applications. The current regulations
already contain provisions to take into account any prejudice to
existing service providers in rural areas from new applicants, and I
stress that that safeguard will continue in the new regulatory
system.</div><a name="09062477000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause requires PCTs to undertake and publish their assessments of
pharmaceutical needs in accordance with regulations. The Department
will work closely with interested parties, including NHS and contractor
representatives, as well as doctors, on drafting the requirements. I
announced last Thursday the formation of an advisory group for that
very purpose. However, not all PCTs need to resort to the services of
dispensing doctors. It is important that such services are available
for the patients who use them in rural areas, but they have little
relevance, if any, in non-rural PCTs across the country. We need to get
the issue right, and I hope that my reassurances have been satisfactory
and that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09062477000131"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000506"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> The Minister may be able to assist me. He has
pointed out the obvious conflict of interest that can exist when one is
both dispensing and prescribing medicines. That needs to be addressed.
He has suggested that the only way in which it would be addressed is
via the ethics committees of local GPs and so on. The issue will, of
course, be assessed, determined and established by the PCT, but is
there not provision in the legislation, particularly in relation to
where a prescribing practice differs radically from what one might
expect, to do things other than relying entirely on doctors&#146;
panels judging
themselves?</div><a name="09062477000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000507"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks whether there are other
provisions in this legislation. I am not aware of any. I shall consider
the matter and in due course confirm in writing whether that is the
case. It is a reasonable question, and I shall write to
him.</div>
<a name="09062477000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000508"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The Minister seizes the point, not least
because his constituency has the same characteristics of rurality, at
least in part, as no doubt many of ours do. That factor has a big
effect on the availability of services and access to them in relation
to how the cash flows work for both doctors and dispensing
operations.</div>
<a name="09062477000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was pleased
at the way in which the Minister put the Government&#146;s case; he
did not go down the same track that was used in defence in the other
place by Baroness Thornton, who took issue with the proposal of pilots
on the basis that it would delay the national roll-out of PNAs for at
least two years. I thought that argument spurious, and I welcome the
fact that the Minister did not deploy it. Given his assurance, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09062477000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div><a name="09062477000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000509"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 145, in
clause 25, page 28, line 24, after
&#145;assessment&#146;,
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(e) for appeals to
the Secretary of State or a body in relation to the content of the
statement made by
PCTs.&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would enable pharmaceutical services to challenge the content
of the PNA. It would ensure that when a PCT was failing to reach
standards in its PNA, a potential provider or other body could
challenge the statement. That sort of scrutiny will help to ensure that
the PNA meets a standard that allows sound decisions to be made on new
applications to provide pharmaceutical services.</div>
<a name="09062477000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the Bill does not guarantee that PNAs will contain reliable and
accurate data. I cite Earl Howe, who said in Grand Committee in the
other
place:</div><a name="09062477000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not know how effectively PCTs will use PNAs, especially given their
record to date of disinvesting in enhanced services such as
out-of-hours opening and local delivery&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 March 2009; Vol. 708, c.
GC477.]</div><a name="09062477000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
been in touch with the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee
and I pay tribute to it for its thoughts on the benefits of being able
to appeal to PCTs should they carry out the PNA negligently.</div>
<a name="09062477000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would not
be appropriate for a negligent PNA to form the basis of granting
applications, and I am concerned that, regardless of the PNA standard,
it will still be used as the unequivocal method of determining
applications. The National Pharmacy Association
said:</div><a name="09062477000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should be understood that if a PNA identifies an unmet need, then there
is an obligation on PCTs, under normal circumstances, to secure
provision sufficient to meet that
need.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must therefore ensure that PNAs provide a rigorous assessment of needs,
and that they are kept up to scratch so as to avoid applications being
granted on the basis of negligent
assessments.</div><a name="09062477000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
adequacy of a PNA might cause concern to all those affected in cases
when the PCT has been classed as poor by the world class commissioning
assessment. Will the Minister clarify whether a pharmaceutical needs
assessment would still be used as a basis for granting applications if
the PCT that conducted it fell into the category of poor under the WCC
assessment?</div>
<a name="09062477000414"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">As the
Bill stands, there is no mechanism by which applicants can question a
PCT&#146;s assessment, even if it is perceived to be negligent.
Although the regulations prescribe some of the content of the PNA, what
is to stop a PCT from disregarding local needs in order to
prevent a particular service from succeeding in its application? I hope
that the Minister will respond to that
query.</div>
<a name="09062477000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000510"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Allowing appeal rights would be
fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons. I recognise the concerns
of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which has raised
questions, but I shall also tell the Committee of some of my
concerns.</div>
<a name="09062477000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">An appeals
system would lead to endless appeals from dissatisfied and potentially
conflicting local interests. There will always be some who take a
different view, and many of them will find that their commercial or
other interests are affected by an assessment. They will have many
different views on how that assessment might affect them. It is
therefore likely that a multiplicity of concerns would be expressed by
a significant number of individuals and businesses. We do not intend to
create 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>some kind of lawyers&#146; charter where we can
have a massive set of new bureaucracies to try and deal with it. We
need to avoid that. There is always a balance to be struck between
creating new bureaucracy and ensuring that people have the right to
make representations. They can make their representations when the
assessment is carried out. The assessment will take account of
them&#151;or not&#151;and the outcome will be there. Constant
appeals over an assessment, which could go on for years, could get
expensive.</div>
<a name="09062477000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
PCTs would potentially incur huge costs defending their decisions under
appeal. That is never justifiable in terms of NHS funding at the best
of times, and certainly not in the current economic climate.</div>
<a name="09062477000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, as a
consequence, appeal rights could undermine the principle of
pharmaceutical needs assessment as set out in the Bill. This is
supposed to be a clear, robust view from the PCT. It is not supposed to
be the view of others. Lots of people will have different views and
commercial interests of their own, with particular views in terms of
their locality or many other things. This is supposed to be an
assessment carried out by those required to deploy the NHS funding as
to what their priorities are.</div>
<a name="09062477000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
fourth objection. I am not aware of any corresponding appeal rights in
respect of other strategic commissioning documents such as the joint
strategic needs assessment which PCTs carry out. Where there are
concerns about a final pharmaceutical needs assessment or where there
are grounds to believe that the PCT has not complied with the
forthcoming regulations about PNAs, we expect much more straightforward
processes.</div>
<a name="09062477000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
legislation already requires us&#151;under subsection (2)(d) to
proposed new section 128A&#151;to set out in regulations the
circumstances in which a PCT must carry out a new pharmaceutical needs
assessment. How every assessment is determined will be a matter for
those regulations. For example, it would be triggered in prescribed
circumstances such as where a PCT has not complied with the forthcoming
regulations which set out how a PCT is to construct its assessment. It
might also be applied in circumstances where an assessment has resulted
in the PCT making faulty decisions about individual applications which
are then upheld on appeal.</div>
<a name="09062477000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the concerns expressed on this issue and on the capacity and capability
of PCTs in this area. I refer to earlier amendments under this clause
and the comprehensive support programme we are putting in place for
PCTs. We need to continue that work. However, I am not persuaded that
in this case, the appropriate way to proceed is to create an entirely
new and somewhat bureaucratic appeal process. I therefore ask the hon.
Gentleman to consider whether it is appropriate to withdraw these
amendments.</div>
<a name="09062477000443"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5pm</div><a name="09062477000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000511"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
response, as much to me as it is to the Pharmaceutical Services
Negotiating Committee and others, who I am sure he has had
representations from. In effect, that was the response to the position
that has been put forward.</div>
<a name="09062477000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of
what the Minister said I am not minded to press the point&#151;not
least because I am equally anxious to ensure that we do not introduce
any further levels of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>bureaucracy; he knows I am genuinely concerned about
that. However, at the same time there is the issue about ensuring that
there is not just a simple draconian process which means that some
people&#146;s interests could be cut off rather than pursued. If
there were some perverse experiences over a couple of years,
representations would flow into Government to suggest that there might
be a need for some form of appeal. However, on that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09062477000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09062477000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000512"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 135, in
clause 25, page 28, line 24, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(e) as to
differing assessment criteria for urban and rural
needs.&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is very much linked to the subject matter of our debate on the first
group of amendments under this clause. It should be recognised that
patients in rural areas may have needs that differ from those of
patients living in towns and cities. The amendment seeks to serve that
purpose. The area of a PCT may well span both urban and rural
geographies. There is no guarantee that it will take into account both
areas. We need to ensure that a PCT&#146;s PNA acknowledges the
potential requirement for different services among different
populations.</div><a name="09062477000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I discussed under the earlier group of amendments, patients in the
country make extensive use of dispensing doctors, as do the elderly,
who appreciate the convenience of being able to combine the collection
of medicines and their visit to the doctor without the burden of an
extra trip to the pharmacy. The Minister identified precisely that
service on behalf of some of his
constituents.</div><a name="09062477000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must express an interest in the issue, as 24 per cent. of
England&#146;s dispensing practices are in Western Cheshire
PCT&#151;the main PCT of my constituency&#151;and a further 13 per
cent. are in Central and Eastern Cheshire PCT, the other one that
serves my constituents. Cheshire GP Dr. Nigel
O&#146;Callaghan&#151;himself a dispensing doctor&#151;recently
outlined the crux of the matter on the Chemist and Druggist website by
saying:</div><a name="09062477000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Why
not let patients vote with their feet and choose between GPs and
Chemists?&#148;</div><a name="09062477000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Dispensing Doctors Association similarly observed in its meeting with
me that patient choice was at risk of being restricted if appropriate
safeguards were not put in place to maintain a variety of
services.</div><a name="09062477000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
not seen the regulations for PNAs, I can only judge the assessments on
their track record to date, which, as I have already discussed, is poor
in places and far from consistent. It is a worry that once again, the
Government may be jeopardising patient choice in rural areas by not
ensuring in primary legislation that PNAs cover a breadth of services,
of views, including those of patients, and of patient choice. We
support PNAs, but they must not limit choice as that defies their
objective. I therefore hope that the Minister is able to guarantee that
the PNAs will provide for rural and urban populations in their
PCTs.</div><a name="09062477000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000513"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> There are many different criteria by which
assessments will need to be made. The first is, of course, the
rural-urban one, but &#147;urban&#148; is not a single
category&#151;it deploys many different kinds of urban areas. There
are inner cities and suburban areas. There are
different ways in which categorisation can take place. Remember that
the criteria of choice and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>access are different. The hon. Gentleman seems to
propose that we should, in some way, create a two-tier assessment
system, which discriminates in the criteria to be adopted between rural
and non-rural areas. I do not think that that is the right approach to
take.</div>
<a name="09062477000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further,
regulating to differentiate between the criteria to be adopted risks
imposing on PCTs criteria that may not match their assessment of the
needs locally&#151;or worse, risks omitting criteria that are crucial
to PCTs locally, of which we know nothing at the centre. In our view,
PCTs are better able to differentiate for themselves the mix of cities,
smaller towns, villages and remote rural areas, and are better able to
locally reflect the way in which they feel it is appropriate to do the
assessment, rather than seeking to impose&#151;as the Opposition now
seek to do&#151;central top-down criteria, by which they tell PCTs
what to do. Let the PCTs get on with it and do it themselves. Do not
apply this bureaucratic centralisation on them. I say to the hon.
Gentleman that I think it is time he withdrew the bureaucratic and
unnecessary
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000514"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I think we have reached a point in this
Committee where just because the Minister says it, it does not mean
that it is. On this particular issue, I do not think that it invokes a
high degree of bureaucracy in quite the way he seeks to tease. The main
point is to emphasise the need to make an assessment that takes fully
into account the difference between rural and urban. I accept that to
some degree there is difficulty with the rather all-embracing word
&#147;urban&#148;, which can include not only suburban, but even
associated villages with an urban centre. I think of the villages that
immediately surround Chester; they are only as far from the main part
of the outer edges of Chester-urban as they are from the next village,
which under the current criteria, is counted in the rural
area.</div><a name="09062477000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
such matters lay at the heart of a dispute that was eventually happily
resolved, but not until a long and tense campaign had been fought to
get the local PCT to recognise the value of a dispensing doctor in the
rural area. That doctor was funding a satellite operation in a village
close to the edge of where a village would be regarded as being
connected with an urban, not rural, environment. As a sign of our
earnest approach to the matter and to make sure that we put it on the
record how important we consider such matters to be, I wish to press
the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="09062477000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is something to which we shall necessarily have to return for
reassurances, but I drafted the amendment to gain a guarantee from the
Minister that pharmaceutical needs assessments will apply to rural and
urban populations. Even given his qualification about the imperfection
of the word &#147;urban&#148;, it is a useful point by which to
demonstrate the determination on the part of the Committee not to let
that little aspect of the Bill rest and to show that it has large
consequences for many of our constituents, not least those who live in
combined rural, urban and semi-urban
areas.</div><a name="09062477000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000528"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 175, in

&#145;pharmaceutical&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000183"></a>

clause 26, page 28, line 37, after

&#145;pharmaceutical&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000530"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> After the excitement of a Division in which so
many of my hopes were dashed by the votes cast, by way of introduction
clause 26 changes how applicants seeking to provide pharmaceutical
services gain entry to a PCT&#146;s pharmaceutical list. The Bill
proposes that local PCTs should use their pharmaceutical needs
assessment to determine entrance to the list. Before this legislation
the Government operated a &#147;control of entry&#148; policy
whereby the number of pharmaceutical services was determined
centrally.</div><a name="09062477000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
175 and 176, grouped together, may appear to the naked eye to be a
technicality, but they raise the pertinent question of whether a PCT
can grant applications to provide services from privately arranged
services or aspirational services that the PCT is not in a position to
commission. &#147;Services&#148; does not exclude those categories
of applicants and there is a danger that, if they can prove that they
meet some or all of the needs included in the PNA, the PCT will be
duty-bound to grant the
application.</div><a name="09062477000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the regulations for PNAs will set out the minimum information that must
be included in the needs assessment, there will be no statutory limit
on the inclusion of other matters. If a PCT&#146;s needs assessment
referred to matters other than pharmaceutical services, and an
applicant undertook to provide some or all of those other services, the
PCT could be forced to grant the application. While there exists a
clear definition of &#147;pharmaceutical services&#148; in the
National Health Service Act 2006, there is no such definition for
&#147;services&#148;. Clause 126(8)
states:</div><a name="09062477000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
services provided under this section are, together with additional
pharmaceutical services provided in accordance with a direction under
section 127, referred to in this Act as &#145;pharmaceutical
services&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the maintenance of a list is part of the arrangements for the provision
of pharmaceutical services, the PCT should be required to grant the
applications only if the services that the applicant is undertaking to
provide, and that are included in the needs assessment, are
&#147;pharmaceutical
services&#148;.</div><a name="09062477000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not to say that pharmaceutical services cannot apply to the list
with a view to providing extra services, such as the smoking cessation
clinics and extended 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>hours options mentioned in the explanatory notes. We are keen for the
role of pharmacies to be expanded, so that the public can benefit more
extensively from the skills of our pharmacists across the country. In
fact, the Pharmaceutical Services (Advanced and Enhanced Services)
(England) Directions 2005 define &#147;pharmaceutical
services&#148; as covering the medicines use review
service&#151;our advanced service&#151;and the locally commissioned
enhanced services, which would include smoking cessation services, the
supplementary prescriber service and the prescriber support
service.</div><a name="09062477000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has helpfully provided
some examples of how PNAs could have an unintended effect on local
services. I shall briefly touch upon one of those
illustrations&#151;I dare say that the Minister has also had the
benefit of what the PSNC has provided to the Committee and to the
Department.</div><a name="09062477000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are many excellent private services used by the public, such as the
Lloyds pharmacy service, which caters for men attending football
matches. It enables a hard-to-reach group to gain access to health-care
and lifestyle advice&#151;interestingly, the topic was raised in
Health questions this afternoon. However, if the PCT inadvertently said
that it would aspire to provide such a service in its area when a
service specification is prepared and the funding is available, then an
applicant might apply and offer to provide that as a private service.
Since it is mentioned in the PNA as a gap in provision, the PCT may,
under sections 129(2)(c) and 129(2A) be duty-bound to grant the
application. The service is granted by the PCT but out of its control,
as there may not exist an NHS service specification for the service. It
can neither halt the service nor control its
quality.</div><a name="09062477000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
other example may help. A home help service may be commissioned locally
but it is commissioned by social care and not by the PCT. If the PCT
stated in its PNA that a high proportion of people in its area are
housebound and that those people may have difficulty in accessing
pharmacies, that could raise concerns about the extent to which social
services commission home help. A new applicant could then apply to
provide such a service, citing the PNA as evidence of the local need.
The PCT could again be obliged to grant the application under section
129(2)(a) and (c) of the National Health Service Act 2006, even though
it is not in a position to commission the service and despite the fact
that it has no control over that part of the service.</div>
<a name="09062477000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
betrays the need for clear guidance in regulations concerning the
content of the PNAs. I hope that the Minister is considering these
issues as he drafts the regulations. By limiting the services whose
applications can be granted through PNAs to those services that seek to
provide essential services, advanced services and enhanced services
that are lacking in an area, we can avoid situations of the sort that I
have
outlined.</div><a name="09062477000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
demonstrate the range of services that would be provided under these
terms, all of the following services come under the category of
pharmaceutical services in the 2006 Act: care home services,
out-of-hours services, medication review services, schools services,
and screening. That list is in no way exhaustive.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div><a name="09062477000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Minister will acknowledge that the PNAs should be driven by
the need to provide a service that is formally absent and that, as the
Bill is drafted, there is too much wriggle room for PNAs to be
exploited.</div><a name="09062477000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000531"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The amendments appear to be fairly
straightforward and they look innocuous. However, by insertion of the
word &#147;pharmaceutical&#148; they would limit artificially the
ability of PCTs to carry out the duties that we want them to carry
out.</div><a name="09062477000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
26 replaces the current provisions in the 2006 Act that
govern whether or not an applicant can provide NHS pharmaceutical
services. For the last 20 years or so, that has been determined by the
regulatory system known as &#147;control of entry&#148;. An
application will succeed only if a PCT considers it necessary or
expedient to grant it, in order to secure adequate provision of NHS
drugs services locally. Over the years, that test has been subject to
considerable review by the
courts.</div><a name="09062477000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#147;control of entry&#148; provisions are set out in section 129
of the 2006 Act. Clause 26 of the Bill amends that section to enable
PCTs to determine whether a new prospective provider will be admitted
to a PCT&#146;s drug list or an existing listing would be amended, by
reference to or determined against its PNA.</div>
<a name="09062477000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition
Members argue that these amendments would clarify the working of that
particular provision. I understand that they have the support of the
Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, as they have indicated.
However, although the amendments appear to be sensible, the new powers
will only ever be exercised in relation to an assessment of
pharmaceutical needs and the services that are then offered.</div>
<a name="09062477000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
persuaded that we need to say how the new powers will work in practice.
The primary intention of the clause is that the applications will be
determined by reference to pharmaceutical services and not by reference
to some other services. We have already established in our debate on
clause 25 that PCTs will be required to assess needs for particular
pharmaceutical services in their area. The provisions in clause 26 are
directly related back to clause 25, so in our view it will not be
possible for a PCT to determine an application under clause 26 unless
the services provided are pharmaceutical services, as defined under the
2006 Act.</div>
<a name="09062477000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might add
that the current wording in the 2006 Act, which the new subsection
replaces, makes no mention of the word &#147;pharmaceutical&#148;,
nor has the absence of that word caused problems for the courts in
determining the regulations that flow from these powers. Therefore, I
see no advantage in inserting words that the courts will have to
assess, to see whether they have a meaning that goes beyond the court
cases that have already examined this issue and lay out a very clear
set of criteria that need to be applied. In other words, all that the
amendments would succeed in doing is muddying the water for the courts.
As a result, they would muddy the water for pharmaceutical services and
ensure that the NHS has to go through a series of new court cases to
determine exactly what these new words mean, because, in the view of
any court, they would not have been inserted unless they were meant to
bring about a
change.</div><a name="09062477000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000532"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The Minister makes a powerful point. The
courts would, through statutory interpretation of rules, inevitably
regard inserting a word as having a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>genuine intent, and therefore intended consequences. I fully appreciate
that argument. To some degree it is helpful that the Minister has put
on the record that the provision ties back to clause 25.</div>
<a name="09062477000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said,
the PSNC has clearly demonstrated concerns, and the Minister will have
been briefed about them as well. I know that he has sought to address
them. Having researched the matter, it is interesting to note, even
without the addition of the word &#147;pharmaceutical&#148;, the
breadth of services that are established by law in the phrase in the
Bill. That is accepted. As the Minister rightly says, there is a wide
amount of case law and interpretative law&#151;that is the nearest we
get in this country to administrative law, which would be more familiar
to those who practise law on the continent&#151;so effectively, there
has been an interpretation already, so I buy the Minister&#146;s
argument.</div><a name="09062477000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the intention of the amendment is by no means to muddy the waters. That
would not be helpful in any circumstances. Equally, it would be wrong
to press the amendment to a Division, given that I suspect this
exchange will be re-examined by the PSNC. If it wants to make any
further points, I am sure that we will be briefed in advance of Report.
Rather than press the amendment to a Division, I leave open the option
to raise any issues that the PSNC feels have not been dealt with
satisfactorily on Report, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09062477000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000533"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 147, in
clause 26, page 29, line 5, after
&#145;application&#146;, insert</div>
<div class="hs_brev">&#145;including a duty for Primary Care Trusts to consult
patients on the decision to grant the
application&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
admire your ability to sound as though you enthusiastically welcome the
arrival of amendment 147, Mr.
Key.</div>
<a name="09062477000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000534"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do indeed, Mr.
O&#146;Brien.</div>
<a name="09062477000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000535"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> That gave me a chance to find the right
page.</div>
<a name="09062477000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased
to say that I need not spend too long speaking to this amendment. I am
simply reiterating the case I made when speaking to amendments 33, 35
and 34 in relation to clause 25, when I outlined the need for patient
consultation in PNAs. I am merely seeking an assurance from the
Minister that the manner in which the PCT determines whether to grant
an application to the pharmaceutical list will, under regulations, take
account of the views of patients. Will the Minister confirm that the
regulations on local decisions concerning applications will contain
provision for patient consultation?</div>
<a name="09062477000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that I do not need to reiterate in full the reasons why patient
consultation is necessary. To summarise, I can put them into three
brief points. First, PNAs should be for the benefit of patients and not
focused on cost-effectiveness. Patient consultation will ensure that
PCTs acknowledge the reason for the PNA.</div>
<a name="09062477000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
patients are often best placed to identify local needs for services and
can offer valuable insights into the services that work and those that
do not. Perhaps this is a good point at which to raise demographics.
When there is an ageing population in an area,
mobility  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>could be a pertinent issue, even if the area is not rural. Right hon.
and hon. Members on both sides of the House have such demographics in
their constituencies and have raised those issues.</div>
<a name="09062477000415"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Thirdly,
consultation will help to safeguard services that are used and
preferred by patients, so PCTs will be less inclined to cut popular
services.</div>
<a name="09062477000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000536"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Under the 2005 NHS pharmacy regulations,
patient and other local community interest groups are already notified
of applications and have the right to make representations to the PCT.
I have no plans to change those rules. They ought to have been
consulted
already.</div><a name="09062477000445"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09062477000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000537"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b><b class="B"> </b>Such a brief reply makes me think
that perhaps I need to be slightly cautious before I roll over humbly
yet again. We need to bear in mind what we truly mean by the word
&#147;consultation&#148;. Allow me to explain as best I can: in a
previous life, I had to tackle the European works councils. The
right to consultation in the United Kingdom applied only to those with
operations right across European Community member states, which the
company that I partly ran had. Interestingly, in every language other
than English, and by almost every worker representative, whatever
European country they came from, consultation was regarded as a right
to attend a forum for an exchange of views&#151;after which they
could take the wife for a jolly good jolly in some beautiful part of
Europe. However, they absolutely respected management&#146;s right to
make the final decisions.</div>
<a name="09062477000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only those
who represented people in this country were not satisfied with that. To
them, consultation meant the need to identify their influence in a
decision and the final output. They wanted to know that they had made a
difference and that the initial management proposals were amended
accordingly. The way in which consultation is used is quite
interesting. If we are following the continental European model, the
Minister&#146;s answer was perfectly satisfactory, but if we are
using the definition traditional in this country, it was probably less
than satisfactory. On this occasion, I shall assume that he was being a
good European and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09062477000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000538"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Now we come to the one that we have been waiting
for&#151;amendment
36.</div><a name="09062477000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000539"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am very pleased that you,
Mr. Key, have been waiting for it. I did not have quite that
much enthusiasm&#151;but now I do!</div>
<a name="09062477000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I beg to move
amendment 36, in clause 26, page 29, line 5, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa)
the terms by which an applicant to the pharmaceutical list is deemed to
be compliant with the adoption of a computer system accredited with the
Electronic Prescription
Service.&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to probe the Government about measures taken to ensure that
pharmaceutical services granted under the PNAs are compliant with the
electronic prescription service. The Minister will be aware that I have
become, contrary to my normal inclination, something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>of an anorak when it comes to IT and anything relating to electronic
aspects of the NHS. Before I turn to the amendment, allow me briefly to
inform Committee members unfamiliar with the EPS of the background to
the initiative&#151;it is really very significant.</div>
<a name="09062477000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">GPs were
producing electronic prescriptions in primary care years before the
Government launched their EPS. Primary care systems even had the
capacity to pick up prescribing errors and report them to staff.
Currently, GPs enter the prescription into the patient&#146;s
electronic medical record, when an alert will notify them of any
prescribing errors. The prescription is then printed on paper and taken
to the pharmacy by the patient. The EPS will make this transfer to the
pharmacy electronic, which will bring about administrative, but not
clinical&#151;that point needs emphasising&#151;benefits to the
NHS. Why, then, is it so long overdue? If the software that it intends
to provide offers a relatively simple functionality, I simply do not
understand why it is not being delivered to
schedule.</div><a name="09062477000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
23 March 2009, EPS was being used for only 24 per cent. of
daily prescription messages, with only 6,440 GP practices actively
using the service. Furthermore, since only Release 1 has been
implemented, the prescriptions require a paper version to be issued,
thus completely undermining the purpose of the system and the intended
administrative benefits. That is not to mention the fact that the EPS
is part of the national programme for IT, which is four years behind
schedule and destined to exceed its &#163;12 billion budget. The
Minister will be aware of the context to all this. If the Government
could not be relied upon to implement the EPS on time, a big question
remains about their record, intent and competence in implementing the
rest of the national IT programme.</div>
<a name="09062477000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a case
not just of delayed results, but of wrongly allocated resources. It is
difficult to see what direct clinical benefit to patient care the EPS
will bring to primary care, as it performs only an administrative
function. My amendment would help to abate some of the delays facing
the EPS, should the Government push ahead with the completion of the
programme. I want to raise through it the pertinent issue of EPS
compatibility as a factor for the pharmaceutical needs assessment to
consider. In order to deliver the functionality proposed under the EPS,
GP and pharmacy systems have to undergo accreditation to ensure that
they are compatible. If the PNA considered the compatibility of
pharmaceutical systems before applications to provide services were
granted, it could save time and money spent on upgrading incompatible
systems to comply with the
EPS.</div><a name="09062477000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Minister will concede that, if PNAs do not take into account
EPS compatibility, more money could be wasted on making pharmacy
systems compliant. Presently, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a
PCT from granting applications from services that do not have the
capacity to link up to the EPS. One might regard that as
obvious&#151;and the failure to do so as patently
crass.</div><a name="09062477000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
PCTs are given the appropriate tools to assess whether a pharmaceutical
service could comply with the EPS, the regulations for the PNAs could
include EPS compatibility as a condition for granting an application. I
know the Minister has become slightly fond of this response during our
exchanges, but I hope he realises 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>that the intention is to get a net gain from
bureaucracy, and above all to ensure a sense that the
centre&#151;top-down, if he wants to throw that point at me
again&#151;can help facilitate best practice. However, responsibility
and implementation is situated locally, and in the procuring and
commissioning
process.</div><a name="09062477000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
approach would no doubt speed up the roll-out of the EPS programme at
the pharmacy end&#151;I would be first to cheer that&#151;as it
would incentivise applicants to adopt a compliant computer system
before applying to provide a service. Is the Minister willing to
consider that option? I hope so, and that on this occasion he will
accept the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000540"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
raising this issue in such detail. The EPS system would mean that PCTs
need to be satisfied that an application is EPS-compliant when
considering whether it would be granted on the basis that it secures
improvements or provides better access to pharmaceutical
services&#151;at least, that is the intention of the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09062477000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
accept that the amendment would be helpful or particularly improve the
available services. Let me take a few moments to explain the background
information to the EPS. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the
points he has made, but to use the EPS, pharmacy contractors must have
IT systems that have gone through Connecting for Health&#146;s
rigorous assurance process. Connecting for Health leads on the delivery
of the national programme for IT, and its assurance process is made up
of a number of key stages, including clinical safety testing and
initial implementation in limited numbers of GP and pharmacy sites.
Patient safety is obviously paramount. We do not want suppliers to cut
corners in order to reach the start of the assurance process faster,
only to lose time in the longer term as they fail to meet Connecting
for Health&#146;s exacting standards.</div>
<a name="09062477000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authority to
deploy Release 1 and Release 2 of the EPS is given separately. While
much progress has been made on deploying across the country Release 1
of the EPS, which releases technical infrastructure, I know that
Release 2 will be of greater interest as it brings a number of
functional changes and associated benefits for patients, prescribers
and dispensers. Those include the option for patients to select or
nominate a dispenser for their electronic prescription to be sent to
their chemist and electronic repeat dispensing produced.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Just a moment&#151;let me run
through some of the benefits.</div>
<a name="09062477000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are the
benefits of Release 2 for patients? The first benefit is a more
convenient service, with a reduction in trips to the GP practice just
to collect a paper prescription&#151;a point particularly relevant to
patients on repeat medication. Some 70 per cent. of prescriptions
nationally are issued for repeat medication. The second benefit is
greater freedom of choice, making it simpler for patients to use a
pharmacist convenient to them. The third benefit is potentially
reducing pharmacy waiting times, as, with a phone call, prescriptions
can be prepared in advance of a patient arriving. In effect, the
information is already there, and they do not have to wait for the
piece of paper.</div>
<a name="09062477000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, what
are the benefits for GPs and pharmacies? First, there will be a
reduction in the work load in GPs&#146; practices generated by
patients collecting individual prescriptions from surgeries,
particularly repeat 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>prescriptions. Secondly, the ability to sign
prescriptions electronically is much more efficient for GPs. Thirdly,
GPs will be able to cancel prescriptions electronically at any point
until they are dispensed, leading to greater confidence in GPs to use
repeat dispensing. Fourthly, there will be a reduction in the need for
pharmacy staff to re-key prescription information into pharmacy
systems, which is quite a problem in bureaucracy terms&#151;I had to
get that point in. In time, this will remove the need for pharmacy
staff to collect prescriptions where they offer a prescription
collection service. Those developments provide significant
benefits.</div><a name="09062477000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000541"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I appreciate the list of benefits, but
what is interesting in the Minister&#146;s answer so far is that he
accepts that we have only managed to get to Release 1 implementation at
this stage, and he was relying on where we will get to with Release 2.
That said, if Release 2 delivers to that degree and soon, that is a
partial answer. Given the track record to date of the progress of the
programme&#146;s delivery and implementation, particularly Release 2,
the Minister might at least want to think about&#151;this could be a
compromise&#151;postponing implementation of this element until after
Release 2 has taken place and proven
itself.</div><a name="09062477000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000542"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b><b class="B"> </b>Much progress has been made on
delivering Release 1 against the background of competing priorities for
IT systems suppliers. EPS Release 1 deployment is virtually complete.
All GP and pharmacy suppliers have completed the compliance process.
The cumulative prescription volume is 207,195,907 as of 11
June&#151;a relatively up-to-date figure. Some 95 per cent. of GP
services are technically enabled to deploy the EPS, and 80 per cent. of
GP practices are business-enabled. Some 92 per cent. of community
pharmacies are technically enabled to deploy the EPS, and 82 per cent.
are
business-enabled.</div><a name="09062477000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Release 2, all central components have been delivered. There are eight
pharmacy systems suppliers delivering nine pharmacy systems for
community pharmacies in England. Currently, seven pharmacy systems
suppliers are developing EPS Release 2 systems. Initial implementation
commissioning is under way at a GP and independent pharmacy, using
synthetic patients to conduct technical and clinical assurance
activities. We expect nearly all suppliers to have full roll-out
approval by the end of 2009, according to the information given to us
by systems suppliers.</div>
<a name="09062477000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite a lot
of progress has therefore been made on Release 2, and we need to
continue to monitor it with great care. We know that deploying any
computer system has its problems. Over the years, Governments of all
persuasions have found that computer systems can cause difficulties.
That is also the case in the private sector where large-scale computer
projects have been introduced. However, with careful monitoring they
can also bring enormous dividends and benefits to
users.</div><a name="09062477000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not feel that the amendment would contribute significantly to
delivery leverage for EPS. EPS is an essential component of a modern
pharmacy service, and we intend that it should be provided by all NHS
community pharmacies. EPS is on everyone&#146;s agenda&#151;it is
not just an issue for applicants to pharmaceutical lists. We do not
agree with the amendment because a successful applicant to a
pharmaceutical list currently has up to 15 months to open. In that
time, the parameters 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>for EPS compliance may change, so a PCT&#146;s compliance assessment
at the time of application may be out of date or irrelevant by the time
the pharmacy opens.</div>
<a name="09062477000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we find in
future that IT systems are compliant with Release 2 of the EPS but
pharmacies are still not delivering the service, we have scope in
clause 26 to make provision as to what matters the PCT must or must not
take into account for the purpose of determining whether to grant the
application. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing
his
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000446"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000543"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for seeking
to address my point. I hope he realises that I raised it in a genuine
attempt to be constructive. In resisting the amendment, he prayed in
aid the 15-month time period between when the choice is effectively
made and implementation. He also prayed in aid the fact that due to the
nature of technology, the programming, the system and the compatibility
could change during that period.</div>
<a name="09062477000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is one
area where we must be extraordinarily cautious. To the extent that I
have found myself dragged, somewhat reluctantly, towards the NHS IT
programme, I understand that one will never catch up with the leading
edge of technology. One must set a point at which one is trying to
achieve a certain standard and say, &#147;That&#146;s the standard
to be met,&#148; and not always worry about things such as the
15-month period. The Minister is absolutely right: the technology may
well move forward. The issue is compatibility with a standard that will
work to deliver the
service.</div><a name="09062477000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not press the amendment, because I think that the issue requires
continuous careful and vigilant monitoring, as the Minister accepted.
We need to watch it carefully, as there are fantastic benefits to be
gained&#151;he sought to highlight some&#151;but it could easily
trip on the basis that implementation is flawed or time-lagged and
there is a lack of capacity for, let alone understanding of, the
standards to be applied to achieve compatibility. Although the
amendment is the sort that one might want to press to a vote in a
somewhat virile way, to demonstrate that one means it, on this occasion
I will withdraw it. However, we need to highlight the issue and ensure
that the Minister, the Department and the Minister&#146;s advisers
keep it as a high priority in order to make it work. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000544"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 37, in
clause 26, page 29, line 8, at
end insert</div> <a name="09062493000002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;including
the impact that granting an application would have on existing
services.&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am delighted that somebody, in a sedentary position, regards it as a
signal victory to have reached amendment 37.</div>
<a name="09062477000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I intend to
consolidate some of the issues that have been raised so far. We have
discussed the need to consult patients and highlighted the potential
impact of the pharmaceutical needs assessment on the services that
dispensing doctors offer patients. We have also discussed the different
needs of rural and urban populations&#151;however one wants to
describe them&#151;and I have sought to ensure that the Minister
takes all those matters into account in setting regulations for the
PCTs.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div><a name="09062477000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
respects, amendment 37 would solve the problems raised by the
Dispensing Doctors&#146; Association with regard to offering patients
a choice of services. If PCTs were duty-bound to assess what impact
granting an application to the pharmacy list would have on existing
services, they would have to ensure that the new service would
complement and enhance existing services, thereby safeguarding patient
choice and potential patient preference for existing services,
such as those of dispensing doctors, be they in the Minister&#146;s
PCT or my own. Hopefully, the PCT would then avoid cutting services
unnecessarily or granting applications to provide services that do not
add to patient choice or increase patient access to pharmacies or
dispensers. PCTs would, of course, still have the right to cut services
in circumstances where they breached a term of arrangements under new
section 150A of the National Health Service Act
2006.</div><a name="09062477000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is simple. I hope that the Minister&#146;s thoughts will
turn towards accepting this worthwhile amendment to the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09062477000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000545"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The amendment aims to oblige PCTs to
consider the impact that granting an application would have on existing
services. I can see the importance of doing so, but it is also a key
concern that the new arrangements for determining entry to a
pharmaceutical list should not be used simply as a basis for PCTs to
refuse all or any new applications without some clear, robust and
objective ground. Just as we saw when the matter was raised in the
other place, I am concerned that the consequence of the amendment would
be unwittingly to restrict new entries, so it would constrain
competition and could undermine new businesses&#146; ability to enter
the field. The hon. Gentleman looks quizzical, but if he looks at this
he will see that it could well be the consequence.</div>
<a name="09062477000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each and
every application will have some impact and effect on contractors; that
is unavoidable, but how much is a question of degree based on local
factors and circumstances. It is impossible for us, from the centre, to
understand the exact impact in every case. We must strive to achieve
the right balance between adequate PCT controls and the freedom of
contractors to operate without creating disproportionate burdens or
costs. When we consulted on this proposal last autumn, we recognised
the need to strike that balance. We proposed to use existing factors
introduced in the 2005 regulations to the current control of entry
tests. These factors are the level of access, the choice and diversity
of providers, innovation in service delivery, the services available to
specific populations to meet specific health conditions or disease
needs and the overall longer-term impact of approving new
applications.</div>
<a name="09062477000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to
include the criterion of longer-term impact that this amendment
proposes in the new regulatory regime. We have not determined that this
criterion should have pre-eminence above all other criteria. It is one
of a range of factors that PCTs need to consider when determining
whether, against its assessment of local needs, an application should
be approved or not. PCTs will have to weigh up the facts, look at the
evidence carefully and determine the plus and minus points accordingly
before reaching their decision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div><a name="09062477000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also make
the observation on the amendment that I think it is equally important
that PCTs should consider the longer-term impact when they are minded
to refuse an application, not just when they are minded to grant one.
Refusing an application may have implications for other businesses and
competition in the area. My concern is that the result of this
amendment would be to restrict competition, to inhibit business, to
prevent new entry of businesses into this area and, in effect, to
restrain the market in a way that I did not think the Conservative
party believed in. It seems that, in response to lobbying, it is
disposed to do that unless the hon. Gentleman decides, as I hope he
will, that he will not press this amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="09062477000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000546"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> We do not favour any kind of
protectionist approach. When the Minister suggested that I might be
quizzical&#151;I was not quite sure who he was indicating as I had my
head down&#151;I was writing a
note.</div><a name="09062477000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000547"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I think he was looking at me, but I was
yawning.</div><a name="09062477000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000548"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I shall move on swiftly. The Minister has
over-egged his case. If one looks carefully at the wording of this
amendment, it says that, where primary care trusts have determined to
make any kind of recommendation, the regulations may make provision for
the manner in which they determine that grant and matters that the
primary care trust must and must not take into account for the purposes
of determining whether to grant the application, including the effect
that granting such an application would have on existing services. Far
from restraining competition or inhibiting new business, the fact that
they would have to acknowledge that they have taken into account the
effect that granting such an application would have on existing
businesses might result in their granting an application because it
increased competition. They might be concerned that a particular area
had no competition, and consider that granting the application would
ensure that an efficient service was delivered, prices were kept keen
and customers would receive first-class customer services.</div>
<a name="09062477000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has overplayed his hand, as he has exaggerated what the amendment
actually states. It makes explicit what is set out and is referred to
in the justification by a primary care trust. A trust must ensure that
it has taken into account the effect that granting an application would
have on existing services. To be frank, in light of cases that have
arisen in my constituency and I dare say in others, the problems have
arisen precisely when it appears that there has been no explicit
justification to make a recommendation without reference to the effect
that it might have on existing services&#151;not that it would
inhibit new business or restrain
competition.</div>
<a name="09062477000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000549"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I do not disagree with the point that the
hon. Gentleman has just made. When PCTs make these decisions, it is
important that they weigh appropriately the impact that a decision will
have on local services, and that means the impact on other pharmacies
in the area. He may well be right that, in some cases, PCTs have failed
to give the appropriate weight to that criterion when they make a
decision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div><a name="09062477000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000550"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, because
our dialogue has brought us back to where we need to be. We want to
ensure that that consideration is made explicit and that we do not end
up having unnecessary concerns, disputes or even campaigns locally
because there has not been a sufficiently explicit
explanation of what lies behind the thinking of a PCT and its
recommendations.</div>
<a name="09062477000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, I do not need to press the issue to a vote. However, it was very
important to have clarity in terms of what the amendment was intended
to say and, given the way that the Minister provided the
counter-argument, I also wanted to make sure that the record was
absolutely straight.</div>

we have now reached clause 28, which is on the second page of the
second list of grouped amendments and not on today&#146;s list of
grouped amendments. Amendments 133 and 134 would place a duty on PCTs
to consult the regulatory and professional bodies for pharmacists in
England, in relation to clause 28, and in Wales, in relation to clause
31. They seek to probe the Government about where the power to suspend
pay should lie.</div>
<a name="09062477000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earl Howe
raised the issue of a PCT&#146;s powers of intervention in matters
concerning pharmacists&#146; professional conduct in the other place.
However, he did so with regard to another clause in the Bill. I want to
address some of the issues that he commented on with respect to clause
28, as I question whether it is appropriate for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>PCT to suspend the pay of a pharmaceutical service. The power to suspend
pay could be detrimental to patient care if it is not strictly
controlled. If the payment of pharmaceutical services is suspended,
those services could deteriorate rapidly and that could severely hamper
services to patients. As the National Pharmacy Association put
it:</div>
<a name="09062477000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pharmacies&#146;
day-to-day financial outlay cannot usually be deferred, so withholding
payment would have an immediate and dramatic effect on cash flow and
the consequent ability to provide core
services.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must ensure that the measure is used as a last resort and that the
power to suspend pay is not exploited in inappropriate circumstances.
What assurances can the Minister give that the use of this power will
not have a detrimental effect on local
services?</div><a name="09062477000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
reason that I tabled my amendment is that PCTs may not understand the
nuances of the pharmaceutical sector and therefore may not be in a
position to make a judgment as to whether they have breached the
arrangements for service delivery. However, I believe that the
principle behind clause 28 is right. I merely wish to query whether the
decision to suspend pay should be a collaborative one rather than one
that is made solely by the PCT.</div>
<a name="09062477000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister can specify in his response the measures that he will
put in place to prevent PCTs from abusing the power to suspend pay. If
a PCT has commissioned a pharmaceutical service, it is perversely in
its interest to suspend pay while still reaping the benefits of that
service. In extreme circumstances, the system could be abused to bring
about cost savings. An arbiter in the form of a pharmaceutical
regulatory body could prevent such a situation from arising and ensure
that the case of the accused pharmaceutical service is sufficiently
represented.</div>
<a name="09062477000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">To quote Earl
Howe:</div><a name="09062477000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
natural question that arises is who regulates pharmacists. Is it PCTs
or is it the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain? If it is in
effect both, which body takes
precedence?&#148;</div><a name="09062477000447"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

I should like to make it clear that we see the use of the powers as a
matter of last resort, not of first resort. They will be part of a
progressive series of steps to ensure that contractors achieve
acceptable quality standards, and PCT decisions will be appealable. The
same provisions are proposed in clause 31 for Welsh
Ministers.</div><a name="09062477000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would place a duty on PCTs in England and on local health
boards in Wales to consult professional and regulatory pharmacist
bodies before deciding whether to withhold NHS contractual payments
that are due to a person when there are continuing concerns about poor
or inadequate performance. I am not convinced as to why that is
necessary. As a general rule, we strive to keep NHS contractual matters
and professional regulatory matters distinct. The amendments would
confuse and integrate the
two.</div><a name="09062477000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reassure the hon. Member for Eddisbury that there is no intention to
penalise individual pharmacists for poor performance. In that respect,
the aim is to look at the practitioner as the person as set out in the
pharmaceutical list. The list is published by the PCT of persons who
are authorised to provide pharmaceutical services by the PCT. In other
words, it is essentially a list of contractors. They may be sole
traders, partners or companies and it is not a list of
individuals.</div>
<a name="09062477000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim is to
ensure that when absolutely necessary, we are able to intervene to deal
with something when it gets to such a poor state that the quality of
provision being made available to local people deteriorates
unacceptably. If we accepted the amendment, it might leave professional
and regulatory bodies rather baffled as to what they would be expected
to do if a PCT consulted them. That is not the remit of those bodies,
nor would they be equipped to take on such a role. They are not really
in a position to take a view on a PCT&#146;s responsibilities. For
that reason, Welsh Ministers and I cannot accept the amendments, and I
ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000558"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Obviously, I listened to the Minister and
he said early in his reply that the powers were last resort powers,
which is important. He also made the point that there was a degree to
which the regulatory bodies would be baffled. Whether or not that is
the case, I made it clear that my amendments were probing and that I
did not intend to press them to a Division. The Minister&#146;s
response went a long way towards clarifying the question of the
demarcation of responsibilities for regulation, and I beg to ask leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000561"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The amendments address my fear that parts
of clause 29 are too loosely worded to merit the circumstances in which
the Government claim that they would apply this legislation. I guess
that all Committee members can follow that we have left pharmaceutical
services in England and moved into chapter 5A, &#147;Notices and
penalties&#148;. Although we have left the part of the Bill that
dealt with them, we are now back to the question of local
pharmaceutical services. I just wanted to make sure that we are all
clear what we are talking about.</div>
<a name="09062477000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
explanatory notes, the Government state that PCTs should be able to
provide their own pharmaceutical services in the case of an emergency
or an exceptional circumstance. The Bill
will</div><a name="09062477000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;remove
the restrictions in NHS legislation on PCTs providing local
pharmaceutical services...or to other PCTs, in certain
circumstances, for example, in the event of any emergency such as a flu
pandemic or where there was no alternative
provider.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is topical as well as important.</div>
<a name="09062477000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The impact
assessment makes a similar statement by noting that PCTs will</div>
<a name="09062477000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
services themselves in an emergency or where there is no suitable
alternative&#148;.</div><a name="09062477000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
state:</div><a name="09062477000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
this stage the Department has not identified a significant impact
arising from these proposals, as the use by PCTs of these new
provisions would be expected to be of limited duration and only in
exceptional circumstances&#148;.</div>
<a name="09062477000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">That admission is at
least a bit surprising, given that we are on the brink of a flu
pandemic that could sweep across the nation at any moment. The
Department obviously had swine flu in mind when drafting the Bill, as
it referred to the flu pandemic in the impact assessment, yet it has
not assessed the provisions&#146; impact in advance of an outbreak,
which is a serious concern. Perhaps the Minister will address that
matter in his
response.</div><a name="09062477000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a case where a PCT decides to provide a local pharmaceutical service, I
understand that the strategic health authority would become the
commissioner in order to prevent a situation from arising in which a
PCT is performing the roles of both commissioner and provider. In
clause 29, the Government amend legislation from the National Health
Service Act 2006 to make provision for such
circumstances.</div><a name="09062477000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concerns with the Government&#146;s amendments to the 2006 Act are
twofold. First, there is an issue of accountability. If PCTs are to
carry out the function only in an emergency, surely the circumstances
in which they are permitted to provide pharmaceutical services should
be prescribed on the face of the Bill; otherwise, there is nothing to
prevent PCTs from providing services on a whim or in normal
circumstances that do not qualify as an emergency.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div><a name="09062477000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
parties will define an emergency? Patently, that is the threshold. My
amendments would allow for that by permitting the Secretary of State to
publish in a series of regulations the circumstances in which a PCT
could provide such a service. The amendments would also place on PCTs a
duty to inform the Secretary of State of their intentions if they
believe that circumstances allow them to provide a
service.</div><a name="09062477000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may argue that at a time of emergency, he does not want
so-called bureaucracy or red tape getting in the way of PCTs becoming
pharmaceutical providers, and I am pretty sympathetic to that. However,
it is only fair to argue that the Government must also make adequate
provision for the times when we are not facing an emergency and prevent
PCTs from providing the services unnecessarily. It seems ludicrous that
under the proposed legislation, a PCT could conduct a PNA, identify a
need and then seek to provide for that need itself, all within the
bounds of the Bill. What is to stop a PCT deliberately identifying a
need it knows that it can satisfy, purely for financial gain? I accept
that that is an extreme form of analysis but it is not implausible,
particularly if there were any real pressure on a PCT and it was
looking to gain from the situation. I accept that we are discussing
extreme circumstances, but as it is our job to point out significant
pitfalls in the Bill, it is right and appropriate that I have raised
such matters, without casting any aspersions on the current management
and composition of boards of any PCT in the land. I hope that I have
given a good explanation of why the amendments have been tabled.
Obviously, the Minister&#146;s reply will be both interesting and
important.</div><a name="09062477000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000562"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Clause 29 amends section 144 and schedule 12
of the National Health Service Act 2006 to enable the Secretary of
State to authorise PCTs to provide local pharmaceutical and drugs
services in certain situations. There is no intention to enable PCTs to
have a long-term role in providing drugs directly. Let me be clear. We
want to enable PCTs to provide services in local situations, such as in
an outbreak of pandemic flu or when there is no suitable alternative
provider. The Bill would enable the strategic health authority or
another PCT to become the commissioning body, in effect, of the
providing PCT. That role and distinction will be
maintained.</div><a name="09062477000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
propose these changes because it is prudent for a PCT to have the power
to act as a service provider. The emergencies that we are describing
are those in cases of a serious pandemic of, say, flu. We are aware
that the current swine flu condition has been described by the World
Health Organisation as a pandemic and that its impact so far on
individuals has appeared in the vast majority of cases to be relatively
mild. A dose of flu is never completely mild, but we must compare it
with some of the strains that we have experienced over the decades. Flu
can happen in waves; it can, in effect, pass through and come back
again. We need to make provision for not only flu, but other
eventualities, so the provision is very much seen as a precautionary
step to enable us to put in place the necessary legal infrastructure,
should the need for it
arise.</div><a name="09062477000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
last thing that we want is to take certain steps to ensure that people
have access to drugs, but not have the legal basis to do so. That would
be wrong. It would be not thinking ahead. There could be circumstances
in which we need to have such a provision, so let us be sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>that it is on the statute book. We can make the
necessary regulations to enable safeguards. Section 175 of the 2006 Act
defines prescribed as being prescribed by regulations made by the
Secretary of State. The provision would not enable the PCT just to make
a decision. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman was stating an extreme
case, but that could not arise because Parliament would have passed a
regulation enabling such powers to be
exercised.</div><a name="09062477000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be limited circumstances. There will be no long-term role as a
provider of pharmacy services for PCTs. Their role will be to ensure
continued provision in emergencies or when there is no suitable
alternative. We envisage the powers being used in emergencies and used
only as a temporary measure until the normal service can be resumed.
Having given those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000448"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000563"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He has
made it absolutely explicit that, in addition to what he describes as
normal safeguards, there is no intent behind the provision for there to
be a long-term role for PCTs to deliver such services. It is important
to recognise that, perhaps in a less extreme example, there could be a
temptation, particularly in the local human-to-human transmission flu
pandemic that we are technically now in. I accept that the Minister was
right to temper that approach by saying that we are now dealing with
relatively mild and short-lived episodes.</div>
<a name="09062477000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, there is a transmission taking place and we have rising numbers.
No doubt the Government are taking advice, just as we do, but according
to all the expertise the likely profile of pandemic flu is one wave,
most probably followed by a larger wave in a second phase, and possibly
even a third phase. Even if no long-term role is intended, in the case
of the current pandemic&#151;not the swine flu epidemic&#151;there
is a danger that we might say, &#147;We had better keep the position
going in case we need it for the second wave,&#148; and therefore
prolong it beyond what would be the normal intent of there being no
long-term role.</div>
<a name="09062477000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It needs to
be recognised that the profile of flu pandemics might make the body
hesitate to get out of making the provision and therefore turn it from
a short to a medium-term role. With that caveat it is clear where the
intent lies. I do not think that the amendment needs to be pressed to a
vote, but it has been useful to ensure there is absolute clarity. Given
the current flu pandemic, it helps to have that in mind when one thinks
about where a true emergency lies in such circumstances, and where
therefore we need to ensure that there is a proper restraint on the
ambitions of those who might want to set up services where they are not
the best people to do so. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

you were testing whether we were awake and paying attention to your
every utterance, I am glad to say we have all passed the test
admirably. One could say that you left out 57 because it is all the

tranche of amendments&#151;a good fistful of amendments&#151;will
be deceptively short in its proposition. It is simply to ask the
Minister why the complaints avenue is limited to adult social care, and
what is the equivalent available to children? That is something that we
spent a huge amount of time on in the Health and Social Care Bill,
which was roundly rejected at the time by one of the Minister&#146;s
predecessors. However, it would be a shame to let the Minister off the
hook too quickly and easily. Therefore, with your permission,
Mr. Key, anticipating that you might wish to suggest that we
do not delay on a clause stand part debate, I might set the context in
which all the amendments can

the measure, although there is little excuse for the two years that it
has taken since the former Health Minister, the hon. Member for Bury,
South (Mr. Lewis) first promised it in 2007. As we have so
often pointed out, it could easily have been part of the Health and
Social Care Act 2008. During the passage of that Act, the right hon.
Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw) denied our amendments to
it,
saying</div><a name="09062477000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;self-funders
can, of course, take their custom elsewhere. They can choose civil

the Government have no qualms about people frail enough to be in
nursing care moving every two weeks, with occasional trips to the
witness box. We were quite angry with the Government for denying us
what was a constructive approach at that time, so we are glad that the
Government have come forward with this measure, albeit in a slightly
face-saving way. Common sense seems to have prevailed at last, and I am
glad that our arguments have won
though.</div><a name="09062477000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
303 of the explanatory notes states:</div>
<a name="09062477000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

raise the complaint with the provider
first&#148;?</div><a name="09062477000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
what basis did the Government make that assumption? We are clearly
legislating for complaints that are unsuitable to be made to the
provider, or that the provider has failed to deal with, so that will
not impact the
baseline.</div><a name="09062477000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a shame that we are debating such matter before the publication of
the Green Paper. I dare say that all members of the Committee witnessed
what I would call a sleight of hand from the Minister today&#151;not
this Minister, I hasten to add, but his colleague, the Minister of
State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Corby (Phil Hope). We
have been calling for the Green Paper on adult social care for many
months and the Government have been promising it for many
months&#151;the former Health Minister, the hon. Member for Bury,
South (Mr. Lewis) promised a new settlement for some years.
We were told that the Green Paper would definitely be out by the
spring, but by every test in the book, spring finishes on either 21
June or 25 June. We had anticipated that it might be published on 29
June. We understood that the Government might not want to affect the
time that the Committee was sitting, but now we are told that it will
be July, so there is yet more slippage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div><a name="09062477000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people
are extremely anxious to see what this Green Paper will contain because
it will set the framework for this debate, which is vital. It would
have been helpful to have had the Green Paper before considering the
Bill, because it may&#151;I think that it should&#151;have major
ramifications for the shape of social care in this country.</div>
<a name="09062477000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Darzi
told peers in another place that the Green Paper would be published in
early 2009,<i class="I"> </i>but as I have just explained, it now looks like
July. I would also caution the Minister on the rhetoric that seems to
have been used in the regulatory impact assessment. The summary states
that this will create a level playing field between privately and
publicly funded users. That is a vital area, which again was discussed
at length during the debates on the Health and Social Care Bill. The
hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who chairs the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, has made a large contribution to the debate
on the distinction between privately and publicly funded users being
diminished to nothing, so that there are equal rights. As all of us
know, it is invidious that two patients can be in neighbouring beds,
one of whom is completely publicly funded while the other is privately
funded. That causes anxiety and issues&#151;often for the relatives
as much as for the patients, but also because of the human rights
issues and who can enforce the legislation.</div>
<a name="09062477000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 24
of the regulatory impact assessment points out that</div>
<a name="09062477000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the policy does
not include private health care.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062477000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">How have the Government
ensured that by opening the door to private funders in social care,
they do not open the door to private funders in health care as well? I
do not for a second underestimate the complexities. We need to keep the
debate on sensible grounds. We started the scrutiny of the Bill
discussing the NHS constitution, which is totally focused on public
provision and the use of public money for NHS services. When looking at
this kind of complaints procedure we absolutely butt up against the
difficulty of a mixed economy of health care, which, whatever its
merits or demerits, exists. We therefore need to make sure that to the
best of our ability is, as we push through any new legislation in this
area, there is real acknowledgement of the need to seek and find equity
in the process.</div>
<a name="09062477000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover, I
remind the Committee that although the Government have closed the
loophole by which publicly funded individuals in private care were not
covered by the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;I alluded to that a second
ago&#151;the individuals we are discussing today, private funders of
private care, are still not covered by the Act. I am not suggesting
that they should be, because of the way the Act works in relation to
public bodies, but it leaves an area uncovered in terms of the
potential for rights and enforcement. I dare say that all of us at
least need to be cognisant of that, even if this is not the right
vehicle to try and address that.</div>
<a name="09062477000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The RIA says
that social care services, unlike health services, have developed under
a funding model under which a sizeable proportion of services pay their
own way&#151;some 300,000, or 35 per cent., according to the RIA. I
asked the Minister whether the passive really is a suitable voice for a
system that the Government have failed to reform, despite many promises
to date. I also question an odd line in paragraph 30 of the RIA, which
states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div><a name="09062477000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we do not
foresee the need to enter into a formal public consultation because the
policy is a ministerial commitment made in
Parliament.&#148;</div><a name="09062477000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will be able to ensure that that position is put
in
context.</div><a name="09062477000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
this stage, the amendments all go to the same point&#151;why do the
provisions cover only adult services, and not children&#146;s care
services? Why is the proposal limited? When will the Green Paper, which
will have ramifications, be published? July is the nearest we can get
to at the moment. Will the Minister inform the Committee of the basis
for the Government&#146;s estimate of numbers? What ramifications may
this have for private health care funders and for all those still not
covered by the Human Rights Act? Do the Government need to consult on
statements made in Parliament and will the Minister credit the
Opposition with holding the Government&#146;s feet to the fire? It
would be rather nice to have that
acknowledgement.</div>
<a name="09062477000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000570"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I am not sure whether my feet feel held to
the fire, or I am just left cold, but I have rarely heard the words in
an RIA described as &#147;rhetoric&#148;. I suspect that Martin
Luther King will not have to feel challenged about that. In answer to
the question of how long the wait will be for the Green
Paper&#151;not long. On private care, it is not our aim to provide a
new system, it is about NHS care and recognising that sometimes it can
be provided by private sector organisations. However, where public
money is involved there should be appropriate safeguards for those
using the service.</div>
<a name="09062477000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
understand the thinking behind the amendments, but I would like to
explain why I do not believe that they are actually necessary. One of
our main objectives in creating the new scheme is to give people who
arrange or fund their own adult social care services, access to
independent consideration of their complaints comparable to that
enjoyed by people with access to local authority adult health services
complaints procedures. We have designed the new scheme so that its
scope is limited to service providers who actually carry out regulated
activity within the meaning of part 1 of the Health and Social Care Act
2008&#151;in other words, adult health services. There are good
reasons for that. There is not only a different system for complaints
about children&#146;s social care services, but a different system of
regulation under separate legislation. I therefore believe that it
makes sense to keep adults&#146; and children&#146;s complaints
processes separate. For many years there have been separate
arrangements for children&#146;s complaints about social care
services under the Children Act 1989. These arrangements are different
in many ways from adult procedures as they reflect the specific needs
of children. I hope that deals with that point.</div>
<a name="09062477000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the need to consult, the policy has already been discussed during the
passage of the 2008 Act and is the subject of ministerial commitment.
In addition, we believe this is an uncontroversial measure that is
widely welcomed and any alternative approaches are not realistic. We
prefer a reference group approach, which can focus on the
practicalities of implementation rather than the issue of whether or
not the policy should be carried through. We seek engagement with the
stakeholders regarding implementation. We need their advice and input
on the way we engage, but the issue is clear. I assume there will be
broad support for the way in which we are giving these additional
rights; indeed, the support is so broad that the Conservative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>Opposition appear to be claiming credit for it. I do
not mind where the credit is taken, provided this Government continue
to deliver for
people.</div><a name="09062477000449"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000571"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> As long as the Minister is not trying to
put a time on that, we can all have our own thoughts as to how long
that may be. As he referred to Martin Luther King, we can all have our
dreams.</div>
<a name="09062477000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000572"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> In your
dreams.</div><a name="09062477000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000573"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The Minister has sought to satisfy us why
this measure has been limited to adult social care. There is a genuine
anxiety that, for whatever reasons and whatever the merits and
demerits, children&#146;s social care and adult social care are
effectively dealt with by two different arms of Government. As with all
such issues, there is both a desire and an anxiety on the part of the
Government and those who scrutinise it, that this above all is an area
that should be joined up. An absence of joined-up thinking in relation
to children is always of grave concern, particularly when so many
social services are produced from the same source within the local
authorities with whom we as hon. Members have to deal. That is
notwithstanding the fact that this has been put under the banner of
children&#146;s services and that the onset shortly of
children&#146;s trusts will be key. Although I cannot see an
immediate solution to breaking down that barrier in the way that
legislation is approached because of departmental responsibilities,
there is a need to recognise that the issue of complaints, particularly
with regard to children, is effectively the same as in the courts.
There one has an advocate appointed by the court or some kind of friend
to enable an approach to be made. I hope the Government will give that
active consideration.</div>
<a name="09062477000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
listened to the Minister I will not press these amendments to a vote,
but it is important to recognise the issue. In seeking to introduce
this series of linked amendments it took me a long time to find
amendment 62 in the documentation as it is right at the back
and had just been linked with this subject. It merited discussion and I
hope some more thinking will take place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000358"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09062477000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 33

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Schedule
5</h4><a name="09062477000013"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Investigation
of complaints about privately arranged or funded adult social
care</div><a name="09062477000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000574"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 104, in
schedule 5, page 53, leave out lines 25 to
35.</div><a name="09062477000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike
in the previous clause, the amendments to this one are sequential
rather than grouped. We had some discussion on that but, given that we
are not under so much pressure, it will be easier to take them
separately as I have prepared
them.</div><a name="09062477000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 104, the Bill as drafted suggests that an action is to be
treated as an action taken by the legal person of the provider. In
other words, in terms of liability, an action is to be treated as an
action taken by the provider if it is taken either
by a person employed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>by the provider, a person acting on behalf of the
provider, or a person to whom the provider has delegated functions.
Those are quite common legal concepts. The provisions suggest that the
conduct of individuals will not be considered or commented upon, which
seems odd, both in itself and if and when we move to a fully registered
work force.</div>
<a name="09062477000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be
clear that one of the potential key benefits of the process is that it
is able to ensure that lessons can be learned from its findings on
complaints. We are dealing with potentially extremely sensitive and
vulnerable situations, and it behoves all of us to ensure that lessons
are quickly learned. One of the most shocking recent absences in
relation to adult social care is what has taken place at Stafford
hospital, and the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust was prayed in
aid by some of the earlier amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Hemel Hempstead. It is absolutely vital that we keep in mind
how quickly we need to ensure that lessons are
learned.</div><a name="09062477000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also need to know, if I may press the Minister, what happens if a
provider goes bust but the management team continue trading under
another name. I assume that the body remains accountable, but there
must be a question mark on the concept of being able to pierce the
corporate veil. As a lawyer, I will not go into the detail of that,
because I dare say that other members of the Committee are familiar
with the concept at a legal level. While that is not a completely happy
analogy, it helps promote my point, and I would like the Minister to
comment on how far one can get behind the legal person of the
incorporated or unincorporated body actually to get to some of the
individuals
involved.</div><a name="09062477000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment raises the important principle of liability, and I hope that
the Minister will clarify the schedule as drafted. I do not for a
moment suggest that the amendment is particularly elegant or happy, but
it has given me the opportunity to raise a point, and I hope that the
Minister will offer some analysis and comfort on the
issue.</div><a name="09062477000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000575"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> New section 34A includes the definitions of
adult social care and adult social care provider for the purposes of
the new scheme set out in new section 34B. The meaning of adult social
care is the same as that in section 9 of the 2008 Act. The amendment
would remove subsections (4) and (5) of new section 34A,
which provides that action taken on behalf of the provider should be
treated as action taken by that provider. Not referring to the
ombudsman being able to investigate action taken on a provider&#146;s
behalf would introduce uncertainty about the coverage of the scheme,
and I am glad to have the opportunity to set out why that would not be
desirable.</div><a name="09062477000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
aim is to ensure that complaints about social care that is provided
under any arrangements where the provider has delegated a service
remain within the ombudsman&#146;s remit. We want the ombudsman to
have a fair degree of discretion. The provisions cover action taken by
an employee, by a person with whom the service provider was contracted
to provide the service, as well as where the service is provided by a
less formal arrangement with another person. I do not believe that
anyone would think it right for a service provider to evade
investigation of poor practice just because someone acting on their
behalf carried out the service for them and was directly responsible
for the actions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div><a name="09062477000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppose
a care home provider contracts with a person for that person to come
into the home and provide a particular service, which is then the
subject of a complaint. Under these provisions, the care home provider
is still responsible for what happens within that care home and they
should rightly be subject to an investigation if there is a complaint
to the ombudsman. Without these provisions, it would be easy for such a
provider to escape investigation by arguing that the service that had
been the subject of the complaint was carried out by someone else on
their behalf. That would be wrong and therefore I trust that the hon.
Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman rightly raised the issue of those who trade under
different names and he asked to what extent we can pierce that
corporate veil. It is our intention that the ombudsman would be able to
examine all the circumstances in a case and would have broad discretion
in the way that that would be done. It would be the facts that would be
investigated rather than a corporate individual. If the ownership of a
particular care home was to change and was passed among a number of
organisations, each of which was a separate corporate entity but owned
by linked individuals, the ombudsman would still be able to look at the
facts and the circumstances before taking a view on the
matter.</div><a name="09062477000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000576"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister,
because this is obviously an important point and I think that he
recognises that it is important in terms of the way that accountability
flows.</div>
<a name="09062477000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have had a
case in my constituency that caused the most monumental nightmare for
everyone concerned. After an inspection, the lady who originally owned
the care home in question was found to have been operating something
that was very sub-standard and indeed she faced some allegations that
she had provided very poor care. Of course, her permission to operate
was withdrawn under the various processes that applied.</div>
<a name="09062477000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">It then
turned out that that sanction had been wholly and wrongly misapplied to
her, because the inspectors had placed an over-reliance upon
information from the owner-boss of the care home; I will not name the
case, for obvious reasons. During the inspection process, the company
had been sold, it had become part of a larger group and there was a
conflict of personalities between these two individuals. Consequently,
there was an attempt by the new owner effectively to get rid of the
former owner, so that the new owner could make efficiency savings; the
removal of the former owner was certainly not going to do anything to
improve patient care. It was an absolutely despicable case at every
step. However, the difficulty was being able to get behind the issues
of
ownership.</div><a name="09062477000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I say, I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification. I am sorry
that this is a long intervention, but I am grateful to him because, as
he said, the process is about investigating the facts. However, it can
often happen in these cases, after the inspection and regulatory
process, that matters reach the courts. The case that I mentioned
reached the courts purely because there was a restraint of trade case
that took place in the courts, because of the attempt by the new owner
of that care home to restrain the original owner from going into
competition with them after she realised that her future plans were
being blocked. That was why we had huge difficulty in getting behind
the different corporate entities.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div><a name="09062477000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad that the Minister was able to take my point seriously, but this
is a real issue; we are trying to ensure that patients do not
suffer.</div>
<a name="09062477000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000577"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> In trying to get to the facts in a case,
there is obviously a requirement to get the relevant information. Where
an ombudsman is concerned, it is always difficult for them to collate
and obtain the information that they need. Some people may say that
they just will not co-operate with the ombudsman and that remains an
issue for us. I just want to warn the hon. Gentleman about that,
because these provisions are not panaceas. They are ways of helping,
instruments that are available to those who are badly done by, and we
need to ensure that they are in place where they are needed. However,
let us not pretend that they will solve all the problems or that they
will be able to do more than they
can.</div><a name="09062477000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the point about an individual&#146;s liability versus the
liability of a home or a company. Let me say that an ombudsman can
report, but whether compensation is paid or what the final outcome of a
case will be is all a matter of law and there is also the question of
whether there will be co-operation with the ombudsman.</div>
<a name="09062477000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
complex issues and I just wanted to put on record the fact that there
are a number of caveats, so that it is clear that I am not claiming
that these provisions will provide all the guarantees that we might
like to provide. They will provide a tool to ensure that complaints can
be dealt with more effectively and to ensure that people have somewhere
to go and some prospect of getting a
remedy.</div><a name="09062477000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000578"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful and the Minister is right;
it is obviously a complex area. He is also right to be cautious
because, while, as we have already stated, we more than welcome the
proposal, there will always be some who seek to escape the full
consequences of the law and everything that runs up to that. On the
back of the discussion, which moved matters forward sufficiently, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000580"></a>Mr.

ombudsman&#146;s remit the commencement or conduct of civil or
criminal proceedings before any court of law. That mirrors the
arrangements in the local authority scheme and also those for all other
public service ombudsmen. For example, a complainant could not complain
to the ombudsman about how the High Court dealt with a claim against a
care home. That would not be appropriate for the ombudsman to
investigate.</div><a name="09062477000382"></a>

like clarity from the Minister about Privy Council responsibility and
using Orders in Council rather than regulations. I move the amendment
to get an answer.</div>
<a name="09062477000388"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000585"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> At present the Bill provides for changes to
be made by an Order in Council. An Order in Council is a form of
statutory instrument and, as such, may be annulled in pursuance of a
resolution of either House. That is what the Bill specifies. Orders in
Council are made by Privy Councillors and have often been used to amend
primary legislation governing public service ombudsmen. The use of
regulations, on the other hand, is a power given to a Secretary of
State, so is linked to a particular Department. Matters relating to the
ombudsmen are not strictly departmental matters, which is why Orders in
Council are used to make changes relating to ombudsmen in legislation.
The new scheme will sit alongside the existing local authority scheme
in the 1974 Act, under which there is already provision for the
equivalent schedule of exclusions to be amended by Order in Council. If
the power under proposed new section 34B is ever used, it is highly
likely that it will be at the same time as the existing power. It would
be cumbersome to have to have two different statutory
instruments&#151;one by Order in Council and one by regulation. I
trust that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied that that is a reasonable
way to proceed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000588"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The Bill allows persons to complain on
someone else&#146;s behalf. If someone has died, or is otherwise
unable to authorise someone else to complain on their behalf, a
personal representative, or someone who appears to be suitable to the
ombudsman, may complain. It gives a certain amount of discretion to the
ombudsman. If someone has died, the estate or personal representatives
in law will be in that category. The amendment would remove the right
of personal representatives of a deceased person to complain, and
instead, create the right for someone who has the power of attorney to
do so.</div>
<a name="09062477000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
allows someone authorised in writing by the person affected to make the
complaint on their behalf. This could include a person with the power
of attorney, so the power of attorney could, in any event, do that. But
that is not enough for two reasons. First, since many service users are
elderly and frail, it is a sad reality that they could have died before
the complaint can be pursued. Secondly, they may be unable to authorise
someone to act on their behalf. If the person affected has died, there
may be a personal representative who will need to take that forward for
the broader public good and to ensure that they are satisfied about how
things were done in a particular circumstance. It is appropriate that
they should have the ability to do
so.</div><a name="09062477000397"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000589"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am satisfied with the Minister&#146;s
answer. The difficulty arises, as both he and I and indeed all members
of the Committee will recognise, because our political generation faces
the enormous demography of an ageing population. Yet, outside this
particular arena, where we are effectively setting up a complaints
process, there is also the process of people being represented at the
onset of dementia and Alzheimer&#146;s. There is always a tricky
phase between the point at which we do not want someone&#146;s
independence, dignity and inner confidence impugned and when it is
becoming too difficult for people to handle their own affairs. At that
difficult time, it is possible that the personal
representative&#146;s approach in the complaints process will have a
read-across to something that is not as formal as the power of
attorney, or an enduring power of attorney, which now seems to be one
of the areas that is causing quite a lot of problems. Does it take
place before someone becomes a candidate to go into a residential care
home, or does it happen after they have made their own decision to go
into the care home? All sorts of issues surround this area, so I urge
the Minister to comment on the potential of taking that example and
looking at it a bit more widely. That would give us a bedrock on which
to address some of the wider issues about the ageing
population.</div><a name="09062477000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000590"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The aim here is to give the ombudsman at
least a broad degree of discretion about whom he accepts a complaint
from. It is right that when we are looking at such issues, we are
conscious that it has a broader and general applicability. We are
dealing with the ombudsman, and therefore, in a sense, we are taking
the issues outside the legal, formal arena. In that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>arena, the courts will have a view about who is
appropriate to make a complaint and what the circumstances are in which
an organisation or individual is obliged to respond. That would be a
matter of law. Here, again, it is a matter of law, but we want to give
greater flexibility to the ombudsman to take a view about what sort of
complaint it will be prepared to consider and from
whom.</div><a name="09062477000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that there is a wider general applicability to the issues. I am
a bit more cautious than the hon. Gentleman wants me to be about how we
go down the route, because I am conscious that we will have both legal
and non-legal&#151;in a sense, outside the formal, legal
processes&#151;obligations that we have to take account of. I do not
want to make general statements about the capacity of individuals to
make complaints on behalf of others, if the courts take a view that
under its procedures, it would be not permissible for it to go much
further than to the ombudsman with that sort of
complaint.</div><a name="09062477000400"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000591"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful. I hope that that was a
useful exchange. I am satisfied on the actual substance of the
amendment that it can be withdrawn. Effectively, the power of attorney
point is included, rather than excluded. The general point that I made,
using the issue as a hook to make it, is a discussion for another day.
But there are some important issues that need to be established. As we
are looking at contentious processes&#151;this is the ombudsman
effectively being brought into a process&#151;it is part of a more
appropriate way of dealing with complaints, particularly where the
courts are involved. That is often a more contentious and difficult
process, and often a barrier to access; an ombudsman is not, because of
its availability and access to all. There is clearly an area in which
such thinking may be a spur to thinking that needs to go on elsewhere.
Hopefully, the courts will take good cognisance of it as we develop the
process. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062477000401"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09062477000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000592"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 68, in
schedule 5, page 55, line 14, leave
out &#145;12&#146; and insert
&#145;36&#146;.</div><a name="09062477000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ombudsman can take complaints only within 12 months of the
event, although he has the power to suspend that. The simple question
is: why 12 months, especially as the whole arena of complaints
procedure was first promised&#151;certainly more than
mooted&#151;in 2007? We felt that in fairness the time should stretch
back to then and that is why we have substituted 36 months,
which is around the average length of stay in a care home and might
make some correlating sense. Furthermore, if the ombudsman can take
complaints from events 12 months in the past, what assessment has the
Minister made of the initial wave of complaints, which may meet the
arrival of the framework? Paragraph 32 of the RIA states
that the Government envisage up to 1,000 people a year having their
complaint looked at. Where does the Minister get that figure from and
is he concerned that up to 1,000 people will put in complaints on the
first day, in addition to the 1,000 over the first
year?</div><a name="09062477000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
some degree we have the example of what has just taken place in
relation to the parliamentary ombudsman, with whom I had a meeting
recently. A number of complaints already in train in the Healthcare
Commission 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>have now been taken on by the ombudsman, because the Care Quality
Commission has taken over the Healthcare Commission&#146;s role and
the complaints process is with the parliamentary ombudsman. We have now
reached the point at which the ombudsman&#146;s own work load is
arriving, as well as what has effectively been taken on from the
previous Healthcare Commission work load. The Healthcare Commission was
a public body, so had there been any allegation of maladministration or
other such things in the broader remit of what the ombudsman can
consider, there would of course have been some referrals from the
Healthcare Commission to the ombudsman. There were three categories.
That assessment needs to be made and clearly understood, as does the
sourcing of the estimation in the regulatory impact assessment given by
the
Minister.</div><a name="09062477000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the amendment, the RIA addresses set-up costs for the ombudsman in
2009-10, at paragraph 15, noting that they are in the region of
&#163;500,000 to &#163;770,000. I would be grateful if the Minister
could let us know whether the process has begun and when he expects the
ombudsman to
start.</div><a name="09062477000406"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062477000593"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> There are a number of reasons why we have
specified a time limit of 12 months. Before going into those, the hon.
Gentleman is right that there needs to be a balance. I am sure that
some people might have complaints from further back than that that they
might well want dealt with, but we have to look at some basis upon
which we judge how far back to
go.</div><a name="09062477000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure mirrors the provisions in part 3 of the Local Government Act
1974, governing the ombudsman&#146;s role in relation to local
authorities. Twelve months is a reasonable time and the vast majority
of complaints would reach the ombudsman well within that period. If we
were to have a longer limit&#151;for example, the three-year period
proposed by the hon. Gentleman&#151;some investigations could
potentially be made more difficult, because key staff had moved on, or
managers in the service might have moved to another job, and those that
remained would find it difficult to recall accurately events going back
three years in the
past.</div><a name="09062477000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not impossible to do that&#151;the courts do, the tax authorities
do&#151;and all sorts of provisions require longer periods, but we
wanted to ensure that the ombudsman, who has a difficulty enough job in
any event, is not burdened with all the problems of calling evidence,
which would normally be done. Such issues are usually resolved in a
hearing, but the ombudsman would normally want do this on paper.
Therefore, it is necessary to have a situation in which a reasonable
period of time is looked at. I would not suggest that there might not
be cases in which it is right to allow more than 12 months. For that
reason we have provided in subsection (3) for the ombudsman to have the
power to disapply those time limits. However, we would very much see
that as a decision for the
ombudsman.</div><a name="09062477000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ombudsman&#146;s remit would not extend to self-funded adult
social-care users until 1 October 2010, when the new CQC registration
starts applying to adult social care. I am happy to write with more
details on the impact assessment&#146;s assumption about the 1,000
people; we shall go back, check the detail and report on the sources of
that assumption. Our proposals in the Bill include the local government
funding and money set aside to cover the establishment of a
scheme.</div>
