<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I hope that you enjoyed the dinner to which your long hours of patience have undoubtedly entitled you.
<P>
I was attempting to summarise the debate because I sensed that the Committee wanted to come to a conclusion on it. I said that it was one sided. We had a glimpse of the real world--of the seaside, leisure parks, the Royal British Legion, social clubs in villages and towns up and down the country, and Conservative and Labour clubs. I ended by saying that it was to the shame of Labour Members that my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, the shadow Treasury Whip, had to make the case for the continuance of a Labour club and for its very survival as a non-profit-making club.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford spoke eloquently about Truro Conservative club. His portrait no doubt still hangs there after his successful campaigning in Truro. He made a point about the revenue take.
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham was, I fear, so terrified by your ruling, Mrs. Dunwoody, that he has not been seen since. I do not know whether you can issue an instruction allowing him back into the Committee if he can decommission his piece of equipment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should explain that the hon. Member for Twickenham kindly wrote me a little note explaining why he had to go. He was extremely sorry and apologised to me and to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for making that clear. We are, however, not sure whether the hon Member for Twickenham will come back. He made the important point about the Royal British Legion clubs, which are non-profit making and which have to compete with pubs and other commercial activities. He also made the important point that it was a bit early for the Government to judge the effect of the 1996 deregulation order. It would have been better for them to assess the order's effect and to think through what they were going to propose.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton amazed us with the depth of his experience in this country's arcades. He rightly spoke up for the seaside resorts, and he made an important point. Our resorts depend on attractions, and jobs depend on the tourism that they bring; all that is at risk under the Bill.
<P>
The debate has been worth while. First, it has highlighted the Government's failure to wait for the effects of the previous Government's deregulation to work through; and, secondly, it has highlighted the Government's failure to consult properly. The Financial Secretary made two specific apologies. She could not dodge the commitment to consultation that she made just three years ago. In mitigation, she claimed that the criteria for pre-Budget consultation had been met. That is not BACTA's view. A spokesman said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I cannot see how we failed the tests it''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the criteria--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``contained. Important changes both to the rates and to the way they have been implemented and decided upon warranted pre consultation with BACTA.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Financial Secretary's defence, therefore, falls.
<P>
I should also tell the Financial Secretary that when my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells made similar changes in January 1995, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I also undertook that the detailed and specific amendments, which will give effect to the proposal, will be exposed to the industry and to hon. Members who want to comment on them.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 31 January 1995; c. 29.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We undertook consultation; she did not.
<P>
Finally, the amendments have exposed the Government's failure to offer any clear rationale for the swingeing increases that are proposed. The Minister offered only two of the flimsiest possible reasons. First, she said, ``The industry can afford it.'' Then she said, ``But, I was wrong about that back in 1995.'' Those two reasons, taken together, simply cancel each other out.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that the industry is protected from the worst of the damage that the Government are now wreaking upon it. Conservative Members have to stand up for the sea fronts, for the leisure clubs and, above all, for the Royal British Legion and the Conservative clubs--even for the Labour clubs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Disgraceful!
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I trust that that remark was not directed at the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that it was not.
<P>

Clauses 13 and 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fiscal representatives</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall speak only very briefly, Mrs. Dunwoody. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I am glad that my decision is popular with the Committee.
<P>
I am concerned about the proposal that fiscal representatives should provide security. In some cases, fiscal representatives may be dissatisfied with the amount of duty that has been levied on them. Will the clause allow them rights of appeal and, if so, how will their security be treated during the course of such an appeal?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman perhaps misunderstands the option that is offered in clause 15 with regard to passenger duty.
<P>
The clause will provide an additional degree of revenue protection and make it easier for certain foreign airlines to comply with the air passenger duty law by offering them choice, flexibility and a potential reduction in their compliance costs.
<P>
Under current law, any aircraft operator without a business establishment in the United Kingdom that operates chargeable flights from UK airports is required to appoint a fiscal representative who will be liable for the airline's duty debts. The Bill will not alter the provisions of the existing legislation in that respect.
<P>
A number of airlines have been unable to find representatives who are willing to take the risk of duty liability. In such circumstances, the clause will provide that the airline will not be brought under revenue control, the duty will not be secured and the airline will therefore be in breach of the air passenger duty law. It will be the fact that the airline cannot find a fiscal representative that puts it in breach of law, not the issue of whether it is prepared to meet its air passenger duty liabilities.
<P>
The clause will enable airlines to appoint ``administrative representatives'' who will be responsible for keeping records and accounts but will not be liable for the duty debts of their principals, on condition that the airlines provide security for the duty.
<P>
The Government are thus offering a choice to airlines that are experiencing difficulties in acquiring a fiscal representative. If the commissioners were to ask the airline for further security in such a situation, that request would be appealable. The Government are trying to ease the difficulty that some airlines experience when attempting to comply with the original APD law that was instituted by the previous Government. I believe that it will be a helpful measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady has said, which highlighted the reason why I asked my question in the first place. If an unfair assessment is made, as a result of which security is drawn down, I am concerned that the airline's right of appeal could come after that point. Will its right of appeal pre-empt the drawing down of security or, as the Minister's words seemed to imply, will the appeal only pre-empt a further demand for additional security?
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The current position is that security is calculated by the airline based on the commissioners' directions. There would be no right of appeal on that. If the commissioners asked for further security, that would be appealable. I understand the hon. Gentlemans's point. The new clause allows overseas airlines the option of paying security and having a fiscal representative responsible only for the records. They are required to do one or the other.
<P>
Security is calculated by the airline, based on the commissioners' directions, so there should be no difficulties there.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is important that we clarify the point. If I understood the Minister correctly, she said that the original security may be seized by Customs pending an appeal, but that Customs may not demand additional security while the appeal is taking place. That begs the question, as the business carries on operating--which it will no doubt want to do while the appeal is being heard--what happens to further liability for duty during that period? Will the Government stay their hand, or will they invent a further demand for security outside the appeal process, which negates, in its own way, the comfort that the Minister is trying to give to airlines in that position?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not understand the position. The commissioners' directions are in a public notice. Security is based on duty, liability and past compliance. The company can agree on that security. Its fiscal representative will then have a lesser responsibility. The hon. Gentleman talked about drawing down security. The security would be the company's liability to pay its tax to release it from the requirement on fiscal liability, which is the current regime.
<P>
Airlines therefore have two options. They can operate under the current regime or under this regime. In both cases, the liability is calculated on the basis of their duty liability. I fail to see the hon. Gentleman's point. He is trying to make it sound as though the commissioners dream up a liability and draw down on the security totally unreasonably. That is not the way that APD works. The clause does not change the way it works or the calculations of liability.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the Financial Secretary's answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. I have a slightly different question. It is extremely technical, but I am sure that she will be able to put my mind at rest. It has been raised with me by people in the business.
<P>
If a fiscal representative is appointed under section 34A as an administrative representative only, and if that administrative representative gives security, at any time, for any reason and notwithstanding his appointment as an administrative representative, would he have the same rights of appeal to a VAT and duties tribunal that a fiscal representative appointed under section 34 has under existing legislation?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That is a good question. The commissioners issue the amount that an airline is liable to pay on its APD on the basis of its liability, and that will not change. The airline can have a fiscal representative with full liability, as currently determined, or an alternative, which would be somebody who accounts and holds the business. That person agrees directly with the commissioners the security that is necessary in the light of existing provision. Assessments are then made for liability. The previous Government put that legislation in place. Because of the calculation for liability for APD, the appeals procedure against liability remains the same.
<P>
Opposition Members are looking for complications that are not there. The Government are removing liability to pay the duty from the fiscal representative and substituting a security from the airline. The airline would have the same right of appeal as the fiscal representative. This is getting very complicated. The fiscal representative currently has the right of appeal under the full powers. If security was required, there would, therefore, be the same right of appeal.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty where pollution reduced</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 8, line 46, after `vehicles', insert `or types of vehicles'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 22, in schedule 1, page 144, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section shall provide that, once a certificate has been issued in respect of any one vehicle of a particular type, it will be sufficient for the keeper of any other vehicle of the same type to demonstrate that his vehicle is of the like type as that in respect of which the certificate was issued; and that in those circumstances no further proof shall be required that the reduced pollution requirements are satisfied in respect of the vehicle.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This is a probing amendment in the genuine sense of the term. We seek to understand exactly what the Government have in mind in clause 16 and in schedule 1, which relates to it. We are slightly hindered in our pursuit of knowledge by the fact that everything hinges on regulations that have yet to be made. I understand, however, that negotiations between the Treasury and industry on the form of the regulations are at a relatively advanced stage. For the purpose of our discussion, therefore, I shall assume that the draft that is in play in those discussions indicates the final form of the regulations.
<P>
It is not clear to me whether the concession that will be granted under clause 16 will be available only to vehicles that are retrospectively fitted with a means of reducing their emission of harmful particulate material or whether it will apply also to new vehicles that are manufactured to a stricter emissions standard.
<P>
My attention was initially drawn to that possible problem by the wording of clause 16, which clearly refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``vehicles adapted so as to reduce pollution''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure whether I should understand the word ``adapted'' in an active or passive sense. From my reading of the documentation that is circulating in the industry, however, I understand that the clause is seen as dealing specifically with the clean-up of vehicles that are in the fleet as of today.
<P>
The first point on which I seek clarification from the Financial Secretary is, therefore, whether the Government will allow the reduced rate for all vehicles that meet a specified emissions standard or whether it will apply, for example, only to vehicles of the pre-Euro I category which have been retrofitted with some means of reducing their particulate emissions to bring them up to the Euro III standard. The industry documentation often refers to such percentage particulate removals, which appear to be the way in which the improvement can be achieved.
<P>
Whatever the Financial Secretary's answer to that question, it brings the Committee directly to the point of the amendment. It seeks to provide a mechanism for allowing type approval of either new vehicles--if the concession will apply to new vehicles that meet specific stringent emission standards--or of commercially available catalyser systems or particulate traps that may be retrofitted to existing vehicles.
<P>
The Government's intention is clear. It is entirely laudable to reduce the particulate emissions of heavy vehicles. As I understand it, however, the cost of fitting a particulate trap to a goods vehicle is likely to be about &#163;4,000. Having fitted it, the operator is likely to find that the vehicle's engine achieves a somewhat reduced level of performance in terms of mileage. The operator is also likely to face a somewhat increased routine maintenance requirement, in respect of both the engine and of the particulate trap.
<P>
It does not take a mathematician, which I freely admit that I am not, to calculate that a maximum &#163;500 per annum duty rebate will be a modest incentive to the road freight industry to fit a &#163;4,000 kit to vehicles that will often, almost by definition, be relatively old. Although the contribution is small, anything that reduces the cost and hassle to the operator of getting his vehicle approved for the lower rate of duty is to be welcomed. The requirement in schedule 1 for every vehicle to be tested and certificated, and for a fee to be payable for that testing and certification will be a further nail in the coffin in respect of the financial analysis that every operator will undertake to decide whether the proposition is attractive.
<P>
By proposing tight approvals either of vehicles or of commercially available means of reducing emissions, the Opposition seek to reduce the testing and certification costs and the off-road time of the vehicle, which will be an equally important factor to commercial operators. The amendment would make it marginally more attractive to fit such means of reducing emissions and to qualify for the reduced duty level offered by the clause. Whether that proposed duty level will ever be a sufficient incentive to motivate the economic actors in this equation to do what the Government want them to do is another question, which will be more properly addressed at the clause stand part debate.
<P>
Will the Government assure the Committee that they will seek to facilitate the development of commercially available standardised emission reduction systems by allowing type approvals, so that individual vehicles do not have to incur the time, cost and off-road implications of certification on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis?
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): I, too, wish to speak in favour of the amendment, not least because it was the previous Conservative Government who announced the intention to reduce vehicle excise duty for heavy lorries with lower emissions of pollutants. That was clearly a good idea, and consultation was absolutely necessary.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I regret the interruption, but I was making an important point in support of the amendment. As I was saying, the idea behind the measure is a Conservative idea which has been embraced by the new Labour Government. We welcome that, but sadly must deplore its implementation, which reveals a lack of consultation. We began the consultation process, but under the Labour Government it has consisted of only words and no matter.
<P>
The amendments are crucial because they demonstrate thinking from Opposition Members, as opposed to the new Labour Government's desperate attempt to grab the environmental mantle. How green one is--we are not as green as some Labour Members--is judged by how one delivers in practice. The measure fails because the qualification standards for the concession are such that the maximum reduction of pollutants will not be achieved.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has pointed out the ludicrous position that will obtain under the provisions. Anyone who wanted meaningfully to deliver reductions would be forced to use a particulate trap that would cost about &#163;4,000. When we place that against a reduction of &#163;500, it is apparent that only after a long period would any company be able to recoup its money. As my hon. Friend said, that cost is in addition to the &#163;1,500 a year premium cost of operating a low-emission engine vehicle.
<P>
The measure is a lamentable attempt by the Government to claim green credentials. The moment that it is put up against the light, it is revealed to be a shallow attempt to appease the green lobby. It is ill-conceived and ill-thought-through. As the director general of the Freight Transport Association has said, the sums do not add up. The FTA engineers, who produced the figure of &#163;1,500, suggest that the premium cost is crucial to understanding whether the &#163;500 tax rebate is meaningful. It is interested that the FTA's director general is also a member of the Government's cleaner vehicles task force, so that stinging criticism of the Government comes from someone in their own task force, and we hope that they will pay due attention to the amendment.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) pointed out, the measure was originally planned by the previous Government. We thought that it was a good idea and wanted to build on their proposals. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds may be able to tell us about the discussions that took place in the Treasury, if he was still there at that stage.
<P>
On consultation, I offer some information to the hon. Member for Witney. More than 450 trade and other organisations were invited to respond to our proposals. The result of the consultation was then published, and further consultation will take place on the details of the scheme. Of course, it is the hon. Gentleman's prerogative if he does not like the scheme, but he is wrong to say that there has not been proper consultation or that there are no plans for further consultation. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge acknowledged that there had been consultation on the draft regulations.
<P>
The next point made by the hon. Member for Witney was that the rebate of &#163;500 was not enough and would not make any difference. The Government's proposals form a package of measures, of which this is one, to encourage the adoption and entry into service of vehicles with cleaner exhausts ahead of tighter mandatory emission standards. The measures are intended to promote the manufacture of particulate traps. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge gave examples of how expensive they are.
<P>
We are trying, as were the previous Government, to encourage the development and production of technologies to improve vehicle emissions. We cannot give larger rebates than the amount paid on vehicles. As with all measures with environmental objectives--intended to encourage certain developments or behaviour--we have to make a start. We congratulate the previous Government on investigating the matter, and we are developing their work. There is no need for us to be churlish about that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about old and new vehicles. Yes, new vehicles will qualify. The purpose of the change is to encourage adaptation to higher standards. That means moving from Euro I to Euro II, III and--we expect--Euro IV standards. The Government are making it clear why we want to encourage that behaviour and are sending a clear signal to vehicle operators and to manufacturers of particulate traps.
<P>
The amendments would be impractical; primary legislation is not the way to proceed. I am sure that all members of the Committee sympathise with the sentiments underlying the amendments: that the process by which owners and operators gain entry to the concessionary tax class should be as simple, cheap and unbureaucratic as possible, while maintaining the integrity of the provisions. The clause does not attempt to define the process; it provides regulation-making powers. As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, it will allow the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to specify a scheme for the approval of equipment and the certification of vehicles.
<P>
I assure the Committee that, in preparing a scheme, the Government will want to propose the simplest route, minimising the number of pieces of paper needed and keeping burdens on manufacturers and operators to the absolute minimum. That is why the regulations are the subject of consultation. I assure the Committee that consultation on the scheme will continue once the regulations are published.
<P>
The amendment is imperfect and will not deliver its objective. The regulations, which deliver a policy initiated by the previous Government and taken forward by the present Government, will make an important contribution to air quality in urban areas. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Imperfect the amendment may be--I am ready to concede that--but the Financial Secretary's answer, too, is imperfect; it does not assuage our concerns. The Financial Secretary appeared to be giving me the assurance that I sought--that the lower rate of vehicle excise duty would apply also to new vehicles--but she then went on to talk about Euro I standard vehicles being improved to the standard of Euro III vehicles. I am still a little confused.
<P>
I understand how a reduction from the emission level of one standard to the emission level of another would apply to vehicles fitted retrospectively with that equipment. The proposed standard that I have seen circulated in the industry speaks entirely of reductions. It speaks of the pre-Euro I standard engine being required to achieve the output performance of a Euro III engine in order to qualify for vehicle excise duty credits. It also speaks of the Euro II engine being required to meet the output standards of a Euro IV standard engine. Where does that leave Euro III engines and, in future, Euro IV engines?
<P>
I do not want to beat about the bush, but if the Financial Secretary can give an absolute assurance that the regulations, when they are promulgated, will allow type approvals of vehicles by particulate emission standards, and not by reference to a reduction from another level achieved with a particular vehicle? To qualify for vehicle excise duty, the regulations should allow type approvals by an absolute reference to a maximum particulate emission level. New vehicles and older vehicles that have been re-engineered to achieve that level of particulate emission would therefore all qualify.
<P>
If the Financial Secretary can assure us that it will be done by type certification, we shall be satisfied and I shall withdraw the amendment. If the Financial Secretary cannot give that assurance, we shall press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I thought that I had given the assurance that the hon. Gentleman seeks. If he wishes to press the amendment to a Division, we shall certainly oppose it. I made it quite clear that new vehicles were to be included, and that it would not be done by type approval but by specification according to emission.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I wish to make a few additional points on the clause, if that is in order, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I allowed a fairly wide debate on the amendment, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall, Mrs. Dunwoody. I would like to put an important point, which did not arise earlier, to the Financial Secretary.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have run around the issue of the cost of particulate traps and the very long payback periods involved. The proposed reduction in particulate output--87 per cent. for pre-Euro I engines--can be achieved only by fitting of a particulate trap. The much cheaper technology of a diesel oxidation catalyst is, at 70 per cent. reduction, less efficient in reducing particulate emission than a particulate trap. That catalyst is not a theoretical, boffin's project--a dodgy, also-ran product. It is the option that London Transport has adopted for its bus fleet, for the obvious reason that the cost of fitting a diesel oxidation catalyst is approximatley &#163;1,000, as opposed to &#163;4,000 for a particulate trap.
<P>
In the absence of any regulation requiring a reduction in the output emissions of older vehicles, operators are unlikely to fit particulate traps in order to qualify for a vehicle excise duty reduction of &#163;500. They are much more likely to spend &#163;1,000 on a proven technology that is used by London Transport and which will pay for itself in two years. Have the Government seriously considered specifying a lower level of particulate reduction--admittedly a less than ideal position--to ensure much higher take-up? Will the Financial Secretary give us the Government estimates of the likely response to the initiative? What modelling has been done on what percentage of the existing vehicle fleet will respond to the fiscal incentives of a duty reduction of &#163;500 if particulate traps are fitted? Has any sensitivity analysis been undertaken to find out how many more vehicles would be fitted with a diesel exidation catalyst and the overall impact on the output of particulate matter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Perhaps it would be helpful to my hon. Friend if I pointed out that the Millbrook proving ground has shown in extensive testing that the oxidation catalysts to which he refers are a demonstrably more effective and efficient reduction method. I invite the Financial Secretary to comment on those tests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have looked at the results of the Millbrook trials and I think it is fair to say that they demonstrate that diesel oxidation is not a more efficient method in purely technical terms, but is more economically effective.
<P>
I would like to make one more, small point to the Financial Secretary. Would not it be better to specify a percentage reduction in vehicle excise duty for cleaner vehicles, thus avoiding the need for regular updating of the absolute figure and the possibility of anomalies whereby &#163;500 would be a larger proportion of some vehicles' duty payable than others?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The costs of the technology will fall as manufacturers increase production, especially in response to the incentive. It is not a case of minding how the improvements are achieved; the objective is to enable vehicles to meet standards to qualify for the reduced rate. We are incentivising a standard, not promoting a particular form of technology to achieve that standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I could just finish making the point, I should be grateful. The hon. Gentleman has made several points and, before he makes another, perhaps he would let me finish.
<P>
We cannot predict the likely take-up. Much will depend on the business decisions of individual operators. However, as I have said, we expect take-up to be low initially, given the high initial costs involved for hauliers and the need for the scheme to become more widely recognised. We expect that take-up will gradually increase over time; the cost of particulate traps will fall as the volume of production increases.
<P>
The lower level of improvements was debated during the first stage of consultation with the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, but we felt that there was no case made for lower standards.
<P>
However, we shall consult on the detail of the regulations. That will be the time to deal with such matters in detail.

Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restriction of Exemption for old vehicles</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 9, line 4, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless such a vehicle is driven for fewer than 1,500 miles a year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a mean little clause, and the amendment would improve it--or at least limit the damage that it will cause. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) introduced a concession in the previous Parliament to exempt from vehicle excise duty vehicles more than 25 years old. That has proved popular, well targeted and an effective way of addressing the circumstance in which classic and veteran cars are owned and used.
<P>
The University of Central England in Birmingham has conducted a survey. It estimates that there are 658,575 such vehicles, made before 1977. the real number might be higher because some vehicles are owned by clubs not affiliated to the sponsoring organisation--the Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs. About 64 per cent. of those vehicles are licensed and roadworthy, so we are talking about more than 400,000 vehicles, which sounds like a great many--as indeed it is--but it is only about 2 per cent. of the total number of vehicles on the road.
<P>
Some of those vehicles are part of our heritage; we should look after and cherish them. It may not be cool Britannia, because it harks back to a more industrialised phase in our national economic history. That does not appeal to the Government, who, as we have heard in other debates, are entirely unconcerned about the state of manufacturing industry and how it is suffering from the high pound. That debate will continue elsewhere, but all hon. Members should agree that the motoring past is valuable and should be preserved and that such vehicles should be kept in good repair and used.
<P>
Moreover, a surprisingly large number of people use such vehicles for everyday transport, especially those on modest incomes, who used to receive the sympathy and understanding of the Labour party. Those days are gone, but that category of people and vehicles should catch at least the passing attention of Labour Members. In recognition of that sector of the population, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe exempted such vehicles from vehicle excise duty. That part of the Finance Bill of four or five years ago has stood the test of time. Although the national lottery awards generous grants to several heritage institutions, it cannot reach individual owners of such vehicles. That privatised sector of our heritage is not touched by lottery funding. It was, therefore, a perceptive concession on the part of my right and learned Friend to give such people that modest help.
<P>
A further feature of such vehicles is their low mileage. The study to which I have already referred estimates that the average mileage covered by such vehicles that are roadworthy and licensed is about 1,224. That compares with the average mileage for all vehicles, which is in excess of 10,000. Such vehicles therefore make few demands on the road network. That should be recognised in the licensing provisions, which we did through exemption.
<P>
The clause is mean minded. It will erode that exemption over time by specifying the date 1973, which will bring increasingly more vehicles into the vehicle excise net. Fewer historic vehicles will qualify as they are scrapped or become unroadworthy.
<P>
The amendment would restore the concession to vehicles that are drive for fewer than 1,500 miles a year. It should be possible to administer and enforce such a concession. If not, the Financial Secretary has another means at her disposal--to withdraw the clause. To do so would not be expensive, the clause is unnecessary, given the current state of Government revenue. I should like to hear the Financial Secretary's initial remarks about the amendment before we debate clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Apart from his attempt to rewrite industrial history, I agreed with much of what the right hon. Member for Wells said. His description of the clause as mean was well put, and I shall support his amendment tonight.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The phasing out of the exemption is a totally unnecessary attack on a popular hobby. Many people enjoy classic cars, fixing them up in their garages at weekends, driving them on a summer's day and showing them off at car rallies. Many people join clubs and their car is their main hobby. They are not the owners of multitudes of classic cars--many of the people enjoying the tax exemption have one car. It is their main hobby and they spend all their weekends and evenings on it. Labour Members should think about the number of their constituents who fall into this category. There may be a few wealthy people who benefit from the exemption, but the vast majority of beneficiaries of the tax exemption are ordinary people. I can see no reason or justification for the Government phasing out that exemption--and why now? Why the 1973 cut-off year?
<P>
There seems to be little argument in favour of the clause, but a lot to be said for the amendment of the right hon. Member for Wells. He put it very well when he talked about the ordinary people who are protecting our inheritance as a sort of privatised national lottery. People are using their own money--their hard-earned savings--to protect our inheritance. People enjoy the spectacle of those old classic cars being driven down the high street during classic car rallies.
<P>
I had the pleasure of adjudicating a classic car rally at last year's Surbiton festival. It was my first visit to such an event and it was very instructive, as before my visit, what I knew about classic cars could have been written on a tax disc. Most people who were exhibiting cars were just ordinary folk who were very proud of their cars, and it is a great shame that the Government are attacking this small sector of the population. I have had letters from a couple of constituents, one of whom sent me a cutting from the Triumph Sports Six Club magazine. There are many car clubs up and down the country, each of which publishes a magazine. The cutting is headed ``Comment'' and the article is written by Bill Sunderland.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will paraphrase, rather than read the whole article.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I shall quote only one sentence, which I hope will be in order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Bill Sunderland writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Old cars/Classic cars have a place on the highways, they do very few miles and bring enjoyment to 1,000s of people, owners and onlookers alike, they are a part of our heritage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows how the current exemption is enjoyed by many people, and I hope that the Government will think again and either accept the amendment moved by the right hon. Member for Wells or withdraw the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The name of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe has been referred to as someone deserving praise for the regime that he introduced in one of his Budgets during the previous Conservative Administration. That was not the only great thing that my right hon. and learned Friend achieved, of course. He delivered a golden economic legacy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. and learned Gentleman was my pair, but we shall not investigate everything that he did in the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody. My references were to be passing ones only. I merely wished to reiterate that my right hon. and learned Friend achieved many great things and the classic car regime was one of his great political achievements, which has already been recognised in our debate.
<P>
I echo the concern about the sheer arbitrariness of the illogical choice of a cut-off date of 1973. We have not had an adequate explanation, although I am sure that the Financial Secretary will tell us why the 25-year rolling time period has been dropped. A rigid date will have unfortunate effects. Some modern-day classic cars will not be exempted. A colleague recently referred to a Maclaren F1 road car, which in the course of time should be judged to be a classic car. Their owners would no doubt want to take advantage of an exemption, but because of the arbitrary 1973 entrenched date, such cars will not be classed as classic cars. I could give plenty of other examples.
<P>
The clause mounts a huge attack on a substantial industry when we consider the volume and value of sales. The classic car movement estimates the value at between &#163;100 million and &#163;900 million. More importantly, for those of us concerned about small business, small maintenance and car-restoring firms employ many small people--[Laughter]. They provide valuable employment and derive benefit from maintenance, upgrading and restorative work. In that figure of several hundred million is the value of insurance and the premium tax that the Exchequer receives from the insurance of those expensive and valuable vehicles.
<P>
It is illogical to choose the year 1973; it is a vicious attack on an industry and the people who want nothing more than to go about their weekends, restoring and using classic vehicles. For those reasons, I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We have had a short but interesting debate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells described the clause as mean. He is a generous man. I think that it is a nasty little clause. In our debate on the previous clause, we were told that the Government were taking forward our good work, but they are reversing it in clause 17. The point of the original exemption was that such cars were unlikely to do high mileage, so the duty being charged was disproportionate to the use they made of the roads. As those who have contributed to the debate have said, the measure reflects the cost to them of keeping historic vehicles--part of Britain's motoring heritage--in good condition. It is unfair that, by fixing an entirely arbitrary date, some vehicles that might in future be classified as classic cars now no longer will be, and thus will not be entitled to the exemption.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend said that 1973 is an arbitrary date. Has it occurred to him that 1973 was the year when the powers of those such as Red Robbo were at their peak?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the intellectual debate about small people in small garages to take place, but the hon. Gentleman is getting a little off the point by referring to Red Robbo.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I, too, received a letter from a constituent who suggested the basis of amendment No. 10. Mr. John Milligan from Kemsing wrote to me saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Last year I drove on the road for 1,500 miles thereby incurring Excise Duty of 10p a mile.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As luck would have it, his car was registered in October 1973. The day after the Budget, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency wrote to Mr. Milligan telling him that his car would be caught.
<P>
It was only when I read other material supplied in opposition to the clause that it became evident that 1,500 miles is about the average mileage. The Minister may say that such a matter is difficult to police, but it is hardly likely that people who look after such cars will abuse them and drive them for many more miles than the average each year and shorten the life of the vehicles. Although the owners are ordinary people who maintain the cars, in most cases the historic car would be the second car. If the concession were granted, there would be no question of it being abused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): Conservative Members have referred to ordinary drivers and the impact of clause 17 on those who have only one car. The amendment would limit the mileage to 1,500 miles in one year, so how will that help the ordinary driver?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> That is the point that I was making. In most cases, the historic car would be the owner's second car.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> That is not what was said by other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am not responsible for the speech of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. He must make his own speech. Let us find common ground. Some people will be maintaining classic cars that are 25 or 30 years old. They may, indeed, be their only cars. However, other people will be maintaining a truly historic car by taking it out for a run, exhibiting it at shows and so on, and also own another car. I mentioned the second car precisely to illustrate the point that if the exemption were granted, it is unlikely to be abused.
<P>
We could have played tougher and asked for the clause to be deleted but, in the spirit of compromise and trying to reach a consensus, we tabled the amendment that would exempt low-mileage cars.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Member for Sevenoaks will need to write to his constituent, John Milligan, again and explain that his suggested amendment would make the situation worse. It would do the exact opposite of what Conservative Members want to do, which is to retain an exemption from vehicle excise duty for vehicles that are more than 25 years old with an annual mileage of less than 1,500 miles a year. Clearly, they do not understand the effect of their amendment.
<P>
The Government will ensure that exemption from vehicle excise duty for pre-1973 vehicles is preserved. The amendment would remove that exemption from pre-1973 vehicles with an annual mileage of less than 1,500 miles. It would encourage high-mileage vehicles. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman had in mind when he referred to precision-drafting of the clause. The concept of using mileage as a criterion for vehicle excise duty is fundamentally flawed.
<P>
It is my turn to quote the right hon. Member for Wells. In 1995, not long ago, he abolished the exemption for vehicles driven less than six miles a week because it was highly bureaucratic, difficult to enforce and costly to administer. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The present system is . . . too complex, and more or less impossible to enforce. In the pursuit of good government and administration, we must find a better a way of granting exemptions, and one that is easy to understand and possible to enforce.''--[Official Report, 30 January 1995; Vol. 253, c. 768.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is quite right. The hon. Gentleman was right then, but unfortunately he is not right now.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</B><I> rose--</I><P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is nice that the hon. Member for Cotswold has come back. I shall give way to him in a moment.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving way and for quoting my words. I do not take back a word of what I said.
<P>
The best and simplest solution would be for the Financial Secretary to withdraw the clause. Conservative Members are trying to salvage something from the wreckage of her proposals by at least exempting low-mileage vehicles. If she wants to follow the spirit of what I said, let her withdraw the clause.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> That was a nice try but the right hon. Gentleman is wrong. The amendment is incorrectly drafted. He is forced to admit that what he said in 1995 was right then and it is right now. I agree with his comments about the administration of the exemptions; it is wholly unworkable to rely on mileage, which is impossible to police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, although it is nice that he has come back, he was not here at the beginning of the debate and I should like to respond to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On that very point, will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Financial Secretary is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> An exemption of this nature would be inequitable and would discriminate against keepers of newer vehicles that meet significantly higher emission standards. People who use their vehicles only occasionally and have a low annual mileage would have to pay vehicle excise duty. The right hon. Gentleman would not want a system that included that injustice.
<P>
The amendment is ill-conceived, crude, confused and would not work. Irrespective of the intention of Opposition Members, the effect would be to encourage keepers of older vehicles to increase their annual mileage and would unfairly remove the exemption from genuine, classic low-mileage vehicles. That would run counter to the Government's policy of seeking to reduce harmful emissions from road transport. We also want to preserve our nation's motoring heritage by continuing the exemption undisturbed for vehicles constructed before 1973. The amendment would not do that and I ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman persisting with the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We shall vote against clause stand part. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the Financial Secretary's technical and substantive reasons for rejecting the amendment. Will she consider the possibility of exempting vehicles that are 25 years old and are kept in, and owned by, registered museums?
<P>
I have in my constituency the Cobham Bus museum and the Brooklands motor museum. I accept that most of the vehicles in those museums will be pre-1973. However, the objective in the bus museum is to keep a comprehensive collection of London Transport vehicles. As time goes by, there will be post-1973 vehicles. They are kept in the museum and driven on the road two or three times a year.
<P>
I suggest that the problems of enforcement and regulation that the Financial Secretary mentioned could be overcome if the exemption were restricted to registered museums. This is not a trivial point because, for buses, the amounts of duty are substantial. I ask the hon. Lady not to make a commitment now but to give genuine thought to the matter. I would be happy to write to her with details about these two museums.

<P>
: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 151, line 23, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to consider amendment No. 12, in page 151, line 26, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We now turn to schedule 2, and I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 6 on page 151. The amendments represent a relatively small point of drafting on which the Financial Secretary may be able to reassure us immediately.
<P>
There appears to be some doubt about the selection of the word ``may'' in sub-paragraphs (3)(a) and (b). The way in which ``may'' is introduced into the proposed subsection (2)(3A) of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 could mean that in some cases a demand is made rather than an assessment. That is an important distinction: if a demand is made, the taxpayer is denied a right of appeal. I should be grateful for the Minister's clarification.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The amendments are not without an element of desirability, but they fail to address the wider issue. The form of words in the provisions that the amendments seek to change appears many times throughout indirect tax legislation. Should a different approach be deemed necessary, this is not the manner in which it should be introduced.
<P>
Were we to adopt the amendment and make it a prescriptive requirement for the commissioners to assess, we would remove from them the discretion which they operate under in their powers for care and management of taxes and duties for which they have a responsibility. It is essential that that discretion remains. Were the commissioners to be required to make an assessment every time, as the amendment proposes, the results could be unfortunate. For instance, we would not like a continuing criminal investigation to be compromised because the commissioners were obliged to issue an assessment to the person being investigated. Even the least sophisticated of fraudsters may be alerted to the fact that Customs and Excise was on to them by the receipt of an assessment. That seems quite straightforward.
<P>
There are other grounds of equity when it would be preferable not to have a requirement to assess. The prime intention of the schedule is to extend the Customs and Excise assessment provisions so that the person assessed has a right to a review of the assessment and to have a right of appeal to a VAT and duties tribunal against the outcome of the review.
<P>
I can assure the Committee that the commissioners will always use the Customs and Excise assessment provisions where they are available to them. I therefore believe that my explanation covers the point that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks was seeking to clarify with regard to the amendment and rights of appeal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am grateful, but somewhat dumbfounded, because the Financial Secretary began her comments by saying that the amendments were not without an element of desirability. That is a phrase that I shall cherish on my journey home tonight. If I catch my train, I shall chew over that phrase on the way home to Sevenoaks, because it sounds as if we are on to something.
<P>
Of course, I take the Financial Secretary's point. We would, if we introduced such a provision everywhere, be removing some of the discretion available to the commissioners. I hope that the hon. Lady takes my point that there is always a balance to be struck between the discretion afforded to the commissioners and the rights that properly belong to taxpayers. If she even privately undertakes to keep the matter under review, we need not trouble the Commitee any further. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 2 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Deemed supplies</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We now turn to the clauses dealing with value added tax. We shall need to spend some time on these four clauses, as I and my hon. Friends will have much to say about them.
<P>
As I understand it, clause 21 aims to make VAT payable on goods that are given away free or put to a non-business use when a business is transferred. That is reasonably familiar ground for some members of the Committee. The Financial Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and I were members of a Standing Committee considering an equivalent change for the supply of services. We are dealing tonight with the supply of goods; the provision dealing with the supply of services was made a few weeks ago in a statutory instrument. I do not know why; I asked but I received no answer.
<P>
The reason for clause 21 is that some scope may exist for tax avoidance. The finance sector is often thought to be seeking further methods of avoidance--I do not know why--and it is thought that it might want to transfer assets without incurring VAT. Before the change is made, however, we are entitled to examine whether the scope for avoidance is significant.
<P>
The explanatory memorandum, which is published as part of the notes on clauses, says that removing the scope for avoidance would protect revenue of up to &#163;1.5 billion--a serious sum, you might think, Mrs. Dunwoody, had you not also been aware that the press release issued on Budget day classified all four VAT clauses as a package of changes meant to protect more than &#163;1.5 billion.
<P>
My first question to the Financial Secretary is, which of those is right--the press release, Customs and Excise No. 8, issued on Budget day, or the explanatory memorandum? They cannot both be right; that &#163;1.5 billion is being protected either by clause 21, or by the four clauses taken together. Will the Financial Secretary clarify the scope for avoidance that she wishes to target?
<P>
It is, of course, within the Financial Secretary's remit and part of her duty constantly to identify any loss of revenue. I am sure, however, that she knows that there is always a cost in making such provisions, and that clause 21 will certainly impose costs on business. When a business is transferred, information on the cost of individual items and on whether VAT has been recovered on those items and passed from the transferor to the transferee. That information will have to be collated and assembled. I wonder whether it would be worth an ordinary business incurring the considerable professional fees involved in establishing a gain by giving away certain goods.
<P>
To justify clause 21, the Government must be clear about how much scope there is for avoidance, explain in which sectors such avoidance might lie, and answer my question on that extra burden of compliance that the clause will undoubtedly impose on businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 21 is an anti-avoidance clause. It stems from the Value Added Tax (Supply of Services) Order 1993, which states that if assets are taken from a business for private use or are given away, the business must account to Customs and Excise for the VAT recovered when those goods were acquired. The Financial Secretary will doubtless say that, in some circumstances, a business can acquire an asset without having incurred input VAT on it. The 1993 order, which would require VAT to be accounted for, would not apply because the business had never incurred input VAT on the assets.
<P>
Prima facie, there is scope for avoidance when one acquires an asset through the VAT relief provisions for the transfer of a going concern. If one can transfer a business from one entity to another, there is no VAT on the transfer of those assets. Once one has the assets in one's hand, however, there is scope for giving them away or for private use. Under the order, there would be no scope for recovering the VAT.
<P>
For relief on the transfer of a going concern to apply, several conditions must be met. The principal one is that the business must be capable of being run as a stand-alone business. One cannot just transfer one's stock or one's debtors; one has to transfer what amounts to a stand-alone business. One does not have to sell the whole business, only part of it. It must, however, be capable of standing alone and functioning.
<P>
That brings me to the particular avoidance ruse that the clause seeks to block. A company could set up a wholly owned subsidiary to which it could transfer the whole of its business. For corporation tax purposes, the transfer would trigger no capital gains charge or other consequences because it would be a transfer under the provisions of section 171 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. There would be no VAT consequences because it would be the transfer of a going concern. Once the assets have been transferred to the new company, it could make private use of them without having to account for output VAT because it would not have incurred input VAT when it acquired them. The transferor company--the first company that had the assets--would have incurred the input VAT.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks said, that is a cumbersome process. Giving away a business' goods is not a usual practice and could have tax or company law consequences. Giving away goods is generally a breach of a director's duty to his or her shareholders. There would be direct tax consequences, and income tax would be payable in the case of a gift to an employee. For corporation tax purposes, the gift would be assumed to have been disposed of at the market value and there would be tax on that disposal.
<P>
The scope of avoidance is quite limited. My hon. Friend requested an accurate assessment from the Financial Secretary of the likely revenue loss to Customs and Excise and to the Exchequer. The Chartered Institute of Taxation is concerned that the Government are trying to crack a nut with a sledgehammer. It has spoken about countering:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the perceived mischief rather than adopting a blanket form of provision which would inevitably catch innocent transactions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Government are trying to deal with potential tax avoidance, but they will bring into their net a whole range of transactions. Dealing with the compliance side of the measures will cost this country money.
<P>
The Law Society has raised the issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks mentioned of the discrepancy in how much the Government reckon is at stake in terms of potential avoidance. The press release refers to the four or five different anti-avoidance measures that the Government propose to take and which will protect revenue totalling &#163;1&#183;5 billion. The notes on clauses, however, refer to clause 21 as protecting &#163;1&#183;5 billion of revenue. In the Committee that dealt with the services side of the issue, the Financial Secretary again said that the &#163;1.&#183;5 billion related only to the one anti-avoidance measure in the clause. We should like some clarification of the potential for lost revenue.
<P>
Every piece of legislation brings with it added compliance costs. The anti-avoidance measure will involve costs for the small number of people that it targets who will potentially abuse or who are abusing the tax system. It will, however, also involve costs for the plethora of people to whom the regulations will apply when they come into force. What assessment have the Government made of the compliance costs that will arise from the clause?
<P>
It is important, when determining whether a loophole should be blocked, to examine the effect of the new rules on the total economy. If the revenue that may be lost is less than the extra compliance cost for the country as a whole, one must question whether a change in the law would benefit UK plc.
<P>
There is little doubt, however, that the loophole exposed by the Bill should be closed. Clearly, the measure will increase the compliance cost incurred by those who wish to transfer a business under the provisions governing VAT relief on the transfer of going concerns. It will make more cumbersome the sale and acquisition of businesses, especially between third parties. For instance, the purchaser of a business will have to know whether VAT has been recovered on every asset being acquired because at some time in the future he may decide to give an asset away, or use it for private purposes. Therefore, a business' vendors will have to provide the VAT information to its purchasers during the negotiations.
<P>
It may be argued that the VAT information would pass from vendor to purchasing company automatically when the business is bought because the purchaser would take over the books and records. However, there are circumstances in which that would not happen. For example, a company might sell its business, but not the actual company, to a third party on 7 April. If that vendor company had a March year-end, it would have to retain its books and records to complete its audit for the previous year. There would still be a transfer of a going concern, but the agreement between the purchaser and vendor would mean that the vendor would have to keep the books and records.
<P>
Similarly, a company might wish to sell only part of its business. If that part could stand alone independently, the vendor company would have to keep its books and records because it was not getting rid of the whole business.
<P>
In such circumstances, the due diligence requirements when a company purchases a business from a third party would involve a considerable information-gathering exercise. That burden did not exist before the Bill was drafted or before the recent order was agreed. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that, as long as the purchaser company had made all reasonable inquiries of the vendor to ascertain that input VAT had been reclaimed on the assets, no penalty would be levied on that purchaser if it turned out later that the information compiled was inaccurate?

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): In the hon. Gentleman's example, what would prevent the vendor from passing on a photocopy of the relevant documents?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Yes, there are ways around the problem. However, under the new rules, transferring a business with many assets--100 cars, say, or large quantities of tiny items--could involve passing on enormous amounts of information that would not have been necessary previously. The provision therefore would place an enormous burden on business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's argument with interest. He is a great expert in these matters. If the government are determined to retain the clause, does not he think that it would be advisable for them to make it possible for a transferee--the purchasing company--to obtain a Customs and Excise certificate confirming whether input tax had been claimed on the items in question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Customs and Excise would be entitled to respond by saying that the administrative burden would be intolerable, but the proposal will impose just such a burden on the private sector. Given that this is a Government measure, it would seem only fair for them to shoulder that burden, rather than the private sector. Better still, the provision could be left out precisely because it imposes such a burden. That is not just my view. the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says that under certain circumstances
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a strict reading of the law may require a transferee to compute an output tax charge by reference to the cost of the asset to the earliest transferor in the chain.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So it goes on. In its view, it would help if Customs and Excise were prepared to accept an output charge computed on a fair and reasonable basis by reference to information in the transferee's possession.
<P>
The Institute of Directors states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Information on the cost of individual items and the recovery of VAT will have to be passed from the transferor of a business to the transferee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It believes that the burden on business of collating and passing on that information is likely to exceed the potential loss of revenue of &#163;1.5 billion.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This might be a good point to remind hon. Members of the simple rule that on the Floor of the House and in Committee, hon. Members may quote briefly or they may paraphrase, but they may not read large amounts into the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I apologise for that, Mrs. Dunwoody. Those bodies add weight to one's argument, but--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Not in this Committee with this Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall try in future to paraphrase.
<P>
To conclude, Opposition Members want to be sure that there is a genuine potential loss of revenue to the Exchequer and to Customs and Excise. We should like to be given examples so we can be sure that that is the case. The compliance burden is not just being imposed on the financial sector or on a small number of very large banks which may engage in this for the acquisition of large computer equipment, for example. Let us be sure that the country will not be over-burdened by the enormous compliance cost that the measure will impose on people trying to buy and sell businesses in the future. That cost must not exceed the genuinely estimated potential loss of revenue to the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Opposition Members have made a mountain out of a mole hill, particularly the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I shall deal with the specific questions first, and then turn to the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked, as he did in the statutory instrument Committee, why we had a statutory instrument and why it had been taken first. I explained on that occasion--although he seems to have forgotten--that one piece of legislation required an amendment to secondary legislation, while the other required an amendment to primary legislation. The former came into effect on 18 March to prevent forestalling and it therefore had to be debated within 28 days. That is the procedure of the House and that is why the statutory instrument came first.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the revenue--the &#163;1.5 billion--that will be protected by the VAT clauses. Overwhelmingly, that revenue is in this provision and the statutory instrument which forms its sister measure. As he will see, subsequent VAT clauses make quite small, technical changes.
<P>
I was asked in which sectors there could be avoidance. The answer is the finance sector--banks and insurance companies--and the education sector.
<P>
On compliance, the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that it was unlikely and unusual for companies to give away goods. I should tell him that Customs recently won a VAT tribunal case concerning a different loophole. A company gave goods away in an attempt to avoid VAT--precisely the mechanism that the hon. Gentleman said would not happen.
<P>
He went on to talk about increased burdens on business. The measure is designed to hit tax avoiders. It is unlikely to impact on genuine disposal of assets without an avoidance motive. To be caught, a person would have to buy goods as part of a business transfer and then give them away or put them to private use. Even then, such a person would be caught only if the previous owner has been unable to recover input VAT on purchasing the goods. If a business is caught, it will have to pay the usual VAT charge that is payable when goods are given away or put to private use.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman went on to ask how a person buying a business could tell whether a previous owner was entitled to recover input VAT. Usually, the new owner of a business will have necessary records following the business transfer to establish whether tax has been claimed on goods subsequently given away. If, for any reason, such an owner does not have that information, he or she will use common sense. In the absence of contrary evidence, the new owner will simply assume that the previous owner was entitled to recover the input VAT.
<P>
It is simply unrealistic to suggest that any significant administrative cost is associated with that simple process. I should caution the hon. Member for Runnymead and Weybridge, who suggested that there should be a certificate for the transferee. He expressed concern about compliance costs, but certification costs would have implications for business as well as for Customs. They are simply not necessary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton went on to ask for assurance that penalties will not be imposed following errors. There is no need for an assurance that misdeclaration of policies will not apply when a business has acted conscientiously but a mistake has been made. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that there is already a defence against the misdeclaration penalty where a business satisfies Customs that there is a reasonable excuse of error. If a business has, in the circumstances, made its best endeavours to get the VAT right, it would have no difficulty in convincing Customs of that. If such a business had any difficulty, it would be entitled to appeal to a VAT tribunal.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether such loopholes are genuine or theoretical. I have given an example of similar practice. Customs has evidence that the weakness is known to the private sector, although it does not believe that the scheme is as yet widespread. The Government are acting to prevent an important tax loss. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged the importance of anti-avoidance clauses and of defending the revenue.
<P>
Finally, I pray in aid the support of Deloitte Touche by briefly quoting from its assessment of the Budget with regard to VAT and indirect taxes. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The measures if sensibly applied are unlikely to have any impact on many businesses''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Many businesses'' means excepting those that are avoiders. That is the case with the clause, and I have explained why it is necessary and how it will work. I hope that the Committee will endorse it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Changes of place of supply: transitional</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): We now turn to a slightly different aspect of VAT. I should say for emphasis that the Opposition will also pray in aid Deloitte Touche later during consideration of the Bill. It may have approved the Budget in general, but a range of firms and institutes are telling us how unhappy they are with the detail.
<P>
As I understand the purpose of clause 22, it is intended to deal with those transactions that previously fell outside the United Kingdom. The measure will increase compliance costs for business, because it will cover some normal commercial payments, such as quarterly and annual bills. Will the Minister give us some reassurance about compliance costs?
<P>
I have two technical questions. First, if services are provided outside the United Kingdom and no invoice or document is issued, how will a VAT invoice or tax point be created? Secondly, if, as a result of the change, some overseas traders become liable to registration in the United Kingdom, how will Customs and Excise enforce its tax levy?
<P>
Finally, a strict application of the clause would impose a particular burden on lessors who will have to amend or reissue invoices covering the actual commencement date of 18 March. It would be a concession to business if Customs and Excise were to agree not to apply clause 22 to services that were pre-paid or invoiced before 18 March in the normal course of business. Will the Minister respond to that suggestion?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clause 22 is an anti-forestalling provision that relates to the rules that set out whether a supply of services is made in the UK for VAT purposes. It will allow us to consult in advance of changes when we signal an interest, without compromising the pre-payment provisions.
<P>
The Institute of Directors raised a point about contracts in its representations to us. The clause will only operate in combination with a change to the place of supply rules. It is not retrospective, but will act as a warning. It means that we do not need to use the forestalling regulation on every occasion when we consider place of supply.
<P>
Suppliers are normally required to account for VAT on their supplies in accordance with the rules that determine when those supplies are treated as having taken place. In relation to services, that is in many cases linked to when the services are actually performed. However, if a payment is received beforehand, the supply is treated as having taken place at that time. That means that people could avoid VAT by making pre-payments prior to a change in the place of supply rules for services, which brings into the UK's VAT net services that would formerly have been treated as having been outside it.
<P>
The clause's purpose is to prevent avoidance. It applies to any order made after 17 March 1998 which changes the place where a supply of services is treated as having been made, so that it is treated as occurring outside the UK. It will ensure that where payments are made for services before the starting date of such an order, but relate to services that are performed afterwards, VAT will be chargeable on all or part of those services from the starting date of the order. Time of supply will be determined according to the time at which the services are performed. Compliance costs will have a limited effect because of the nature of the services. The clause gives signals to business, hence minimising compliance costs. The clause is designed to help Customs and Excise and business to deal with such matters.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The notes on clauses explain why it is technically difficult in Scotland to define a ``major interest'' for the purposes of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 in the same way as a ``major interest'' is defined for other legal purposes and for value added tax purposes throughout the United Kingdom. I understand from the notes on clauses that the pactice of Customs and Excise, under extra statutory concession, has been to treat disposals of residential buildings on 20-year leases in Scotland as though they were disposals of a major interest. The clause is designed to formalise prevailing practice. The practical and revenue effects will therefore be nil.
<P>
However, a point of principle is at stake. Notwithstanding the Government's valiant attempts to render it otherwise, we still live in a united kingdom, and a substantial body of opinion believes that it is unhelpful and unnecessary to introduce differences in the taxation system between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Conservative Members see no reason why the definition of a ``major interest'' for value added tax purposes could not be reduced to 20 years throughout the United Kingdom, thus preserving the principle of common taxation and overcoming the technical problem in Scotland that the clause is designed to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The clause is important; I let my junior speak first on it. As he correctly points out, developers in England will be worse off than those in Scotland as a result of the clause. Major interest leases in England will still be defined by a term exceeding 21 years; it would be sensible to make it 20 years throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>
As I understand it, the press release was a revelation to the industry. It merely stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Until now, Customs have treated Scottish leases of 20 years in the same way as 21 year leases in England on a case by case basis''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was never a published concession. I understand that it has not appeared in a Customs and Excise notice. Why is it done on a case-by-case basis? What criteria have been applied? If the clause will give effect to an existing concession, surely that concession should be deemed to have always had effect up to this point?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This simple change provides that 20-year leases of housing in Scotland can be zero rated for VAT purposes. The clause will end an anomaly that has disadvantaged some developers who let properties on lease in Scotland because of the difference between the Scottish legal system and that in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked: why not change to 20 years for the whole of the United Kingdom? Requiring a lease to run for 21 years or longer in order for it to be zero rated causes no problems in the rest of the United Kingdom, where most property leases run for more than 25 years anyway, so there is no need to make that change. The hon. Gentleman also asked: will not that give Scottish developers an advantage over developers in the rest of the United Kingdom? In theory, it will give them a minor advantage, but in practice the change is necessary for them to be fairly treated in comparison with other UK developers. The clause is intended to regularise the practice inherited from the previous Government of recognising the difference between the legal system in Scotland and that in the rest of the UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I know that the Minister has had to deal with amendments all day, but we asked two final questions. First, was the concession published? Why was it not in any official Customs and Excise notice? If it was introduced on a case-by-case basis, what criteria were applied?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I inherited the situation from the previous Government. If the hon. Gentleman insists on an answer, he can get one in two ways: he can either ask the right hon. Member for Wells why the previous Government acted in that way, or I can write to him with a specific response. I will be happy to write to him.
