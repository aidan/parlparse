had just recounted an example of a company that was closing its factory
in my constituency to move the jobs to eastern Europe, and how I felt
that some of the issues around investment in new technology over the
years had caused that to happen. The point was debated by hon. Members
from all parts of the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to shift away from anecdotal evidence and ask the Minister questions
about other elements of evidence that I feel should inform the debate.
There is a picture of different Government interventions that make it
more or less likely for companies to choose to invest in better
technology, and therefore improve the productivity and success of our
economy. Some have already been mentioned: regional development
agencies and matters relating to general quality of life. I would like
to focus on the difference between corporation tax and investment
allowances, and what leads to investment in new technology.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
possible world where the Government no doubt believe that their
corporation tax will lead to all kinds of good effects. They obviously
think that lower corporation tax will lead to new businesses
starting—that may be so. They may think that lower corporation
tax will lead to companies using increased net profit, acquired through
paying less tax, to invest in some of the new technologies that I have
mentioned. There is a possible world, therefore, where the best way to
have investment in companies in British business is to cut corporation
tax. That may be true. It may also be the case that there is no link
between lower corporation tax and investment in technology. It may be
that actually increased profit is rarely used for investment in better
equipment and technology, unless specifically incentivised by
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those
are two possible worlds, and in the field of economics it is not
necessary to have a politically heated debate. It should be a matter of
evidence and demonstration. I would therefore like to ask the Minister
what research the Treasury has conducted into the correlation between
reduced corporation tax and investment, especially in technology, but
also in staff skills. Is it the case, either globally or historically
in this country, that where

                           </div>corporation tax has been reduced, investment in those two important
factors has increased? To my mind that is an entirely testable theory,
and it would be strange of us to make a decision without reference to
some of that evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000020">&#160;</a>

brings us back to the interventions made this morning by the hon.
Member for Watford, who is not here at the moment, on whether changes
in taxation lead to changes in behaviour. On the one hand, we heard in
an earlier debate that a 50p tax rate could change behaviour and result
in non-competitiveness. In this case, however, a reduction in capital
allowance will apparently not see a change in behaviour. I do not see
consistency in the Government’s
arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000021">&#160;</a>

intervention. My answer to her point is that we should go out and put
that to the test. We should look for evidence. We should find out what
academic research has been done, and what research has been done by the
excellent economists in the Treasury, about how such changes affect
behaviour in reality—not in a text book, not in theory, not in
our political debate and not as we argue about these things as Labour
versus Tories versus Liberal Democrats, but in reality. Otherwise, we
are taking a decision that is of very poor quality. So I ask the
Minister directly what evidence he has that the corporation tax cut
will, if the future resembles the past, lead to increased investment.
If there is such evidence, it would be welcome if the Treasury were to
share it. I have made a cursory, preliminary search to see if there is
any academic research to bear that out, but was unable to find it. If
there is such evidence it would be helpful if the Minister could share
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000022">&#160;</a>

disagreement with my right hon. Friend. Of course, my right hon.
Friend, as a shadow Minister, is not going to have the sort of evidence
for which I have asked the Minister. I mean, come on. I have asked the
Minister for the evidence because he is in charge of all the very able
Treasury economists who have produced the statistics, the data, the
correlation and the regression that will have led the Minister to
decide, I hope, that this is the best course of action. It is vital
that we put to one side the idea that there ought to be a blustery
party political, dogmatic debate about this. Policy made without
evidence is, in the best case scenario, just guessing, and in the worst
case scenario it is just ideology off the top of one’s
head.<a class="bkMark" name="11051329000002">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is therefore highly important that the Minister shares with us what
research has been done by the Treasury so that we can ensure that this
decision, which is so crucial for the good of business and therefore
for people’s jobs and quality of life, and for the
sustainability of our country, is being made with the best case and not

<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>just on instinct or guesswork. This is a question about what is most
likely to lead to investment. If we want a flat tax approach in which
the Government hand over responsibility for macro decisions to each
firm on a micro basis and hope that the framework is good enough to
support it, we should have proof that that approach is better. I think
that we should try to do what the investment allowances were designed
to do, and use our role as Government to intervene in the economy,
because it is necessary for the broader picture—for the macro
strategy—and for the impact on people’s lives that there
be investment in new technology, whether or not a particular firm
perceives that to be in its interests at the time.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000023">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I worry that
there is not enough of a picture being drawn about how the Government
will deal with some of these problems. If, two years down the line, we
have seen a falling away of investment, what will the Government do?
Will they change course on this? It is important that we set that out
now. We could have a Japan-like situation, where because of the very
severe drop that we have had in the economy, firms choose to keep a
larger amount of cash and choose to pay down debts rather than invest,
and they do not think about expansion because they are fearful of the
situation that was caused by a global crash. I would understand that
from the point of view of an individual firm. However, maybe there is a
role that the Government need to take to intervene, for the good of the
broader economy.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000024">&#160;</a>

Government intervention in the form of a direct corporation tax cut,
which my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has already
demonstrated goes to bigger companies at the expense of investment in
small companies, will go straight into the pockets of shareholders and
not be reinvested in companies? At least the investment allowances
would help the bottom line of the balance sheets and the profitability
of companies; one would know that a proportion of that had gone into
investment to grow the company. So there is a danger that this
particular Government intervention means that shareholder value goes up

of our future. We talked this morning about how we overcome the fact
that we have higher wages in this country. Research and development has
to be a huge part of that. How much of the tax handed back in this
corporation tax cut will be invested in skills and in assets that
increase profitability? The Minister has to tell us how he will monitor
that so that we can be sure that we take the right decision in

a complicated picture. Wales has a history of manufacturing that has
changed over time, but there are many new energy firms in north Wales
that might have made use of investment allowances and may or may not be
seeing high levels of profit at the moment. I think of some of the
enterprise that goes on in mid and west Wales around Trawsfynydd, which
I know very well. Those firms have done a huge amount of research and
development that has led to them purchasing new technologies to try to
drive forward our economy. Has the Treasury discussed these proposals
with the National Assembly for Wales, and what does it think the
collective impact will be? That is an interesting

people’s jobs and their quality of life. When I consider the
importance of thinking through all the details and ramifications of
this choice, it brings home to me how interconnected the economy is and
therefore how important it is that the Minister shares with us today
some further details about what monitoring of the investment picture he
will do. How does the Treasury think that is connected to tax cuts of
various kinds—specifically the corporation tax cut and the
reduction in these investment allowances? How does that play out in

In previous years, I might have put some questions to the regional
development agencies. Now that we do not have those houses of best
practice, knowledge and research, the Treasury needs to get a grip on
understanding the economy of all parts of the country. Economies
cluster very differently across different parts of the country. If the
Treasury does not have the expertise to monitor how the reduction in
investment allowances is affecting research and development, technology
and skills improvement, we are in real danger of too much of a
hands-off, step-back, laissez-faire attitude to our economy. It is not
that we do not want to make good decisions, we just do not invest in
the evidence and research to enable us to make
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000034">&#160;</a>

ask the Minister to share the evidence he has about changes to
investment allowances and corporation tax. What monitoring will there
be of how the reduction in investment allowances impacts as we go
forward in this important time for our economy? What might have been
the counterfactual situation, if we had kept things as they were? How
is the Treasury going to do its job for the whole country, not just the
economy to which it is closest, that of London and the south-east? How
is it going to do a good job for the whole country? How will it check
that the policies made in the Treasury are good ones that work for the

is important for the Minister to consider how the reduction in

to affect employment, and specifically different kinds of employment.
When a company invests in an asset or a new piece of kit to help it be
more productive, people will often be encouraged to get new
skills—a knock-on benefit of the investment—and the
growing company will have the confidence to employ younger people at
the beginning of their careers. It has never been more important to
encourage that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South
mentioned, we need to avoid the majority of the corporation tax cut
being handed back to shareholders. It should rather become part of a
productive business-led economy that can help solve some of the social
ills that are still with us from the recession, such as unemployment
and a lack of opportunities such as apprenticeships.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000036">&#160;</a>

your chairmanship, Mr Gale. I want to follow on from a number of
questions put to the Minister by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Delyn. My remarks concern the relationship between corporation tax and
tax allowances; the regional impacts, which are of particular concern
to my constituents; the view of the business community; and the impact
on the economy as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before coming
to the House, I was a councillor in my constituency for 27 years, and I
have had the pleasure  of being deputy leader of Gateshead
council for the past eight years. I have therefore
come to understand  the place well. In that time, the economy
of the area  has experienced significant changes. Employment
in  manufacturing has been taken away from very large
engineering companies such as Huwood, which manufactured

                           </div>equipment for use in coal mines. Since the necessary changes in the
market following the closures of the mines, Huwood is gone. It employed
several thousand people within my constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Across the
river, Parsons, a heavy engineering company, has been much reduced; it
now just ticks over as a business in the locality. Vickers, the
armaments manufacturer, which was at the height of its business in the
war period, employed 30,000 to 50,000 people on the River Tyne. There
were very large industrial engineering concerns in the
north-east—Clarke Chapman in my own constituency, Rolls-Royce
and Swan Hunter. The names are synonymous with the north-east region,
but sadly, all are now gone or much reduced.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am glad to
say that the nature of employment in the area has been much diversified
into many small and medium-sized enterprises. The Team Valley trading
estate, half of which is in my constituency and half of which is in
that of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson),
is typical of the north-east industrial market now. More than 20,000
people are employed in one industrial estate in the heart of Tyneside,
but mostly by small and medium-sized enterprises. Those companies
employ 100, 150 or 250 people. It is their concerns that I am here to
reflect, because those businesses will impact on the potential of the
north-east region’s economy and, within the private sector, they
will help it to grow out of the
recession.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000041">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is clearly setting out the
challenges that we in the north-east face. I recognise that picture
well, because it is very much the same in my constituency. There has
been a move from traditional heavy industry, such as the mines and the
next-door shipyards, to a mixed picture and a diversified economy. Does
he share my concern that the Government do not seem to understand the
challenges faced in the different regions and do not appear to have a
strategy to deal with them? They certainly do not have an active
industrial policy, which would encourage growth in the private sector,
which they say they want.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000042">&#160;</a>

pre-empted a comment I was about to make. We have referred in previous
debates to the differentiated approach that is required to stimulate
the economy in different parts of the country. From the
Opposition’s view, it seems as though the Government, or their
Ministers, find the concept of regions alien. They do not seem to like
the concept, or the idea of having a differentiated regional policy, so
one wonders whether they have a devil-take-the-hindmost
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000043">&#160;</a>

the 1980s; the Metro centre, which is a significant development in the
adjoining constituency to mine, was developed on the back of such a
zone. Unfortunately, however, the enterprise zone established a
shopping centre, and it did not establish growth in the local economy.
In fact, there was a significant amount of displacement from other
parts of the regional economy. There is a concern that the policy of
enterprise zones could lead in that direction
again.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000051">&#160;</a>

It is interesting that we are comparing and contrasting enterprise
zones with capital allowances, given that capital allowances offer a
company the opportunity to set up anywhere. Enterprise zones are
restrictive, in that companies must set up in a specific, limited,
localised area, which may or may not suit
manufacturing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000054">&#160;</a>

point that I want to develop about small and medium-sized engineering

orders and business on the back of the development of the Hitachi plant
at Sedgefield. We have been led to believe that, down the line, the
Government expect some 5,000 to 7,000 supply-chain jobs to come from
that particular venture into the development of high-speed trains, and
we are delighted that it is coming our
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000055">&#160;</a>

return to the issue of enterprise zones. Does he share my dismay at the
confusion about the location of enterprise zones and what
industry-specific work they will be able to do? I do not think that the
Chancellor helped matters much when he announced during the Budget that
the enterprise zone for part of the north-east would be on Tyneside.
That appeared not to be the case. As a Wearside MP, I was certainly
rather concerned to

zone allowed the local authority in the area, Gateshead council, to
attract many millions of pounds of derelict land reclamation grant. It
was on the back of that work by the council that Sir John Hall did the
work to develop the Metro centre. Without that work first being done by
the local authority, albeit with a central Government grant, that land
would probably have remained toxic until this day. It was a genuine

point. The different Government policies, including the changes in tax
allowances, the eradication of the regional development agency, and the
very strange rules that have been drawn up for bids to the regional
growth fund, which to a large extent have ruled out bids from local
small and medium-sized enterprises, the picture for the north-east in
the medium term is not hopeful. There is a great deal of unease among
the business community about the Government’s attitude towards
the regions and the sort of manufacturing enterprises that exist
there.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000064">&#160;</a>

about the strategy is echoed by a number of different organisations.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies said in its “Green

will benefit a region like the north-east. We had a fairly large
financial institution in the north-east of England called Northern
Rock. It followed the pattern of many financial institutions across the
country and invested in dodgy batches of triple A-rated loans from
other parts of the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000067">&#160;</a>

am concerned that the largest impact on those firms with
capital-intensive operations will not be positive. The IFS also agrees
that<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000068">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for Sefton Central referred to the Chartered
Institute of Taxation earlier. The Government’s growth strategy
seems to believe that the most important driver of economic growth is
creating a low corporate tax jurisdiction for multinationals, but there
is much more to a growth strategy than this. I am concerned about the
reliance on multinationals to grow the British economy. I fervently
believe that helping small and medium-sized enterprises to grow from
within would be a much more stable growth pattern for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000070">&#160;</a>

move capital around the world to where they will get the best return,

                           </span> We have heard compelling
evidence about how the proposals of a change to capital allowances
combined with a cut in corporation tax will impact on the economy. The
Government have a stated aim of deficit reduction in five years. To
achieve that, they have cut public spending by unprecedented amounts,
raised VAT and taken a range of other measures. The reduction in
capital allowances combined with the cutting of writing down
allowances, which was in a previous clause that was debated last week,
removes the slight benefit of the corporation tax cut for SMEs,
especially, but not exclusively, those in manufacturing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In Sefton,
many small businesses need support at this stage of the economic cycle
in order to grow and stimulate the kind of recovery and growth in jobs
that are needed to offset the very large losses in the public sector.
The 30% cut in Sefton council’s funding is producing great
hardship, not just for those people who have lost their jobs but for
the small businesses in the area that depend on those people as their
customers. The proprietor of one small business in the building
industry was telling me recently that he would love to expand. He is
ideally placed to benefit from the higher level of capital allowances
that are in place at the moment. His business, which is typical of the
type of business that benefits from capital allowances at the higher
rate of £100,000, will significantly lose out by this measure
and will benefit very slightly from the reduction in corporation tax
because he does not make vast profits. Put together, the measures
penalise the SME sector disproportionately compared with large
business.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000075">&#160;</a>

this stage of the economic cycle, we need not just cuts but investment
if we are to see the kind of growth that is needed for long-term
deficit reduction. The loss of customers who work in the public sector
is a key problem for small businesses across the country. It is
becoming increasingly clear that the lack of a growth strategy will
lead to big problems for SMEs across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000076">&#160;</a>

Evidence clearly shows that we need the SME sector to drive growth, and
as my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland
said, we need that growth from the small business sector to encourage
the larger businesses as well. Sadly, the measures are aimed at helping
the big business sector and the multinationals in this country at the

take on more apprentices, but are finding that difficult in the current
climate. What is compounding the problem is the fact that public sector
contracts are drying up, whether from local authorities or housing
associations. One local electrical contractor in my constituency, Alex
Scullion, has made that clear and has had to lay off apprentices. It is
a difficult picture all round for SMEs, and surely the Government want
all possible measures to be put in place to support the development and

difficult time from 2009 onwards, and without it a far greater number
of people—whether they are in electrical contracting, directly
in the building trade or suppliers—would have gone to the wall.
The short-term decisions that the Government are taking are simply not
the right ones. We need to look carefully at stimulating growth in the
construction industry.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000090">&#160;</a>

Again, that emphasises the need for measures such as a repeat of the
tax on banking bonuses to be invested at this stage of the economic
cycle. Looking at the link between the cut in corporation tax and the
changes in allowances, I think that Members on both sides of the
Committee would accept that in principle the cut in corporation tax is
beneficial to business and to the economy. As someone who ran a small
business for many years before coming to this place, I know it is the
sort of measure that was certainly beneficial when the previous Labour
Government gradually implemented it over a number of years. The trouble
is that in those businesses that really need it, it is being blown out
of the water by the changes in capital allowances. I believe the
evidence shows that £2.6 billion will be lost in the cuts in
investment allowances as a result of clauses 10, 11 and 12, which
penalise such businesses at a time when they can least afford
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000091">&#160;</a>

do not contribute to rebalancing the economy. That is the nub of the
Opposition’s argument. Bigger investment allowances help small
manufacturing firms expand and build capacity, but that will go out of

summarise, the Government announced an additional 1p cut in corporation
tax over and above the changes announced in the previous Budget. The
June Budget set out a corporation tax cut of 4p implemented over the
next four years, but these corporation tax cuts are paid for, in large
part, by slashing investment allowances that encourage businesses to
take a longer-term view. The UK should have a competitive tax regime
and a corporation tax cut should, in principle, help this, but the
Government are paying for it by slashing investment allowances by
£2.6 billion and the package penalises companies who invest,
particularly in manufacturing, in order to offer tax cuts that
disproportionately benefit the banks. At a time when the Government
claim to be rebalancing the economy by encouraging manufacturing, this
package does the
reverse.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000098">&#160;</a>

promoting a Budget for growth. It must have been the first Budget for

Gentleman, who always makes a very useful contribution. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West, to whom he refers,
represents my neighbouring constituency and I would never disagree with
anything he says, but let us take it away from the politicians and into
the hands of the Office for Budget Responsibility who said clearly,
with the figures they produced on the back of the Budget, that growth
in this country would fall in every year of this cycle and unemployment
would increase. The figures from the independent Office for Budget
Responsibility, set up by the Chancellor himself, show quite clearly
that the growth figures have gone down, as my right hon. Friend would,
I am sure, acknowledge. It is written in black and white in the Office
for Budget Responsibility’s documents: 2.6% to 1.7%. I believe
that part of that reduction in growth comes from some of the decisions
that have been made and if we are looking to rebalance the economy,
surely the best way of doing that is to take away some of the levers
that the large multinationals—in particular, the financial
sector—have on the economy and put them into the hands of small
businesses and manufacturing businesses who use investment allowances
to grow their
business.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000102">&#160;</a>

I mentioned this morning, Mr. Gale, under the fine
chairmanship of Mr Hood—I am sorry you were not here and I would
be delighted if my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn wanted to go
over exactly the same points again later for your own
edification—the profitability of companies comes from
investment. If we are only looking at cutting corporation tax cut for
large companies and companies in the financial sector, we are doing a
disservice to the real drivers of the economy, who want to create
employment and growth. Those drivers of the economy—companies
that use investment allowances to invest—invest to drive up
their profits. Therefore, the corporation tax cut, while welcome, comes
at the end of the stage for their companies and not at the beginning in
terms of some of the financial services
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the
particular point, many companies at the moment are using working
capital to invest in infrastructure because the banks are not lending
to them. When we challenge the banks about their lending, they tell us
that the money is there and that the companies are not coming forward
for it. Perhaps that is a symptom of the fact that they are worried
about the future and their profits. If investment allowances were still
in place at a far more generous level than the Government are looking
at at the moment, perhaps companies would borrow money from banks to
invest. But why would they if they are not going to get investment
allowances and are worried about their bottom line and profits? In my
constituency and experience, many small businesses look week to week to
make sure that they can pay the salaries of their employees, rather
than investing in large-scale machinery. That can only be turned around
by telling companies that the Government are right behind them in terms
of their business investment aims.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The issue
about investment allowances also flies somewhat in the face of the
Government’s entrepreneurial relief. Entrepreneurs are creating
businesses from scratch to drive growth and employment in the country,
and the entrepreneurial reliefs that the Government have put in place
are incredibly welcome in terms of extending that. However, the
entrepreneurs will be looking at this and saying, “We want to be
able to invest in the infrastructure and machinery of our
businesses,” and the investment allowances that are written down
over time certainly help them to do so. There is, therefore, a little
bit of a contradiction in the Government’s policy of driving
growth through private business.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000107">&#160;</a>

will not benefit from the corporation tax cut, but will in effect face

is Sellex Galileo, which has been branching out for many years into the
space industry and developing products within it. Although they do not
directly fall under investment allowances because most of their work is
done through research and development, much of what they produce is
done through subsidiary companies and other suppliers in the supply
chain. When they come up with a new idea and technology that allows
them to develop something, they need the supply chain companies to
manufacture it. In many cases, the only way they can do that is by
investment allowances to allow those supply chain companies to invest
in the equipment they require. Surely that is the way that we need to
work in terms of running around the investment allowances to create

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes probably the starkest point
that we have heard this afternoon about investment allowances and the
supply chain. I say that because if we consider the Government’s
quest for export-related growth we can see that one of the reasons
Germany has been able to outstrip most of mainland Europe in increasing
exports to drive its economy is because it has a well established
supply chain, particularly in the car industry. The Business,
Innovation and Skills Committee recently visited China to see how the
UK could best put policies in place to export goods to China, the
largest growing market. One of the key things that emerged from that
trip is that the supply chains in the UK are either broken or the major
companies that are using the supply chains are finding it very
difficult to find suppliers.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The car
industry is one of the key examples. Earlier, one of my hon. Friends
mentioned the engines and other products that are developed in this
country. Those can only be made with a supply chain that is fitting and
able to supply major companies. If we are considering a corporation tax
cut for the large companies that will benefit from such a cut, we must
also consider that they need a supply chain in place. If a large
company says, “We require product X,” it would be in the
interest of the Government to ensure that the supply chain company that
can supply that product has the financial support that it needs. Then
the supply chain company could invest in what are sometimes risky
pieces of machinery that will benefit it in the long term without
having to consider whether or not it will enjoy a corporation tax cut
in the future rather than having its board decide on a particular
investment allowance at that time. I think that that would
help.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A lot of
companies in supply chains across the UK are in that position at the
moment. My friend the hon. Member for Bristol West made the point that
investment allowances enable companies such as those in supply chains
to invest with a greater degree of security, knowing that they can
write off an asset over a period of time through those investment
allowances rather than hoping that the profitability and the
sustainability of the particular product that they have been asked to
produce creates additional profit in the future that they can benefit
from in the form of a corporation tax cut.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000114">&#160;</a>

very well with the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral
South made about supply chains in her intervention. It gives people a
certain degree of security that the value of the asset they are being
asked to develop allows them to make that investment decision over a
longer period of time, rather than their having to look at the
bottom-line balance sheet in terms of where the corporation tax cut
might come in.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let us
consider the car scrappage scheme. In a lot of instances, the way that
that scheme operated was almost like a reverse investment allowance for
the public, because the Government said, “We will allow you to
scrap your old car for a certain amount of funds that you can then put
towards a new car.” That not only allowed the car industry to be
supported but helped to get older cars and cars that were probably less
environmentally friendly off the road. With that scheme, the Government
were essentially saying to the general public, “We will give you
an investment allowance of x amount of cash through the framework of
Government, in order for you to make that investment in a far more
environmentally friendly vehicle, which will then support the car
industry.” That was almost an investment allowance in reverse
for the public. That clearly showed that when policies like that are
put in place, they not only support employment and growth in the
country, but support the public in buying new goods, including more
environmentally friendly
cars.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second company I would like to look at in connection with clause 11 is
the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh, a world leader in providing
technology and manufacturing support to the EELT. That is an acronym
for something incredibly complex and scientific: the European
extra-large telescope. That telescope, based in Chile, is 42 metres
wide and will be the largest piece of infrastructure in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such
institutions are not covered by the same investment allowance and
corporation tax profile, but their supply chain is. The Royal
Observatory has developed a 42-metre mirror that is operated on many
small arms. One can imagine it in the desert in Chile pointing at the
sky, trying to find a Liberal Democrat left in an English council, and
stars that it can then look at. This 42-metre mirror has to move across
the sky to identify something unimaginably far away. The Observatory
has had to develop 128 arms to go around the mirror to take that piece
of technology. That requirement had to be put to a supplier in the
chain, which had to invest in microscopic manufacturing tools to make
that incredibly complex piece of equipment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">From the
perspective of the directors of that supplier, they have to decide
whether to invest in a piece of technology that may never come to
fruition. Of course, in Edinburgh and at the Royal Observatory, we all
hope that it does. However, from the perspective of that supplier, the
question is, whether to invest in it itself—in the hope that the
technology works, and profits increase, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 126<a class="bkMark" name="Column126">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with a welcome accompanying corporation tax benefit—or whether to
invest in its own business, company and reputation, to be able to
create profits for the future, through some proper investment
allowances. There is a very keen and real issue about where companies
will invest in the supply chain to be able to make those technologies
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
third point relates to my own business, something I mentioned this
morning. We were driving back through the Scottish borders one Sunday
with a friend who had been made redundant from a financial institution.
As we drove past a derelict hotel bearing a banner that said
“Save us from the greedy developers”, the friend made a
flippant, throwaway suggestion that we should rescue it. Six weeks
later we were in our overalls and on our hands and knees cutting tiles
and sorting out the establishment. We got support through various
organisations to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason I
highlight that is that when a company is faced with a decision to
invest in new equipment, it takes that decision in the round, with the
last thing in mind the bottom-line profit. Making profit is the bonus,
but getting there is the key. When making these decisions, it is a case
of whether to buy the £2,000 range for the kitchen or the
£1,000 range and develop a different menu. It has to be decided
whether to put various things into the infrastructure of the business
such as till systems or an abacus. That kind of investment decision is
made by companies all the time, on the basis of what will benefit the
company and what will take the profitability of the company forward. A
company is based on growth, employment and
jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hotel was
sold some time ago, but I believe it still operates profitably. It must
have at least 30 staff and supports the local community. I am not
saying that investment allowances were the be-all and end-all of that,
but they allowed decisions to be made at the coalface to go towards the
profitability of the company in the longer term. Investment allowances
are critical to that. Anyone who has been in
business—manufacturing or hospitality—where they have had
to invest money in upgrading infrastructure or technology would welcome
investment allowances. Nobody in business would tell you otherwise. The
business that I ran for that period of time never made a profit, so a
corporation tax cut would not have benefited us, but the writing-off of
investment allowances did. That is very much
key.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000124">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman actually makes a good point,
and although he makes it flippantly, it is worth considering. Many
businesses, in fact the vast majority, do not make any money, let alone
massive profits. They survive on their ability to generate income to
keep the business going. When we took the hotel on, it already had a
massive debt infrastructure. We turned it into less of a debt
infrastructure and passed it on to someone who, no doubt, is making a
profit out of it now. Business is not necessarily about buying an apple
for £1, selling it for £2 and pocketing the £1.
What is important is where someone takes a business from and where they
take it to.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the process
of leading a business from A to B, investment allowances inform part of
the decisions that make businesses suitable for sale. Our object with
the business in my example was to turn a derelict hotel, which some
landowner in the borders was looking to demolish in order to build
flats, into a community facility—it is a well used hotel for
tourists and the community alike. Yes, its profitability was never
forthcoming, but that was not our aim, and we sold the business on to
someone who has taken it on and made a profit. It now employs 30-odd
staff. I think that doing that is more valid than making flippant
remakes about why I came into politics. I came into politics to create
jobs in communities such as the one I represent, not to make flippant
remarks about whether people are here because they have nothing better
to do. The Finance Bill Committee feels like that for all the right
reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000127">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That highlights how businesses are not hugely
profitable sometimes, but Skype, although under a different regime,
will have made investment decisions in order to make the company worth
£4 billion. That does not necessarily mean that the bottom-line
profit of that company is anything other than in the red, but when have
companies ever been bought and sold differently? The only way that

thought: next year, if one of the hospitality companies in Edinburgh
was looking to invest in modernising its equipment, but chose not to
make that investment because it faced a cut in capital allowances and
fragile spending power for the hospitality and retail sector, would
that help the economy?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000130">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My right hon. Friend is right. That would not help
the economy grow. Looking at the specifics of the hospitality industry
at the moment, we can see that the major problem is lack of consumer
confidence, and that is for a variety of reasons, 95% of which are the
responsibility of the current Government—VAT, the threat of
unemployment, the cut in public sector jobs and so on. Consumer
confidence is not feeding through to those companies’
profitability or their ability even to break even. If they are not
allowed to take investment decisions to provide a different offer or to
become a better company, they will not see the corporation tax cut
because they will never get to that stage of profitability. That is one
of the key elements of this package of measures, which are not about
growth but about some other issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have two
other points, one of which is about the banks themselves. Edinburgh is
one of the largest financial centres, not just in Europe, but in the
world. I think I made this point earlier, but it is key: now that the
Scottish National party has taken majority control in Scotland, it is
looking to wrestle responsibility for corporation tax from the UK
Government. That is the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 128<a class="bkMark" name="Column128">&#160;</a>
                           </div>wrong thing to do, but the party is doing it because it knows that the
independence discussions and the uncertainty about the constitutional
settlement would make the major banking and financial institutions,
which employ hundreds of thousands of people in Edinburgh and the
surrounding area, and support employment all over the country, take
fright and flee. The Scottish Government want control of corporation
tax so that they can give those banking and financial institutions a
corporation tax cut to keep them where they
are.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000132">&#160;</a>

pm<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000367">&#160;</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
shows us that corporation tax cuts are best targeted at low-manufacture
and high-profit companies that are not able to spend money on
investment allowances—helping the big guys but not the small
guys. The only way to help the latter is to improve the supply chains,
and the only way to do that is to give small businesses the investment
allowances they need to invest in new technologies and new ways of
working, and improve their
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point is on employability and skills. Up until the worldwide
economic crash, youth unemployment in my constituency sat at 0.01%, and
we had, I think, only 14 long-term unemployed young people, because of
the various programmes in place to get them back to work, including the
new deal and the JET—job education training—programme.
That ladder of opportunity has now been kicked away, in terms of higher
education and the future jobs fund, and we need to find new ways of
skilling people. The best way to reskill young people in particular is
for a manufacturing organisation to invest in a new piece of technology
and reskill its current work force, and then provide apprenticeships
and the reskilling of young people so that the organisation has the
confidence to bring them in.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This is all
part of the same package. The lack of investment allowances means that
if a company does not invest in a particular piece of new technology,
the new jobs do not come and the ability to have young people skilled
in the new technology is not there, creating a vicious circle of lower
growth and lower employment. If this is about a Budget for growth, the
key is to combine corporation tax cuts with capital allowances, which
are so crucial if businesses are to invest in jobs and the future. That
is why the amendment is critical in ensuring that the Government
properly focus on growth instead of solely on their
friends.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000135">&#160;</a>

lacking the confidence to invest in the future because the Government
cuts are going too far, too fast. If we are to rebalance the economy we
need to increase investment, which in Britain has always been low
compared with some other countries. Cutting investment allowances does
nothing to ensure that the corporate surplus goes into investment in
Britain. This Chancellor goes down in history not only as a Chancellor

have to get the regime right in this country now. It is no good looking
at what has gone on in the past; we have to get it right now, and we
have to get the right policies in place. That is why issues such as

Manufacturing is suffering most—and this is why it is the
squeezed middle in this context—because we have banks that are
unwilling to lend to firms, and we have a Government who, rather than
giving a helping hand, have a closed fist. Therefore, firms are
squeezed on the very elements of finance legislation that allow them to
get that investment in.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000143">&#160;</a>

voice of manufacturing is not being heard properly. I also welcome the
earlier intervention made by the hon. Member for Watford, who reminded
us that manufacturing has faced challenges over time. However, if we
look at the previous Government’s record in responding to those
challenges—infrastructure was put in place around regional
development agencies, and capital investment opportunities were created
through capital allowances—there was a different approach from
the one that there is now. That is why this is a very challenging time
and why it is so important that the amendment in the name of my right

learn lessons from recoveries from big recessions—for example,
from what happened to the Japanese economy in the 1990s. Richard Koo,
of the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, said that after
the Japanese recession, at the turn of the decade many businesses
remained in what he described as a “balance sheet
recession”, preferring to pay down debt and protect cash flows,
yet to shun investment. That is the danger that we currently face. That
is why the capital allowance system encourages businesses not to go
down that route. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South spelled
out how businesses need these incentives to encourage them in the
direction in which we want them to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000148">&#160;</a>

stave off the worst vestiges of decline, but bump along the bottom,

higher in countries that have a higher investment in social and
intellectual assets, as well as good capital infrastructures. That is
the point she is underlining. That is why countries such as Germany

                           </div>and Korea have prospered in recent years. The Government are in danger
of having too simplistic a view, thinking that cutting corporation
taxes will automatically lead to investment. All the evidence from the
research demonstrates that that will not necessarily happen. There
needs to be an investment strategy. To cut investment allowances at
this time sends completely the wrong
message.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Capital
allowances are a significant part of the support infrastructure for
business. They can boost investment and they need to be retained. If
the Government fail to raise business investment then our economy could
stagnate over a prolonged period. None of us want that. It is crucial
that these discriminating tools of fiscal policy allow capital
allowances to incentivise investment at a time of low business
confidence. That is exactly what we need. The danger of this proposal,
which reduces capital allowances, is that it gives completely the wrong
message and the wrong driver to the economy at this sensitive time. I
hope that all members of the Committee reflect on the far-reaching
debate we have been having today, and support my right hon.

again, Mr Gale? My hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe mentioned the
squeezed middle. In this context, manufacturing is the squeezed middle
between the banking sector and the Government. Clauses 11
and 12 propose a reduction in capital allowances, as part of a blend of
policies that either make balanced good sense or are predisposed with
the desires of one or more dominant sectors, which are having greater
influence on this Budget and these Treasury policies than
others.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000152">&#160;</a>

want to ask the Ministers present a number of questions. Are the
reduced capital allowances based on available evidence? Is there any
evidence the Ministers can give the Committee now or at a later stage
for that proposal? Are reduced capital allowances, balanced with
corporation tax, favourable or not to SMEs? What has the SME community
said about the reduction in capital allowances? What is the regional
impact of the reduction in capital allowances, particularly on my
region of the north-east? Yes, we have a large public sector in the
north-east, but we also have a large heavy manufacturing sector,
particularly in my area around Teesside and Teesport north and south of
the river. What effect will the reduction in capital allowances have on
the chemical industry? We have to remember that the UK’s largest
export product is chemicals. The chemical sector makes up 30% of this
country’s
exports.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000153">&#160;</a>

evidence is there for the Government taking on these policies in
response to cyclical industrial patterns per sector and per industry?
How do the Government believe that after a year of reduced growth rates
this policy is helping de-risk the market? We see across the pond in
America a policy of intensive investment over the last two years. Yes,
they have now come up with a far more austere budget, once they have
obtained growth, but we have revised growth figures down and down and
down over the last 12 months. How are we de-risking the market with a

in the CBI are far more dominant than others, and
simply quoting the CBI in relation to capital allowances or other
Treasury policies is not good enough. What consultation have the
Minister and the ministerial team had with the Chemical Industries
Association? The North East of England Process Industry Cluster? Tata?

policy ensure domestic demand? We have talked about manufacturing
growth; yes, it has grown, but not back to the stable levels we saw
three or four years ago. It has grown back. How does this policy, in
relation to capital allowances, generate domestic demand? We are seeing
the effects of a drop in domestic demand in my area, and in that of my
hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe. There are dangerously low levels
of domestic demand, from which certain internal sectors within
particular industries are suffering more.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would
compare that effect to the BRIC nations—Brazil, Russia, India
and China. While the Government, to a certain extent, and the banks for
a number of years, have applied a credit squeeze here, we are now
seeing credit squeezes in places such as China and India. Will the
manufacturing boost that we have benefited from  in the last 10
to 12 months continue? Without capital allowances to soften the blow
come quarter 3 or quarter 4, when the Chinese and Indian
credit squeeze on consumption for industrial product tightens, what do
we have in place to pick up the pieces? It will occur, especially as
countries such as China and India are cornering markets such as iron
ore and oil. China has only just got into an oilfield around Cuba,
which was ignored for political as well as industrial reasons—it
is high in sulphur. They are now investing there to take that oil, and
also purchasing as much coke and iron ore as they can around the world.

industries, whereas the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and

none of the policies under discussion conform to that type of view. It

in 1996, when I was 16 or 17, I was an agency worker at Lionweld
Kennedy, which is a steel components firm in Middlesbrough. I was a
fettler and grinder—a glamorous title. I had to take beams of
steel or architectural platforms and file them down to smooth
components. I did not know it at the time—unfortunately, the
company had very few employees and was not allowed to unionise
us—but that role was at one of the highest risks, perhaps, for
vibration white finger. I was a 16 or 17-year-old who had gone away to
try to make as much money as possible to help me go  to
university and so on, and I was not aware of the risks to my own
health. If it had wanted to, the company on site could, through capital
allowances, have tapped into funds or made those capital investments
for free, lessening the risk to my health as well as the risk to its
pocket of potential future

vibration were everywhere. People were working on presses that were

                           </strong> We
have had a lengthy and thorough debate on clause 11 and amendments 6
and 7. As we have heard, clause 11 reduces the maximum amount of annual
investment allowance to £25,000 from April 2012. I
shall come on to amendments 6 and 7 shortly, but I want first to set
out the reasons for changing the
AIA.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
AIA enables businesses to claim full tax relief on most plant and
machinery expenditure in the year in which it is incurred. Clauses 10
and 12 make related changes to the capital allowances regime, with
changes to the main rate and special rate of writing-down allowances
and a doubling of the disposal period to extend the scope of the
short-life asset
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reduction of the AIA was announced in the June 2010 Budget. Since April
2008, businesses regardless of size have been able to claim the AIA on
up to £50,000 of their expenditure each year on most plant and
machinery, with the maximum increased to £100,000 from April
2010. Businesses are able to claim the AIA in respect of their
expenditure on both general and special rate plant and machinery. So,
in effect, the AIA is a 100% allowance that applies to qualifying
expenditure up to an annual
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
change in clause 11 will contribute towards a reduction in the main and
small profits rates of corporation tax, which will provide strong
support for enterprise and growth in the UK. It is fair to say, as the
right hon. Member for Delyn has acknowledged throughout, that the
provision is part of a package and has to be viewed in that
context.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
corporate tax package announced in the June Budget will create a
competitive corporate tax system and help ensure that the world knows
that the UK is open for business. The AIA has always been designed to
provide SMEs with help on simplification and cash flow. That will
continue to be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
95% of all businesses will continue to have all of their annual capital
expenditure covered by the AIA. Those businesses that invest more than
£25,000 will continue to be eligible for plant and machinery
writing-down allowances on expenditure not covered by the
AIA.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition’s argument is that somehow this step is anti-small
business. I must stress that 95% of businesses will be unaffected by
the change. They will continue to be able to claim all their capital
allowances under the existing AIA
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000172">&#160;</a>

the corporation tax rate from 21% to 22% as the previous Government
planned to do, we are reducing it to 20%. We are expanding the SME R
and D tax credits regime from 175% to 200% this year, and from 200% to
225% next year, which is as generous a regime as can be found anywhere
in the world. We are increasing the size of qualifying companies and
making other improvements within the EIS and VCT regime. We are
extending the small business rate relief holiday, which will benefit
more than 500,000 small businesses, for a further year from 1 October
2011. This Government have a proud record in providing support to small
businesses. Given that Opposition Members would have increased the
level of corporation tax on small businesses, I am not sure that their
complaints sit terribly
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000175">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
also heard an argument that the measures are an attack on
manufacturing. This Government take manufacturing seriously. The hon.
Member for Wirral South was absolutely right to say that sometimes
people knock manufacturing in this country and say, “All the
manufacturing has gone.” When she visits an Airbus factory near
her constituency—in the constituency of the right hon. Member
for Delyn—she sees an example of UK manufacturing that is the
best in the world. I was struck by the quote from Airbus, which said,
“Without us, it is just a bus.” Airbus is hugely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Despite the
fact that there are a number of very successful manufacturing
businesses in the UK, there has been a certain amount of talking down
of manufacturing here. The hon. Member for Scunthorpe, who is normally
moderate and careful in his words, talked about the squeeze in
manufacturing and the lack of optimism in manufacturing. The EEF
predicts that manufacturing will grow by 3.5% this year and engineering
by 7%, and these forecasts have recently been revised upwards. In
March, the CBI
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000177">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is well documented that the OBR could not
factor in the 1p additional corporation tax cut because the Chancellor
brought it to the table too late before his Budget. Indeed, many
commentators suggested that he may have panicked about the cut. Would
the Minister not contend that, rather than making that additional
corporation tax cut on top of what had already been announced to make
the UK one of the most competitive countries in Europe in terms of
corporation tax, it would have been better to reassess the investment
allowances part of that to give a little more flexibility to the
industries that we have been considering this
afternoon?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000181">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When the Chancellor announced his package of
policies in June 2010—and this addresses the point raised by the
hon. Member for Wirral South about the modelling—the OBR looked
at the impact of the corporation tax package on business investment. It
modelled that, using the average reduction in tax rates and academic
evidence from the UK and around the world as well as business
investment responses. It forecast a future business investment increase
of £13 billion by 2016. The OBR report in that Budget makes that
very clear. It confirms that the growth of business investment and the
intentions for further increases are based on information from
businesses themselves. It stated that the reductions in the rate of
corporation tax underpin its forecast for strong business investment
growth over the next five years. It was argued that businesses do not
necessarily want that, but it is worth quoting the British Chambers of
Commerce in a survey of its members last
year:<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Asked
about corporation tax, 90% of companies stated that the Government
should proceed with lowering the headline rates at the expense of tax
allowances.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also worth considering the previous Administration’s record
on enhanced capital allowances. They conceded that the effects on
investment of enhanced capital allowances are probably modest. When
they introduced the generous temporary 40% first-year allowances for
all businesses for 2009-10, the increase in investment was estimated to
be less than 1%. We believe that we are getting the balance right. It
is right that we move forward in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
6 would seek to reduce the AIA to its original value of £50,000.
Although I understand the reasoning behind such a proposal, we do not
believe that it is the right way to support business, and it would
involve disrupting the overall package for business that we have set
out. The changes that we are making within the corporation tax package
will, as I said, encourage additional investment of £13 billion
by the end of this Parliament. The manufacturing sector will benefit
from the reductions in corporation tax to the tune of
£700 million each year by 2015.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I must make
this point, as I made it in the context of the changes to the
writing-down allowance. We have heard several passionate speeches from
the Opposition. 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>In 2007, the Labour Government cut capital allowances and reduced the
writing-down allowance much more substantially than we have done to
fund a reduction in the CT headline rate. We think that we have done
the right thing, because it was important to reduce our corporation tax
rate, but from listening to the Opposition today, all that appears to
be forgotten. The industrial buildings allowance was scrapped, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire highlighted; so was
the agricultural buildings allowance. It is worth reminding the
Opposition of that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have heard
the Opposition argue that we should reverse the policy, but we have not
heard anything about what the cost would be. I will enlighten the
Committee. In 2013-14, the cost of amendment 6 would be
£300 million, and for the years following, it would
be £250 million. I am aware that all spending commitments
proposed by the Opposition must be agreed by the shadow Chancellor and
the Leader of the Opposition, but I am not sure whether that applies to
tax expenditures. <em>[Interruption.]</em> Well, we have heard a lot of
passionate speeches in support of amendment 6, and I am sure that when
it comes to it, there will be voices calling for a Division. We will
note that
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, fewer than 1% of all businesses would benefit from amendment 6,
and 95% of businesses’ capital expenditure would still be
covered by the AIA. Any compromise on our planned reduction in the rate
of corporation tax would affect not only businesses directly but the
approach to encouraging business. It would also contradict the
position, which I warmly welcomed, professed by the right hon. Member
for Delyn only last week, which was that he was in favour of the
reductions in corporation
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is no evidence to suggest that such a change would have any significant
impact on investment. We think that it is right to focus the
simplification and cash flow benefits of this valuable relief on
smaller businesses, in conformity with the original policy purpose.
Moreover, the cuts in the small profits rate of corporation tax will
benefit smaller companies seeking to invest and grow.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I am not
entirely surprised that we have heard relatively little about amendment
7 during the debate, because I confess that we find it somewhat
puzzling. I know what tabling amendments can be like in opposition, and
I suspect that this is one of those moments when closer scrutiny shows
that an amendment does not quite do what was intended.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection (3)
is wholly to the taxpayer’s advantage, because we seek to limit
the Government’s existing power to change the AIA’s value
by secondary legislation. In future, changes by statutory instrument
will be able only to increase the amount of the AIA—something
wholly beneficial to business. At the moment, the power exists to
increase or decrease the amount introduced by the previous Government
as part of the original 2008 legislation, in which a subsection
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000189">&#160;</a>

the Government could reduce the £25,000 limit by secondary
legislation to £5,000, for example. Under the clause, the amount
can only become greater—we can only increase it—so I do
not quite understand why the

                           </strong> We have had a fruitful debate of some length, but
this is an important issue about the contribution of capital allowances
to helping support manufacturing industry. I hope that the Minister
will refer to <em>Hansard</em>, because I said that the purpose of
amendment 7 was to tease out from the Government whether they intended
to create a floor, so that the capital allowance could not be reduced
still further. He confirmed in his final contribution that that is the
intention. That was the amendment’s purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I mentioned
this morning, the Conservatives argued before the election that capital
allowances should be reduced to 12.5%, but the clause will give the
Treasury the ability to raise the allowance but not to reduce it. The
amendment’s purpose was to confirm that point. I am pleased that
the Minister has said publicly that he does not intend to reduce the
capital allowance still further. That is a positive
development.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendment
6 on the £50,000 limit is a probing amendment designed to test
the reasons why the Minister felt that the figure should be reduced
from £100,000 to £25,000. I will not press the amendment
to a Division—I will withdraw it in due course—because,
as he has said, it involves a spending commitment. At this stage, we
cannot judge the commitments for future years, when a Labour Government
have been elected in due course. We will reflect on those spending
commitments when we consider those points. My hon. Friends the Members
for Wirral South, for Sefton Central, for Edinburgh South, for
Scunthorpe, for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and, indeed,
other hon. Friends in interventions have made the case very strongly
that the proposal in clause 11 is ill thought out and has got the
potential to damage small businesses.</p>

                        <p class="tabbed">This morning,
we looked at representations—not from my hon. Friends but from
business organisations outside the House—that express real
concerns that the clause as drafted will benefit big businesses and
financial institutions and disadvantage small and medium-sized
businesses. The comments and speeches from my hon. Friends in support
of my original comments have indicated
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000196">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South about the impact
on small businesses in her constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for
Gateshead talked about the abolition of the RDAs and the need for that
level of support to be there to help small businesses because they are
the leading suppliers for big businesses in his area. My hon. Friend
the Member for Sefton Central mentioned similar issues surrounding the
need for investment for growth. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
South spoke with real experience of building and managing a small
business in his area. That experience demonstrated that the supply
chain is very important and that small businesses are part of that. My
hon. Friends the Members for Scunthorpe and for Middlesbrough South and
East Cleveland made similar important points. We are concerned about
the impact of the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
we will withdraw the amendment, the Minister needs to use that
well-known phrase “a pause for reflection and thought,”
which is common at the moment on issues where there is considerable
criticism from outside the House on key matters. I strongly take the
view that the clause will be disproportionately beneficial to large
businesses and will have an impact on small businesses. In terms of
regional impact, the clause has not had the regional assessment that my
hon. Friends mentioned. As far as I can see, in Scotland and in my area
of Wales, where devolved Administrations deal with economic
development, there has been no real engagement with the impact of the
measure on the growth of the manufacturing industry.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I did not get
any indication from the Minister about what he has discussed with DBIS
and DECC—Departments in his own Government—on the issues
and how they feel about it. Greater thought needs to be given to the
clause. We will not press the amendment to a vote but give the Minister
the opportunity to reflect on the matter and bring back proposals on
Report to deal with the issue in more detail. The Minister
needs  to reflect on the impact of capital allowances and to
listen to the representations that we have put on record today from a
range of bodies—from the Institute of Hospitality to the EEF, to
individual tax and accountancy firms across the north-east and other
regions—and the experience of my hon. Friends.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will not
press the amendment to a vote because, as the Minister rightly pointed
out, it relates to spending commitments designed simply to test his
logic. However, I am not content with clause 11 because it is not well
thought out. We will vote against it. When hon. Members have listened
to the arguments and decided to vote with us, the Minister can take the
measure away, reflect on it and bring back some proposals on Report
that adequately meet the needs of organisations outside the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000200">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I assure you, Mr Gale, that I will be brief.
Clause 12 will increase the period over which expenditure on plant or
machinery can be given short-life asset treatment from four to eight
years. If a qualifying asset in the pool is disposed of before the end
of the period, some of the expenditure can be offset against tax, and
the extension from four to eight years is therefore generally
beneficial for businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I just want to
get a flavour from the Minister of something that I think I know: how
much the extension could save businesses. We believe that it could save
them some £170 million, even at the end of the period. Can he
confirm that figure? Compared with the cuts of about £2.8
billion that we have already agreed and discussed, this is a fig-leaf
to try to deflect criticism of the cuts to capital
expenditure.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Existing
provisions in the Capital Allowances Act 2001 allow certain assets to
be elected into an SLA pool. The benefit is that such
assets—typically those with short lives, such as computer
equipment—can often benefit from accelerated capital allowances
if they are disposed of before the four-year cut-off point.
Clause 12 will simply extend the cut-off point from four
years to eight years for new expenditure. A greater number of assets
could therefore benefit from SLA elections. In particular, businesses
that purchase a significant amount of assets with expected lives of
five to nine years are most likely to
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000240">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me address this as swiftly as the right hon.
Gentleman has done. He is right: the Exchequer impact for 2015-16 will
be some £170 million, which is how much businesses will save by
that year. We have heard much about the EEF today, but it is worth
noting that its chief executive, Terry Scouler, has
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Extending
the short-life asset election is a simple way of recognising the true
cost of modern machines with shorter lives. This will make the tax
system more efficient and remove in part barriers to
investment.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000361">&#160;</a>

                        <p>We
believe that the effective extension of the short-life asset regime to
assets with longer useful lives may lead to an increase in business
investment in plant and machinery. It will serve to align the capital
allowances regime more closely with economic depreciation, thereby
enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system and supporting
enterprise and growth.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000243">&#160;</a>

supported the continuation of the duty escalator of

with environmental taxation and excise duties on tobacco and gambling,
there is a debate to be had about whether such taxes are used solely
just to raise revenue or whether they can have an impact on binge
drinking, alcoholism and other social bads. It has been argued that
higher taxes on bads can change behaviour, by encouraging people to
drink less or to switch to drinks that are subject to a lower rate of
tax, as under the clause. Other people argue that taxation only has a
limited power to change behaviour, but following the “polluter
pays” principle, it is sometimes concluded that it is better to
tax the bads, such as alcohol and environmentally unfriendly products,
than to tax the goods on the grounds of efficiency or
ethics.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
want to tease out from the Government whether they introduced the
measure to encourage more responsible drinking. Evidence suggests a
direct link between alcohol prices and consumption. For example, a
major study carried out at the university of Florida in 2009 drew on
the findings of more than 112 other academic studies and suggested that
consumption did indeed increase when alcohol prices fell and that
consumption fell when prices rose. Another study carried out by the
university of Cardiff in 2006 went further and suggested that increased
alcohol prices could lead to fewer injuries resulting from violent
crime and thus a reduced demand for hospital trauma
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Studies
have also suggested that young drinkers, as well as heavy drinkers, are
the most responsive to changing prices, because they tend to drink
cheaper alcoholic drinks. There is certainly a debate to be had about
whether pricing mechanisms alone could encourage people to switch to
lower-strength beers. I should be interested in what the Minister has
to say about that and in what analyses the Government have carried out
of whether reducing the revenue on lower-strength beer would actually
make a
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000257">&#160;</a>

I go to pubs, I tend to drink water. I am not an expert on the strength
of beer, but it seems to be low. There is a quite a market now for
alcohol-free beer, which is linked to the progress that has been made
in tackling drink-driving. The message is, “Don’t drink
at all if you’re going to drive.” I wonder whether an
equivalent market in low-strength beer could be encouraged by having a
lower price because of the lower duty

issue of what is common in the beer trade and the gravity of the beer
consumed in most pubs. I was at a beer festival in Gateshead last
weekend. There were 100 real ales on show and for sale. Of those, about
60 or 70 were what are commonly known in the trade as session beers and
were around 3.8% to 4%. About 10 or 15 of them were really quite strong
and beyond my normal taste. There were no beers on display in Gateshead
that were 2.8%, and such beers are unusual from my perspective. One
wonders whether this is an opportunity for breweries, the micro
breweries in particular, to get into that sort of
trade.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000262">&#160;</a>

adding to my very limited knowledge of the strengths of beer. As a
Bristol MP, I know about the cider industry as cider is very popular in
the south-west. I quite often look out from my flat at a barge called
“The Apple”, where people go to drink cider. I have been
there on only two occasions; usually I just stand there looking
wistfully across the water at people enjoying themselves on a Friday or
Saturday night. <em>[</em>

                        <p class="tabbed">I went there
straight after my re-election in 2010 and I was lured there the other
week after we had done another typical Bristol thing and attended a gig
by The Wurzels. South-west MPs have to go to a Wurzels concert at some
point. I spent most of the concert begging to be allowed to leave, but
it was not quite enough to force me to turn to drink. I am aware that
some of the ciders are as high as 8% or 9% proof; sometimes when I am
gazing out at this scene from my flat I can tell that it is 8% or 9%
proof by the behaviour of the people who are
leaving.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000264">&#160;</a>

shall return from my digression about my lack of a social life, or my
exciting social life going to a concert by The Wurzels. If the
Government intend to introduce this measure to encourage more
responsible drinking, why is this new provision not coming into effect
until October 2011 rather than at the beginning of the financial year
like other measures in the Budget? The Government’s review of
alcohol and taxation referred to their wish to tackle problem drinking
without unfairly penalising responsible drinkers. There is a careful
balance to be struck. There is a complex mix of evidence on the links
between alcohol consumption and/or harm, and between price generally
and/or taxation levels specifically.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The British
Beer and Pub Association, whose representatives I am sure the Minister
has met and been lobbied by frequently, disputes the link between
taxation and harm, citing international comparisons on lower duty
rates. It none the less welcomes the plan to introduce the reduced rate
for beers under 2.8%. It believes that the change could provide an
incentive for the industry to invest in lower-strength beers and
encourage drinkers to consider
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will also be aware that there is a campaign within the
industry to tax alcohol according to the per-unit strength, so that
rather than there being differential rates for wines, spirit and cider,
taxation would simply be on the basis of the alcohol strength. What
consideration has she given to that? We will come in a moment to the
provision about higher-strength beers. It looks as though

teasing out what the Government are trying to do. To help with her
social life, perhaps next time she visits Sefton she can visit the Blue
Anchor in Aintree village with me, where she can also see the race
course on the other side of the canal. The beer is very good, I can
assure her, and none of it is below 2.8% in strength.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000268">&#160;</a>

get the Minister to comment on the current research into the
effectiveness of this measure, and the question of how much beer is
below the 2.8% level. I think that in supermarkets quite a
lot of beer is below that strength, so maybe it will have more of an
impact in supermarkets than it will in

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
concern about taking this measure one step further and looking at a
per-alcohol-unit taxation across the board. When I spoke to the
representatives of the spirit industry in particular—for a
couple of months leading up to the Budget, it seemed as though I was
stalking the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, because I had endless
meetings with people from the Scotch Whisky Association, the Bingo
Association and the British Beer and Pub Association, who had met her
the day before or were due to meet her the day after, so I suspect we
both received very similar representations—they were keen to
stress that drinks that are not normally associated with binge drinking
or problem drinking are often subject to much higher rates of duty on a
per-unit
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Duty
on spirits is 26p per unit, which is far higher than duty on beer at
16p to 17p. I would perhaps dispute the representatives’
assertion that spirits are not associated with binge drinking; I think
that high levels of vodka, in particular—people drinking a lot
of vodka before they go out, or smuggling it into pubs in their
handbags and topping up their drinks—are significant in binge
drinking for young women. The point remains that if we are looking at
taxation as a way of changing behaviour, perhaps it should be looked at
across the
board.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
understanding is that the current share of the beer and cider market
below 2.8% is less than 1%. Perhaps the Minister could provide further
details of how many such beers are available in both the on-trade and
the off-trade, and what proportion of beer sales they constitute. I
would also be interested to know what discussions she has had with the
industry about increasing the supply of lower-strength beers, given
that the small breweries relief and the lower-strength duty rate cannot
be applied together.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does the
Minister have any information on what proportion of beer under 2.8% is
produced by small breweries? Have the Minister or her officials at the
Treasury done any calculations, on a sliding scale of lower-strength
beers, about the level at which consumption 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 145<a class="bkMark" name="Column145">&#160;</a>
                           </div>would be expected to rise and the extent to which that would be matched
with the correlation in the decline of the drinking of
ordinary-strength and higher-strength beers, which we will come on
to?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is obviously concern in the pub industry about the low cost of alcohol
in supermarkets. The Labour Government banned irresponsible drinks
promotions under their Policing and Crime Act 2009. There is a real
issue about loss-leading in supermarkets by pricing alcohol under cost
price. The debate relates not only to alcohol duties and taxation, but
to public health measures and whether there should be a minimum alcohol
price. Pubs and bars cannot compete with the prices offered by
supermarkets and they have lobbied me—and, I am sure, the
Minister—claiming that the lower off-trade cost contributes to
the trend of pre-loading before a night out.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The pub
industry accordingly argues that off-trade sales are the more
significant factor in problem drinking, but either way, it does not
seem that alcohol duty alone will significantly change the existing
balance. I return to my point about drink-driving; people may well turn
to lower-strength beers if they want to drive home at the end of the
evening, so they are carefully watching their alcohol intake. If they
are buying alcohol from a supermarket, however, it is far more likely
to be for home consumption. The strength of the alcohol may not,
therefore, be such a deciding factor. The price differential may not be
sufficient to persuade them to go for a lower-strength beer instead of
buying something of ordinary strength.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000276">&#160;</a>

alcohol issues, such as the health aspects, drink-driving and pricing.
Will the Minister say how the Government will bring those aspects
together to make the most of the provision? Without doing so, there is
a danger that supermarkets will be able to carry on with the sort of
loss-leading behaviour that my hon. Friend has referred to. Recently, I

                           </strong> My hon. Friend raises an important issue. Again,
we go back to how effective taxation and price differentials are in
modifying behaviour. In particular, are we simply trying to reduce
alcohol consumption across the board, which would have an impact not
only on binge drinking but on people who drink responsibly, or are we
mostly concerned with tackling binge drinking?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I question
whether lower-strength beer appeals to people who are more prone to
excessive or binge drinking. The measure might therefore benefit people
who drink responsibly, but it will not tackle the underlying public
health issue, which also affects the public purse because

violence, family life and policing. The cost of policing binge drinking
in city or town centres at the weekend, in many areas across the
country, is astronomical. Although I welcome the measure, it does not
in itself address those problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000280">&#160;</a>

attitudes towards drink-driving, and behaviour patterns, changed not as
a result of any financial measures, but because of public information
campaigns and subsequent peer pressure. The position on drink-driving
shifted. It used to be very much accepted—it was something that
people did. There would be debates about whether people could get away
with being over the limit and it was accepted that people at pubs or
dinner parties would drink a fair bit and then drive home. That has
significantly changed and drink-driving is now very much frowned upon,
but taxation did not play a major role in that
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000281">&#160;</a>

evidence linking advertising to drinking and the Advertising Standards
Authority has very strict regulations on alcohol advertising, including
a prohibition on any health claims. Can the Minister tell us whether
the Government will work with industry to improve awareness of, and
potentially the demand for, lower-strength beer? Also, will the
Government propose targeting such beer at a particular section of
drinkers? For example, could the current strict rules on advertising
alcohol be relaxed so that lower-strength beer could be promoted in a
more positive way, to try to create more of a market for that type of

the distribution of cider sales according to alcohol by volume band,
with a reduction in the average ABV from 5.6% in 2000 to 5% in 2010.
The NACM attributes that to the marked rise in the popularity of
premium but lower-strength ciders such as Magners, Bulmers and
Gaymers.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The NACM
report did not comment on the reasons for the increasing popularity of
those brands, but it is notable that they have all been very heavily
marketed. I am not proposing that the Government start an advertising
campaign for lower-strength beer brands; I am merely asking whether
duty alone can have a significant impact on drinking habits or whether
it comes down to marketing, changing social attitudes, peer pressure
and so on. Will the Minister tell us, therefore, what is the projected
impact of the lower beer duty rate on alcohol consumption? Also, what
is the projected impact of the lower beer duty rate on the
Treasury’s revenue streams from alcohol?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Previously,
the Economic Secretary has told the House that it is not possible under
EU directive 92/83 to apply the reduced duty rate for beers on beers
that are above 2.8% in strength, but she intimated that the Government
would like to increase that threshold at some point in the future. Can
the Minister update us on the Government’s discussions with the
EU on this issue? I would particularly like to know what threshold the
Treasury would ideally set if it was able to go above the 2.8%
threshold dictated by the EU. Also, what proportion of the beer market
would be affected by such a change? What impact would there be on the
Treasury’s revenue? And does the

terms of reducing alcohol-related harm?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
turn to the amendment itself. Although the precise causes and effects
may be disputed, the Government clearly believe that a reduced duty
rate for lower-strength beers will have significant benefits for the
Treasury, drinkers and society more generally. Even if it were to apply
to relatively few beers that are currently being produced, it seems
preferable to allow those benefits to be reaped sooner rather than
later and to promote the idea of lower-strength beer within the
industry and among drinkers as soon as possible. So I hope the Minister
will be able to clarify why the date of 1 October was
chosen.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000286">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I want to speak about
the amendment and indeed the clause itself, because it is a really
interesting clause. It has wider ramifications for how this Government
act. It seems to be one of the most explicit examples of
“nudge”. I know that many people have talked about
“nudge” and the principles behind it, arguing that
Government policies can effect behavioural change in the population. I
must say that all I have seen in the last year is a large
“shove” for many people in my community of Walthamstow,
as we have seen massive cuts to public services and to the benefits and
support that they all rely on.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000291">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, this
policy is explicit about changing people’s behaviour by
introducing a higher rate of duty on super-strength lager. It also
speaks to a concern, with which many of us are sympathetic, about the
difficulties of dealing with problem drinking and the impact that it
has on all our communities. It is therefore worth asking the Government
to clarify what they mean by problem drinking and what type of drinking
they are attempting to tackle. Does that have a knock-on
effect—I do not want to use the word “nudge”
twice—on other public policies and on other concerns, which are
dear to many members of the Committee, about the future of pubs in our
local communities? I know well the concerns of 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>Opposition Members about the regular distribution of pubs, and I am sure
that they are shared by Government Members. What does the policy mean
for the public
purse?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are dangers in the use of nudge in public policy. I would be happy to
give Government Members a treatise, if they so desire at 4
o’clock on a Thursday afternoon, on why we should not read
Thaler’s work; why we should be critical of the rather
unimaginative philosophical and psychological principles behind it. I
am sure that they would welcome that opportunity. It creates
complications for public policy. If we seek to effect change in one
area through measures in another, those measures interact.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000293">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With that in
mind, it is worth looking at what we mean by problem drinking, because
the clause relates to a specific type of alcohol, and asking whether
that will affect the people about whom we are talking. Many members of
the Committee are concerned, as I am, about the increase in binge
drinking among young people. Having worked with young people for many
years, I know that it is a new phenomenon. Indeed, some of us may
remember. In the inter-war years, the  18 to 24-year-old age
group were the lightest drinkers but, by this century, they have become
the heaviest drinkers in our communities. There is trend towards
drinking to intoxication. It is not just that people are drinking a
lot; they are drinking to get very drunk. Many of us will have seen the
impact of that on the streets of our town centres on a Friday and
Saturday—and indeed, on midweek
nights.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000294">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
a former youth worker, I am concerned about the evidence of that trend
spreading to younger children. It is very worrying that, of 15 and
16-year-olds, nearly 20% of boys and 25% of girls have been drunk three
times or more during the last 30 days. When we think about the impact
of that on their ability to learn at school, on the relationships that
they form with their peers and on their personal safety, that is a real
problem. Much of that drinking starts not in pubs but at home. Kids
start trying alcohol with their parents and then, for reasons of peer
pressure, use alcohol not only to have a good time but because their
friends are drinking and it is seen as the thing to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000295">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
must think about how the measure will affect people with such a form of
problem drinking. I am sure that Ministers would accept that the clause
probably does not make much difference to young drinkers, because the
evidence shows that they do not drink the type of alcohol to which the
clause refers. The measure will, however, have an impact on our pubs,
which are really struggling. Many hon. Members are worried about what
is happening to pubs, not necessarily because of drinking problems, but
because of the wider social and economic ramifications for our local
communities. At present, there are 52,000 pubs in Britain and, through
the income that they generate, each adds about £80,000 to their
local community. In London, five pubs are closing each week. I can see
some members of the Committee starting to panic about that
already.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000296">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Beer
sales are falling, and I am sure that hon. Members throughout the House
have been lobbied by the pub and beer industries about the impact of
changing duty on beer and what that might do to those trends. That
seems to be a different question. The problems to be dealt with are
binge drinking, especially among young

			Column number: 149<a class="bkMark" name="Column149">&#160;</a>
                           </div>people because, if people start drinking early, they continue that
pattern into their later life and we all know the health and social
consequences of that. However, actions to deal with problem drinking
might have unintended consequences on other parts of our economy, be it
the pub industry, which employs nearly 600,000 people in this country,
or on our ability to engage with young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000297">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the shadow Minister has set out admirably some of the
challenges involved in getting the policy right. No one wants to make
partisan points, because it is a difficult policy area, but we need to
recognise the complex factors that are in play. Problem drinking among
young people calls for a different set of measures from problem
drinking among older people, who can go into pubs and buy alcohol at
discounted rates from supermarkets. In that sense, it is worth thinking
about the context in which we operate, because if we are discussing
that second category of people, who are legally eligible to drink, we
are looking at some different
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that the UK has one of the highest rates in western Europe of
people who consume alcohol and of people who consume to excess, but we
are not actually the worst. About 26% of men in the UK drink five units
or more a day, which is in contrast to 49% of men in Ireland and 42% of
men in the Netherlands. We know that the trend of binge drinking and
drinking to intoxication on a regular basis increases with age. Beyond
the 18 to 24-year-old age group, 30% to 40% of the population in their
late 20s, early 30s and, indeed, 40s, continue to drink in such a
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Looking
at those facts together, we see that we have a culture of drinking in
the UK that we must tackle if we want to deal with its social and
health consequences. Our approach must transcend the rather narrow one
of duty alone. I am not suggesting that the pricing of alcohol has no
role to play, but we have to look at all the factors. We have to be
clear about what we mean by problem drinking and the consequences for
one group over the other. The shadow Minister was discussing the
different types of alcohol that people are consuming, and, again, I
return to the point about who the problem drinkers are. One trend that
I have noticed among some of the young people with whom I have been
working is that they have started drinking gin. I must say that I did
not associate gin with the younger age group, but it has become a
trendy spirit. I can see the shock and horror among hon. Members
faces.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000300">&#160;</a>

people face with their alcohol consumption. I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman did not intend to be flippant, but he made an interesting
intervention. If we are going to start looking at the way in which
economic policy can effect behavioural change—I have big
reservations about whether that really works—trying to
understand what behaviour and by whom and in what context is really
critical when we consider whether any of the measures will actually
make an impact.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000304">&#160;</a>

that the Government will introduce the wrong measure and seek to affect

                           </strong> I hesitate to answer, but I am trying to make a
general point that the issue is cross-cutting. When we get to policies
such as this one, it would be helpful, so that the Opposition can
understand the motivation, to have a broader conversation, so that we
understand if the Government say, “In the first instance, we
want to act on the duty on high-strength beer; we may leave spirits
alone.” If the Government are going to use economic and fiscal
policy to affect behavioural change in such a specific manner, do we
need to review the entire application of taxes to alcohol? That is not
to dismiss the value that I am sure the Minister will bring to the
debate when she replies, but these are cross-cutting, complex
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000308">&#160;</a>

is not something that you can poke with a stick from Whitehall and
expect to change on the streets with such simplicity. That is precisely
why I have grave concerns about nudge. For the Government to embrace
nudge as a philosophy perhaps reflects some of the philosophical vacuum
that overcomes them, because it does not reflect the complex, messy
reality of the groups of people whom they are trying to deal
with.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000309">&#160;</a>

therefore, that when the Minister comes to respond to some of the
points that hon. Members on this side have raised about this particular
proposal, and whether duty can be used to effect behavioural change,
she will set out that broader context for us to better understand where
she sees that fitting. What is it a harbinger for, in terms of how the
Government will approach alcohol taxation, and might we see a
whole-scale review not just of alcohol taxation but of alcohol policy
in the round? I think that all of us recognise that measures needs to
be taken not just by the Treasury or even the Department of Health, but

the measures to increase the rates on higher strength beers. I am
extremely concerned, however, by the assertion, in the coalition
agreement of last year, that the proposed changes in alcohol duty
pricing will tackle binge drinking. Alcohol pricing is clearly a tool
in the arsenal of the Government against alcohol-related problems. It
should be noted that a much wider package of measures is required, and
that pricing does not always have an effect.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For example, I
was pleased to learn recently that, according to NHS Scotland’s
report, “Health Behaviours in School-Aged Children”, the
number of our young people who are drinking is now a third less than it
was 20 years ago. That flies in the face of the stereotype of teenagers
binge drinking and behaving badly. I have to say that I did not really
help to dispel that myth myself in Scotland not so long ago, but I am
glad that it does seem to have been reduced now. That reduction has
come in spite of the fact that alcohol prices in Scotland are now
cheaper than they have ever been. I can only put that drop in young
people drinking down to the excellent public health campaigns we have
had in the past 15 years in Scotland by NHS Scotland and education work
in
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem we have in Scotland is the consumption of higher strength beers
and also alcohol products with high levels of caffeine content, such as
Buckfast, which is widely consumed in my constituency. Therefore, I
strongly support the proposed higher rate of beer duty. High-strength
lagers have often been consumed by the most vulnerable in our society
and I believe that the proposal will make an impact on those problems.
However, I have seen no specific mention of caffeinated alcohol
products from the Government in the past year, which is a shame because
they are such a scourge on many communities, and certainly my
own.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000313">&#160;</a>

that toxic mix is something that can be addressed by the Government,

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this
afternoon, Mr Gale. We have had a debate that has focused on
high-strength beer, which is actually tackled in the following clause.
Clause 14 relates to lower strength beers. Perhaps I can address some
of the broad issues around problem drinking. The two clauses are
clearly related. If we have the debate now, it will still be relevant
to clause 15.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000317">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The provisions
are part of a series of measures that the Government have introduced
and are introducing to tackle problem drinking. The Treasury recognises
that duty has a role to play, but it is clearly part of the bigger
package of measures that is needed if we are to challenge the
relatively deep-seated drinking culture in our country, and, as some
hon. Members said, the changing nature of problem drinking over time. I
assure hon. Members that the Treasury has worked with the Department of
Health and the Home Office, which clearly has a role to play. The hon.
Member for Airdrie and Shotts mentioned that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000318">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Walthamstow referred to a segmentation strategy for problem
drinking, and the need to recognise that there are different sorts of
problem drinkers. I agree. There are perhaps four-plus segments:
alcoholics; young, under-age drinkers; binge drinkers, and home
drinkers—an increasing proportion of middle-income people drink
too much at home. In the workshops that we held last summer, we talked
to not only the industry but to other stakeholder groups about their
views on problem drinking, and another category of problem drinking
emerged from those discussions. It comprises perfectly normal people,
who, when out celebrating a particular occasion, drink too much.
Setting aside those particular instances, they may drink responsibly
for the rest of the year.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly, the
matter is complex, and we are right to consider a mix of solutions,
depending on which group of problem drinkers we particularly want to
influence. The solutions include duty, the Home Office, local
authorities and the police, and the Department of Health, which can
play a role in education, changing the culture, and perhaps working
with the Department for Education in tackling younger drinkers, their
perceptions of drinking and the peer pressure that is sometimes applied
to them to drink.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000320">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I assure the
Committee that the provision is part of a much wider piece of work.
From my perspective as a Minister, clauses 14 and 15 are a start. We
are one of the first countries to introduce a low-strength duty. At the
moment, it is very much couched in terms of what we can do in Europe,
but we are interested in how the market—demand and
supply—responds to the duty provision that we are
discussing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000321">&#160;</a>

of Members’ Financial Interests. Before we move on to the
technicalities of the policy, will the Economic Secretary give us some
views on the Government’s approach to over-the-counter off-sales
in licensed premises? All the evidence shows that if we tackle the
cheaper, supermarket alcohol and off-sales

                           </div>generally—it is not just the supermarkets; I do not mean to pick
on them—and benefit the on-trade, which is one of the most
highly regulated industries in the world, it could regulate the matter
for the Government. The policies that we are considering will do
nothing to regulate the off-trade. We should make a distinction, and if
the Government increased duties on the off-trade and benefited the
on-trade, that would go a long way towards resolving some of the
problems that the Economic Secretary has started to
highlight.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000322">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a point that many
people in the industry, particularly the pub industry, raised. The
Government have introduced measures to ban below-cost sales to start to
tackle that. However, I think that he asked how we could link the two
clauses with tackling the off-trade issue. We will define
“below-cost” as duty plus VAT. We are therefore clearly
linking the two approaches in a helpful way, which means that our
decisions about levels of duty and VAT will feed directly into that
below-cost definition. So there is a way to link them
together.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will now
take the Committee through some of the technicalities of the clause, so
that I may put on record how it will work. Clause 14 introduces a new
reduced rate of duty for beers at or below 2.8% ABV. That will help to
encourage development of lower-strength beers and give responsible
drinkers a wider choice of
products.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
reduced rate is being introduced following the review of alcohol
taxation, which I briefly mentioned, and was announced in my statement
to the House on 30 November last year. The measure
corresponds to the new high-strength beer duty that we will address in
the next clause. As well as introducing a new duty to encourage people
not to drink super-strength lagers, it is right that we provide
encouragement to those who wish to consume lower-alcohol
beers.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause introduces a new reduced rate at 50% of general beer duty for
beers at or below 2.8% ABV. We will continue not to charge duty on
beers at or below 1.2% ABV. That will reduce the price of a pint of
lower-strength beer by between 12p and 18p. It will provide an
incentive for brewers to develop and retail new lower-strength
products. As we have heard, the measure has been welcomed by the
industry and beer
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
Members wanted to know how big the market currently is. As we have
heard, it is relatively small at the moment. There are a few limited
brands that brewers are putting on the market. As important as price
is, taste is important, too. Many companies are now working to produce
low-strength beers that have the taste that consumers want.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure hon.
Members will be pleased to know that a number of producers are already
experimenting with new lower-alcohol brews, and they are making good
progress. We expect the reduced rate of duty to allow pubs and other
retailers to offer lower-strength beers at a lower price. A price
differential will hopefully encourage consumers to try, and enjoy, a
wider range of products. We hope that the new lower rate of duty will
encourage growth in that part of the beer market.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000328">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In terms of
where we set the definition of lower-strength beer, it is not possible
at present for us to apply a reduced rate of duty for beers with an ABV
above 2.8%, because the 2.8% ABV threshold is set directly by the EU
directive on alcohol structures. As Members may be aware, that
directive is currently under review. We are working with our European
partners to try to increase the threshold, which would give us more
flexibility nationally to raise the definition of lower-strength beers
should a Government wish to do that in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000329">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Has the Minister been given any indication of
how long it would take to get EU agreement to change the 2.8% limit? At
some point next week we will go on to talk about fuel duties. There has
been an issue with the derogation of VAT on fuel, which the Minister
has said will be a complicated and lengthy process to implement. Are we
talking about a similar time scale for this, or could it be achieved
much more quickly?<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000330">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The difference between the two measures is that
this directive is already under review. Because of the introduction of
the new lower rate of duty, we are now able to participate meaningfully
in the European debate. We are one of the countries that is using the
ability to set a lower rate of
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment, of course, there is no review of the VAT directive looking
at whether any product should go from a zero rate of VAT to a reduced
rate of VAT or a full rate of VAT. That is the difference. This is
under review, and, as a country, we want to make our view known. We
expect the measure will have a relatively small cost to the Exchequer,
but that will be offset by the revenues from the new high-strength beer
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was asked about the impact on small breweries, and the clause includes
provisions that ensure that all small breweries receive the full 50%
duty reduction for lower-strength beers. That will help to limit the
complexity of having to apply reduced rates to reduced
rates.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
8 seeks to advance the date for the introduction of the reduced rate of
duty. The measures are to encourage the production and consumption of
lower strength beers, but a retrospective introduction of the reduced
rate would not achieve that, instead giving a duty rebate to lower
strength beers that have already been produced. Also, as one of my hon.
Friends pointed out, producers paying the higher rate of duty until now
would then have to claim a rebate, which would be an added
complexity.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
date of 1 October 2011 was chosen for three main reasons. First, HMRC
needs to make changes to its systems, so as to collect the new duty and
to apply the reduced rates. Without the changes, collection of the duty
would have been burdensome for businesses and for HMRC, imposing
unnecessary costs. The system changes needed time, and would not have
been achieved by 1
April.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the level of the reduced rate was only announced in the 2011 Budget
and, consistent with our aim of better tax policy making, we decided
that eight days was simply not sufficient time for businesses to adapt
their accounting systems to a structural change in the duty
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000336">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, the
longer lead-in time will allow all brewers to develop a product that
will benefit from the favourable rate of duty—we hope to see
that take place. Earlier introduction of the measure would have been
unlikely to help bring new lower strength beers to the market more
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000337">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Accepting
the amendment would also have had revenue implications for the
Government. Without the parallel amendment to the timing for the
introduction of the new high strength beer duty, we would have had a
reduction in revenue because of the lower strength beer duty. Without
the corresponding higher strength beer duty to pay for reduction, a
loss to the Exchequer would have resulted.<a class="bkMark" name="1105136000338">&#160;</a>
