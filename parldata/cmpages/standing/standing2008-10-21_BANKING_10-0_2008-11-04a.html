Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Welcome to the 10th sitting,
Mr. Gale. I had just taken an intervention from the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall before we adjourned; we were discussing
my proposal to include a competition objective in the Bill, so that the
issue is recognised and used when determining how the tools&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 307</div>stabilisation powers, the bank insolvency procedure and the bank
administration procedure&#151;are used. We must think about the
powers, not only in the context of the five objectives, but also the
potential further objective of avoiding the competitive impact that a
bank subject to those powers could
have.</div><a name="08110462000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-East Cornwall alluded to the possible tension
between a competition objective and a bank&#146;s ability to repay
taxpayers&#146; funds quickly. We talked about that in the context of
Northern Rock earlier. Restricting the ability of a bank that is
subject to one of the powers to compete could delay the repayment of
any financial assistance that that bank had received from the taxpayer,
because it would not be in a position to attract new funds from retail
depositors, for example. Conversely, if the restriction was on offering
mortgages and lending, that might hasten its ability to repay
taxpayers&#146; money, depending on the dynamic and the particular
competitive effect that we want to deal with. As we discussed before
lunch, there are tensions within the objectives in the Bill and within
some of the proposed objectives, but it is important to understand the
role that the objectives will have and how they will shape decisions
that the tripartite authorities will make about the stabilisation
powers.</div>
<a name="08110462000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two points
emerge from the code in relation to the objectives. Paragraph 17 of the
draft code
states:</div><a name="08110462000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Following
actions taken under the SRR, the Authorities must make public
statements explaining (a) how they have acted with regard to the SRR
objectives; and (b) how they have balanced the objectives against each
other&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08110462000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
refers to the tension that we have been
debating.</div><a name="08110462000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
form such an explanation will take will depend on the
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister say how long we shall have to wait for such a statement
after the powers have been used? Will it accompany the exercise of the
powers or will it appear a couple of months later, after the powers
have been exercised? Obviously there is an issue about timing and the
nature of the information that can be disclosed by such an explanation.
Paragraph 18 of the code points that
out:</div><a name="08110462000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
should be noted that it will not be possible to divulge certain
information, for example information the release of which would
threaten financial stability or the confidence of the banking
system.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly
the longer that is left, the more information could be received, but it
will also mean that market participants will be in the dark about why
the authorities have taken the steps that they have. The sooner the
information is released the more difficult it is to give a full
explanation. Does the Minister see that tension being
resolved?</div>
<a name="08110462000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister feel that the Treasury statements released in the aftermath of
the FSA&#146;s triggering the threshold conditions for Kaupthing and
Heritable constitute a template for what we should expect under clause
17? I hope that the answer is no, because the statements did not
clearly explain why the Government were taking those actions. I shall
return to that point in a little more detail on clause 7, which deals
with the threshold conditions.</div>
<a name="08110462000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
want to understand the interaction between the objectives of the FSA
under clause 4 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The
subject is raised in the code. Paragraph 16 states:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 308</div><a name="08110462000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
sole exception to this rule relates to a decision taken by the FSA,
under section 7 of the [Act] that the general conditions for use of the
SRR have been met. This decision will be taken in the context of
FSA&#146;s objectives under the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that we could cover the subject in more detail when debating
clause 7, but there seems to be a carve-out later in the Bill saying
that the objectives in clause 4 will not be applied to the exercise of
the powers under clause 7. It would be helpful if the Minister were to
elaborate on the interaction between the objectives of clause 4 and the
2000 Act, and specifically why they are carved out in clause
7.</div><a name="08110462000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the challenges in trying to understand the objectives and their
application is the lack of transparency in the Bill, the explanatory
notes and the code on how they will interact, and on how they will
return the powers that could be used under parts 1, 2 and 3 of the
code. The code is meant to be a safeguard on the exercise of power. I
would have expected it to say rather more about the interaction of
objectives.</div>
<a name="08110462000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are probing; we seek to understand the scope of the
objectives, how they work together and how they relate to other aspects
of the Bill, including references to the protection of creditors and
compensation that are not reflected in clause 4. I want to know how
those objectives will work, why they are limited to five and why they
do not include competition and the protection of creditors and
shareholders. We would be comfortable if the Minister were to give a
fairly full explanation on those points. We look forward to his doing
so.</div>
<a name="08110462000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110462000298"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I wish to speak to
amendment No. 74, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Southport. As I said this morning, it is complementary to
the other amendments to this important clause. However, it is
particular in adding to the third objective, that of protecting
depositors. As the hon. Member for Fareham said, it should cover
depositors in the widest sense; I assume that it means retail
depositors, but it may include others.</div>
<a name="08110462000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would add the words</div>
<a name="08110462000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to protect and
safeguard the value of the enterprise.&#148;</div>
<a name="08110462000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is important when
we come to the use of the special resolution and the stabilisation
powers, which are set out in clause 4(2)(a) rather than in banking
insolvency or administration procedures. At that stage, the bank may
well be trading&#151;indeed, it is likely to be trading&#151;and
will not necessarily be a failed bank. It might become a failed bank,
but at that moment it will not be failed in the legal sense. Paragraph
9 of the draft code of practice
reads:</div><a name="08110462000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
term &#145;protection of depositors&#146; refers specifically to
the objective of protecting depositors from the effects of the failure
of an
institution&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
actual moment of failure is an important aspect. When a bank has
failed&#151;perhaps gone into insolvency or
administration&#151;that is one thing, but before that, it is
considered whether the bank is going to be a failure. Paragraph 9,
about which I have some other comments to make,
mentions</div><a name="08110462000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
effects of the failure of an institution, as an end in
itself&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
concerns me is that it is likely, as we found out in Treasury Committee
meetings on Northern Rock, that the FSA was aware of some of the
problems with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 309</div>Northern Rock some months before it failed. Although the bank was
considered in many respects to be an outlier in how it secured
wholesale funds and so on, it was given time to try to put it right.
The fact that it did not do so, or that the FSA did not insist that it
do so, is another matter, but during that period the bank was not
failed. It was trading, receiving deposits and entering into mortgage
arrangements, and although it was perhaps on the list for close
attention, at that moment in time it had not
failed.</div>
<a name="08110462000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110462000299"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I think that the
evidence of the internal audit was that it was not on any list for
close attention. That was one of the major problems with Northern Rock:
it was attended to all too
little.</div><a name="08110462000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000300"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> It may have been attended to all too little, but
the FSA had it on close watch from January. The report says quite
clearly that it had been brought to the attention of the directors. It
had been perceived as an outlier in terms of its chart and what it had
done, and it was working with the FSA. Nevertheless, it does not matter
whether it happened in January or in March. It was quite some time
before the events of August, when it actually failed. Northern Rock was
in intensive care, which may be the sort of situation in which we find
ourselves if the special resolution regime is imposed in future.
Banking organisations might begin to display all the potential signals
that they are heading towards the rocks, but at that moment, they might
not be.</div>
<a name="08110462000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should be
necessary to ensure that the overall value of the entity, which is
often in large part goodwill rather than just tangible assets, is
maximised for everyone during that period. Of course, once it goes into
administration or insolvency, there are clear rules about how the
administrator may act, but until that happens and while it is still
under the stabilisation powers, it is important that consideration be
given to maximising the value of the bank in its fullness. That is
consistent with directors&#146; duties to promote the success of a
company under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. During the period
of intensive care that may precede the failure of the bank, it is
important that that principle is maintained. That is the purpose of the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08110462000266"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="08110462000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
readily accept that this is a subjective judgment on timing, and timing
is all important in such matters. While things can go on for quite a
few weeks, matters often come to a head quickly and something happens.
We may therefore go from an attempted stabilisation to a wholesale
failure. It is important, however, that when we think about protecting
the depositors, which I know is the main thrust of the legislation, we
do not lose sight of other aspects of the bank. We know, for instance,
that large pension funds are normally significant investors in
banks.</div>
<a name="08110462000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110462000301"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): The hon. Gentleman is
making a good point. I wonder whether he has a view on the following. I
understand from these objectives that the Government are not talking
about the normal business relationship and the normal duty of directors
to look after the whole of the company, but are saying that they will
look after a specific group of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 310</div>creditors, that is, the depositors. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that
that looks as though the Government are
sinking?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000302"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That certainly may be the impression. As I said,
the main thrust of the legislation is to protect depositors. We should
not lose sight of the fact that prior to actual failure&#151;when
there are clear rules for the way in which administrators may undertake
their duties, and the relative classes of shareholders, creditors and
so on are more easily established&#151;if one still has a going
concern, although it may be limping along, it is important to recognise
that directors have other duties. There may well be an opportunity to
rescue the situation before it goes into failure, and to have regard
for maximisation. Once intervention happens, share prices can disappear
and the value of the entity can evaporate overnight. It is important
that we do not lose sight of the objective that while there is still a
going concern, the creditors and shareholders should have at least some
say in what is going on.</div>
<a name="08110462000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister gave us some basic assurances that in the
period when stabilisation powers are being introduced and we do not
have an actual failure, the Government have a view as to how that is to
be handled. At the end of the day, it must be normally in
everybody&#146;s interest to try to save the institution and ensure
in one way or another that it continues. To have a further contraction,
through a merger or a takeover, is not likely to be in the interests of
competition. To have a failing bank is not likely to be in the public
interest or the economic interest; it is not likely to be in too many
people&#146;s interest. It is therefore important that in that period
these powers are used, as much to try to ensure the continuation or the
maximisation of the value of the whole, as to try to get to a situation
where the company is split up, sent off, recast and such, and we have
shareholders taking a real bath, creditors losing out, and everything
else.</div>
<a name="08110462000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful to the Minister if he addressed that period when a company is
not insolvent, but is in intensive care, when the directors are doing
all sorts of things to try to maintain their business, and if he said
something about how these powers will be used in those
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08110462000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08110462000303"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): Mr. Gale, rising
gives me the opportunity to apologise to you and to the Committee for
my mobile phone going off. I thought that I understood the technology;
I clearly do not.</div>
<a name="08110462000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
point is not the most serious one I have ever made in Committee. Under
clause 1(5), each of three bodies has a role in the operation of the
special resolution regime, and they are listed as the Bank of England,
the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority, whereas when we
reach clause 4(3), the same three bodies are listed in a different
order: the Treasury, the FSA and the Bank of England. The parliamentary
draftsman never does anything for no purpose, and I would be curious to
know the purpose of that particular difference in listing. The listing
accepted in the rest of the Bill is the same as that in clause 4(3), so
it must be clause 1(5) that is out of order. That is not my biggest
point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 311</div><a name="08110462000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more
important points are that the Bill is predicated on supporting
depositors, as the hon. Gentleman has just mentioned. Clause 2(1) talks
about accepting deposits. Accepting deposits and the protection of
depositors seem to be a prime purpose of the Bill, but there are other
bodies and other ways that banking institutions can interface with
public confidence<i class="I">.</i></div>
<a name="08110462000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasing
confidence is not just a matter of protecting depositors. There have
been some quite serious mismatches, which have caused the public and
our constituents real concern. For instance, there was a mismatch
between the treatment of individual depositors in the Icelandic
associate banks in the Isle of Man, such as Kaupthing Singer &amp;
Friedlander, where individual depositors are not protected. Similarly
there is a mismatch between the individuals who invested money by way
of deposits through Icelandic banks and the institutions that invested
money through Icelandic banks, such as councils and, as I mentioned
earlier, a children&#146;s hospice in my
constituency.</div><a name="08110462000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other ways that banks can interface. If we wish to protect
confidence, it is not just a matter of ensuring that deposits are fair.
For instance, if a bank were involved in, for example, bills of lading,
and the bills of lading failed, that would cause a loss of confidence.
It would not just be a matter of losing deposits. A breakdown in money
transmission would have a significant impact on confidence. A fault in
the custodian system, whereby pension funds are held by banks, would
cause a problem. If a bank failed in its capacity as either a trustee
or a factor of money, that would cause a problem.</div>
<a name="08110462000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already noticed that investment banks are not covered by the rules on
the protection of depositors. What would happen to investors in banks
where there is no deposit because the interest is payable under sharia
law and is a shared venture? What is the rule there? My questions come
down to this. Which depositors are protected? Is it UK individuals only
or is it every UK institution, as there has been a mismatch so far?
Secondly, depositors in what? Is it just depositors in UK banks or
depositors in UK institutions as well, or depositors in overseas
institutions, including banks?</div>
<a name="08110462000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question
can be summed up as follows: if the object of the exercise is to
protect confidence by ensuring that depositors are protected, then a
more careful definition of exactly what institutions will carry this
cover is needed. What institutions have the reputation that if a
deposit through them is lost, the UK Government will stand behind them
through the special scheme?</div>
<a name="08110462000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
insufficient clarity here. Lawyers acting for banks and other financial
institutions will be all over this Bill when it is an Act. They will
look for the interstices in it and clever ways of getting protection,
which we perhaps have not anticipated. I would be a little
happier&#151;we may come to this when we consider the draft code of
practice&#151;if the law had been cast in more general terms and
enabled the Bank of England to do such things as may be necessary to
protect deposit and other customers of banks. But that is perhaps for a
later
discussion.</div><a name="08110462000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000304"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> Lawyers
have already been over the Bill. They continue to go over it in
substantial detail. The amendments seek to add to the objectives for
the special resolution regime 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>set out in clause 4. Before dealing with them in turn, I should like to
set out the thinking behind the objectives we have put forward in the
Bill and explain why I think they are the right
ones.</div><a name="08110462000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out the special resolution objectives, which are intended
to present in primary legislation the broad purpose of the measures we
have put in place and the aims that the authorities must have regard to
when exercising their powers under parts 1, 2 and 3. I hope that the
hon. Member for Gosport welcomes the fact that we are doing this at a
broad level.</div>
<a name="08110462000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
consulted widely on these objectives and they have received strong
support. While the objectives are not defined in the Bill, the code of
practice, which the hon. Member for Fareham referred to and which was
sent to members of the Committee on Thursday, provides further
information on their meaning and effect.</div>
<a name="08110462000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will help
the Committee by summarising what the draft code says as to the meaning
of these objectives, as this touches on some of the points that hon.
Members have already made in the debate; they are also covered in the
amendments. Members will, I hope, forgive me if much of the following
quotes extensively from the code, but it is important that these
definitions are made clear before the Committee today, in order to
inform debate.</div>
<a name="08110462000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
term</div><a name="08110462000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;stability
of the financial systems of the United
Kingdom&#148;,</div><a name="08110462000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">used
in objective 1, refers to the stable functioning of the systems and
institutions&#151;including payment and settlement
infrastructure&#151;supporting the efficient operation of financial
services and markets for purposes including capital raising, risk
transfer and the facilitation of domestic and international commerce.
As the Committee discussed last Thursday, there are a number of
possible definitions of what stability does, or could, mean in
different contexts; this definition provides a clear explanation in
terms of the stability of the UK financial systems.</div>
<a name="08110462000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
of this initial objective is first, to recognise the wider systemic
risks posed by the potential, or actual, failure of any institution or
group of institutions. Secondly, it requires the authorities to have
regard to the likely systemic impacts of their actions, or non-actions,
when implementing an SRR tool.</div>
<a name="08110462000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000305"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister referred, as I did, to last
Thursday&#146;s debate about financial stability. Does he not agree
with me that the definition set out on financial stability in the code
is likely to be the one by which people will judge the achievement of
the effectiveness of clause 216? Will this in effect become the
definition of financial stability? Should that not be recognised in
clause 216, as well as in the
code?</div><a name="08110462000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000306"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> For the reasons that I outlined last Thursday, it
is right that we do not put a detailed definition of financial
stability in the Bill. We believe that the right place to do that is in
the code, which is why we provided that clarification in terms of our
understanding of objective 1.</div>
<a name="08110462000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Objective 2,
and the term</div>
<a name="08110462000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;public
confidence in the stability of the banking
systems&#148;,</div><a name="08110462000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">refers
to the crucial role that public confidence has in maintaining the
stable and efficient operation of financial services and markets. The
confidence of the general public is of particular significance in
maintaining stability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 313</div>in a banking system whereby it is important that banks&#146; deposit
liabilities exceed the liquid assets that they hold at any one
time.</div>
<a name="08110462000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
confidence has a number of dimensions. For example, it refers to the
expectation that deposits will be repaid on demand; normal banking
services will be continuously available; problems&#151;or perceived
problems&#151; in one bank or building society will not
extend to other banks; and if a bank or building society does fail,
systems exist to protect the interests of
depositors.</div><a name="08110462000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the second objective is to ensure that the authorities
have regard to the need to act so that a failing bank or building
society will be resolved in a manner that enhances public confidence in
the banking system as a
whole.</div><a name="08110462000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
term &#147;protect depositors&#148; in objective 3 refers
specifically to the objective of protecting depositors from the effects
of the failure of an institution, as an end in itself. That objective
goes beyond the need to ensure public confidence in the banking system,
and recognises the important public policy objective of ensuring that
depositors in a failed institution are adequately
protected.</div><a name="08110462000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the Bill, such protection can be delivered in different ways, such as
by facilitating fast payout,  or account transfer, under the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme to eligible depositors through
the bank insolvency procedure, or facilitating continuity of banking
services through the stabilisation options in the
SRR.</div><a name="08110462000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public
policy concerns around effective depositor protection are particularly
relevant in the case of retail depositors protected by the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme. Protection of retail depositors is also
likely to be conducive to realisation of a number of other objectives,
such as protecting and enhancing public confidence in the banking
system. However, the use of the SRR may also offer protection to other
types of depositor, particularly where the SRR tool chosen may provide
continuity of service to both retail and non-retail customers of a
failing
institution.</div><a name="08110462000267"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="08110462000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000307"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I pick up the comment made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Gosport? I want to check that the Minister is
right&#151;or that what I take from what he says is right&#151;that
depositors as a term expands beyond retail depositors, to cover all
depositors. Clearly, if the decision were taken to put a bank into
administration, retail depositors would be covered by the FSCS but
non-retail depositors would rank alongside other creditors in terms of
distribution. They might argue that the choice of mechanism made by the
authorities did not protect them while it did protect retail
depositors. I wonder whether the use of the word depositor is not too
widely
drawn.</div><a name="08110462000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000308"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The objective to protect depositors covers all
depositors, retail and wholesale, but I would point out that the focus
of the SRR will often be primarily on retail depositors eligible for
compensation from the FSCS, as demonstrated by the bank insolvency
procedure which is designed to speed up payout to this class of
creditors. It is right that the objective covers both retail and
wholesale depositors.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 314</div><a name="08110462000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term
&#147;protection of public funds&#148; in objective 4 refers
primarily to the protection of taxpayers&#146; interests in the
effect of expenditure of public money. The intention of this fourth
objective is to recognise the strong fiduciary duty of the authorities,
in particular the Treasury, in taking decisions with implications for
public funds.</div>
<a name="08110462000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term in
objective 5,</div>
<a name="08110462000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to avoid
interfering with property rights in contravention of a Convention
right&#148;</div><a name="08110462000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">refers
to the rights of property holders who might be affected by the use of
the SRR. This can include the bank or building society itself, the
shareholders, creditors or other third parties. Such persons may hold
property in the failing bank or building society or have a right of
control over such property, or both. The inclusion of this objective
acknowledges the importance of acting proportionately in exercising
these
powers.</div><a name="08110462000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham asked in the early part of his contribution
about the definition of proportionality in the code. This is an issue
that has been considered repeatedly both in domestic and international
case law. In broad terms, it means that property rights should be
interfered with to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the public
interest aims, albeit those aims may provide very powerful
justifications for intervention.</div>
<a name="08110462000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">This clause
also notes that the objectives are to be balanced as appropriate in
each case. Again, the hon. Member for Fareham invited me to speculate
whether particular areas have priority. I want to make it clear that we
need to look at these on a case-by-case basis. We have always been
clear that our primary objectives are to protect depositors and
financial stability, and stakeholders have supported these purposes. We
have included  other rights, such as protecting property
rights, in acknowledgment of the potentially invasive nature of some of
these tools. It is right that we judge our action on a case-by-case
basis.</div><a name="08110462000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000309"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Minister has been most helpful but is it not
unfortunate that the Bill does not say that the primary purpose is
those two objectives? The Minister has said it but the Bill does not
say
it.</div><a name="08110462000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000310"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We have been clear that depositor protection and
public confidence in the banking system are essential. When deciding to
take action, it is right that the special resolution objectives should
be as we have set out in clause 4. I refer hon. Members again to
subsection (9), which says that</div>
<a name="08110462000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they are to be
balanced as appropriate in each
case.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000074"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000314"></a>Ian

What is important is that we have the flexibility to look at the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 315</div><a name="08110462000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000315"></a>Mr.

then.</div><a name="08110462000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000317"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am grateful for the gracious way in which the
Minister gave way. Will he go away and think about the matter? Clearly,
he is correct in what he says. However, that is not what the clause
says. We cannot have all the objectives jumbled together; we have to
have some primary ones. The Minister is right to say that the two
primary objectives are financial stability and depositor protection,
and that is all that needs to be said in the clause. I know that the
wording will not be changed now, but perhaps the Government can go away
and reflect on
it.</div><a name="08110462000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000318"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want to go away and reflect on it,
actually, because we considered the measure at some length before
coming to the conclusion that these are the right objectives. Together
the objectives capture the public interest that should be pursued in
operating the special resolution regime, and are the most important
factors to which the authorities should have regard when taking action
under the SRR. That is why we believe that including the objectives in
the Bill provides guidance to market participants and other
stakeholders as to how the SRR powers will be used.</div>
<a name="08110462000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that it is impossible to define the objectives exhaustively. The
concepts at issue are too complex to be reduced to hard-edged statutory
definitions. The applications of the objectives may well change over
time. That is why we have the code of practice, to elaborate in more
detail how the objectives are to be interpreted and applied. That was
the point that I made to the hon. Member for Fareham
earlier.</div><a name="08110462000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me now turn to the amendments that have been proposed on the
objectives. I hope to reassure the Committee that the issues that have
been raised are already appropriately dealt with in the Bill as it
stands. I want to make it clear why I do not believe that we should
amend clause 4 in the manner that has been
proposed.</div><a name="08110462000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discussion of the detailed definition of the SRR objectives as set out
in the code of practice, let me explain why I believe that both the
second and third objectives, as set out in the Bill, implicitly include
the concepts of access to deposits and ensuring continuity of banking
services. If there is any doubt regarding that, the code of practice,
to which the authorities must also have regard, makes it explicitly
clear. I do not believe that amendment No. 77 is
necessary.</div><a name="08110462000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 74, tabled by the hon. Members for South-East Cornwall and for
Southport, calls for a requirement</div>
<a name="08110462000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to protect and
safeguard the value of the enterprise&#148;.</div>
<a name="08110462000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I presume that means
the enterprise value of the failing bank. The enterprise value of a
company is usually made up of a number of elements, including the
market capitalisation of the bank. That is the market value of all its
shares in issue in addition to the value of its debt financing and
other liabilities. I do not believe that a core objective of the SRR
should be to protect this measure of the value of a firm. When a
failing bank enters the SRR, the stabilisation options in the Bill are
deployed because the authorities believe that they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>necessary in the public interest. At this point, it is the
Government&#146;s view that the wider public interests of financial
stability, depositors&#146; interests and protection of public funds
may well outweigh the commercial interests of the
bank.</div><a name="08110462000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to reassure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall that a number
of specific features of the SRR will operate to safeguard and protect
the value of the failing bank. The Bill is designed so that the
stabilisation options of a transfer to a private sector purchaser, such
as a transfer to a bridge bank or taking the bank into temporary public
ownership, can be applied before the insolvency threshold has been
reached. In turn, that helps to protect against the destruction of any
residual value that the failing bank has upon entering insolvency. I
think that that addresses the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="08110462000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also like to draw the attention of the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall to clause 53, which introduces the bank resolution
fund. The fund, which is compulsory for a bridge bank but optional when
taking a bank into temporary public ownership, is designed to ensure
that the proceeds of any resolution, minus deductions necessary
adequately to safeguard public funds, must flow back to the failing
bank. If the Bank of England or the Treasury put in place a bank
resolution fund, the resolution fund order may place a duty on the
authorities to maximise the proceeds available for distribution,
subject to meeting the special resolution and bridge bank governance
objectives. I believe that that mechanism should also help to achieve
the result that the hon. Gentleman is looking for. I therefore hope
that he does not press the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="08110462000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 78, tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham, proposes that we state
that the expenditure of public and private funds is done in an
economically efficient manner. Of course I agree with the intention of
the amendment, but again, I am not convinced of the argument to make it
an objective of the special resolution regime. First, there are
adequate general mechanisms to monitor and provide oversight of the use
of public and private funds by the Government and other public bodies.
In addition to the value-for-money and propriety analysis that the
Government will undertake before providing financial assistance, there
are external mechanisms to ensure that assistance is provided in an
appropriate manner, for example through the work of the National Audit
Office.</div><a name="08110462000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Gentleman is referring to funds of the FSCS when he mentions
private funds, I should say that we have put in place a number of
provisions to ensure that they are used in an appropriate manner, when
called on to fund the SRR, as in clause 157. I refer him in particular
to the requirement that any resolution costs that the FSCS must
contribute should be independently verified, and the core principle
that the FSCS cannot contribute more than it would have had to pay out
to insure the depositors had the bank entered
insolvency.</div><a name="08110462000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also do not agree that the objectives that the hon. Gentleman proposes
in amendment No. 76 should be included in the Bill. The amendment
proposes that the protection of creditors should be a separate SRR
objective. Let me set out why I do not believe that that part of the
amendment is necessary. First, as I have said, objective 5 operates to
ensure that any interference with the rights of creditors must be in
the public interest and proportionate. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 317</div>Secondly, there are in addition a number of specific features of the SRR
that operate to protect non-depositor creditors, such as the protection
of set-off and netting arrangements in the case of a partial transfer,
which we will discuss in due course when we come to clause 43.
Furthermore, I draw hon. Members&#146; attention to the compensation
provisions that we have provided, particularly the possibility of
compensation being payable to creditors under a third party
compensation order. In relation to partial transfers, there is the
additional safeguard, reflected in clause 55, of ensuring that no
creditor would be worse off than in a whole-bank insolvency.</div>
<a name="08110462000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can
certainly agree that the interests of creditors need to be taken into
account when determining whether the SRR should be deployed and that
their interests need to be respected, but we do not think that it is
appropriate to provide expressly for the protection of creditors as a
separate objective from the protection of depositors. Creditors, to a
much greater extent than retail depositors, can take a number of steps
to protect themselves in the event of counterparty failure, including
taking security and adopting set-off and netting arrangements. When
creditors stand unsecured, they do so in the knowledge that that is the
case, and having secured a suitable rate of return on the terms of
their liability with the bank. None of that is the case with
depositors. The Government have made it clear that the class of
creditor that the measures focus on protecting is the depositor class,
both as an end in itself, and because of the important role of
depositor protection in financial
stability.</div>
<a name="08110462000268"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="08110462000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I should like to turn to the important topic of competition law. I
believe that the intention behind amendments Nos. 76 and 79, tabled by
the hon. Member for Fareham, is to ensure that a bridge bank or a bank
in temporary public ownership does not take commercial advantage of its
favourable position in terms of Government support in a manner that
distorts the market for financial services as a whole. He made that
point clearly in his contribution.</div>
<a name="08110462000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
reassure the hon. Gentleman that we have put measures in place to meet
that intention. The first is the code of practice, the draft of which
includes measures regarding the running of a bridge bank or a bank in
temporary public ownership and guidance on running the bank on a
conservative basis. Furthermore, both bridge banks and banks in
temporary public ownership will continue to be regulated by the FSA in
the same manner as other financial services providers. The Office of
Fair Trading will continue to keep the relevant markets under review in
order to protect the interests of UK consumers and the British economy.
As the amendment addresses the running of bridge banks and banks in
temporary public ownership rather than the general operation of the
special resolution regime, I argue that the measures that I have set
out meet his aim more appropriately.</div>
<a name="08110462000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also probed the extent to which banks in receipt of financial
assistance will be permitted to take advantage of that assistance in an
anti-competitive manner. That is an important point. It is crucial that
banks cannot use the receipt of financial assistance to obtain an
inappropriate competitive advantage. I reassure him that firms in
receipt of financial assistance will still 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 318</div>be subject to the provisions of competition law and that the competition
authorities will continue to have the powers to investigate any
breaches. As I have said, the Office of Fair Trading will continue to
keep the relevant markets under review in order to protect the
interests of UK consumers and the British economy. Additional
restrictions may also be imposed on those in receipt of financial
assistance in order to comply with the rules on the provision of state
aid.</div><a name="08110462000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the point about priorities, the hon. Member for Fareham made the
Government&#146;s argument for us when he pointed out that the
weighting of the different objectives outlined in clause 4 may change
in different times and contexts. He is absolutely right. It illustrates
why we should not attempt to rank objectives in the Bill, despite the
injunctions of some Opposition Members. To give one example, in cases
where significant public financial assistance had been committed before
the special resolution regime, objective 4 on the protection of public
funds would be likely to increase in importance, but it is not possible
or desirable to put into the Bill the sorts of trade-off that the hon.
Member for Fareham discussed or to stipulate in advance what they might
be.</div>
<a name="08110462000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall sought assurance that the aim is to
preserve a viable entity. I confirm that that is exactly the case.
Before the SRR operates, the objectives of the bank&#146;s management
and the FSA as its regulator will clearly be to run it as a going
concern. Once the bank is in the SRR, subject to the objectives that we
are debating, the authorities&#146; aim will be to preserve the
business or part of it as a viable business entity. All along, pre-SRR,
we want businesses to continue as going concerns. Once a business is in
the SRR, the first point is to preserve all or some of its parts as
viable business
entities.</div><a name="08110462000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have demonstrated that the SRR objectives in the Bill
strike the right balance between being clear about our primary aims and
the purpose of the SRR measures and protecting other important rights
and interests. I also hope that my explanation of other measures in the
Bill and the code of practice address the concerns raised in the
amendments. I hope that that provides adequate reassurance that we have
taken those important matters seriously, that hon. Members, who I think
tabled the amendments in a probing spirit, will not press them and that
we can agree that clause 4 should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08110462000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000319"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I thank the Minister for his full reply to our
debate on clause 4. Given his remarks, I want to reflect on a few
points. We had an exchange during his speech about what was meant by
&#147;depositor&#148;. I am still concerned that the Bill deals
with depositors in a rather broad way. The explanatory notes do not
clarify the position, so we are reliant on a non-binding code of
practice for a clearer definition.</div>
<a name="08110462000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
a local authority or charity depositor to look at the objectives and
say that the Government had not protected them because they had been
ranked alongside the window cleaner and the person who provides the
stationery when it comes to the payout on administration for
insolvency. I believe that we need greater clarity about the different
levels of protection given to the different types of depositors in the
various sectors. A retail depositor has a very different set of
protections from a non-retail depositor. That does not come across, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 319</div>either in the Bill or in the explanatory notes, and it is not as clear
as it could be in the code of practice. It is important to make it
absolutely clear to depositors what protection they are likely to
receive under the scheme.</div>
<a name="08110462000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
gap that the Government need to consider on the question of financial
stability. The working definition used in the evidence session at the
start of the process by the Bank&#146;s executive director for
financial stability, Nigel Jenkinson, was narrower than the definition
in the code of practice. We could end up with the Bank believing that
it was accountable for one thing in the context of how it operates,
with the code of practice expressing financial stability in a wider
fashion. The two should be more closely aligned, so that all the
tripartite authorities know exactly what is meant by financial
stability.</div>
<a name="08110462000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
conceded on Thursday that this business should be covered by the Bill,
but the Bank and the Treasury should be singing from the same hymn
sheet. I am not sure that they are. That will add to the confusion over
the respective roles of the Bank and other tripartite authorities and
how financial stability is to be addressed under the Bill, particularly
under part 1. More work needs to be done on that
aspect.</div><a name="08110462000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
balance of objectives is dealt with in subsection (9); my hon. Friend
the Member for Wellingborough debated it with the Minister, and I
touched upon it in my remarks. One part of the challenge is that people
will need to know how the objectives work together in different
circumstances. One objective of the code&#151;we will talk about it
in our debates on clause 5&#151;is to give some clarity and
predictability. Clause 5(2)(a) is about how to achieve the special
resolution objectives. We need a window in the code on how they
interact at different times. I agree that they may vary; indeed, the
code reflects on the fact that they may vary, depending on the
time.</div>
<a name="08110462000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I drafted
amendment No. 77 before I saw the draft code. Paragraph 10 of the code
makes much clearer how depositors might be protected. Amendments Nos.
74 and 76 are on the value of the enterprise and the interests of the
creditors respectively. I am not sure whether the safeguards identified
by the Minister are sufficient to reassure creditors. The safeguards
come across almost as a second-order priority, because they are to be
dealt with in secondary legislation or in a different clause. The fact
that they are not in clause 4 indicates that creditors&#146; rights
are not as important, and the Government&#146;s thinking on ensuring
that value is left in the business for creditors does not seem as
important as some of the other objectives in clause 4. I am not sure
whether the Minister has addressed that point fully, and we might want
to return to it
later.</div><a name="08110462000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister teased apart the issue of whether we are dealing with public
or private money. I want to touch on the efficient use of private
money, which we will probably deal with in more detail under clause 157
about the funding of the regime. There is a provision in the Bill to
verify how the money is spent&#151;like an audit. From my accountancy
training, I know that an audit does not necessarily show that money has
been spent well or
efficiently.</div><a name="08110462000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000321"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I expect my hon. Friend was both a client and an
auditor at different stages of his career before he came to the House.
An audit does not provide exactly the reassurance I seek in amendment
No. 78. I accept the point about public money&#151;that the NAO is
there to provide an external check, and that before spending
taxpayers&#146; money the Treasury will go through its own processes
to determine whether that is the best way to resolve the crisis;
however, the provision for independent verification of the use of the
funds that the banking sector will provide to the FSCS, to meet some of
the costs of resolution, does not necessarily go far
enough.</div><a name="08110462000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
competition, I think that the Minister set out to reassure us that
there are sufficient checks on an institution that has been subject to
one of the stabilisation tools, to ensure that it does not act
anti-competitively. During the debate on the code, I might touch on the
meaning of &#147;conservative&#148; in the section dealing with
temporary public ownership. The Minister has acknowledged the
importance of ensuring that the right arrangements are in place so that
banks in receipt of public financial assistance are not unfairly
advantaged. It would be wrong to advantage banks that are seen to have
failed, to the detriment of those that seem to manage their businesses
successfully without recourse to public funds. On that basis, and with
the reservation about creditors, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment. I will not seek permission later to press any of the other
amendments in the group to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000324"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The code of practice in clause 5, which we have
already referred to quite a bit today, is seen by third parties as an
important part of the legislation, because it is one of the tools that
would give the market comfort regarding how the powers in parts 1, 2
and 3 will be exercised. It is therefore important that the code gets
it right and that there is sufficient guidance in it to enable people
to predict reasonably well when and how the powers will be used.
Subsection (2) of clause 5 sets out some of the guidance that will be
included in the code. I will start by talking about my amendments, and
then speak more generally about clauses 5 and 6 stand
part.</div><a name="08110462000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments aim to highlight some of the potential deficiencies in the
code as currently drafted. Amendment No. 81 inserts some additional
guidance on the context. It
reads,</div><a name="08110462000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;how
to determine whether the threshold conditions under section
41(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 will be
breached&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
code, to be fair, refers to that. Paragraph 28
states:</div><a name="08110462000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
FSA&#146;s Handbook contains rules and guidance relevant to an
authorised firm. In particular, within the FSA Handbook, the
&#145;COND&#146; Threshold Conditions contains rules and guidance
on the threshold conditions. There are a range of conditions,
including: legal status and location of offices; the adequacy of the
firm&#146;s resources (financial and non financial) in relation to
the regulated activities which the firm carries on; and suitability
issues (e.g. competent and prudent management, conducting business with
integrity and in compliance with proper standards). These are set out
in more detail in the FSA Handbook.&#148;</div>
<a name="08110462000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether the code really provides the guidance that people need to
determine whether the threshold conditions will be breached, or which
threshold conditions in particular the Government are interested in.
For example, one of the threshold conditions not referred to in
paragraph 28 is the appointment of a claims representative. I do not
know whether the breach of the appointment of a claims representative
will trigger the special resolution regime. I hope it does not, but
part of the problem is that we are left none the wiser in the code as
to whether that is the
case.</div><a name="08110462000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the matter of the location of offices, I printed off the relevant
section of the conditions handbook to see whether it might provide me
with some more detail. It states
that</div><a name="08110462000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
the person concerned is a body corporate constituted under the law of
any part of the United Kingdom...its head office, and...if it
has a registered office, that office, must be in the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
the fact that a FSA-regulated firm decides to change its head office
and move out of the UK be sufficient to trigger the special resolution
regime? It may be sufficient to remove its authorisation, but do we
really want to go down the route of triggering the special resolution
regime if a firm happens to change its head
office?</div><a name="08110462000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes to condition 2.2 talk about how a firm&#146;s head
office might be defined. It is not defined in the Act apparently, nor
in the post-BCCI directive, nor in the insurance mediation directive.
The FSA handbook
states:</div><a name="08110462000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is not necessarily the firm&#146;s place of incorporation or the
place where its business is wholly or mainly carried on. Although the
FSA will judge each application on a case-by-case basis, the key issue
in identifying the head office of a firm is the location of its central
management and control, that is, the location of: the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 322</div>directors and other senior management, who make decisions relating to
the firm&#146;s central direction, and the material management
decisions of the firm on a day-to-day basis&#148;.</div>
<a name="08110462000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not clear whether
a breach of that threshold condition is sufficiently important for the
stabilisation powers to be used. If it is important we need some
guidance in the code to say why. Where the Government are coming from
in the threshold conditions is not really about the location of the
head office or the appointment of a claims representative&#151;it is
about the adequacy of resources. That, to my mind, is the sense of
where the Government got to on Kaupthing and Heritable, but all that we
know in the context of those two institutions is that the FSA judged
that the threshold conditions had not been met. I do not know why the
FSA made that judgment and the reason was not apparent from the
Treasury&#146;s press release on the
topic.</div><a name="08110462000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are talking about adequate resources we should say so in the Bill
and the code. We should give people some guidance in the code as to
what it means if adequate resources rules have not been met because I
think they are subjective terms. I shall give an example from the
FSA&#146;s online
handbook:</div><a name="08110462000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;FSA
will interpret the term adequate as meaning sufficient in terms of
quantity, quality and availability, and resources as including all
financial resources, non-financial resources and means of managing its
resources; for example, capital, provisions against liabilities,
holdings of or access to cash and other liquid assets, human resources
and effective means by which to manage
risks.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a very subjective definition of the meaning of adequate resources.
We do not necessarily want the FSA to be tied to a quantitative
definition but we require some guidance in the code as to what the FSA
would deem inadequate resources, to give a flavour of the sort of areas
we are looking at. The code is currently deficient in not providing
that detailed guidance, which is why I propose amendment No.
81.</div>
<a name="08110462000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 80, the current situation under subsection (4) is that the
authorities must have regard to the code. I think the term &#147;have
regard to&#148; is too weak. The authorities might read it, not be
very interested, throw it away and not be bound by it, but it is a key
part of the structure of this series of reforms and the code is seen by
the outside world as an integral part of the package. Simply to
&#147;have regard to&#148; the code is not strong enough to give
the right degree of emphasis when bearing in mind the powers set out in
part 1. That is why I have suggested in my amendment that the
requirement should be on the tripartite authorities to comply with the
code or publish an explanation of why they were unable to do
so,</div>
<a name="08110462000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in good time
after their actions&#148;.</div>
<a name="08110462000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Comply or explain is a
term that is used quite often by businesses in their accounts. If
something does not comply with the code, they explain why. I am
suggesting that the same principle should be used in the
provisions.</div><a name="08110462000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
other omissions might be dealt with on a stand part basis. Paragraphs 2
to 13 of the code, which set out how the objectives in clause 4 are to
be defined, do not go far enough in detail, although we have dealt with
that point in the previous debate. Paragraph 29, on page 7
of the code, uses curious language that leads me to
think&#151;although I do not think this is the right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div>interpretation&#151;that the default tool for the Bank to exercise is
the bank insolvency procedure. Paragraph 29
says:</div><a name="08110462000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under
section 8 of the Act, the Bank may only exercise a resolution tool
other than the bank insolvency procedure if satisfied that the exercise
of the power is
necessary&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is almost as if the Bank of England will start on the basis that it
will exercise the bank insolvency procedure unless it thinks the powers
in paragraph 8 that enable it to have a private sector purchaser or
bridge bank are better. I assume that the default is private sector
purchase, that the bridge bank is the second preferred option, and that
temporary public ownership or the bank insolvency procedure rank
further down the list of
priorities.</div><a name="08110462000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000325"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman highlights a concern that I
share. The code is silent on whether the institutions involved should
just stand aside and let the bank collapse, on the basis that its
collapse poses no systemic risk to financial stability in the UK. That
implication is not set out in the code; in fact, the default position
is that the authorities will take some action, almost no matter which
financial institution is involved, on whatever scale and however
isolated the impact might be. I would welcome the greater clarity in
the simple position: &#147;This is a matter for the market to
resolve. We shouldn&#146;t be involved at
all.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000326"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I think I understand where the hon. Gentleman is
coming from&#151;it relates to the clarity of the code and what the
code says the default options should be. As I understand his view, it
is that the instinctive reaction is that action should be taken, rather
than that the market should run its course and the bank should end up
in administration or insolvency. The drafting of paragraph 29 certainly
suggests that the expectation is that default will end up in
administration or insolvency, rather than that all the stabilisation
powers should be used first. Perhaps the language needs to be clarified
further to get it right so that we can understand the sequencing or the
priorities.</div><a name="08110462000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000327"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Will the Committee permit me to clarify a little
further? It is important to emphasise the moral hazard position, which
is that the public sector should not be expected to step in whenever an
institution appears to be threatened. The last few months have almost
given the impression that whatever institution is threatened and
whichever group of savers might find their savings in jeopardy, the
public purse will step in to resolve the matter. The code is an
opportunity to make it absolutely clear that that is not the case.
There are circumstances in which an institution may be permitted to
collapse because it does not pose a systemic risk to the financial
stability of the UK, but the last few months have allowed us to drift
away from that
debate.</div><a name="08110462000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000328"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I am
not entirely clear in my mind whether that issue has been properly
addressed throughout the crisis. The hon. Gentleman makes the point
that before the crisis started, the assumption would be that the market
would work its way through some of these issues, that the deposit
protection scheme and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme were
there to protect consumers and that if a bank collapsed, that would be
the route. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 324</div>That goes back to the moral hazard point of view&#151;the warning to
investors, creditors and depositors: &#147;Don&#146;t expect to be
bailed out. You need to think about your own
position.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
this crisis, we have moved to a situation where it is expected that our
Government and Government generally&#151;the crisis affects countries
outside the UK as well&#151;will leap to the rescue; and to use the
Minister&#146;s phrase from the evidence session, that we will do
whatever it takes to solve the problem. One of the Treasury&#146;s
challenges in writing the code is to write it in a way that covers both
our present situation and what happens when financial stability
returns. That goes back to the comment made during the last debate
about the context in which such decisions are made. In a time of
financial instability, a different set of decisions might be made from
those that would be made in a period of financial stability, when moral
hazard may well come back to the fore. However, it is important for the
code to distinguish clearly between the two situations, and what the
impact will be. It is difficult to draft the bit about what the impact
would be, because that itself could lead to a degree of uncertainty,
but it would be helpful to be able to tease apart the two different
contexts.</div><a name="08110462000270"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="08110462000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000329"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I entirely agree with the hon. Member for South
Derbyshire. We have, to an extent, drifted away from what was the norm
only a few months ago. Of course, there is no obligation on the
Government to use the powers; they may not consider the time
appropriate to use them. The powers are very clearly designed to
protect depositors&#151;there is no qualification to that. They may
be depositors of very significant funds&#151;well in excess of the
compensation scheme limits&#151;and if there was a qualification,
standing back and letting the bank go might be perfectly acceptable.
Some of the objectives have made that position more difficult, which is
a slippery slope that I suspect may make Governments wish to return to
something more akin to the norm with moral hazard; otherwise, they will
be inveigled into trying to come in under special resolutions to
protect almost any situation, because of the extent of the
deposits.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000330"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a difficult area to get right and I am
pleased that I am in the position of having to criticise the code
rather than having to draft it. It is a much easier position to be in.
The interchange of thoughts about what sort of messages the code sends
out is important, because when drafting the code one needs to be very
careful about the impression that is created in the minds of
depositors, as I alluded to earlier in response to the hon. Member for
South Derbyshire before I took the intervention from the hon. Member
for South-East Cornwall. For example, if there is a very clear
restatement in the code that the limit for deposit protection is
&#163;50,000 and that will apply in the future, we may see the
shuffling of money around banks, post offices and so on, which may
trigger a fresh wave of
uncertainty.</div><a name="08110462000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to get the balance right. It is important, in general, that we try
where possible to give as much detail about the context as we can, and
to give a degree of predictability even though it may cause some people
concern. The more predictability there is in the code, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 325</div>the greater the market&#146;s confidence that the code is right and
the greater the likelihood that it will know how the powers will be
used. That is what the code is about&#151;how the powers will be used
and how market participants can be confident that the powers will not
be used will-nilly, at the drop of a hat. We are talking about the
controls and the checks on the exercise of the powers, which is why the
code needs to be detailed at the front end to give people a greater
sense of how the powers will be put into practice.</div>
<a name="08110462000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not a
great believer in long documents and I always think that it is better
to have a shorter ones, but when I opened the file containing the code
of practice, I was surprised at how short it was given the complexity
of the issues. While this is an early draft, and I suspect that later
drafts may elaborate on some of these issues, this area needs
elaboration. How should people expect the powers to work in&#151;to
use a different analogy&#151;wartime and
peacetime?</div><a name="08110462000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some more specific comments. Paragraphs 32 and 33 of the code deal
with clause 8 of the
Bill:</div><a name="08110462000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
test of &#145;necessity&#146; is a high one. In determining whether
the exercise of the power is necessary, the Bank must have regard to
whether other approaches would resolve the
situation.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I am not sure whether there is enough information in the code to
determine when the bank will find it necessary to exercise such powers.
The code is a bit light on timings of when things may happen, so we
need a bit more specificity in that regard. I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to paragraph 20, which says that there
will be a</div>
<a name="08110462000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;revised
Memorandum of Understanding between the
Authorities&#148;</div><a name="08110462000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">which</div><a name="08110462000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
set out how the Authorities will communicate with each other before and
during the resolution of an
institution&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not clear when that memorandum will be produced, and it would be
helpful to know. When the Treasury Committee debated the matter, it was
suggested that we would see the MOU long after the passing of the Bill.
To help us understand how the authorities will interact with one
another in the context of the Bill, it would be helpful to have sight
of that element of the revised MOU before the Bill completes its
passage through both
Houses.</div><a name="08110462000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
paragraph 33, there is a trade-off. It
says:</div><a name="08110462000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
assessment must balance the short- and long-term effects on financial
stability, public confidence and depositor protection of different
resolution
options.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is absolutely right; I could not disagree with that statement, but what
does it really mean? What are the short and long-term effects? The
paragraph refers to the need &#147;to protect depositors&#148; but
it does not expand to cover the short and long-term effects on
financial stability or public
confidence.</div><a name="08110462000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
36 of the code refers
to</div><a name="08110462000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
operational risks of managing a bridge bank and the amount of public
funding that may be required to keep it
operational.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no sense of where the economic decision comes into play. We talked
about the protection of taxpayer interests in the previous clause. The
code says
that</div><a name="08110462000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Bank will need to take into account in determining the feasibility of
different
tools&#148;</div><a name="08110462000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">factors
such as the operational risks of managing a bridge bank and the amount
of public funding that may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 326</div>be required to keep it operational. I do not get a sense of where the
balance of judgment is between this and temporary public
ownership.</div>
<a name="08110462000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 40
of the code does not say much apart from paraphrasing conditions A and
B. I think that more work needs to be done on that area if we are to
understand how the Bank, or the tripartite authorities, will act in the
public interest and how they will apply the conditions. I would have
expected more clarity in that
area.</div><a name="08110462000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
44, 45 and 46 are important and relate to the announcement of the tools
and to accountability. I referred to that matter earlier today in the
context of amendment No. 80, in which I call on the relevant
authorities to comply or explain. Paragraph 46 relates to something
that I mentioned in a previous debate. The Minister responded by saying
how transparent the Treasury would be over the exercise of such powers.
I asked him whether the announcement made by the Treasury in respect of
Kaupthing and Heritable was a model or a template for what we would see
under paragraphs 44, 45 and 46 or whether we would see a fuller
explanation. The Minister did not come back to me on that point, and I
was too slow to pick him up on it, but I will give him a second chance
in this debate to explain&#151;if he has not thrown away the notes
that his officials prepared. That is important, because it helps to
build up an understanding of how the Government will react in the minds
of participants. When people are assessing how the powers will be used,
they will look not only at the code, but at how the measures are
applied subsequently, to see where the gap is between the application
and the code. Therefore, we need to ensure that a decent level of
information is available to help participants to understand the range
of powers. Also, of course, that is an important part of holding the
tripartite authorities to account on how the powers will be
used.</div>
<a name="08110462000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not a
member of the Treasury Committee and I was not able to listen to
yesterday&#146;s sitting because I was engaged on the Report stage of
the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill, but I suspect that
the Committee would like to debate again Icelandic banks, for example,
in the event of the exercise of the stabilisation powers. The more
transparency about how the powers will be used and the more
announcements that are made about them, the easier it will be for
Parliament to hold the authorities to account, which is particularly
important when taxpayers&#146; money is
involved.</div><a name="08110462000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
52 begins with the words: &#147;In exceptional circumstances&#148;.
What are exceptional circumstances? Are they so exceptional that the
Government do not expect the measure to be used? It is important to
clarify the definition of exceptional
circumstances.</div><a name="08110462000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
go back to time periods, paragraph 60 of the draft code
states:</div><a name="08110462000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
in situations where there is expected to be a lengthy period of time
prior to a sale, the Bank shall put in place an appropriate governance
structure&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
long is &#147;lengthy&#148;, and when does one decide when
something has gone from being short to &#147;lengthy&#148;? If the
powers had been available and the Bank had owned the shares in Northern
Rock, it might have thought that it could flog it within a couple of
months. However, I suspect that the gap between the Northern Rock
rescue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 327</div>in September and its nationalisation in February would be deemed
&#147;a lengthy period&#148; if the powers had been available at
the time, and it may have been necessary to put in place appropriate
governance arrangements. What is &#147;lengthy&#148;? How long is a
reasonable period before steps to put in an &#147;appropriate
governance structure&#148; need to be
taken?</div><a name="08110462000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
his remarks on a previous clause, the Minister referred to the
safeguarding in the code of practice of operating strategies. Paragraph
68 states that that</div>
<a name="08110462000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is likely to
involve the bridge bank operating on a conservative basis, to protect
the franchise value of the business&#148;.</div>
<a name="08110462000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure what
&#147;conservative&#148; means. Does it mean prudence in the
management of liabilities or when dealing with repossessions? Is it
&#147;conservative&#148; in that the bridge bank does not take any
risks and operates at the less competitive edge of the threshold? Doing
so could impede the achievement of its objectives. Knowing the meaning
of &#147;conservative&#148; in this context would be helpful to the
banking
system.</div><a name="08110462000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that no one expects a bridge bank to exist for too long a
period&#151;that is not necessarily its purpose&#151;because there
could be other ways in such a period to resolve the situation.
Paragraph 72, on the bridge bank report,
states:</div><a name="08110462000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank must report to the Chancellor about the activities of a bridge
bank if a bridge bank exists for a year. The first report must be made
as soon as is reasonably practicable after the end of one year
beginning with the date of the first transfer to the bridge bank. A
similar report must also be made as soon as is reasonably practicable
after the end of each subsequent
year&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that Northern Rock reports quarterly to the Treasury,
and I am not sure why the reporting requirements for the bridge bank
are less onerous. I thought that they would be broadly
comparable.</div><a name="08110462000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
80, which is on disposal and onward transfer, states:</div>
<a name="08110462000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Following
this process, the Bank shall complete the transaction. This may be
achieved through a standard commercial agreement...or by
exercising the onward transfer powers provided in the Banking
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether there is a practical difference between the two
options. Will they be used in different circumstances, or are they
interchangeable? It is not clear why that might be the
case.</div><a name="08110462000271"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="08110462000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
93, on page 16, is also ambiguous as to
time:</div><a name="08110462000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a bank is likely to remain in public ownership for longer than a short
period&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is sometimes difficult to determine what a short period is. There is no
guidance, and the context is the objectives that the Treasury will set
for the board of directors. In the case of Northern Rock, even though
we are in a period of temporary public ownership, that period has been
deemed sufficiently long for the Government to set objectives. The
Government could have argued in February that they expected to make a
quick sale and therefore would not set objectives. That is a purely
hypothetical argument rather than a realistic one, but the presumption
should be that objectives will be set for a bank in temporary public
ownership.</div><a name="08110462000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
read through the code, I have just picked out some areas where further
work needs to be done. I make those points not to sound pedantic or
picky but to say that we need to be much clearer about how the code
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 328</div>operate in practice if it is to be the reassurance that the financial
services sector is looking for as to how the powers will be
exercised.</div>
<a name="08110462000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">To touch on
amendments Nos. 82 to 85 to clause 6, which I tabled, I wanted to focus
on the consultation process surrounding the code. Since I tabled the
amendments, the Minister has tabled a new clause that addresses
amendment No. 83, which would insert after subsection (1)(c) a new line
(d):</div><a name="08110462000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;those
persons whom it considers to have relevant knowledge of those
matters.&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause, which is not scheduled for debate today, deals with
amendment No. 83, because it sets out clearly who should be consulted.
In terms of the broader consultation on revisions to the code, the
Government might wish to go wider than that. I have also proposed that
the code should undergo some form of scrutiny. I would not normally
advocate parliamentary scrutiny of a code, but given the importance
invested in this one, Parliament should have the opportunity to
consider it. It forms an important part of the framework of the
Bill.</div><a name="08110462000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the code as we saw it on Thursday, which is largely as it
will be when it is made available for public consultation later this
week, requires a lot more work. One or two people to whom I have spoken
who have seen the code share my view that there should be much more
detail about how it will work in practice, and others do not yet see it
as the safeguard that they anticipated. I hope that the Minister will
see my comments as constructive rather than critical for the sake of
being critical. We want to be constructive about how we engage on the
code, but there is a lot more work to be
done.</div><a name="08110462000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000331"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> The proposal relates to an amendment that we tabled
to clause 7. Under clause 5(2)(d) the code will provide guidance
on</div><a name="08110462000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;how
to determine whether Condition 2 in section 7 is
met&#148;.</div><a name="08110462000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I recognise that we are talking about a draft code of practice, what we
have so far does not really explain precisely how it will be determined
that condition 2 in section 7 is met. It merely repeats some of the
wording from the Bill itself.</div>
<a name="08110462000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fundamental
aspect of both the amendments to clause 4 and what is happening in
clauses 5, 6 and 7 is how the external investors may view bank shares
or banks in the future. Their investment, which can be considerable,
may be far less certain than they had originally expected. The
determination of whether condition 2 in section 7 is met is
fundamental. We need a clear indication of that in the code because
that sort of clarity, along with the other aspects of amendments that
are yet to come, and one that has already been withdrawn, is
fundamental to the way in which the SRR will work.</div>
<a name="08110462000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Timing is
obviously of the essence. I accept that and it is recognised in the
guidance. But we need to be much more precise about how that condition
is exercised. Upon that will depend so much of the perception of
whether a bank can raise more capital, whether it has enough investors
to begin with and even future capital-raising exercises if necessary.
Unless investors are confident that the plug will not be pulled from a
bank in which they are going to invest and that the conditions will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 329</div>clearly met and will not be very subjective in their interpretation,
they will be reluctant to invest in such
businesses.</div><a name="08110462000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000332"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument. Is he making the case that where a bank is in some sort of
trouble, but has not reached this stage, investors who might invest in
order to save it will stand back if they do not know the precise terms
of when the special regime will come
in?</div><a name="08110462000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000333"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That is exactly right. As the Minister said, the
objective is to try to maintain these entities as going concerns. In
general terms that will probably require some sort of recapitalisation
and additional investment. The conditions under which an entity may
ultimately come under some sort of regime may determine whether that
capital-raising exercise is successful. We have to make it much clearer
that it is not too subjective and that clear conditions have to be met,
so that people understand what will happen. As I said, I can see in the
drafts no clear explanation of how it will be determined whether
condition 2 in section 7 is
met.</div><a name="08110462000176"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000334"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I want to amplify briefly the point that I made in
my intervention on the hon. Member for Fareham. We are contributing to
the process of producing in the code not a specific disaster plan, but
a document that is effectively enshrined in law. As it is referred to
in the Bill, it will be a permanent feature of the regulation of
banking in this country, and will be used as a reference document of
some considerable substance.</div>
<a name="08110462000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I felt when I
read the code that it was written, perfectly understandably, in the
crisis-room mentality of dealing with the circumstances that we face
and how we are using powers now&#151;the hon. Member for Fareham,
very fairly, said that it is easier to criticise and a lot harder to
write. It was not written in normal circumstances, in which we could
perhaps respond with a wider range of policy options than we have been
using until now. That is my first, guiding
principle.</div><a name="08110462000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
to use a sort of Rumsfeld term, this is an opportunity for us to
express certainty about uncertainty, particularly about risk and the
principles of risk. One of my anxieties about the way in which the code
is written and, of course, to some extent about the necessary actions
that we have taken recently, is that they entrench in our citizens, and
to some extent our institutions, an assumption that the state will
intervene and provide, almost regardless of what circumstances we face.
That is, baldly, an unhealthy
position.</div><a name="08110462000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
document is an opportunity&#151;I should say straight away that this
needs to be carefully expressed&#151;to restate some principles of
moral hazard that the state&#146;s action should in normal
circumstances reinforce, although I recognise that these are not normal
circumstances. Those principles, broadly, are that if a person runs or
invests in a business, they must expect to take risks and, in some
circumstances, may find failure and, in ultimate circumstances, utter
failure and complete loss of their investment and employment. That is a
part of a mixed economy. We should not try to suggest that if a person
is in a deposit-taking institution, for example, such failure might not
happen because the state can always intervene and resolve some of their
problems. That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 330</div>the first moral message that needs to be reinforced. There are
circumstances in which a business might collapse. One can imagine
circumstances in which that might be allowed to happen, for example, in
the case of a small business or one that operates in such a niche
function within the marketplace that its departure might not
necessarily cause either a loss of confidence or an impact on financial
stability. I think that we have recognised that the US, in the Lehman
Brothers example, probably made the wrong judgment about when to
reinforce moral hazard and that the consequent effect on confidence and
stability was so profound that it should have accepted a greater
responsibility to intervene.</div>
<a name="08110462000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000335"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is a very good example of when predictability
in the market would help. Actually, the expectation of investors, based
on actions that the Federal Reserve took on Bear Stearns, was that it
would bail out Lehman Brothers. The fact that it did not, and allowed
moral hazard to take its course, became an even greater shock, and
triggered a further wave of
problems.</div><a name="08110462000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="08110462000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000336"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> That indicates some of the risks in an inconsistency
of approach. The world is inconsistent, but the difficulty is that the
jeopardy in that case was rather profound. It was probably the wrong
decision. I can see why it was made, but I think it was an error. None
the less, there might well be circumstances in which some other
institution, not quite like Lehman Brothers, could be allowed to fail;
and we should allow it to happen.</div>
<a name="08110462000272"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="08110462000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000337"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I entirely agree with the case that the hon.
Gentleman is making, but I have not been able in my own mind to come up
with a situation in which any Government, whatever their political
colour, would allow a financial institution to go under. Does the hon.
Gentleman believe, in reality, that that would
happen?</div><a name="08110462000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000338"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> In reality, the answer is yes. It could happen, and
we should reinforce the message that in some circumstances it would. If
we do not give that impression in a document of this kind, we risk
giving the impression that, in some way, it is a charmed circle
activity in which there is some form of intervention&#151;but not, of
course, one that necessarily protects shareholders&#146; rights; that
jeopardy is pretty explicit in the choice of objectives that have been
set. However, some other stakeholders certainly have protections in
place that provide for the state to be the fall-back
position.</div>
<a name="08110462000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
moral hazard is that depositors should take some responsibility for
their decisions when choosing where their deposits should be placed.
For perfectly understandable reasons&#151;I do not criticise the
Government; I can see where they are and how they got there&#151;we
have given the broad impression that whatever has been done by UK
licensed deposit-taking bodies, people will be okay to whatever
investment limit they have chosen. The difficulty is that if one allows
that message to be given out repeatedly, people will chase the best
rates without any thought. That, of course, will incentivise market
behaviour, which chases exactly those depositors.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 331</div><a name="08110462000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important, in a document of this kind, to reinforce those principles.
It does not need to be done at length, but I would prefer a firm
emphasis on ensuring that when the state acts it should, in normal
circumstances, seek to reinforce those moral goods in the market place
rather than protecting the participants to the point where they lose
the inclination for any kind of risk awareness. As the Sage of
Twickenham remarked in a debate in which I was able to participate, if
we protect everyone from foolish behaviour, we will have a nation of
fools. That is a pretty sensible picture of the ultimate outcome of
ignoring the moral hazard argument.</div>
<a name="08110462000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I encourage
the Government to think further on the approach that they are taking in
the code. Much work remains to be done. It has one rather embarrassing
typo, which I am sure will be picked up, but there is more work of
substance to be done on the document, and I am sure that we can all
participate in it.</div>
<a name="08110462000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000339"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> The hon. Member for South Derbyshire made a
thoughtful, well-informed and well-judged speech. The lesson of
politics is that the battle is not so important; it is the war that
matters. I do not necessarily expect the Minister to say that he
accepts everything said by the hon. Gentleman and that he will order an
immediate redraft, but the points that he made may at some point be
taken into account. I completely share his
view.</div><a name="08110462000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to address my remarks to clause 5(2)(d), which is on the crucial
issue of the trigger for a special regime. We have to go back to 1997
and the creation of the tripartite arrangements between the Treasury,
the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England. The Bank, to
great acclaim, was given the responsibility for setting interest rates,
and to effect that the Monetary Policy Committee was created. Rather
less noticed was the taking away from the Bank of its responsibility
for banking supervision. The FSA was given the duty to control and
monitor individual banks, while the Bank of England was given a more
general power to control financial stability. The FSA fulfilled its
duty, but there is little point in glossing over the facts: there were
failures, and they happened on the watch of the FSA, which failed to
perceive the systemic risks within some banks. We must learn from our
lessons. There is no point in being too polite; we must say that there
was a failure
there.</div><a name="08110462000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government propose laying further specific duties on the FSA. Paragraph
26 of the draft code of conduct of the special resolution regime
clearly
states:</div><a name="08110462000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
decision whether the bank or building society fails or is likely to
fail to meet the threshold conditions is a regulatory matter for the
FSA.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
concerns me, because I have felt for some time that there should be a
division of responsibility in the future, based on our learning from
our mistakes in the past. The FSA should be given what I regard as the
box-ticking, the responsibility for regulation, for ensuring that
individual institutions meet certain criteria. The Bank of England,
however, should be given responsibility for what I call banking
supervision.</div><a name="08110462000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
distinguish between banking regulation and banking supervision. It
should be possible for not only the FSA but the Bank of England to pull
the trigger, because since the FSA is responsible for the routine
financial regulation of banks it will naturally be reluctant to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 332</div>come forward and say that normal regulation has failed. It will
instinctively&#151;naturally&#151;not wish to say that the
regulation for which it is responsible has not been successful. There
should therefore be a separate mechanism giving the Bank of England the
power to supervise, and that power of supervision must provide it with
enough personnel and abilities for it to be close enough to the
management of banks to know when special action is required. Clause
8(1)
states:</div><a name="08110462000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank of England may exercise a stabilisation power in respect of a bank
in accordance with section 10(2) or 11(2) only if satisfied that
Condition A is
met.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(2) then
states:</div><a name="08110462000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition
A is that the exercise of the power is necessary, having regard to the
public interest
in&#151;</div><a name="08110462000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the stability of the financial systems of the United
Kingdom,</div><a name="08110462000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the maintenance of public confidence in the stability of the banking
systems of the United Kingdom,
or</div><a name="08110462000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the protection of
depositors.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the Government have put in the Bill the same kind of
responsibilities for the Bank as it already has under current
legislation. The responsibility for individual bank supervision is to
remain with the FSA, whereas the general responsibility for financial
stability, under clause 8, will be that of the Bank. That is not good
enough.</div><a name="08110462000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
draft code of practice envisages, in paragraph 31, that
the</div><a name="08110462000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;three
public interest conditions may overlap (to a greater or lesser degree)
depending upon the particular circumstances of the bank or building
society and the wider circumstances of the financial system as a
whole.&#148;</div><a name="08110462000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
the legislation and the draft regulations envisage that there could be
some overlap in the responsibilities and powers of the Treasury, the
FSA and the Bank. Good, roll it on. Some level of duplication is
necessary. It is not good enough to restrict the regulation and the
power to pull the trigger to the FSA; the power to pull the trigger
must also be available to the Bank of England, because only the Bank of
England has long-term experience of bank control, the levers to affect
financial stability and the traditions and ability to discern systemic
risk, which the FSA, based on its record, has failed significantly to
do.</div>
<a name="08110462000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As happens in
the United States, I would give slightly different responsibilities to
the FSA and the Bank of England, but I think that it is important that
the Bank of England should not be restricted to the exercise of general
powers and the stabilisation power referred to in clause 8. It should
also have the ability to pull the trigger and implement the provisions
to introduce the special regimes.</div>
<a name="08110462000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000340"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As is evident, clause 5 provides for the Treasury
to make a code of practice on the use of the stabilisation powers, the
bank insolvency procedure and the bank administration procedure. The
authorities&#151;that is, the FSA, the Bank of England and the
Treasury&#151;must have regard to the code. The clause also provides
a non-exhaustive list of the areas on which the code may provide
guidance. As hon. Members are aware, a copy of the code was circulated
to the Committee last Thursday and, as I said earlier, a consultation
document on safeguards, including the code, will be issued on
Thursday.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column332" />Column number: 333</div><a name="08110462000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
the code covers further explanation of the SRR objectives, how they
should be balanced, what regard the authorities should have to the
code, further explanation of the roles of the authorities in the SRR,
further explanation of how the authorities will judge that the general
and specific conditions are met, factors to be considered when choosing
the SRR tools, procedure for the announcement of the SRR tools and the
Government&#146;s arrangements for bridge banks and banks in
temporary public ownership. That is not a comprehensive list, and it
will undoubtedly be expanded and clarified as a result of the
consultation
exercise.</div><a name="08110462000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already had significant debate about the further explanation of
the SRR objectives and how they should be balanced, but the hon. Member
for Fareham, in a sort of online stream of consciousness, went through
the code in fine detail. I will respond to some of his questions. He
asked again whether the Kaupthing Edge announcement was a template. Not
necessarily; we will consider such matters on a case-by-case
basis.</div>
<a name="08110462000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">A related
question was how long to wait for a statement. We wish to make a
statement as soon as is reasonably practicable, but as the hon.
Gentleman said, the type of information given may depend, rightly, on
the circumstances. For instance, if there is still a risk of loss of
confidence in the banking system, that might affect the timing of an
announcement as well as what can be disclosed in it. There are tensions
between full and immediate disclosure and effective action. I think
that he understands that. It explains why, although we want to publish
information as quickly as is reasonably practicable, other
considerations must be borne in
mind.</div>
<a name="08110462000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000341"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
explanation&#151;he picked up that I understand the
subtleties&#151;but the announcement about Kaupthing erred on the
scanty side in terms of information. For example, it did not say what
trigger conditions Kaupthing had breached to lead to the FSA&#146;s
withdrawal of permission. That is the level of detail that we want. We
do not need to know down to the nearest 5p why there was an issue, but
there was nothing to indicate why it had lost that permission. It was
missing information that could have been given in any context. Maybe
they had lost their claims representative. I do not
know.</div><a name="08110462000273"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="08110462000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000342"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I note the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments and
will take them into account as part of our consultation on the code.
Regarding the point he makes about the claims inspector, the FSA
handbook does refer to all the threshold conditions. The FSA will
update its handbook in the light of the Bill and will address such
points. On the specific example of the appointment of a claims
representative, I can confirm that this condition applies only to
regulated activity when it comes to carrying out insurance
business.</div>
<a name="08110462000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also referred to paragraph 29 of the code and implied that
the bank insolvency procedure is the default option. That is not the
intention of this part of the code. This paragraph highlights the need
that a strong public interest test, as outlined in clause 8, be met
before the Bank of England exercises stabilisation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 334</div>powers which, as hon. Members have noted, are invasive. That is why we
always need to think carefully before exercising these
powers.</div>
<a name="08110462000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
respond directly to comments raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
South Derbyshire. I can confirm that it is the Government&#146;s
intention not to create a zero-failure regime. Indeed, the bank
insolvency procedure has been created expressly so that there is a
credible failure option. It is possible that the authorities could
decide in the event of a bank or building society failure that there is
not a systemic risk, that the requirement for action under the special
resolution regime is not necessary. I would, however, point out that if
a significant number of retail depositors were affected we might still
want to use the bank insolvency procedure to ensure effective, fast
payout under objective 3, or because perhaps public funds had already
been committed previously to the institution which relates to objective
4.</div>
<a name="08110462000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want
to respond to the point my hon. Friend made that the code was written
in times of crisis and that it should it reflect the actions in periods
of financial stability as well as instability. The point I made that
there is a credible failure option in terms of the bank insolvency
procedure is an important one. I would want to reflect on my hon.
Friend&#146;s point while at the same time wanting to be clear that
the code is specifically about the actions within the special
resolution regime, that is actions that are being taken not under
normal conditions but when a bank is failing. Even then, other tests
have to be satisfied. In terms of when the code is written, I think it
right that we should respond to circumstances as we see them at the
moment, but the Bill allows us to revise the code so it can be updated
in calmer times as well as in times of financial
instability.</div><a name="08110462000207"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000343"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> My hon. Friend will be aware that revising a code to
transfer risk back to the public and to commercial organisations will
be a lot harder than setting out some of those risks at the start of
the process, albeit shrouded carefully in this
document.</div><a name="08110462000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000344"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I certainly take the points made by my hon.
Friend and, as I have said, we will want to reflect on them. I did want
to put back to him the point that the code is deliberately designed to
refer to times that are not normal because it relates to the operation
of the special resolution
regime.</div><a name="08110462000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000345"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> What happens if the independent Bank of England and
the FSA think that the failure of an organisation is a
one-off&#151;not systematic&#151;but the Treasury and the
Government take a wholly different
view?</div><a name="08110462000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110462000346"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not think that it is particularly useful to
engage in speculation, but, from my experience and from hearing about
recent discussions, there are extensive talks between the three
organisations that make up the tripartite authorities in which
different options and courses of action are debated. It is not possible
to set out general principles in this area. We have to look at how
things operate on a case-by-case basis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 335</div><a name="08110462000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham also asked why a bridge bank should report every
year when Northern Rock reports quarterly. He may be misunderstanding
what we are trying to achieve through paragraph 72 of the code, which
is intended to refer to a report on why the bridge bank exists for more
then a year, rather than financial reporting arrangements. We would
certainly expect the Bank of England to put in place appropriate
arrangements for a bridge bank&#146;s management to report to the
Bank in its role as a shareholder.</div>
<a name="08110462000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked what &#147;conservative management&#148; is,
and I am very tempted to tell him. We are trying to get the point
across that we want to take action that will preserve the franchise
value of the banking business transferred to the bridge bank, but we do
not anticipate the bridge bank competing aggressively for new business,
which was one of the concerns that he tabled an amendment on. The code
will be subject to public consultation, and I think that all the points
raised by Committee members will be taken into account as part of that
process.</div>
<a name="08110462000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
81 is designed to ensure that the code includes provisions on
determining whether the threshold conditions, set out in the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, are met. I do not agree with the
intention behind the amendment. The threshold conditions are regulatory
conditions under the 2000 Act, and therefore provisions about
determining whether they are met are included in the FSA handbook, so
it is unnecessary to include in the code any provision on that
determination. However, as hon. Members will see, the draft code that
has been circulated refers to the FSA handbook, so stakeholders can
easily find this detail should they wish. The people involved in these
areas are well aware of the situation. I therefore believe that
amendment No. 81 is
unnecessary.</div><a name="08110462000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 80 comments on the manner in which the authorities should treat the
code of practice. Clause 5(4) requires the authorities to have regard
to the code. The hon. Member for Fareham&#146;s amendment however,
seeks to require authorities to comply or to explain publicly why they
did not comply with the code as soon as possible after any action. I
shall set out why I do not agree with that approach.</div>
<a name="08110462000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions of the code are intended to provide guidance. For example,
the code may set out provisions that should be taken into account or
may provide for the approach that the authorities should normally seek
to adopt. The expectation is that the authorities should follow the
code, and that if they do not, a public explanation would normally be
needed. However, a hard-edged statutory requirement to comply with the
code would be inappropriate to its function and would unduly restrict
the flexibility of the authorities. There may be a number of reasons
why a public explanation is not appropriate; for example, if explaining
an action that did not comply exactly with the code meant divulging
information that itself would put at risk the SRR objectives of
confidence in the banking system or financial stability. I consider
that to be the appropriate status for the code, in that it will provide
a significant amount of detail about how the authorities will implement
the SRR and it can be updated to reflect experience gained from
operating the SRR without imposing hard-edged duties 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 336</div>or requirements on the authorities. I therefore invite hon. Members not
to support the amendment if it is pressed.</div>
<a name="08110462000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the next set of amendments, which refer to clause 6 rather
than clause 5, I shall speak briefly to Government amendment No. 89,
whose purpose is to remove duplication under the Bill, by removing
subsection (2)(f). Clause 11(3)(c) already requires the information
provided for in that subsection to be included in the code of practice,
so it is superfluous to make reference to it. The amendment is simply a
technical correction and I commend it to the Committee.</div>
<a name="08110462000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next set
of amendments refers to clause 6, which sets out the procedure for
developing and updating the code of practice. It requires the Treasury
to consult the FSA, the Bank of England and the FSCS before issuing the
code. Further, it requires the Treasury to lay a copy of the code
before Parliament as soon as is reasonably practicable after issuing
the code. As the code is required to be a flexible document that can
respond to the authorities&#146; experience in operating the SRR and
general market conditions, the Treasury can revise and reissue the
code.</div>
<a name="08110462000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 82 to 85 would introduce extra procedural requirements before the
Treasury could agree and issue the code. First, amendments Nos. 82, 83,
and 85 would require the Treasury, in addition to consulting the Bank,
the FSA and the FSCS, to consult other interested stakeholders.
Secondly, amendment No. 84 would require that the code be approved
through a resolution by both Houses of Parliament before coming into
force. I do not believe that those additions to the procedure are
necessary, and I shall explain why.</div>
<a name="08110462000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
parts of the Bill, including the powers and areas that affect
stakeholders the most, have been and will be subject to full
consultation&#151;indeed, that is something that stakeholders have
welcomed&#151;yet none of that is set out in the Bill and nor should
it be, as it is already covered by the relevant Cabinet Office and
better regulation guidelines on the development of secondary
legislation. I recognise that there is, of course, substantial interest
in the code. That is why, as I explained earlier, I sent a draft to the
new banking expert liaison group last week for discussion at its
meeting on Friday, as well as providing a draft to the Committee. As I
said, the code will be extensively consulted on when the consultation
document is issued on Thursday. Throughout the process of producing the
Bill and its supporting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 337</div>documents, we have had full engagement with stakeholders, and we fully
intend to continue to follow Cabinet Office guidelines in producing,
and consulting on, new secondary legislation and other documentation
supporting the SRR. That, I can assure the Committee, will also be the
case with the code of practice. The amendments are therefore
unnecessary.</div><a name="08110462000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 84 would ensure that Parliament formally approves the code of
practice by resolution. Again, I do not believe that such an amendment
is necessary. Under the Bill, the Treasury has a duty to lay the code
before Parliament and of course Parliament is at liberty to ask
questions or call for debate on the content of the code. However, the
code, just like the FSA handbook, is not a statutory instrument, so I
see no reason to require it to be formally approved by Parliament, just
as the FSA handbook is not formally approved by Parliament. Again, I
hope that our actions in producing a draft code of practice for the
Committee to consider as part of the debate shows our willingness to
involve Parliament and stakeholders in the creation of the document. I
hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</div>
<a name="08110462000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="08110462000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
conclude on the general issue of the accountability of the authorities
to Parliament. The Committee will be aware that the Treasury
Committee&#151;some of whose distinguished members serve on this
Committee&#151;has been active and scrupulous in holding the
authorities to account in their exercise of powers under the Banking
(Special Provisions) Act 2008, and also their actions to deal with the
wider financial crisis. That is exactly how it should be. The
Government expect the Select Committee and Parliament to continue
exercising that important responsibility.</div>
<a name="08110462000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that our approach, with full consultation on the secondary legislation
and the code, and with the secondary legislation coming to Parliament
in the normal way, provides sufficient safeguards. I am sure that the
Treasury Committee will continue to hold all the authorities to
account.</div>
<a name="08110462000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">If hon.
Members wish to press the amendments to a vote, I suggest that, with
the exception of Government amendment No. 89, they should be
opposed.</div>
<a name="08110462000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
