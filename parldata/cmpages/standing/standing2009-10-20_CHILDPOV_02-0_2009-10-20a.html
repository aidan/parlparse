<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000355"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to this
sitting of the Child Poverty Bill Committee. I remind hon. Members and
witnesses that we are bound by the deadline agreed this morning, so
this afternoon&#146;s first evidence session must end at 5.30 pm and
the second session must end at 7 pm. I hope that I will not have to
interrupt hon. Members or witnesses in the middle of sentences, but I
will do so if need be.</div>
<a name="09102073000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are here
this afternoon to hear evidence from Kate Green of the Child Poverty
Action Group, Neera Sharma of Barnardo&#146;s, Fergus Drake from Save
the Children and Kate Bell from Gingerbread. Members of the Committee
will ask them questions and we look forward very much to their answers.
I turn to Graham Stuart for the first
question.</div><a name="09102073000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7575</b><a name="09102073000356"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): The
Government missed their 2005 child poverty target, and they look almost
certain to miss their 2010 child poverty target. They have a great
incentive to bring forward legislation now so that you focus your
attention on that rather than on their failure to meet their previous
promises. Why do you think that legislation will give you more
confidence about delivery in future than you could have had from the
Government&#146;s pledges in the past?</div>
<a name="09102073000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I do not think that we have lacked confidence
in the Government&#146;s intentions in the past. Broadly, we felt
that we would have supported many of the measures that were adopted,
but we would have liked to have seen more investment, effort and speed.
I do not think, therefore, that we are as sceptical about legislation
that will continue to keep the context in place for that investment and
effort to continue and increase.</div>
<a name="09102073000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is clearly an important issue for us and for Parliament in terms
of the credibility of the Bill and of making sure that as much is done
as early as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>possible to continue progress towards the 2010 target&#151;not least
because children cannot wait until 2020 to see the quality of their
lives
improve.</div><a name="09102073000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> It is worth adding that obviously we are still
pushing very hard for progress towards the 2010 target. The pre-Budget
report coming up represents an absolutely key moment for making that
progress. I also think that the structure of the Bill gives us a good
opportunity to continue pushing the Government as they reach 2020. We
see the fact that there is a strategy every three years and an annual
reporting mechanism on progress very much as giving the structure and
framework for us, hopefully, to push the Government to make sure that
they meet that 2020
target.</div><a name="09102073000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> We welcome the legislation because we believe
it to be a major opportunity to shape and drive policy to tackle child
poverty and to improve children&#146;s life chances and the quality
of their childhood. It also sets the context for greater action at a
local level, to drive progress on child poverty to meet the 2020
targets.</div><a name="09102073000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><a name="09102073000357"></a><b class="B">John
Barrett</b> (Edinburgh, West) (LD): In any other walk of life,
&#147;eradication&#148; would mean the end of something, but the
word has a different meaning in relation to the Bill. Are you happy
with the use of &#147;eradication&#148; when it is clearly not
eradication? Moreover, are you happy with the assessment used in the
Bill as a description of &#147;eradication&#148;? Every time I use
&#147;eradication&#148; it means something different from what we
are going to be discussing here today. Is there a problem for those
outside the loop in understanding exactly what the Bill
means?</div>
<a name="09102073000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> The Bill states that the measure for the
eradication of relative poverty is below 10 per cent. We believe that
10 per cent. would still leave 1.3 million children&#151;one in
10&#151;living in poverty. That measure is not challenging or
ambitious enough, and it is likely that those children most at risk of
poverty, such as disabled children and some black and minority ethnic
children, will still remain poor under that 10 per cent. measure. When
the Government made a commitment to eradicate child poverty by 2020,
they stated that that would be the best in Europe. However, the best in
Europe at the time was a level of 5 per cent., in Demark and Finland.
We would prefer a more challenging measure of 5 per cent., rather than
10 per
cent.</div><a name="09102073000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> That is the view across the panel. We have
talked to the Government about the technical difficulties of measuring
child poverty below the 5 per cent. level, and we accept that at that
stage it might get harder. One of our proposals is a suggestion for
after the 2020 target has been met. We hope that it could be done on a
three-year rolling average, so that some of the ups and downs that we
might get once we get down to those very low numbers could be captured.
We think that the Bill needs to be more ambitious in that
area.</div>
<a name="09102073000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000358"></a>John
Barrett:</b> Would you agree that within such a general
target, there is the danger of specific groups&#151;you mentioned
disabled people&#151;heading in the opposite direction, even if the
overall target is being approached?</div>
<a name="09102073000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Yes, that is absolutely a risk. It is
important that the building blocks, the strategies and the reporting of
data enable us to track the progress of some of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>small but vulnerable groups. On the whole, those groups are reasonably
easy to follow in statistics, but they would not be captured in a broad
measure if most children were getting better outcomes but a small group
was being excluded.</div>
<a name="09102073000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000359"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Helen
Goodman):</b> Have you made any assessment of how much tougher
the targets are because there are four of them, rather than just one
relative low-income target? What impact do you think that might
have?</div>
<a name="09102073000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> We welcome the fact that there are four
targets, but we think that the headline, the most important target, is
the relative low-income target. We believe that measuring right across
those four indicators is important, and we welcome that as well as
welcoming measurement through the strategy and the building
blocks.</div>
<a name="09102073000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> We have had three indicators for looking at
child poverty for some time. The new target that the Bill introduces is
the measure of persistent poverty. We hope that that will pick up some
of those more vulnerable groups, so I would say that, yes, it is
welcome.</div>
<a name="09102073000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><a name="09102073000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): May I
explore the possibility of bringing a judicial review under the terms
of the Bill? I will do that by assuming for a moment that a Bill
similar to this one was enacted in 1997 and enshrined the 2010 target
just as this Bill enshrines the 2020 target. Are there any
circumstances from the past 12 years under which any of you would have
been tempted to seek judicial review on a Government policy?</div>
<a name="09102073000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I think that you are asking two questions. You
ask whether we would have been tempted to seek judicial review on a
Government policy. As the Minister and hon. Members will know, we have
taken the Government to judicial review during the past 10 years on a
number of aspects of policy. I suspect that the question is about
whether we would have asked for a judicial review on the failure by the
Secretary of State to address the demands in this
legislation.</div>
<a name="09102073000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to speculate after the event, but we can see a framework now
in which, if no significant and meaningful efforts were being made and
it clearly looked like the target would not be met, I imagine that we
would look for a judicial review well in advance of the failure to
reach the 2020 target. It is not only about hitting the end point, but
about the progress, effort and the steps that we can see are being made
on the way, consistent with that objective.</div>
<a name="09102073000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everybody
understands that unexpected and difficult circumstances can arise, so
it is important for us to track progress, not only as we reach the
finishing post, but well ahead of that point. We will certainly be
planning to do
that.</div>
<a name="09102073000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000361"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I would be interested in the views of the rest of
you on that, but I take it that your view of the Bill is that it would
enable you to seek judicial review any time between its enactment and
2020. It is not something whereby you have to wait until the last year
or so and then seek judicial review.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="09102073000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I do not think that you would have to wait
until after the 2020 target date had passed. It would be considered
unreasonable by the courts not to have given Government the opportunity
to develop and implement meaningful strategies, and we would have no
intention of rushing in with legal challenges. It is a strategic
process that we want to see work. Taking legal action is not at the
forefront of our minds. We want to use the legislation to promote
positive and proactive activity by Ministers in a spirit of willingness
and ambition, which we confidently expect because of the cross-party
support that the legislation enjoys. Of more importance to us is that
the Bill gives public profile and a political push to the issue and
ensures that there is constant progress and
momentum.</div>
<a name="09102073000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000362"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Kate Bell, a moment ago you said that you saw the
public borrowing requirement as a key moment with regard to the 2010
target. Imagine that similar legislation was in place now with regard
to the 2010 target. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the
targets could be met if one spent an additional &#163;4.2 billion on
tax credits and benefits. Assuming that there was very little there
towards meeting the 2010 child benefit target, with the benefit of this
Bill, do you imagine you would seek to obtain judicial review to ensure
that the Government spent more on this area?</div>
<a name="09102073000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> I think that it is hard to counterfactual it
backwards. The Bill requires Government to meet the 2020 target; they
have set out a strategy to do so. In considering a judicial review, we
would look at what the Government had said they would do in their
strategy&#151;whether they had taken steps to meet the target and
what the circumstances were had they not done so. Without the benefit
of the architecture that the Bill puts in place now, it is difficult to
say in what circumstances we would seek a judicial
review.</div>
<a name="09102073000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000363"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> So are you saying that the Government have not had
strategies in place to meet the target&#151;they have merely had a
target?</div>
<a name="09102073000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> They have clearly had strategies in place but
they have not been on the statutory basis that the Bill places them
on.</div>
<a name="09102073000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000364"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> If they had been, would you have been able to look
at them and say, &#147;This is inadequate; there is an opportunity
here for judicial review to ensure the target is met&#148;?</div>
<a name="09102073000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> I think that were a statutory strategy and the
architecture of the Bill in place, you would be able to have that
opportunity. You would be looking at that. As Kate said, you would be
examining the circumstances carefully. I do not think it possible to
say now, with what we have got, how we would use the architecture of
the Bill.</div>
<a name="09102073000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> I think that overall we strongly welcome the
Bill, because it can have a carrot and a stick effect. There is the
stick there. We as a group would have specific conversations around it,
should we be seriously off track in 2017 or 2018. The carrot is all of
us working with children, trying to ensure that their voices are in the
Bill, and working closely with local authorities in terms of needs
assessments and the specific poverty strategies that they will be
working on. That is why we as a group are very supportive of the Bill
overall.</div>

84</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000365"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I ask one final question? Kate Green, you said
that you saw the political pressure as the key driver in the Bill, as
opposed to the judicial review side of it, although you obviously
welcome that. Would the rest of you agree, or do you see being able to
take the Government to court if they fail to abide by an appropriate
strategy as the teeth of the Bill? Or is it the political pressure and
the greater focus on child poverty in the Bill that is the
key?</div>
<a name="09102073000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> I think that it is the political pressure,
but it is also the prospect that there will be strategies in place.
Also, the commission will have a key role, so we can hopefully speak to
the commission, which might call for witnesses. There will be
architecture in place for us to make our voices heard and to make
representations. If we feel that the strategy is not going to address
the issues that we think are pertinent to progress being made, we can
have input at that
stage.</div><a name="09102073000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><a name="09102073000366"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): If one were cynical, one could
imagine a future Government sensing that there was trouble down the
track&#151;even getting wind that you were thinking of judicial
review&#151;and amending the Bill: &#147;delete
&#145;2020&#146; and insert &#145;2030&#146;&#148;, or
&#147;delete &#145;2020&#146; and insert &#145;as soon as is
reasonably practicable&#146;&#148;. Does the Bill have any teeth?
You cannot bind future Governments&#151;we know that, and this is the
nearest we can get to it. We will talk later about whether the child
poverty commission has any teeth. Is there not only a political cost,
as legal action could be forestalled? How strong is the Bill?</div>
<a name="09102073000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> It is worth mentioning that all three parties
have said that they support the Bill, so I hope that it has cross-party
support and no future Government would do what you said. One of the
great things about the Bill is having the statement that all political
parties see ending child poverty by 2020 as a
priority.</div><a name="09102073000048"></a>

Bell:</b></i> We have not yet seen your manifestos. We would
start by not being cynical about it but by saying, &#147;This is
real.&#148; I think it is real that any Government would have to come
back to Parliament and say explicitly, &#147;We are no longer
committed to meeting this child poverty target&#148;, and that is
what Kate talked about regarding the political pressure as well as the
legal one. So I think the Bill does more than just say, &#147;This
would be done&#148; or &#147;This would be nice.&#148; I think it
is a real
commitment.</div><a name="09102073000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><a name="09102073000368"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North)
(Lab): As you know, the Government are introducing a new
indicator for persistent poverty, but as yet, exactly how that will be
measured is not set out in detail. What would be an effective way of
measuring sustained, persistent and deep poverty? Is there a risk that
the indicator will once again allow Governments to concentrate on
households just below the poverty level, and will not necessarily deal
with deepened and sustained poverty?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div><a name="09102073000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I think it is unfair to say that Government
policy to date has dealt only with people just below the poverty line.
In fact, I think I am right in saying that there have been improvements
on income across all income deciles. Some policies have been
increasingly directed at those who are at greater risk of poverty,
although I think that there is more to
do.</div><a name="09102073000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think the advantage of measuring persistent poverty is that that gets
to a group of families who suffer significant disadvantage.
Particularly, it gets at some of the instability that persistent
poverty causes for family incomes. That includes them moving in and out
of poverty; they are out of poverty for short periods, but there are
long periods when they are plunged back in again. I think we would be
interested in measuring, over a period of time, children who spend most
of their time below the poverty line, and I think that would be a
useful way of getting to a number of the at-risk groups that we are
concerned
about.</div><a name="09102073000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> We can also get to the at-risk groups as part
of the strategy and the building blocks. The strategy needs to include
a focus on groups most at risk of poverty, which are set out in the
equality impact assessment. Examples include children in BME groups and
disabled children. That is another way of making sure that progress is
made with the children who are most at risk of poverty and persistent
poverty.</div><a name="09102073000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000369"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Are the Government right to have, to some extent,
changed the goalposts a little by moving away from a clear
after-housing-costs measurement of poverty, or does that not
matter?</div><a name="09102073000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> I think that the sector view has always been
that the after-housing-costs measure is the better one. The Government
took a decision a long time ago, in 2003, to have their headline figure
in terms of before-housing costs. Luckily, the after-housing-costs
figure continues to be measured, and that is the one we examine when
child poverty figures come out. Although we lost the battle six years
ago, we will continue to monitor that
figure.</div>
<a name="09102073000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000370"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Can you explain what the difference would be, or has
been?</div><a name="09102073000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> The after-housing-costs measure gives a
better indication of the disposable income that families have after
housing costs. Housing costs vary so much across the country. That is
why we keep the focus on that measure. For us it is a more accurate
measure of disposable income for families and a better measure of child
poverty.</div>
<a name="09102073000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><a name="09102073000371"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Clause 8 is the
heart of the Bill in some ways; it deals with the UK strategies that
the Secretary of State will have to put in place. There are clearly
some good and important things there. I will not read them all out, but
subsection (5) refers to the facilitation of employment, the
development of skills, the provision of financial support, health,
education and social services, housing and the natural environment.
None of us would disagree with any of those.</div>
<a name="09102073000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">What other
areas that you consider important are missing from that list? I would
be interested to hear from all of you about what shape you think the UK
strategy should have. We have not done as well as we all would have
liked, notwithstanding some progress over 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>the past 10 years. So how will it be different? What drivers of poverty
do we need to hit rather harder to really step up the progress over the
next
decade?</div><a name="09102073000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> The important thing about these building
blocks, as they have been called, is that they give you the tools that
you might be looking at for tackling child poverty. They define quite
nicely the tools that you can use when you are looking at the strategy.
They also provide a bit of space for whichever Government is
implementing the strategy to decide what those tools might look like
and how that would work.</div>
<a name="09102073000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly
Gingerbread thinks that the tools around employment will be
particularly important. We know that if we are going to end child
poverty by 2020 we need to see more parents in work, but employment is
probably going to look quite different. It will have to be much more
flexible. There will have to be many more opportunities for part-time
jobs. One thing that we will want the strategy to do is to create those
opportunities and to make sure that there are real jobs that lift
families out of
poverty.</div><a name="09102073000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> We would like to echo what Kate Bell says
about the importance of the employment building block and how that is
broadly interpreted, in relation to not just employment rates, but the
quality of work and the fact that it genuinely lifts families and
children out of poverty. We see child care as an important element of
the building blocks that you need if a child poverty strategy is to be
successful. There has been good progress in creating child care places
in recent years, but clearly there is still a very long way to go
before parents will be able to access the affordable and available
child care that they want and
need.</div><a name="09102073000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also interested in placing child well-being centrally in the way
that we think about the approach to the strategies to eradicate child
poverty. I think we see the building blocks as being quite useful for
developing policies across a range of different aspects of public,
national and local provision, which would make sure that children at
the greatest risk of poverty were reached. Many of the elements that
are in the building blocks are very helpful for
that.</div><a name="09102073000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> I would echo what Kate has said.
Barnardo&#146;s broadly welcomes all these areas, but in drawing up
the strategy it is key that the needs of those children and families
most at risk of poverty are specifically addressed. We need to consider
how those building blocks could target those families and reach the
families that have been in persistent poverty and are hard to
reach.</div><a name="09102073000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> From a Save the Children perspective, I
completely echo what has been said already. We had some very
interesting feedback from children when we worked with the child
participation unit to get feedback directly on what was proposed in the
Bill. They expressed concern about these four areas being seen as silos
and the fact that there needs to be a strategic focus on how they can
be joined up. I thought that was an excellent point. It is in step with
one of our overall points about giving children a voice in the Bill, in
terms of participation, particularly at ground level with local
authorities.</div>
<a name="09102073000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
91</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000372"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> May I press you all a little bit more on that, as
it is really important and gets to the heart of the Bill? Do you think
that there are any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>omissions in subsection (5)? Are there any things that are not there and
make you think, &#147;Gosh, if we are really going to make progress
we need to do something about x&#148;?</div>
<a name="09102073000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
have not really heard anything from you about what extra things need to
be done, or what needs to be done differently to try to step up the
pace a bit. Sadly, we look as if we may not reach the 2010 target. We
have got to do better. We cannot have more of the same, notwithstanding
the progress made. I have not heard what I hoped to hear from those
earlier answers, and I want to press you all a bit
more.</div><a name="09102073000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I think that child care is missing. Health,
education and social services are fine, but we specifically say that
child care is so key to a successful child poverty strategy that we
would like to see it explicitly in the building blocks. On what more
should be done, or what should be done differently, a number of
interesting issues were raised on Second Reading, particularly
regarding benefits adequacy and an adequate financial safety net. That
is something that is not sufficiently in the thinking of the
anti-poverty policy to date. That is certainly something that we want
to see getting proper attention in the strategies that come forward as
a result of the legislation.</div>
<a name="09102073000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like many of
you, all of us are very concerned about rising levels of in-work
poverty and addressing some of the disincentives built into the system,
which were highlighted in the Centre for Social Justice report the
other day, for example. A proper focus on those disincentives in the
system, but also on what is happening in the workplace regarding
quality of jobs and level of pay, is a very important part of a
holistic anti-poverty strategy that is genuinely everybody&#146;s
business.</div>
<a name="09102073000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
very interested in how other legislation may, to some degree, work
against the Bill and its intentions. For example, it is very important
that we examine welfare reform proposals for their impact on child
poverty. While there are some very good intentions in the welfare
reform proposals&#151;from all political parties&#151;on helping
more parents into good-quality sustainable jobs, which of course we all
support, we have to be anxious that too punitive a model of welfare
reform, or a model that rewards the wrong sort of provision, could
actually be damaging for child poverty. For example, we might see
increases in levels of benefit sanctions coming through over the next
few
years.</div><a name="09102073000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Fergus, I wanted
to ask you about the excellent films that you produced, in which one of
the factors that the young people identified as being a problem for
child poverty was overcrowding. Would you welcome the kind of measures
that Helen talked about this morning, where the Bill would improve the
standards for overcrowding from the pretty abysmal current
standards?</div><a name="09102073000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> Yes. What we saw in the series of films, where
children engaged with what poverty meant for them in their own
environments, was very powerful. We heard directly on issues about free
school meals and child uniforms. Social housing, in particular, is
something that there are ongoing concerns about&#151;its impact on
educational attainment and the social circumstances that people then
report back in school, which can then lead to areas of discrimination
there.</div>

93</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000374"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> What we heard this morning was that the
overcrowding standards will be improved by the Bill; I remember in the
films that overcrowding was particularly mentioned. Are you concerned
that those standards need to be properly monitored and enforced, if
they are higher than the standards that are accepted currently as
constituting statutory
overcrowding?</div><a name="09102073000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus

94</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000376"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> What I was concerned about is that Kate Green has
now mentioned the problems of conflicting bits of legislation, which
there could be here. There is even a conflict between the Children and
Young Person&#146;s Act 2008 and some immigration legislation. Are
you concerned that some of the very good measures in the Bill might be
overridden by other bits of legislation, for example on access to
housing?</div>
<a name="09102073000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I think that we are. I do not have a comment
on that issue specifically, but I can think of  a number of
areas where there could be conflicts between the Bill and other
legislation.</div>
<a name="09102073000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000377"></a>Ms

Where?</div><a name="09102073000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Welfare reform is one. You mentioned
immigration legislation, which I think is clearly another. At any
moment, changes in world circumstances could lead to an upsurge,
potentially, of children in the UK suddenly becoming vulnerable to
poverty. I think that we are also anxious about the legislation that we
are expecting from the Government on reducing the deficit and how
public spending decisions might affect the child poverty target. It is
very important to us, therefore, that decisions about public spending
and managing the public finance deficit should address the need to
continue spending on child poverty measures to meet the requirements of
the
Bill.</div><a name="09102073000082"></a>

95</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000378"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Fergus, at that event the young people also talked
very specifically about the business about holidays&#151;something
that some people might think is marginal to child poverty, but was
clearly important to them. Are you concerned that quite a number of
those measures are tucked away in the regulations as side issues rather
than being in the Bill? How do you think we can ensure that those
issues are carried through and
enforced?</div><a name="09102073000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> Because we have been talking about the four
points that are the building blocks, I would hope that the local
authority, in terms of needs assessments and local child poverty
strategies, would be able to focus on quite a few of those areas. In
general, those areas have a huge impact on children&#146;s sense of
self-worth and where they stand with regard to their peers. That can
flow into their aspirations about their future. Yes, I agree with
you.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000379"></a>Ms

responsible authorities&#151;that is something else that we discussed
this morning&#151;do you think that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>a local authority, faced with a choice between repairing a pavement and
letting a poor kid go on holiday, might prioritise the pavement over
the child? That is the kind of thing that I am thinking
about.</div>
<a name="09102073000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> I think that that is one of the things that we
are very keen on, in that we are very supportive of the focus in the
Bill on local authorities, as I have said already. But we would also be
keen that resources are flowing in that direction as well, where there
is more emphasis on them to have that focus and that work. Such
choices&#151;between the bins or child poverty&#151;are not at the
front and centre of what people actually have to allocate resources
to.</div>
<a name="09102073000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000380"></a>Ms

look at the overlap between ethnicity and poverty among
children?</div><a name="09102073000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> I would be interested in other views on
that.</div><a name="09102073000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> The equality impact assessment published
alongside the Bill specifically mentions children from BME communities
and the high levels of poverty in those groups. The strategies and

authorities should also prioritise those groups as part of their
sustainable communities strategies.</div>

98</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000381"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Do you think it a mistake to exclude mental health
trusts from the list of responsible authorities and partner
authorities? They appear not to be listed in either list&#151;neither
are acute trusts or the new health delivery bodies.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If you look on page 10, you will
see that under health, you have the strategic health authority and the
primary care trust, but you do not have mental health trusts with a
specific duty, despite the fact that one would think that there is a
fairly clear link between mental ill health and
poverty.</div><a name="09102073000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Indeed there is; both parental and child
mental ill health. It is certainly not specifically
listed.</div>
<a name="09102073000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000382"></a>The

that?</div>
<a name="09102073000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

looked at.</div>
<a name="09102073000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I think that that has always been our concern
about the lists. In any given list of building blocks, groups of
children or partner authorities, you are always at risk of missing
either someone who is key and has somehow been forgotten or someone who
becomes key, though who is not envisaged so today.</div>
<a name="09102073000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Between now
and 2020 there could suddenly be a very live issue or an agency that
needs to be engaged in making the strategy work. That is why we are
interested in having the strategies at the heart of the way we make
this legislation live. Though we had not given it thought or
particularly picked up the Mental Health Trust&#146;s important
point, we know that mental ill health is associated with high levels of
child poverty. Parental mental ill health significantly locks parents
out of the labour market, for example, or propels them into poor
quality stop-go jobs. We are also aware in terms of wider child
well-being of the pressures on child and adolescent mental health
services. You rightly draw attention to that important group of
organisations in terms of improving children&#146;s enjoyment and
health.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000384"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b><b class="B"> </b>Yes. Briefly, I would like to press a bit
further on that general point. In the list of partner authorities in
clause 19 you see police authorities and chief officers of police but
not further education colleges or chambers of commerce, for example.
The list is slightly odd to me. I wonder whether any of your eyebrows
have been raised at some of the partner authorities included and
whether there were any that you thought should be
included.</div><a name="09102073000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> The explanatory notes explain that employment
partnerships are covered under the duty of the Secretary of State. With
the structure of further education changing so that it is devolved down
to local authority level, we hope that they will come under the local
authority remit. The other useful thing about the strategies, both at
local and national level, is the duty to consult. I hope that if there
are omissions they are being picked up as we go through. Again, that
may be an optimistic
view.</div><a name="09102073000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It seems to me that the list is an interesting
area. Maybe our witnesses would wish to send in a supplementary

<a name="09102073000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Minister, you
have been very
patient.</div><a name="09102073000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000386"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> This is a question for all of you but I think
Kate Bell might have some particular insights. Do you think that family
breakdown is a major driver of child poverty? Should it have been added
to the list of building blocks in clause 8? Are there obvious policies
that could be introduced to reduce family breakdown and have a major
impact on child poverty in this
country?</div><a name="09102073000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> What I was trying to say earlier about the
building blocks is very important. They are tools and not target
groups. We would understandably be very concerned about a specific
strategy that set out to prevent family breakdown as a causal approach
to tackling child poverty. We know that children growing up in
single-parent families in this country are more likely to be poor, but
we also know that some of the countries that do best on child poverty
have very similar levels of single parenthood to this
country.</div>
<a name="09102073000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There would
be concern if tackling family breakdown were applied at individual
family level. We know that outcomes on a global level are better for
children in two-parent families although, again, the causal links are
very unclear. There are families where it is much better if the parents
do split up. The outcomes for children actually improve in that
situation. A global target to reduce family breakdown may impact poorly
on
that.</div><a name="09102073000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Clearly, nobody would want to stop investment
in supporting family and couple relationships, but we doubt that that
would be an assured instrument for ultimately eradicating child
poverty. As Kate Bell says, other countries with high levels of single
parenthood are able to have much lower levels of child poverty than we
have. No direct link can be traced in a range of developed countries
between the level of single parenthood and children&#146;s well-being
and outcomes. We published 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>some research on that as an update of the UNICEF report card, which did
ask that question. As Kate says, it is a matter of disentangling causes
and consequences. There is no doubt that lone-parent households are at
high risk of poverty, but that can be addressed successfully.
Nevertheless, we should be doing all we can to protect couple and
family relationships wherever
possible.</div><a name="09102073000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000387"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>Kate Green, I would like to follow up
quickly your comments on concerns about the proposed fiscal
responsibility Bill and welfare reform. Coming back to my earlier
question, given the duties on the Secretary of State under clause 1,
are there areas here where there may be scope for taking the Government
to judicial review because they fail to abide by those duties in
pursuit of other policies, such as welfare reform
ones?</div><a name="09102073000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000388"></a>Mr.

Green:</b></i> We have had some successes. To some degree, we
want to see this legislation produce moral pressure and moral will to
create a space in which all politicians of all parties vie to achieve,
rather than look for ways to duck and evade the intentions of the
legislation.</div><a name="09102073000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot remember which country they were from&#151;probably one of the
Nordic ones, as usual&#151;but we had some visitors who, very
interestingly, were talking about localising their child poverty
strategies, the impact of regional government and devolution, and
whether that had fragmented the anti-poverty strategy. They said that,
on the contrary, it had led to competition between the different local
agencies to drive their child poverty standards up. So we are hopeful
that this legislation will raise the game, rather than lead us to look
for ways to say, &#147;Well, that bit of legislation over there means
that you are not really serious about achieving these targets&#148;.
Having said that, we do not rule out using legal means to challenge
legislation if that seems necessary, and where we see clear
discrepancies or something working directly against the Bill&#146;s
intentions.</div><a name="09102073000109"></a>

102</b><a name="09102073000389"></a><b class="B">Julie
Morgan</b> (Cardiff, North) (Lab): You have all raised the
importance of child care, and it is obviously the key to employment for
many people. It has to be affordable and accessible. How could that be
put into legislation? Do you think it should
be?</div><a name="09102073000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Local authorities are already required to
undertake child care sufficiency assessments, and they give us some
very important data now about the nature of child care provision and
where the gaps exist. Clearly, what we want is not just to have the
data, but to have action on those assessments. That is a moving picture
for local authorities: it is possible to deal with pockets of need and
demand today, and then find that a new set of needs and demands pop up
tomorrow because employment patterns or demographics in the local
authority change. Certainly, some of the changes in migration patterns
into the inner-London boroughs can very quickly cause a stretch on
child care and on school places too. It is very important that we take
the child care sufficiency assessments as the base point for doing
something with that knowledge. Child Poverty Action Group would like 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>to see child care included in the building blocks, because then we would
get clear certainty that there would be plans to address it within the
child poverty
strategies.</div><a name="09102073000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also say that I am talking about England. There is of course an
issue for the devolved nations, and I know that colleagues from
Scotland would certainly express some different concerns. I am not
really in a position to say very much about that, but I do know that
that is an area that the Committee may want to
investigate.</div><a name="09102073000112"></a>

Goodman:</b> Of course what you say about child care being
central to children&#146;s well-being and vital for parents&#146;
employment opportunities is absolutely true, but do you not feel that
the duties that were put on to local authorities, with respect to
provision, information and introducing child care in a way designed to
increase equality in local areas, have already covered that point? If
we were to incorporate it into the Bill, would that not be an
unnecessary
duplication?</div><a name="09102073000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> No; I think it would be a reinforcement of the
good progress that has been made so far to recognise the absolute
importance of child care. I suppose that the other thing that will be
important about having it in the context of the Bill is that it will be
a very child-centred Bill, which is important for us in terms of
thinking about what child care is for and what good child care looks
like. I hope it would not mean that it created extra effort and
difficulty in people&#146;s minds. I think that there is a real local
understanding of the importance of the provision of good quality child
care, but I cannot see why there would be any specific disadvantage to
including it in the building blocks of this
Bill.</div>

that you do, which we are all aware of, at a strategic level with
central Government. However, what the Bill does is to pass a lot of the
responsibility for delivery over to local government. How do you see
your role and your working relationships with local government in
practice as a result of the
Bill?</div><a name="09102073000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> Barnardo&#146;s works throughout the UK. We
have 400 projects working in the most disadvantaged communities and we
work in partnership with local authorities. We see the Bill giving us a
framework to work on child poverty issues. Child poverty is an
inescapable fact of all our services. Many local authorities work with
us proactively on examining issues of disadvantage and child poverty.
Some are not so engaged. So we feel that, at a local level, the Bill
will give us a framework to work with our partners.</div>
<a name="09102073000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> Gingerbread, as well as lobbying and
campaigning, runs services and among the services that we run are
employment services, helping single parents to return to work. Some
local authorities have taken a very active approach on that issue. For
example, we have worked closely with Manchester city council and Camden
council. We hope that the Bill will drive that type of action and make
local authorities more open to thinking about the opportunities for
disadvantaged people in their area and how they can help them,
including helping them to move closer to the labour
market.</div><a name="09102073000117"></a>

should be around child poverty, and others have not. So we hope to
review our commissioning arrangements with local authorities, to ensure
that we can work proactively on the child poverty agenda at a local
level.</div>

106</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000393"></a>John
Howell:</b> I do not think that I have quite got the answer
about the additionality issue that I am seeking, regarding your own
view about what you will be doing differently as a result of the Bill.
You say that there might be a different type of commissioning, but is
there anything else there? After all, local government already has a
generalised indicator and a whole lot of sub-indicators that it can
work to. I am just trying to grasp how you see the landscape differing,
at a practical level, after the Bill is passed.</div>
<a name="09102073000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> Some of the differences would be in the
softer outcomes. So, most of the families that we work with are not
employed and there has been intergenerational poverty. So we would want
to look at the soft skills that people need before they reach the
labour market. For example, more volunteering opportunities would be
useful, so we would seek to work with our local partners on providing
those opportunities, or signposting people, if they have mental health
problems or other issues, so that they build up those pre-employment
skills. Then, we would work in greater partnership to look at how we
could help people to access the right sort of child care or to move
into employment. Bringing lots of partners to the table will help to do
that at a local level. As local authorities formulate their sustainable
community strategies, it will especially give partners a greater say in
what needs to happen locally for children and
families.</div><a name="09102073000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I hope that we might be able to find it easier
to have a dialogue with local government to help shape local service
design. There is already a real appetite for that among some local
authorities. Only this morning, I was invited to Be Birmingham, the
Birmingham city council local strategic partnership, specifically
because it was holding an event about putting together its child
poverty strategy. There is an opportunity for real engagement and
dialogue between organisations such as ours and the chance to talk
about our intellectual understanding of policy issues and the
experience that&#151;not, I must say, the Child Poverty Action
Group&#151;the other organisations represented here gain from
delivering local services and the interest that local authorities have
with their partners in thinking about the whole landscape of service
provision and how it might impact on poor
families.</div><a name="09102073000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the Child Poverty Action Group, the issue is likely to be about
influencing local government and its partners to think about a broad
range of activities in the local authority and how they can be shaped,
designed and delivered, and about explaining and working with it to
identify the impact on families and children in poverty in the local
area and help it to think about ways in which it can reconfigure and
offer services in a more accessible way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="09102073000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example of
that policy might be to encourage local take-up campaigns. I can
envisage our providing an analysis of why take-up might be low in a
particular community or area, and what can be done to drive it up. We
have already worked with the Local Government Association to reproduce
the &#147;Quids for Kids&#148; toolkit, which comprises take-up
materials for local authorities. There would be quite a lot of interest
on both sides in sharing good practice and
expertise.</div><a name="09102073000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000394"></a>John
Howell:</b> What, given your experience so far of having
worked with local government, do you think it needs by way of
additional resources to make the policy
work?</div><a name="09102073000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Not all local authorities have shown the need
for additional resources to make the policy work, although additional
spending on low-income families will be good both for those families
and the local economy, because if there is more money in the household
budgets of poorer families, they immediately spend it on local
businesses. It is also true that some local authorities have already
begun to look at the way in which they make spending choices within
their existing funding arrangements. A good example of that is Kent,
which has made some quite deliberate choices to fund the provision of
free school transport, for example. Presumably, it has had to make
choices not to offer another public service provision, but it is a
matter of balance between the need for leadership and sufficient
resources at local level. Furthermore, the process is one of local
strategy development with local people in which they are making
informed and deliberate
choices.</div><a name="09102073000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> The process of setting out a child poverty
strategy will lead to less duplication of work at a local authority
level. Parents often ask us why five different people are telling them
about employment and skills policy, and we hope that the provision of
the strategy might help them to say that their resources into advice
provision and take-up are going here, and their resources into
employment skills are looking across the partner authorities as well,
where action can be done more efficiently to achieve the goal of ending
child
poverty.</div><a name="09102073000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> We, in Save the Children, are particularly
interested in being a bridge with regard to the voice of children,
especially in local child poverty strategies and needs assessment work.
We have looked at whether it would be useful to have some form of kite
mark, which says that we believe that a particular needs assessment has
actually gone down on the ground and that we have listened specifically
to children, thus involving them at every point as each strategy is
worked on. That area is something to which all the organisations
represented here could add tangible skills as well as the resource
matter that we have just talked
about.</div><a name="09102073000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000395"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> You have been quite upbeat about the benefits of
decentralising some responsibility to local government, and I am sure
that there are some grounds for that and that more good practice can be
encouraged. But can I push you further on the flipside of that? There
is a risk, particularly in a much larger country than the Nordic
countries, with a much more decentralised press, with much less
scrutiny and political pressure on individual local authorities, that
some authorities&#151;I would probably say many&#151;will find ways
of possibly not taking some decisions that are hard to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>deliver. They will have strategies, but they could easily say that the
big-ticket items for dealing with poverty are the benefit system, the
tax system, employment and pay, all of which are outwith the
responsibility of a local authority. It will actually be quite
slippery&#151;quite hard&#151;to hold to account those authorities
that have other priorities than child poverty. What would you encourage
Ministers and Parliament to do to ensure that there are measures for
and means of holding to account those authorities that will sign up to
a strategy but are not going to be the ones in the forefront of good
practice?</div><a name="09102073000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> At the risk of being upbeat again, the
advantage of having strategies is that you can at least try to progress
against them. It is also really important that we have a national
strategy. One of the things that a national strategy may want to do is
to pick out local areas that are doing particularly badly. I think the
point that Kate was making earlier around authorities therefore being
quite keen not to be seen as falling behind is something that the
national strategy can also help
push.</div><a name="09102073000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> Local authorities will need resources and
support, also sharing of good practice&#151;local authorities that
are doing well could partner up with local authorities that are not
doing well to share learning and experience and to have mentoring
schemes. So, there is a possibility of being quite imaginative as to
how local authorities get support and the knowledge that they feel they
might
need.</div><a name="09102073000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000396"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> You mentioned some good practice, and you are all
meant to be doing some work with local authorities. Tell me where there
isn&#146;t good practice. Are there any authorities that are not
really stepping up to the plate and not showing a great deal of
interest, or is every local authority in Britain engaging in
this?</div><a name="09102073000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> We do not have the resources to look at every
local authority in Britain. One of the reasons for being a small
charity and lobbying at national level is to put in place the framework
so that those who are working at a local level can challenge things. I
think that that is the other really important thing about the child
poverty strategies&#151;empowering groups, which are working on a
smaller level and do not have access to national lobbying, hopefully to
be able to say, &#147;Here&#146;s a strategy, here&#146;s what
you are not
doing.&#148;</div><a name="09102073000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> In England the Government offices have an
unfortunate role in terms of using the national indicator set
proactively to maintain pressure on the local authorities in their
area. The other thing that I would say is that we have observed a real
step change in local authority interest over the past two or three
years. I think that three or four years ago the extent to which local
government was engaging, in the sense that it could do anything about
child poverty at all, was very patchy. I think that has changed
significantly, I am sure in part because of the debate that has been
going on around this
legislation.</div><a name="09102073000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000397"></a>Julie
Morgan:</b> I want to ask about the devolved countries and how
you think they would fit into this UK-wide strategy. Obviously Wales is
going to have its own new poverty strategy this year or next
year&#151;how do you think that will fit into the overall UK
strategy?</div><a name="09102073000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> We think the proposals in the Bill for the
devolved Governments to formulate their strategies to fit into a UK
strategy are right. We are hoping that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>there will be an overarching UK strategy. Obviously the income targets
are not devolved, but we think that in formulating the devolved
strategies and the UK strategy, the devolved Administrations will have
the flexibility to look at the kind of issues that should be in their
building blocks to drive progress in their nations. We know, in
Barnardo&#146;s, that our colleagues are working with their officials
and their Governments to look at the Bill and that they are having
discussions with the child poverty unit on how to make it
work.</div><a name="09102073000332"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000398"></a>Julie
Morgan:</b> Obviously some of the policies in Wales and
Scotland, such as free prescriptions or free breakfasts for children,
have an impact on poverty. Some of those initiatives are, say, not
available in England, so there will have to be different measures than
for a UK-wide
strategy.</div><a name="09102073000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000399"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> How should incentives be altered for those in
local authorities such as chief executives and others? All Governments
talk about not rewarding failure and rewarding success, but the
tendency is towards precisely the opposite. You inevitably get drawn
in, such as when Liverpool was failing in the 1980s, with Governments
giving the authorities money because they cannot let people sit with
failure. The real incentives for success are rarely there for those on
the ground, so the rich areas get less and the poorer areas get more.
The poorer the area, the more money it gets. Do you have any thoughts
on incentives and how we should align them so as to ensure that we get
positive feedback all the way through, and do not suffer perverse
eddies in the incentive
structure?</div><a name="09102073000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I am not a great expert on this, but I make
two points. First, I observe a strong commitment to public service
across local government, and to the drivers that people feel to deliver
high-quality services in their local community&#151;you want to build
on the positive there. Secondly, although I understand your point that
rich areas never get the money and that it always goes to poor areas
that are failing&#151;the reward for failure&#151;we need money to
reach the families and communities that are failing the most.</div>
<a name="09102073000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
problem with saying, &#147;If you succeed, we will give you a bit
more money to do more,&#148; is not that we do not want to reward
success but that we do not want to punish individual families when
there has been a failure to meet standards and targets. It seems to me
all the more important that funding reaches those most disadvantaged
communities. It is not reasonable that individuals should bear the pain
for administrative failure. You can see that, for example, when housing
standards are not met and extra funding is then not available for
further refurbishment of social housing estates. That is extremely hard
on the people who have to live in that housing, and it is no fault of
theirs that they are in that situation.</div>
<a name="09102073000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000400"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> You make the extremely good point that Governments
of all colours always act in the way that you say, despite the
pronouncements that they make. How can we cut through that to ensure
that the most positive incentives are put in place? Successive
Governments have wanted to challenge poverty and underachievement, and
have put in place resources towards that end, but in many places we
have not seen the response that we would have liked.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="09102073000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> I think that you are taking me out of my
depth. In terms of how you incentivise public servants, you are
probably going some way beyond the remit of any of our
organisations.</div>
<a name="09102073000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000401"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Is it possible that the Bill could end up having
perverse effects? Is there a way in which local authorities and local
government could go for short-term measures? For instance, as has been
mentioned, the IFS says how much can be spent on benefits, yet the
Centre for Social Justice has reported on the disincentives in the
system. The Minister spoke this morning of her belief that there had
been improvements, which would obviously be welcome, but are there
dangers that we need to watch out for? Are there changes that could be
made to the Bill to ensure that we do not allow the short-term
political desire of meeting the target to go against the long-term
desire of creating opportunity for all and the other broad policy
changes that are
needed?</div><a name="09102073000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> That is a very important point, and it has
been important since we first had child poverty targets and interim
targets were set. It is really key, therefore, that the strategies that
are produced, and the commission&#146;s examination of those
strategies&#151;and the bite that the commission has&#151;are
strong as a result of the Bill. When the commission reports, we will
want it to say not only, &#147;This looks like it will make a bit of
a difference this year,&#148; but, &#147;Is this helping to drive
towards the 2020
goal?&#148;</div><a name="09102073000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> I think that the sustainability of any
success is absolutely key. Both on the income targets and on the
building blocks, the way in which the strategies are delivered and how
this is all implemented must be sustainable. As Kate says, the
commission would hopefully have a key role to play
there.</div><a name="09102073000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000402"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Could we end up with many people just above the
artificial 60 per cent. figure&#151;with them being pushed over that
figure to meet a target? Is that a realistic
danger?</div><a name="09102073000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Bell:</b></i> The suite of targets&#151;not just the 60 per
cent. relative income target&#151;does, to a certain extent, try to
avoid that. You have the material deprivation targets in there, which
look at poverty in a much more experiential way. Also, you have the
persistent poverty target. Looking at those is at least trying to get
beyond that problem. I also think that the fact that the strategy is
three years, whereas the reporting is annual, gives you a longer-term
horizon as well as that short term. That is progress being made. I
think that that interaction is quite
important.</div><a name="09102073000146"></a>

strong as possible so that it can play a key advisory role. In order to
do that, we feel that it should be able to publish its own
research&#151;and have a budget for that&#151;and to call for
witnesses. We feel that the powers of the commission need to be
strengthened.</div><a name="09102073000151"></a>

publish the advice and require the Secretary of State to have regard to
it, with the experiences laid out by members of the
commission?</div><a name="09102073000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera

Yes.</div><a name="09102073000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

explain why he might be departing from the advice, if that is the
case.</div><a name="09102073000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> We would also like Government to look at the
time scales for setting up the commission. The first strategy will be
published within 12 months of the Bill receiving Royal Assent. That
could limit the commission&#146;s ability to influence that first
strategy. If the commission is not set up for several months after
Royal Assent, it will not have enough time to influence the strategy.
The first strategy will be a blueprint for other strategies and annual
reports to follow. The timeline for establishing the commission is
absolutely key. In other legislation, such as the Climate Change Bill,
a shadow commission was established so that it could get to work as
soon as the Bill got Royal
Assent.</div><a name="09102073000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000407"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I think that that last point is a powerful one,
having been involved with the Climate Change Bill. The shadow
commission more or less dictated the amendment of the Bill&#151;to an
80 per cent. reduction&#151;and made it
powerful.</div><a name="09102073000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
be momentarily cynical again, the child poverty unit&#146;s impact
assessment of the Bill says that the child poverty commission will meet
four times a year and have 14 staff. It tells us the cost of their
travel. It even includes the cost of a room; I am surprised that it
does not include tea and biscuits. The commission will oversee
Government spending of &#163;400 billion, according to the Bill, over
the next 20 years, with an annualised running cost of &#163;190,000.
The civil service staff will be one policy grade 7&#151;I am sure
that they will be a splendid person, but that is not terribly
senior&#151;and an executive officer, who does minutes, I suppose.
There is an &#163;80 day rate for people attending. It is all a bit
half-hearted, is it not?</div>
<a name="09102073000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate
Green:</b></i> Clearly we think that it must be adequately
resourced, including, as Neera said, with an adequate research budget,
the power to call for and commission its own research, and adequate
staff to critique the strategies and provide proper advice and
information for Parliament and the
public.</div><a name="09102073000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

me.</div><a name="09102073000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> There is another option in that assessment,
which is &#163;390,000. That would include a research budget. We
would, obviously, want to push for the higher budget so that the
commission can have its own research
budget.</div><a name="09102073000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fergus
Drake:</b></i> But overall, the point you are alluding to is
that it has to be properly resourced in order to give it the role that
it needs for best practice in some of the areas that we have been
talking about. We need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>ensure that there are not four or five wonderful beacon authorities and
then tens, or hundreds, that are lagging
behind.</div>

120</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000409"></a>Steve

done?</div>
<a name="09102073000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Neera
Sharma:</b></i> I think that the commission should have a say
in whether it is abolished. This is also about at what point it should
be abolished&#151;there is a question of sustainability. We could get
to 2020 and the targets might have been met, and then a year later
child poverty could start going up again. When the commission is
abolished depends on the process and the timing. It could stay until
after 2020 to ensure that the whole strategy is proving to be
sustainable.</div>
<a name="09102073000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kate

be abolished through an affirmative resolution in Parliament, although
that does not provide the greatest safeguard. Clearly there must be a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000411"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good afternoon and welcome to the second session
of the afternoon. We are now going to hear evidence from Catherine Fitt
from the National College for Leadership of Schools and
Children&#146;s Services, Colin Green from the Association of
Directors of Children&#146;s Services, Kevan Collins from the London
borough of Tower Hamlets, Richard Kemp from the Local Government
Association, and Paul Carter from Kent county council. Welcome to all
of you. I start by asking John Howell for a
question.</div>
<a name="09102073000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000412"></a>John
Howell:</b> Local authorities already have a number of ways of
prioritising child poverty. They have the NI 116 as an overall
indicator of child poverty, and they can sign up to a number of
specific indicators that better reflect the local circumstances. They
also have relationships with myriad other partnerships on the ground,
and in many authorities I am aware that the child poverty agenda goes
right through those partnerships. The basic question is: what does the
Bill add to that?</div>
<a name="09102073000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> I think I need to explain that until nine weeks
ago I was director of children&#146;s services for Newcastle city
council. To a great extent, what I want to say today is coloured by my
experience of the last four years and four months. I have also been
chairing a theme group of the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes in
Children and Young People&#146;s Services, looking at child
poverty.</div>
<a name="09102073000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">For me, the
reason for having the Bill is to ensure consistency across the country.
We know from what has been happening over the last few years that local
government and its partners are engaging very positively. For example,
nine out of the 11 local authorities in the north-east region now have
child poverty as a priority in their sustainable communities strategy.
That has been very much down to the work of the region&#146;s
coalition to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>tackle child poverty. We are very aware that it is no good solving the
problem in just one part of the country, because whether a
child&#146;s needs are met should not be dependent on where they
live. We are looking for
consistency.</div><a name="09102073000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> I take a different view from that. Giving local
government a duty would not help us, but enhancing the duty of our
partners to co-operate with us around a specific thing would. You will
be aware, because you have passed the legislation, that the Local
Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 gives
all the partners around the LSP table the duty to co-operate with the
council, in this case the upper-tier authorities. It is taking time for
our so-called partners to understand what that duty to co-operate is.
Even where a council is being a good lead partner, it takes two to
tango. Who is coming in behind us?</div>
<a name="09102073000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it
is clearly evolving, partnership is developing and more and more
councils&#151;as I think we will see from the comprehensive area
assessment reports, which will be presented in the next few
weeks&#151;are creating successful partnerships. However, that is not
always carried through by the quangos and departments of local
government. So, we think that ensuring that that co-operation means
something, rather than just being an Act of Parliament, would be of
assistance to
us.</div><a name="09102073000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> I take a long-term view. In trying to address
child poverty you are not going to get a quick fix. In Kent, we are
taking a longer-term approach to the underlying problems<i class="I"> </i>to try
to stop the cycle of repetitive benefit dependency and generational
behaviours, through transformation in education as well as working
alongside Sure Start programmes, children&#146;s centres and the
support given to wraparound family care. That all adds value. There has
to be a multi-agency approach to the solutions. On the journey that we
have been on for the last six, seven or eight years, we are beginning
to see some positive outcomes.</div>
<a name="09102073000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Kent, by
raising young people&#146;s aspirations and ambitions we have reduced
the number of young people who are not in education or employment by 16
per cent. The numbers in the rest of the country have gone up. So, some
of the medium and longer-term solutions in changing the mindsets of
young people are beginning to take effect. One head teacher of a high
school&#151;not a grammar school&#151;in Kent said to me,
&#147;The only child poverty around here is the poverty of aspiration
and ambition&#148;. It is not about money. It is not about resource.
If you have families where one or both parents have alcohol or drug
addiction problems, no matter how much money you give them it will not
stop child poverty. Child poverty crosses all social boundaries. There
is child poverty in relatively affluent parts of society as well as the
more deprived areas.</div>
<a name="09102073000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
massive problem, but to think that putting in financial resource and
increasing benefits will stop child poverty is absolutely wrong in my
view. You have to get to the underlying cause. You have to do all you
can to bring wealth and prosperity into an area. Some people think that
Kent is relatively prosperous. Our average gross value added per head
is less than the average for this country, not just for the south-east
of England. The east of Kent has social deprivation indices that are
off the Richter scale and in the top 20, something we are not proud of.
Roger Gale said to me the other day that when he first became an MP he
was going to change the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>dynamic of Thanet in five years. If anything it has gone backwards, not
forwards. So, what are the underlying levers of control that we have in
local government, working with the other public agencies that can bring
wealth, prosperity and job opportunities and through education change
the mindsets, ambitions and aspirations of young people? I think that
we are starting to make good progress.</div>
<a name="09102073000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000413"></a>John
Howell:</b> What you have just described is a situation, if I
read it correctly, that Kent has been involved in for some time. What I
am trying to grasp is what you would do differently, if the Bill were
to be passed tomorrow, as a result of its passage?</div>
<a name="09102073000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> But the Bill does not go into the solutions
model, does it? It talks about establishing the commission X, Y and Z.
As I understand it, however, it does not go into what we are going to
do about it. That is the interesting debate in my view: what are we
going to do all over the country to try to address the essential need
to reduce the number of those in child poverty, however you define
it?</div>
<a name="09102073000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000414"></a>John
Howell:</b> I think that that goes to the heart of another
question really, picking up the consistency argument that Catherine
Fitt made. Surely, what we need to establish in the Bill is a balance
between some consistency and quite a lot of flexibility, because the
solutions for tackling child poverty will not be the same in each area.
How will we get that balance, or do you see that balance already within
the
Bill?</div><a name="09102073000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> One can see that, from the local area agreement
indicators that we have signed up to. In crude terms, only 45 out of
about 140 local authorities have signed up to NI 116, which is the
child poverty indicator. However, 118 local authorities are doing work
on NEETs, 101 on obesity in teenage schools and 107 on under-18
conceptions. Those issues are entirely relevant, because these things
go hand in hand. So that is an indication that local authorities are
saying, &#147;What is it that we need to do in our area, using our
local knowledge and our partnerships?&#148; So my response to your
earlier question about what we would do differently as a result of the
Bill is, &#147;Not necessarily anything at all&#148;, although it
might help to change the way that some of our partners relate to us,
because I do not think that those partnerships are strong enough to
deal with some of the indicators that we face.</div>
<a name="09102073000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> The point about what we would do differently
if the Bill is passed is the key one. I think that we are already doing
things differently because of the debate that has begun. The most
interesting thing is the way that people have come together to look at
this issue in the round. Paul&#146;s point is absolutely right: this
is a complex and very sophisticated issue, and you need the broad set
of partners around you to consider it. However, the question is this:
is there a collective effort genuinely across the whole of local and
central Government, or is the buck being passed to local government?
People are nervous about that issue, to be honest with you.</div>
<a name="09102073000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
I think that the point about local plans, including the strategic needs
analysis, is important. All of that activity is creating a much richer
frame to place our actions against, and I think that much more
intelligent work is going on because of the potential of the Bill, and
even more work of that kind will flow from the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="09102073000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
important point about there being a greater sense of duty to co-operate
with the Bill and to be part of it, which needs to go right across the
range of partners. In Tower Hamlets, we have found that the work with
health workers, police and our community groups has been fundamental in
getting a comprehensive plan in
place.</div>
<a name="09102073000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000415"></a>John
Howell:</b> How do you see the relationship between central
Government, with its responsibilities under the Bill, and local
government working out? Is it one of stick, or one of carrot? The Bill
threatens, or promises, guidance. How do you see that guidance coming
into effect on this
issue?</div><a name="09102073000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> Guidance always leaves me with a
slight&#151;do we need more guidance? I think that the tension
between responsibilities will have to be resolved. If the guidance
becomes a stick that is used to beat local authorities, for example
Tower Hamlets where we have a higher degree of child poverty but we are
working hard on it, I think that would be unhelpful; it would be
unhelpful if it created a new level of conflict. I think that it has
got to be about co-operation and working collaboratively, to pull all
the levers that are available and that are only available if you are
working at the national and local levels in concert. That is my worry
about the guidance in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09102073000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> I think that the answer is in local solutions
and in public agencies working together. When we started all these
public service agreements and local area agreements, I was a real
sceptic. All this partnership working was going to deliver the holy
grail supposedly. And yet when you look at some of the big outcomes of
the first local area agreement, before it started in micro-management
and became far too complex, the big outcomes of fewer children being
taken into care and a significant reduction in bed blocking in our
acute hospitals in Kent were really significant results that were
achieved by the public sector and the public agencies coming together.
That is why I am a great supporter of the Total Place concept, which is
about joined-up public services looking at the totality of expenditure
in any one area and sitting round and trying to go into solutions mode,
when currently there is still a silo mentality across the public
agencies, which are acting in isolation and not in concert. If you can
get them all working together in a defined area with the totality of
their budgets and a clean sheet of paper, public agencies will start to
deliver things in a fundamentally different
way.</div><a name="09102073000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> I would agree with most of what has been said.
The potential of the Bill is in adding leverage to what is already a
very high priority for nearly all local authorities. The ADCS regrets
that the Bill is not framed in terms of families rather than children.
Children live in families and a family concept of poverty is more
useful in engaging the totality of partnerships, particularly the NHS,
whose resources are devoted in large part to older people and very
significantly at a local level.</div>
<a name="09102073000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue is that there are many other measures on which we are already
performance-managed, particularly on equality. In terms of the driver
for disadvantage and poor outcomes, inequality is the core driver
rather than absolute measures of income. I think the matter is strongly
on local authorities&#146; radar. It is on the radar of directors of
children&#146;s services. I advocate minimal guidance. The Bill is an
enabler: we do not need more micro-management. The national indicator
set has a whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>range of indicators&#151;not just NI 116 but all the ones concerned
with educational attainment and gap narrowing, of which there are a
number. They are very effective measures about whether we are having an
impact in the local authority and with the
partners.</div><a name="09102073000187"></a>

125</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000416"></a>John
Howell:</b> May I pick up on that last point? One way in which
the money is going to be channelled is through a pooled fund. I know
from my previous experience in local government that pooled funds have
had a chequered history in terms of the ability of people to put money
in and to access them. In your experience of them, is there anything
that would help to improve things?</div>
<a name="09102073000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> My experience is similar to yours. The
theoretical agencies that put money into a fund do it voluntarily but
still expect to give you their outputs as you use the money out from
the fund. It is quite opaque. What the Local Government Association
argues generally is that there are a set of needs&#151;in my case in
Liverpool&#151;that ought to go into a pot, and that is what Total
Place is all about. I am sure Members are familiar with it. Very
important work is being done in Total Place to understand how we use
the totality of the money, where it comes in and where it goes, and to
ask a vital question: if we were starting again, would we spend this
amount of money this way? The answer is usually no. There is some
really radical thinking coming through from local government in
partnership with central Government, which will affect a lot of the
debates in  12 months&#146;
time.</div>
<a name="09102073000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000417"></a>The

Kemp?</div>
<a name="09102073000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000418"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Briefly. On Total Place, and picking up what Paul
Carter was saying about it earlier, I am particularly interested in the
relationship of local authorities with the benefits system. I have just
received a brief from my own local authority, which is one of the Total
Place pilots. It says that it is not happy with things at the moment. I
would be interested in any ideas or thoughts about how we could get the
partnership between local authorities and Jobcentre Plus to work
better.</div><a name="09102073000191"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> There are some pilots at the moment on what I
am going to suggest, but one of the problems of dealing with families
who are in and out of employment and just above the poverty level is
benefits&#151;not the benefits trap but the benefit claims problem.
We would like to use the extensive local government one-stop shop
system as a place where you go in and claim all your benefits. One of
the reasons we get delays is that the council does its housing and
council tax benefits and we wait for information to come from somewhere
else. In my own city we have 14 one-stop shops in the key areas of
poverty. You should be able to go in and get your benefits sorted out
in one place, because then you can decide whether you can afford to
take a job or not. If you are going up and down, you can get your
benefits adjusted properly. At the moment, it is still not worth some
people getting a job, because it puts them into poverty for 12 months
while someone reassesses what they should have, and by that time they
are halfway to being evicted. That is a simple system that local
government can do, particularly if it is a four-star benefits service
as judged by the Benefits Agency.</div>

in?</div><a name="09102073000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000420"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Paul Carter mentioned Total Place. He or any of
the other panellists may want to add to that, but that was
helpful&#151;thank
you.</div><a name="09102073000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> I have never been a great fan of pooled
budgets, not least because it seems to be complicated in terms of
administration&#151;getting people to put their bits of money
together and then be jointly accountable. However, I am, and always
have been, a strong advocate of aligned budgets. For me, that is what
it is all about. It is simply about lining everyone up&#151;central
Government, local government and people out in communities, whichever
sector they come from&#151;to do things that are going to be on
balance for the benefit of children and not to their detriment. It is
probably no more complicated than people being aware that decisions
that they make for grown-ups sometimes have unintended consequences for
children. I am absolutely a fan of aligning budgets. I rather like
people knowing what money is in which bag on the table, and the trouble
with pooled budgets is that it becomes messy when you start putting
money together into one big pool, and it is difficult to argue with
your treasurer to have your bit to provide for
children.</div><a name="09102073000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> May I take that forward? I like the
Westminster model, which we are repeating in the Margate renewal, which
is one of our themes in Total Place. We are looking at vulnerable
families in Westminster and in Margate. In one shape or form, the
amount of public agency support going to those families is more than
&#163;100,000 or &#163;150,000. When you then start to talk to the
health economy and the educational economy through to special needs,
all of them are acting in isolation. With the health economy, the
special needs economy and the public agencies, if you looked at the
totality of expenditure on those 15, 20 or 100 families&#151;more
than &#163;150,000&#151;and thought about that pooled resource,
would you start to do things dramatically differently that would lead
to much more positive outcomes for those vulnerable families? That is
part of the Total Place work. Whether you call it a pooled or whatever
you called
it&#151;</div><a name="09102073000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine

Aligned.</div><a name="09102073000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> Whether you call it a pooled or aligned
resource, it is making everyone aware of interventions and support,
which may be well-intended, but individually. Collectively, it could
have a much better output and an outcome than people operating in
silos. That is a small example of what can be achieved.</div>
<a name="09102073000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> Just to return to the benefits issue, the
challenge we found was to create a more flexible and experimental
approach in the benefits world. For example, if you take incapacity
benefit, we see a strong correlation between families where the parents
are receiving benefit and children who then go on to be
NEETs.</div><a name="09102073000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Child
poverty, as you all know better than I do, it is about breaking cycles.
We ask the benefit system to be flexible. How do you get a holiday from
that when there is a great fear that that means that you will never get
back on again, and yet get people back into work? Flexibility in the
benefits system is what we seek.</div>
<a name="09102073000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">When you look
at localisation or you tie it into some of the innovative work that is
going on between families&#151;we have all found our 50 families who
fire a certain set of triggers&#151;how do you then not only get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>the resources wrapped around them but get the system flexible enough to
give that family a chance to change their whole lifestyle? You are
quite often breaking generations of a relationship with the state and
with public service, and you have to do something quite dramatic. We
can do that with housing tenure, and we need to do it with other kinds
of benefits to break people out of a certain set of relationships and
behaviours that they have developed. I would like to see much more
flexibility with Jobcentre Plus. We are finding it quite hard to get it
to have a more flexible and innovative approach, particularly to those
families, but I absolutely take the point that it is about getting
families out of
poverty.</div><a name="09102073000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000421"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I want to ask a question about partner authorities
that has already been raised. Under clause 19, we have a list of
partner authorities that have a responsibility to co-operate with the
responsible local authority. It also appears to be the case under
clause 20 that each responsible local authority must make arrangements
with each of the partner authorities. Can I ask whether the list under
clause 19&#151;apologies to those of you who have not had a chance to
study it&#151;is the right one? It consists of an interesting range
of people, including district councils, police authorities, chief
officers of police, integrated transport authorities, Transport for
London&#151;where relevant&#151;strategic health authorities,
primary care trusts and youth offending teams. I do not know whether
anyone has had an opportunity to look at the list or whether there are
any other organisations that you think should have a responsibility to
co-operate. Also, given that there is an obligation involved&#151;it
is a case of &#147;must&#148; make arrangements rather than
&#147;may&#148; make arrangements&#151;is there anyone on the
list who should not be
there?</div><a name="09102073000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> You are referring to statutory bodies.
Obviously, the third sector&#151;the voluntary sector&#151;has a
massive part to play, but it does not consist of statutory bodies,
which is presumably why it is not listed. You have given a list of all
the partners that sit on local strategic partnerships at various levels
in local government. In Kent, for example, we have one overarching
local strategic partnership called the Kent Partnership, and virtually
every district authority has its own distributed local strategic
partnership in its locality, although some of the authorities have
coalesced
together.</div><a name="09102073000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is one thing creating all these talking shops, but the leadership of
the strategic partnerships with the outcomes that you want to derive
from them is another. Part of that is joining together to deliver some
of the local area agreements, but there is also no reason why we cannot
be much bolder and braver&#151;I am trying to encourage this at Kent
Partnership&#151;on some of the four, five or six big issues that we
want to crack across the county of Kent, and get a lot of traction and
buy-in from those partners. However, that needs leadership, because
otherwise, if we are always responding to the micro-management of
central Government, we are never going to get on to the job in our
locality.</div><a name="09102073000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> I would like to add a point on housing, and
particularly housing associations. I know that this is a difficult
issue, because I chair a housing association and theoretically we are
private companies. In fact, we are private companies that are dependent
on the public sector, and the decisions that we make about housing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>allocations do not necessarily affect individual families, but our
allocations policy can actually aggregate poverty by putting a whole
series of people together. I do not see how you can deal with this
effectively without considering housing in its general sense. If
housing associations create a problem because we are not statutory, I
think that you have to find a way of building us into
this.</div><a name="09102073000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> This, in a sense, is the obvious list of local
commissioning bodies that actually have the resources to commission
services. I would say two key things. First, it leaves out central
Government bodies, particularly the Benefits Agency, which colleagues
have just been discussing. Where is the leverage over the Benefits
Agency to do some of the things as part of this that colleagues have
just been discussing? Secondly, within this kind of framework, given
our experience thus far of these kinds of arrangements, unless the
national Government priorities align and support this, it is actually
difficult to do. That particularly applies to what kind of priority
this will be for NHS bodies. Will it be among the must-dos for PCTs and
strategic health authorities, or will it be somewhere in a long list of
if-you-get-times?</div><a name="09102073000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000422"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I want to ask about housing authorities. If
housing authorities are included in the list of responsible
authorities, they would presumably have to incorporate the housing
strategies, which will pull in the housing associations. Do you agree
with that,
Richard?</div><a name="09102073000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> Yes, I would. In good areas, the
council&#151;even if it does not have any stock of its
own&#151;acts as the strategic housing authority and tries to build
them in. In good areas, good housing associations work with them, but I
can show you areas where neither of those two things
applies.</div><a name="09102073000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000423"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> The other thing that I want to ask about is
partnership working. On children&#146;s needs, we have two-tier local
government with the county council and children&#146;s services, and
the district council and housing services. One of you&#151;I think it
was Paul&#151;referred earlier to the difficulty of the joint working
protocols. Do you find that those work well? Richard might have views
on that as
well.</div><a name="09102073000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> The two-tier relationship is always
difficult. We are working very hard to make it work in Kent. Part of
our overall vision and regeneration framework for Kent encompasses an
overarching housing strategy, looking at housing condition and need.
The districts have signed up to it&#151;a few of them
reluctantly&#151;but it is not getting in the way of what we need to
do to start to change things significantly with regeneration. If you
were being specific about the two-tier issue of getting districts and
counties working together, I am optimistic that we are gaining ground
and making it happen.</div>
<a name="09102073000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000424"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Colin, in terms of dealing with vulnerable
children&#151;Catherine, you have probably seen this as
well&#151;my observation is that slip-ups have quite often been due
to a lack of information getting through to the children&#146;s
services about where the child is. Are you concerned about the need to
ensure that much more real meat is given to the need for joint working
protocols to be effective if we are to tackle poverty and vulnerability
among children?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="09102073000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> Clearly, that is a central part of good
provision for children and families but, fundamentally, it is about
changing people&#146;s behaviour and practice on the front line. It
is about training together, about the leadership being united around
that as one of their core objectives and about each local authority
within that having the means for people to come together, communicate
together and understand what they are telling each other about children
and families. Those seem to be the fundamentals. Those are very much
about having enough of the right people properly trained who understand
that that is their job and that those who work in housing have a
responsibility to children under the Children Act 2004.
Those in other parts of the children&#146;s service, whether in
schools or children&#146;s centres, should have some grasp of the
role of housing authorities and providers so that they can all do their
jobs well
together.</div><a name="09102073000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> My experience echoes Colin&#146;s. The
Children Act 2004 seems to give us enough support through the
children&#146;s trust arrangements to have housing at the table, and
my experience is that that works extremely well. We wanted to have
influence where decisions are made regionally as to what is going to
happen in terms of the provision and development of housing. That is
where we wanted to start having influence. I know that there have been
some changes in the way that strategic discussions will happen
regionally. I am not confident enough to name the body that would do
that, but I suspect that if that body were subject to co-operation,
that would probably be
sufficient.</div><a name="09102073000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000425"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Final question if you could, Sally.</div>
<a name="09102073000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><i class="I"><b class="B">Ms Keeble:</b></i> Under the
overcrowding provisions, it is virtually impossible to be statutorily
overcrowded unless you manage to have an exceptionally large family in
an exceptionally small flat. The legislation is going to improve and
tighten the standards. In those cases that are sort of off to one side,
and that would be managed by a partner authority, not a responsible
authority&#151;so it would be down the edge&#151;how will you
ensure that the standards are properly enforced by the responsible
authority, and that children get the benefit of the tighter
standards?</div>
<a name="09102073000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> First, you are right: there is a difference
between those who do it well and those who do not. Perhaps that is one
of the answers to whether it is legislation or more support and
training that is required&#151;probably not guidance, but more
support and training. I chaired a housing committee of a council and a
housing association, so I have an open mind. I am not trying to make
particular claims. Housing associations in particular are very well
attuned to who lives in their properties, which is an important point
that has not been used effectively
before.</div><a name="09102073000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know who lives in our properties. We are able, within the resources of
our housing associations and the wider public sector where there are
partnerships, to move people appropriately to different types of
accommodation. The other thing that we can do is crucial to this
debate; we also, by and large, have a very good relationship with our
tenants. I believe that there are major opportunities for using good
housing associations and good housing providers in the public sector to
go through the front door of those houses on behalf of all the agencies
here and create the links. It is very difficult. If you are not used to
dealing with authority in a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>variety of ways, to go into someone else&#146;s office is a brave
step. We can take people though the door. We can hold the hand of the
public sector and take it into those houses, because we know where to
go&#151;where the problems are. So, we should be used far more
imaginatively, because we can do more than provide
housing.</div><a name="09102073000217"></a>

patient.</div><a name="09102073000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><a name="09102073000427"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): Thank you. I am not sure
that we are still in any sensible order on
questioning.</div><a name="09102073000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
back to the very first comments in this evidence session, you talked,
Catherine, about the value of the Bill probably being in its seeking to
bring consistency across the country. Taking on board Richard&#146;s
and some others&#146; earlier comments about how to ensure that we
have co-operation, we know that duties are placed on both responsible
local authorities and partner authorities within the legislation, and
that there are powers within the Bill for the Secretary of State to add
people to partner authorities or take them off, and powers for local
authorities to consult organisations. Within all that, what would be
the appropriate response if a local authority, or indeed a partner
authority, failed to deliver on its duties? That would be moving
against what you are seeking to do in terms of providing
consistency.</div><a name="09102073000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> In the extraordinary circumstance of a local
authority and its partners not wishing to tackle child poverty, I would
suggest that the penalties&#151;if you like&#151;were no different
to any of the others in place for the rest of local government and
local partner arrangements, and were covered within the corporate
assessment.</div><a name="09102073000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> You are making an assumption that a duty is
necessarily a good thing but I am not convinced that it is. You can
give me a duty and I can perform it well because I want to&#151;but I
would probably have done it anyway&#151;or I can perform it to meet
the minimum requirements so that you do not take me to court or
wherever, but that does not actually move anything forward. Of course,
as a democrat, I believe that there is only one way to deal with a bad
council, and that is to vote it out of
office.</div><a name="09102073000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> Again, it is not simple. Being on the
periphery of London, Kent gets a lot of problem families that have been
shunted out of London boroughs, particularly into east Kent, into
housing that is already creaking. If you looked at consistency across
the country on housing condition and housing need, you would see that
in private sector houses in multiple occupation in east Kent there are
1,000 unaccompanied asylum seekers, and problem families that tend to
hover around the coastal counties and repeatedly move from one set of
bad debts to a new authority and a new roof over their heads. One
cannot simply look at child poverty at any one moment without knowing
what else is coming in and being imposed upon you elsewhere. So, you
could suddenly have more vulnerable families placed into Kent and more
children living in poverty as a result of the housing policies of other
boroughs, which you have no control over at all. Likewise, we have
1,000 looked-after children placed into Kent by London
authorities&#151;I know that it is into foster care, but it
destabilises the housing market in a number of ways as a
result.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="09102073000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000428"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> So, are you suggesting that it would not be
possible to assess whether a local authority had failed in its duties
under the
Bill?</div><a name="09102073000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul

a moving
target.</div><a name="09102073000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard

badly, but that is different from whether it is dealing with a duty
properly.</div><a name="09102073000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i>Exactly.</div><a name="09102073000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000429"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Is the local authority the appropriate body to
bear a duty locally for reducing child poverty, and, if not, what
alternatives might there
be?</div><a name="09102073000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> I declare myself as the chief executive of
Tower Hamlets council. I do not know what other body locally would be
the appropriate one. The local authority has a special, important place
in convening, and a leadership role in all these matters, so it is
absolutely right that the responsibility is distributed in that way.
What I find exciting is the idea that we are looking towards a
collective effort on the issue. The minute we start trying to work out
where the lines will be drawn around blame or punishment if we fail,
the whole endeavour will have failed. It must be a collective effort.
It must be about how well people are doing to create the conditions
that will reduce levels of child poverty, rather than about trying, as
I said earlier&#151;I know no one is suggesting this, but it is what
we have to watch for&#151;to locate and point the finger at a
particular level of government that has failed. It is not about passing
the buck to local government; it is about collective effort. That is
the game. The minute we get into a culture of trying to allocate
responsibility at one level or another, all of that shared endeavour
would be lost. People would start hiding behind all sorts of reasons
why it was not their
responsibility.</div><a name="09102073000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000430"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The ADCS thinks that child poverty is an unhelpful
expression. Could you expand on that, Colin, and could other members of
the panel comment on whether they think the whole focus on child
poverty in particular is
misconceived?</div><a name="09102073000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> I think our view is that children do not live
on their own; they live in families and they live in communities. Many
children are doubly disadvantaged because they are both in a family
that is living in poverty and in a community that is living in poverty.
As we have already discussed, some of that can be about poverty of
aspiration as much as about lack of income in an absolute sense. That
is why I come back to the issue of inequality being very
important and to the issue of persistence, which is recognised within
the measures. Persistence is very important in whether children spend
the whole of their childhood in poverty. We also feel strongly that the
notion of family poverty is a better lever for engaging the partners,
because, otherwise, it tends to be seen as a children&#146;s issue.
It is not a children&#146;s issue; it is a consequence to children.
We feel that better engages the whole community and the other
partners.</div><a name="09102073000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000431"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Does anyone disagree with
Colin?</div><a name="09102073000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> You have to differentiate between two types of
poverty. The first is short-term poverty, when someone is down on their
luck&#151;they have just lost their job, but in six months they will
have a job and will move 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>back out of poverty. What concerns me most is systemic poverty. In
extended families, I can show you people who are fifth-generation
unemployed, and you have to deal with the whole family because there is
a total lack of esteem and aspiration in that family. They operate in a
way which would not be recognisable to most of the people here. I think
we have to deal with the family. Paul Carter is absolutely right to say
that we have to join the organisations around those families. We can
identify 27 organisations or parts of organisations that are dealing
with some of those families. That is very expensive, and, frankly, the
fact that they are fifth-generation means that it is not working
either.</div>
<a name="09102073000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> I don&#146;t think this is disagreement, but
more about perspective. At one level, I am just glad that, whichever
words are used, people are looking at what effect this is having on
children and their lives. I also think, in the case of young people,
that they would probably see themselves as being a group in and of
their own right and being in poverty in and of their own right. While
they do live in families and are part of families, increasingly, as
they grow up, their separation from the family becomes more
significant. I suppose what I want is for us to look at what is going
on in the lives of children and young people. I have had parents say to
me very powerfully, through Sure Start children&#146;s centre
programmes, &#147;We are not poor, because we have hope,&#148; and
they lived in the most deprived wards of the country. So, I think that
something very important goes on when we translate our intent into
language out there, working with people. We need to do that
sensitively, but the bottom line for me is that, as long as this makes
us do that, it is justified.</div>
<a name="09102073000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> May I add to that? Again, it is about the
definition of poverty. This 60 per cent. threshold regarding median
income does not hit the spot, in my view, when apparently we have
48,000 children in Kent living in poverty. I agree that it should be
family, rather than child, poverty, but it is about defining what you
mean by those young people living in circumstances that you would badge
as family or child poverty. That is really important. Before you get
the definition of that and start to set benchmarks of what is
acceptable and unacceptable, and whether you are going forward or
backward in this country, sub-divided into the counties, city regions,
metropolitan authorities and anything else, you need to get that
definition
right.</div><a name="09102073000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000432"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> That is a helpful thing to say, because this
discussion is the absolute crux of the evidence that we have heard in
the past hour. I admit that I am feeling a bit anxious about it. What I
have been hearing in the general responses to questions so far is some
important thinking and analysis, but it is all about something
different: the multiple problems of children and families of the kind
that Paul discussed as being within Westminster&#146;s family
recovery project. That is a Government programme, by the way, but be
that as it may, it contains 100 children. Actually, there are 2.9
million children living in poverty in this country. You have just
brought our attention, helpfully, to the figure in Kent, which is
48,000. That is what the Bill is
about.</div><a name="09102073000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities may well have varying numbers, and will therefore consider
how they might want to tackle that as authorities and in partnership,
but surely the Child Poverty Bill and its responsibilities on local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>authorities are about addressing the number of children living below the
poverty line. What I want to hear back from all of you is whether that
is what you are talking about too. I am not sure that I have heard that
it is. If that is what you are talking about, how will you develop a
strategy that reduces the number of children living in poverty under
the indicators that the Bill specifically requires us to
achieve?</div><a name="09102073000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> I have been concentrating on the things that I
concentrate on, because I realise the shortcomings of local government.
We can only do so much. The thing that will still take more people out
of poverty in my city is more and better-quality employment. We do not
have enough jobs and have not had enough for some time. Although we
created 4,500 jobs last year, they did not get down to some of those
people who are fifth-generation unemployed. We need to look at the
benefit system and the tax system.</div>
<a name="09102073000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we do
all those things, we will not deal with a very large proportion of
those people whom
Councillor&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Sorry, I was
going back to your old job; whom Karen Buck rightly mentions. Councils
can do the things that we are talking about, but if the Department for
Work and Pensions, for example, is not a partner, that loses one big
chunk of Government direction and spending that could be better used
with some local direction. However, DWP is not in at the
moment.</div>
<a name="09102073000239"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> I am sure that we are not alone in how the
strategy is framed locally&#151;that is the value of the local
strategies&#151;in trying to attend to the long-term issues of how to
raise educational standards, build a skills base and get people into
work, because the surest way out of poverty is work, as well as
mitigating the effects of poverty in the here and now. That is where it
is very important to focus on the benefit system and those
issues.</div>
<a name="09102073000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue for me in terms of mitigating the effects of poverty is how to
ensure that people, regardless of their economic circumstances, have
the right to a full and enriching life, whether that involves leisure,
sport or culture. All those components&#151;as we said at the
beginning, certainly, for me, it is a complex array of
things&#151;have to be corralled into a local strategy, and all the
partners need to be around the table. But absolutely, it is the skills
and access to employment. Into work is the key agenda for us, both for
children in the long term and parents in the here and now, if we are
going to break the cycle of
poverty.</div><a name="09102073000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000433"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Helen Goodman wants to leap in at this
point.</div>
<a name="09102073000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000434"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> You have all talked, quite reasonably, about the
importance of co-operating also with Jobcentre Plus. I am the Minister
for DWP, so I wanted to check out with you whether you are conscious of
the partnership that we are running in Birmingham&#151;the multi-area
agreement&#151;which includes Jobcentre Plus. Do you know anything
about that? We have positive experience in some places, but I am not
sure whether you are conscious of it.</div>
<a name="09102073000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> Yes, but would you like some negative
experience as well? The trouble is that one council can say,
&#147;DWP and Jobcentre Plus are absolutely marvellous partners and
with us all the way,&#148; but I could take you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>to the next council and it will not. In my area, someone from Jobcentre
Plus was supposed to be leading the worklessness stream, which is of
vital importance in Liverpool. She pulled out because she said that it
was not part of her day job, although we were trying to create a
partnership to help her do her day job in that
case.</div><a name="09102073000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
138</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000435"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Of course I understand that sometimes things go
well and sometimes things do not go well&#151;we do realise
that&#151;but the point that I was trying to make was that these
partnerships exist in some places. I was getting the impression from
the way you were talking that you were not conscious of any
partnerships with Jobcentre Plus and local authority agencies
anywhere.</div><a name="09102073000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> I find them quite reluctant partners. In
sharing the data and the information, the data protection gets in the
way. You are trying to get a handle on what is going on in a highly
socially deprived ward, but getting that information is&#151;for
perhaps legitimate data protection reasons&#151;a real problem. There
is an enormous reluctance to focus in on some of those vulnerable
families that are significantly benefit-dependent&#151;you need to
look at and share the data on them to find the
solutions.</div><a name="09102073000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000436"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Following on from Karen&#146;s question, I think
that she was absolutely right in that a lot of what we have heard from
you today about addressing deep, severe and persistent poverty, which
we all support, and also about the very long-term aspects of creating
the right environment and so on, will not necessarily have an immediate
impact on getting people above the 60 per cent. target. Do you have any
concerns that the 60 per cent. target might divert resources from what
you are already doing? Richard, you made the point that there are only
so many things that you can do. Is the point more that, as far as the
60 per cent. target is concerned, the effective things that can be done
are to do with tax and benefits and so on, and it is more a central
than a local government
point?</div><a name="09102073000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> I would say that that is more the case. If I
look at the things that I think that a local authority can do with the
partners, the most important things in this area are those that Richard
pointed to, about creating a dynamic local economy. It is about what
you are doing about getting people into employment, given that the
local authority is often the biggest local employer. What are you doing
in that area? What are the NHS bodies doing in that area? How effective
are you in improving schools? It is very important that the local
authority maintains a role as leader of the local education system. It
needs to have the powers and capability to do that. Similarly, about
tackling health inequalities&#151;is the PCT addressing that? These
are the ways in which, by creating a dynamic and positive local
environment in the city, county or wherever, you give people the
opportunity to get better jobs to change their lives. Those are the
things that we can actually
do.</div><a name="09102073000248"></a>

140</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000437"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Following on from that point&#151;maybe each of
you might have a quick view on this&#151;should it be about having an
impact assessment of all that you do as local authorities to see what
the effect on poverty is? One of the things that is very concerning
about government, including local government, is that the delivery of
one service will directly cut across the attempt to achieve 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>another target. For example, everyone has talked about child care and
agrees that it is an incredibly important engine for delivery on child
poverty, but local authorities are busy increasing their rents to child
care providers, immediately having the effect of pushing up the charges
to parents. That is because there is somehow no read-across from one
area of service to another. Is that something that should be the
basic&#151;probably the starting point&#151;child poverty policy in
each
area?</div><a name="09102073000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> We have brought in a child poverty impact
assessment to how we consider policy across the piece, with the
partnership and the council. I think that that is helpful, because you
do not quite see the connections unless you have the discipline. The
danger is that it becomes another bureaucratic process, which is an
issue, but I agree with you that, otherwise, you miss the connections,
which are very complex. The threads go far and wide in this
one.</div><a name="09102073000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> First, an absolute yes to the impact assessment
and, secondly, we have had an extremely good experience working with
Jobcentre Plus&#151;we had organisations working with it through the
new futures project. Thirdly, I think that there were three groups
identified: those families in long-term poverty, over several
generations; those families who are in in-work poverty, who worry
people considerably; and those people who were coming in for the short
term but for whom being in poverty was a real shock to the system. It
is not the same for those three
groups.</div><a name="09102073000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000438"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Paul, a little while ago you quite rightly made
the point that the Bill is pretty much a blank canvas. It talks about
the mechanisms, the legal framework and the strategies that will need
to be written, but the content is quite blank. I should be interested
to hear from you and anyone else on the panel what you think needs to
be in it, both nationally and locally. You have talked about some of
what you have done in Kent, but I should appreciate a slightly fuller
answer.</div><a name="09102073000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> Presumably, we are going into solutions
mode.</div><a name="09102073000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000439"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="09102073000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> We are not just going to click our fingers
and bring wealth and prosperity to highly socially deprived areas, so
what can we do against the rather bleak, economic outlook for the
western world and this country at the moment? There is a massive role,
certainly in the education part. The outcome of reducing the number of
NEETs is clearly beginning to work by raising aspiration and ambition,
and introducing a pioneering 14 to 16-years-old technical, vocational
programme. Some 5,000 young people are now choosing to do that one day
a week in our high schools. We have the best careers guidance that
allows people to explore social enterprises and what they might see in
a really interactive, creative
way.</div><a name="09102073000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have the future jobs fund of which Kent is an early adopter. We have to
create 1,700 jobs every six months for the long-term unemployed, 70 per
cent. of whom are young and unemployed. That is an enormous task. How
can we create with the voluntary and public sectors social enterprises
that can be of community benefit and raise the self-worth and
self-esteem of those unemployed&#151;particularly young
people&#151;who will get used to having low self-esteem, and low
aspiration 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>because they cannot make the world a better place in any shape or form
because they cannot get a job? The role of social enterprises in the
third sector is enormous. I could go on with a continuum of other
initiatives that we are trialling and on which we want to build
momentum in Kent.</div>
<a name="09102073000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
142</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000440"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Thank you, Paul. That was very
useful.</div><a name="09102073000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Kevan,
something you said earlier was fascinating and very radical. You were
talking about the possible flexibility of the benefits system and the
fact that it is not flexible. You said that it does not do flexibility,
that it is set down nationally, is incredibly prescriptive and that
there are thousands of pages of rules, regulations and so on. I am
intrigued by the idea of local flexibility. You are on to something
there. Will you outline a bit more of what you would like to see, or
what you were alluding to in that
regard?</div><a name="09102073000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> It goes back to an opportunity to ask for
freedom and flexibilities to be put forward as a package. We have had
good relationships with Jobcentre Plus. What we could not get was the
freedom to have a holiday from the particular benefit in order to put
people into work&#151;that was a few years ago in the Canary Wharf
area. If that policy did not work out, people would go back on to their
benefit without losing their rights. What we know is that the minute
people get a taste of work and are into work for a while, it changes
their relationship with that whole experience. Many people,
particularly those on incapacity benefit, are frightened to come off
that benefit even for a short time because of the task of getting back
on to it&#151;I am not applauding that, just stating
it.</div><a name="09102073000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the benefits system, it is difficult to find the location of
accountability around the table at the strategic partnership. Where is
the person with the authority to take a risk? We are lucky with the
London boroughs in that we are coterminous with our PCT and our borough
commanders&#151;the key players around the table. The right leaders
are there to take a risk to bend their resources. It is a matter of
finding that authority at the right level, when someone from the
benefits system has the power and authority to say, &#147;You know
what, I&#146;m going to go with this, and take the risk and the
flexibility at that level.&#148; In places like Tower Hamlets, as we
have done this work, the localisation of the economy around benefits
strikes you in terms of its enormity, and it could be used to strike
new relationships between individuals and the benefits system. It is
all clunky, and in the end you feel worn down by it, and that is a
challenge.</div><a name="09102073000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000441"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I see unanimous nodding heads from our
witnesses.</div><a name="09102073000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
143</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000442"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> How will children&#146;s trust boards be
involved formally with the work of local authorities to meet their
duties in reducing child
poverty?</div><a name="09102073000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> They would be the group who would do that. I
do not think that there would be a separate group. Such people are
already engaged in the children&#146;s trust partnerships. However
configured, they all play a role at present, so it would be that group.
In Coventry, I certainly would not envisage having another set of
arrangements because such things are all interconnected.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="09102073000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000443"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Children&#146;s trust boards may not be working
very well; there is mixed information so far on how effective they have
been&#151;all sorts of things around the difficulties of pooled
budgets, partnership working and junior people turning up after the
first couple of meetings; all that sort of stuff. If they are the main
vehicle and they do not work we have a serious problem, haven&#146;t
we? Don&#146;t we need a plan
B?</div><a name="09102073000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> Potentially, yes, but setting up another body
is not going to solve that. If the children&#146;s trust body is not
working, that is fundamentally to do with the dynamics&#151;the
difficulties between those partners. Having another group is just going
to replicate those
difficulties.</div><a name="09102073000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> In fact, the comprehensive area assessment,
which, as you know, is in the process of reporting, will not be
reporting any longer on the council but on the partnerships and who is
contributing to those partnerships. That is a call to arms. Local
government tends to be better at partnerships, not least because we
have always done lots of bits of things. In our council chamber we are
used to seeing housing, social services and education, whereas a lot of
our silo colleagues do health, for example. Some do this and some do
that and they find it a lot harder to come together. I think the CAA
will show that. I do think there needs to be more training for some of
our partners. I go along to board members of partners who are listed
here who have a duty to co-operate with the council and ask what they
have done about that and I am afraid they say they do not know it
exists. It is early&#151;only two years&#151;but we have got to
provide more training and support in that sort of
situation.</div><a name="09102073000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> May I agree, Chairman, on that? The jury is
out on the trusts. They are great conceptually  but they have
to prove to me and Kent that our 23 distributed children&#146;s
trusts across the county are actually delivering and are not talking
shops. Is the joint commissioning going on? Are the PCTs actually
getting their cheque books out and putting their money on the table or
not? Please do not make me suggest that they are not, but I want proof
that they are because the opportunity for cost shunting is quite
considerable. There can be blurred accountability&#151;&#147;We
thought you were doing it. Oh no, you&#146;re doing it.&#148;
Things slip through the net. Conceptually it could work but it worries
me that in Kent they have been rather distanced from democratic
accountability and political
leadership.</div><a name="09102073000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000444"></a>John
Barrett:</b> I want to move away from the wider issues to a
specific group&#151;children in local authority care. You mentioned,
Paul, that there are 1,000 in Kent. There are also unaccompanied
asylum-seeking children. How should the measurements for child poverty
be made for those specific
children?</div><a name="09102073000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> You are going into the area of looked-after
children. In Kent there are 1,000 indigenous, 1,000 unaccompanied
minors and 1,000 placed by other authorities. Obviously, we are now
going into how you help and support that significant
number&#151;concentrated predominantly in the coastal areas of the
county of Kent&#151;delivering the best outcomes for those young
people. I think you are going down a path to a category potentially
living in child poverty, but there is a slightly different set of
solutions to that problem in my view.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div><a name="09102073000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> In my own council last Wednesday we had a
presentation made by some of our children in care. We have all signed a
pledge that has to include a specific example of what all 90
councillors in Liverpool will do as a corporate parent. I was not
actually there but I will be signing up to this. Frankly, this is a
responsibility on all councillors and I guess a lot of councillors do
not even realise they have it and do not do anything about
it.</div>
<a name="09102073000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
series of national targets and local targets. I can either do this with
my heart because I want to help these people or do it with my head. If
we do not help them early we know we will be dealing with them for the
rest of their lives. That is just common sense as well as being what we
want to do. Increasingly I think looked-after children are coming up
the councillors&#146;
agenda.</div><a name="09102073000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> May I just add to that, Chairman? This puts a
larger burden on trying to fight indigenous child poverty in Kent. We
are exacerbating the problem by allowing London boroughs and other
authorities to place such children into an economy at considerable
distance from their birth families. Legislation needs to change to say
that they cannot make placements over a certain distance. Guidance has
been produced left, right and centre but there is no actual legislation
that makes placing authorities have a duty of care within defined
restrictions.</div><a name="09102073000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> Clearly, we have a duty of care to every child
in our care wherever they are placed. I want to come back to the issue
that children who become looked-after are overwhelmingly drawn from
poor families. Our role is to try to ensure that they do not become
poor adults, living in poor families. That is about whether they have
the social, educational and emotional equipment to lead a successful
adult
life.</div><a name="09102073000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000445"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I want to connect the points made by
Mr. Green and Mr. Carter. Let us say that one
took a child-centred approach. I was not exactly sure, from what
Mr. Carter was saying, what the benefits to the children
would be of the approach that he proposes. I could see the benefits of
it to the local authority, in that it is easier to organise, better to
run, more straightforward to manage and so on, but how precisely would
what you were saying about not allowing children to be placed away from
the central London boroughs help the
children?</div><a name="09102073000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> It exacerbates our problem substantially in
Kent, because it puts up the cost of foster care
provision.</div><a name="09102073000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000446"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Yes, but I was asking about the child&#146;s
perspective, not the local authority&#146;s perspective; that was my
question.</div><a name="09102073000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> Well, I would like to track back some of the
placing authorities to make sure they do carry out their duty of care
sensibly and responsibly. Some of these are the most challenging young
people, with extraordinary special educational needs. The funding
formula and distribution mechanism in relation to our schools funding
does not take into account the extraordinary problems from placing some
extraordinarily challenging young people into Kent and into Kent
schools. If you go round the primary schools in parts of Thanet, you
will talk to head teachers who say that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>there might be two young people who started in year 1 and ended up in
year 6 because the transience of the school population is quite
enormous. That places a most extraordinary burden on those primary
schools in Kent in providing good-quality education for all young
people. It exacerbates the problem in concentrated pockets, so it has
an effect not just on those looked-after children, but on the whole
environment in which they
live.</div><a name="09102073000277"></a>

Keeble:</b> You made the point quite frequently about the
mobility of certain children and issues about having a strategy to deal
with that. I used to be a leader in Southwark, which regularly sent
children and people down to Kent. Do you find in the Bill anything that
deals with that specific issue or do you think that something should be
put in to deal with the problem of transience and
mobility?</div><a name="09102073000279"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul

that in areas of high social deprivation, I think it places an
unacceptable burden on all the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000449"></a>Ms

issue?</div><a name="09102073000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> The information that is required on the
placement from a placing authority into the county of Kent needs to be
absolutely robust&#151;from what I hear, I am not convinced that it
is&#151;so that we know the exceptional needs of those young people
when they arrive, with a proper statement of need attributed to them.
The information also needs to be robust so that the authority keeps a
watching brief over those placed, looked-after children, extending its
responsibilities to make sure that its duty of care is carried out with
all those young people placed in Kent and the burden is not just placed
on Kent county council. From what my officers tell me, that is what so
often
happens.</div><a name="09102073000282"></a>

150</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000451"></a>Julie
Morgan:</b> Are there any other powers that could prevent
children from ending up in
poverty?</div><a name="09102073000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Colin
Green:</b></i> The issue for me, by and large, is what
happens to children before they become looked-after, and the impact of
that experience. The difficulty for the local authority and our
partners is in addressing that, and changing the child&#146;s or
young person&#146;s life to overcome whatever happened to them in the
past. That is a much bigger and longer question.</div>
<a name="09102073000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> I would like to think that the world is
getting a better place for looked-after children. There has been a
substantial focus on the provision of additional 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>support outside the foster-care family that you can give to looked-after
children, particularly post-16 and post-18, and on the educational
outcomes of those looked-after children.</div>
<a name="09102073000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, there is far too much of a cliff edge coming out of foster care
into the big wide world, with no safety net&#151;well, not a proper
safety net provision&#151;to keep them on the straight and narrow and
into work and employment. It is all about getting to a certain
age&#151;I think it is 18&#151;and boom! Although the duty of care
probably extends to 24, most come out at either 16 or 18. When you talk
to young people, they would like more help and support. The amount of
resource that goes into helping and supporting them up to that cliff
edge, and then what happens afterwards, need looking at in my
view.</div>
<a name="09102073000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> I do not think that we need more powers, but
there are two things that we do need. First, we need more social
workers. It is not a question of resource; at the LGA, we work closely
with the Government to try to bring more people back into the
profession. We call it &#147;recruit, retain and return&#148;, to
bring back people at least on a part-time basis. Every time our social
workers&#151;this goes across children&#146;s services
generally&#151;get vilified in the press after a baby P type case, it
makes it more difficult to recruit. It creates pressures on the
profession to take action that it would not necessarily take otherwise.
Like the rest of us, it wants to cover its back.</div>
<a name="09102073000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I was to
make a criticism of local government&#151;I am not going to defend
everything that local government does&#151;I would say, in terms of
looked-after children, that many councillors have not taken their
responsibility seriously. I have been a councillor for 29 years, and no
member of the public has ever asked me about looked-after children
unless there was a baby P-type case. I accept some responsibility as a
councillor, through our agencies such as the Improvement and
Development Agency, to take some of those messages about looked-after
children, so that all 25,000 councillors in the UK actually accept the
pledge of corporate parenting. We accept full responsibility
ourselves.</div>
<a name="09102073000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> I am slightly nervous sitting next to Paul;
we are a London borough that also sends children to Kent, but we send
them to loving, caring families&#151;and we send them with quite a
lot of resources as well, so they are certainly not poor when they are
there.</div>
<a name="09102073000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to focus on leaving care&#151;that is a strong point&#151;rather
than in care. As children leave care, the quality of support they need
if they are not to become poor members of our community, and parents
who are then poor, is very profound. That is the cycle that worries me,
and not while they are in care. While they are in care, often the
support is very powerful. It is before and afterwards. Strong agendas
around families facing crisis and families entering poverty is very
important in order to prevent children going into care, and that is
what we would all love to see. We would also love to have them all in
our borough if they are in care and if we have the right kind housing
support for them. However, I think that the leaving-care agenda is
right. The kind of support&#151;into work and into housing as you
leave care&#151;is most important to prevent the cycle of poverty,
and these children are often from a background of
poverty.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="09102073000293"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Catherine
Fitt:</b></i> I agree very much with what Kevan has had to
say. All I can say is that, for me, it is that the chicken and egg are
the other way around. When I look at the outcomes for children and
young people in Newcastle, poor outcomes are closely correlated to
areas of deprivation. Whether that is teenage pregnancy, low
educational achievement, becoming looked-after, incidents of domestic
violence, parental substance abuse or parental mental health problems,
there is such a strong correlation.</div>
<a name="09102073000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realised
that I was not going to be able to make the impact needed to provide
outcomes to children unless I tackled child poverty head-on. That can
be done only if everybody is determined to do it and accepts that we do
not have all the answers; but together we might possibly find some. For
me, it is rather that way round. That is why we want to tackle child
poverty. That is why I believe having legislation is, on balance,
important symbolically, and that it will be helpful. It is because I
want to improve outcomes for children.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102073000452"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you, Catherine. We will now move on to
Andrew
Selous.</div><a name="09102073000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000453"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I wonder whether you could elaborate a little on
something you said earlier. You talked about some of the families in
acute need who were having budgets in total of perhaps &#163;100,000
or &#163;150,000 a year spent on them and you said that perhaps there
was not always the collaboration that is required. I just wondered what
your thoughts were on how that collaboration would work from the
perspective of management, budget-holding, reporting and
accountability. I think that is almost the holy grail for a lot of
people in terms of these really difficult social problems, but I have
never quite managed to get my mind round how it works in terms of
reporting lines, budgets and so on. If you have any thoughts on that, I
would be very grateful to hear
them.</div>
<a name="09102073000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> We are only just starting the journey.
Clearly, Westminster is further ahead in looking at the 50 or 100 such
families in Westminster and therefore in trying to establish what the
solutions are, what the totality of public resource going into the
support of those families is, and what are the better solutions that
give better outcomes at lesser cost. As I say, it is one of our themes
in the Total Place concept around the Margate renewal programme. For
example, I am told that, regarding the assessment cost of vulnerable
families, you get two, three or even four different officers of the
various public agencies knocking on the same doors and asking the same
questions, so the assessment cost is not what it ought to be, because
we have not joined up helping and supporting families with either
single access to the support mechanism or single assessment of their
needs.</div><a name="09102073000298"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> May I add to that? We have been running
something that is, I think, very similar for a while now: the
budget-holding lead professional scheme, which has been a pilot from
the Government. In the pilot, around a single professional, you have
been able to identify a budget that can be spent in a very flexible way
on the needs of a particular family. The accountability framework of
that system is, of course, that the initial assessment, which has to be
joined up, has a mechanism that allows you to evaluate progress. Some
of these things are incredibly practical. Are the children now arriving
at school on time? Has the number of antisocial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>behaviour orders applying to that family fallen? Are they paying their
rent on time? Those are measurable improvements in a family&#146;s
behaviour and then, classically, there is someone getting into work.
There are therefore mechanisms that you can put around those types of
frameworks.</div>
<a name="09102073000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key for
us was connecting that system with a lever, and the lever, of course,
related to tenancy. It was to do with the fact that our expectation was
that you would engage in this work as a family, and there was a
requirement right at the end of the spectrum, because your ability to
move and to get the kind of housing that you wanted, and your place in
our order, would be jeopardised. So I think that those levers, as well
as the opportunities, are important.</div>
<a name="09102073000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">What was
striking was the type of things that people did with the money, whether
it was buying new mattresses or whatever. Buying alarm clocks for a
whole family was one that struck me. They were things that you just
would not have intuitively come through the normal
mechanisms&#151;well, you might have, but it was unlikely.</div>
<a name="09102073000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
point about that system was that there was a need for a new kind of
professional. With one of the families in our borough that we had all
known for 20-odd years, the right professional happened to be a youth
worker who knew the family well. How do you get the right person
connected to a family? I am therefore not necessarily claiming that
there should be more social workers, although I am always doing that. I
am also claiming that this kind of work with families require a new
trained professional who understands how to work with these families in
a very practical &#147;sleeves-rolled-up&#148;
way.</div><a name="09102073000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000454"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> My question is possibly not directed so much at you,
Kevan, because I think this is very true for your area. Of course, half
the households in poverty do not live in council properties or housing
association properties. This is a little bit of the same danger that I
have raised before: we are looking at poverty through the prism of the
Bill, and we are constantly coming back to a hard core of multiply
disadvantaged families. They exist&#151;and you are on the front line
dealing with that real issue&#151;but for the purposes of the Bill,
we need to focus not just on those families with multiple difficulties,
but on income poverty, employment and what you do about households that
own their own homes, not just those who are tenants. This just keeps
drifting back to the same sort of categorisation of people in poverty
but I am really not sure about that. It worries me that that is the
local authority mindset.</div>
<a name="09102073000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> As I tried to explain before, that is not our
mindset; that is in our ability and our duties to perform. People will
come out of poverty at a high rate in our economy as the economy
improves and people get jobs. What can I do as a councillor to affect
that? I can do some things to safeguard my community. I can do some
things to make sure that we are preparing for new industries and new
opportunities. I can do some things to mitigate the circumstances of
people in poverty, whether full term or short term. However, I cannot,
as a councillor, refloat the economy and that is why we are
concentrating on a particular area, because I can show you that if we
work in those areas, we can have some effect. However, there are other
areas&#151;which might rightly be in the Bill&#151;where you think
that you have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>given us a duty to do something, but I will not be able to have any
effect on it because those levers are outside my control. That is why
we concentrate on the areas where we do have
control.</div>
<a name="09102073000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000455"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I put this to you, particularly in light of
what Richard has said? There are various poverty measures in the Bill,
and clause 24 sets out the measures that apply to local authorities.
One of the measures is described as the relative low income
target&#151; 60 per cent. below medium income. Some other
measures relate to an absolute level of income and others relate to
material deprivation combined with low income. Is it the view of our
witnesses that the 60 per cent. target is perhaps not
appropriate in the context of local 
authorities?</div><a name="09102073000305"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> There are grades of poverty, and that is one
way of making a line. I wanted to look at the figures to check that
48,000 children, according to that definition, lived in poverty in
Kent, to make sure that I had not got the nought in the wrong place.
However, according to that measurement, the figure is 48,000. We are
focused on various different categories of poverty and the need to
address the real concerns of looked-after children&#151;young people
living in pretty appalling conditions in very vulnerable families where
interventions are needed. So, you have to grade it. If you want to
start, the simple solution is to give people greater benefits to bring
them up to the 60 or 70 per cent. You have then cracked a big problem
of getting probably 48,000 down to 25,000 at the click of a switch.
That is not, I would hope, what the commission is all about. It is all
about trying to look at the underlying causes of child poverty at those
different levels that add up to that massive cut-off point that shows
that 48,000 young people in Kent are living in poverty. I would like to
look at the need type of those 48,000 young people to better understand
the various grades and the various different solutions that need to be
applied to those young people in fundamentally different
ways.</div>
<a name="09102073000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is
to be a role for the commission, it is to network and look at what is
working&#151;as far as I am concerned it is what is working that
counts. When you look at some of the Government&#146;s interventions
on vulnerable family support&#151;a lot of it well-intended and a lot
of it working, but a lot not working&#151;nobody has actually done
proper research to look at the input and the outcomes for much of that
vulnerable family wraparound support in an intelligent way. The Sure
Start academic research analysis&#151;it said that Sure Start was
generally bad&#151;was not good. I could take you to three or four
early Sure Start programmes in Kent that are doing a fantastic job of
changing life outcomes, and two or three that are pretty poor, but
reaching that generalisation&#151;the research and
analysis&#151;needs to be done in a much more detailed and
intelligent way. We will learn a lot from that, and in my view the
commission could learn a lot from what is working and, most
importantly, what is not working where a significant amount of public
resource is being
spent.</div><a name="09102073000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000456"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I want to move on to joined-up working with other
authorities&#151;other bodies&#151;but may I just ask you about
this 48,000 number? The national figure of 2.9 million or whatever is
based on a sample survey that has been grossed up. The samples are too 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>small to give a figure on that basis for any local authority. The Kent
number cannot be a pro rata of that and cannot be based on that same
data source. I am not arguing with you, but how can you possibly know
that 48,000 Kent children are in households whose total household
income&#151;you probably do not know that income, unless they are on
benefit&#151;is less than 60 per cent. of the equivalent median? Can
you know that? Where does the 48,000 come
from?</div><a name="09102073000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> It is a horrible answer, because I usually
challenge everything that my officers give me, but that is what the
officers tell me&#151;that there are 48,000 who fit those criteria at
the moment. Kent is one fortieth of England, and you can multiply. Kent
is pretty much a cross-section of the country and its social diversity
is similar. What is the national
figure?</div><a name="09102073000309"></a>

have to make progress on child poverty, but no local authority has a

156</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000458"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> On that point, let me move on to the question I was
getting to about benefit take-up, joint working and so on. It
constantly drives me mad&#151;and it drives real people
mad&#151;that if someone gets a low-paid job, they have to tell the
tax credit people, housing benefit, council tax benefit,
jobseeker&#146;s allowance people and so on. You have to tell
everybody&#151;probably several times over in different forms and at
different times. Why is it so difficult? Is it, pejoratively,
&#147;your&#148; fault or is it &#147;their&#148; fault that
these things cannot be brought together so that one set of
information&#151;perhaps comprehensive information&#151;is given to
one person?</div>
<a name="09102073000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">You mentioned
one-stop shops and housing benefit administration. Why is it that you
cannot simply take the information that has already been given? We keep
hearing about take-up pilots and that we are going to make benefit
entitlement automatic, but it never bloomin&#146; well happens. What
is the problem?</div>
<a name="09102073000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> Local government was not too good at benefit
collection 10 or 12 years ago. We have made a massive improvement now,
according to the benefit fraud inspectorate. For our own taxes and
benefits, large numbers of authorities are four-star and improving. In
those areas, we believe that there is proven competence. There is a
reach into the communities, so our offer is to take it over.</div>
<a name="09102073000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
series of small pilots, but no one from central Government has yet been
prepared to try out a proper full-scale pilot. There will be
difficulties; we will have to learn how to do things and I am not
saying that we should do it like that nationally. However, where local
government has proven itself to be an external regulator, I do not know
why we cannot have a full-scale, quick experiment to see what we can
do.</div>
<a name="09102073000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> But we have a horribly complex system. Put
yourself in the shoes of the customer. They lose their job and have to
sign on, and I am told that that is a horrible, protracted process.
Thankfully, I have never personally experienced it, but I run a
construction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>company in London and employ people who have been on and off the dole
and on and off benefits. It is a tortuous, horrible position, and once
someone is on, what is the incentive for that person to take up a six
or eight-week, or three-month job opportunity on one of my building
sites, because they will then have the tortuous process of getting back
on benefits. If you talk to users of the benefits system who have been
able to go in and out, they say it is horrible. It does not incentivise
them to have another go once they are on
benefits.</div>

157</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000459"></a>Steve

a sense, it was once just the good old Department of Health and Social
Security, or whatever it was at the time. Now the Inland
Revenue&#151;HMRC&#151;is far more involved in the day-to-day lives
of families with children through the tax credit system. Has it got
worse on the ground? Is it more difficult to bring these things
together?</div>
<a name="09102073000317"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> I certainly have nothing more than anecdotal
evidence. Perhaps you are indicating an area that we ought to look at.
I know that the people come to my advice centre with the fear of having
to repay things. There is a fear factor, but whether that is a real
factor, I do not know.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
158</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000460"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I am not going to take the Committee down the
path of defending the great transformation that is under way at the
moment in the way that benefits are delivered. Instead, I would like to
ask the witnesses about their relationships with the voluntary sector.
Local government finds central Government quite inflexible, and I think
that sometimes the voluntary sector finds local government a little bit
inflexible. I was wondering how you were intending to use the new
partnership arrangements in the Bill to work with the voluntary sector,
and whether you think that the provisions in the Bill are helpful and
adequate.</div>
<a name="09102073000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> When I spoke at the House of Lords Select
Committee this afternoon, I invited their lordships to join me on 16
November, and I will invite you to join me as well. At the Local
Government Association, we are taking up that challenge, but in a wider
sense. If we are going to deal with the multiple problems to society,
particularly at a time when public sector finances are going to be
severely constrained, we need to create a new set of relationships
between the public, private and voluntary sectors. We are defining that
partly as kit, cash and culture. Although I know that it would not
apply in this particular field, we should ask what equipment we can use
to help with things, for example that would affect adult social care.
How will we introduce new cash into the system? We all look down on
each other and tie ourselves into contracts that keep us at the lowest
possible level, rather than capturing the innovation and energy that
those three sectors can bring, so how will we work together
better?</div>
<a name="09102073000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
saying that we are starting off from a bad base, because the national
compacts, the community empowerment networks and the local compacts are
beginning to move us forward, but what we are looking at is a step
change. That is where I come back to benefits, because I do not think
that there is a separate argument. People in our communities know that
there are jobs to be done. They know that the people currently doing
nothing could do them, and they would use 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>benefit money effectively to link the two, because they are meaner with
money than people like us. They watch every last farthing and would
ensure that benefits were applied to people in their community doing
real work, which we know is needed in every community. I just think
that there are major ways forward.</div>
<a name="09102073000321"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Kevan
Collins:</b></i> I think this goes back to Ms Buck&#146;s
point. I think that the segmentation of the responsibilities is really
important: where central Government have their responsibility; where
local government have theirs; and where community groups and the third
sector have theirs. I am not sure that that settlement has yet been
reached. I am absolutely clear that the powers of opportunity are there
in the way in which the Bill has been drafted. There are things that
only the third sector can do, particularly when you get to the
localisation of getting people back into work or into work quickly. It
is not just about learning how to write a CV&#151;you do that only
once&#151;but about getting you job-ready for tomorrow and linking
that back to the community sector.</div>
<a name="09102073000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where I live
and work there are some striking issues in relation to belief systems
about the value of being in work, which to me is fundamental to getting
out of poverty, and that takes you into faith groups and to the work we
do with mosques and churches. That is critical to changing
people&#146;s attitudes and relationship to work where it may have
been broken down for a long time. I think that there are very important
roles and responsibilities, but the issue of segmenting and clarifying
who is responsible for what is key to that local plan. To answer your
question directly, I do think that the right kind of arrangements are
there for us to do that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="09102073000461"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> Following up on that, would you say that the
experience of bidding for money from the future jobs fund, which is
intended to be Government money from DWP for moving people from
benefits to things that have community benefit, has been a good
precedent that could be built on in that arena?</div>
<a name="09102073000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Kemp:</b></i> That depends on who you are asking and where
you are asking them. I know about that because Ministers acknowledged
that the Local Government Association had a major role to play in
producing that money. In my area, that has been passed down for one
council to deal with on behalf of the county, and it has then been
passed to another agency and another. When we discussed it at the
central-local partnership, I foresaw it as being a direct relationship,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>as was the case with some of the old youth training schemes, although I
am not saying that it should be another youth training scheme. A
housing association such as mine already runs social enterprises and
wants to take people on, but by the time this has gone through three
layers of bureaucracy on Merseyside, there is frankly so little left
that we are not bidding for it, despite the fact that I was one of the
people who tried to get the money in the first place. In other places
they have managed to deal with it. You really need to look at the
mechanisms you have put in place to get in to people like
us.</div><a name="09102073000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Carter:</b></i> It worries me enormously that we have to find
those 1,700 jobs. I want to give all those 1,700 people, and
particularly the young people, a really good experience of work every
six months, so we must not just create jobs for the sake of jobs so
that people will go and do a bit of community work here and there.
Their self-esteem and ambitions must be raised as a consequence of
being on the programme. Finding so many jobs in community improvement
that satisfy those criteria is a massively big ask.</div>
<a name="09102073000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
thing that worries me is the cliff edge at the end of it. Having got
them into work, got them out of bed, got them alarm clocks and got them
motivated, there is a cliff edge at six months. We want to try to
create a longer opportunity for sustainable work opportunity beyond six
months, but that is difficult. A massive amount of public money is
going into it and that is well-intended, but how we go about it, to do
exactly what I have just said, is
difficult.</div><a name="09102073000327"></a>
