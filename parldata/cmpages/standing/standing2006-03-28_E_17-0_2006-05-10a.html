<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000534"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> I am delighted that we have finally made it to

part 6 of the Bill, which is about nutrition and health. Many hon.

Members will be aware that last year, when I was drawn 10th in the

private Member&#146;s Bill ballot, I presented the Children&#146;s

Food Bill to this House. I pay tribute to the many Members present who

supported me with that Bill, and to all those who are among the 281 MPs

who signed the early-day motion that calls for better standards in

school food. The main strands of what my Bill called for&#151;issues

on which teachers and parents across the country campaigned&#151;are

contained in this Bill.</div>

<a name="06051157000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair to say that school

meals currently have their highest profile since they were introduced

at the start of 20th century. They are finally being recognised as a

vital plank in ensuring child health and public health in later life. I

am pleased that access to fresh tap water is being considered. In my

school days, the only way one could get a drink of water was by sucking

the taps in the school toilets&#151;that was comprehensive education

under the Tories in the &#146;80s. I am glad to see that the bad old

days are now well and truly behind us.

</div><a name="06051157000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put the amendments

in context, it is important to talk about the obesity problem in the

UK. Government figures from 2002 show that 30 per cent. of children

aged two to 15 are either obese or overweight. If the rate of obesity

increase continues at the current rate, more than half of children will

be overweight or obese in the next 15 years&#151;by 2020. The links

between poor diet and chronic disease are well known. If we do not

address this problem, mothers of my generation might, for the first

time, have a longer life expectancy than their children.</div>

<a name="06051157000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the support that the

Children&#146;s Food Bill had from Unison, GMB, the National Union of

Teachers, the Communication Workers Union, the Co-op, the British

Medical Association and the British Heart Foundation. Parallel to the

debate about children&#146;s food has been a television process, with

Jamie Oliver&#146;s programme &#147;Jamie&#146;s School

Dinners&#148;, and a political process with the children&#146;s

manifesto, launch of the fresh fruit and veg for primary school

children scheme, and the joint public service agreement on childhood

obesity between the Department for Education and Skills and the

Department of Health.</div>

<a name="06051157000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are beginning to see the

results of the &#163;220 million investment to tackle obesity through

better training for school cooks, better ingredients and longer hours

for school meals staff, who are crucial not only to the cooking of

school meals, but to cajoling children to eat them. I can see the

difference in my own schools in Wakefield. When I launched the

Children&#146;s Food Bill last July, I visited two schools in my

constituency. In one, all the children were eating white pasta and

white sausage rolls, and in the second there were many smiley faces,

but unfortunately they were on the shaped potatoes that are so

abhorrent to parents, including me. Children like those kinds of food,

so it is hard to wean them off that particular brand of unpleasant

regurgitated mush.</div>

<a name="06051157000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">With Wakefield council and its

contracted in-house catering provider, Kingswood, we have seen the

changes already, not just with ingredients, but with methods of

encouraging children to make healthy choices, such as the use of

stickers. I have an extraordinary memory for very good meals, and I

have 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column814" />Column number: 815</div>fond memories from my September visit to Lawefield primary school, in my

constituency, of the turkey casserole with dumplings followed by

pineapple pudding and low-sugar custard. That pretty much knocked me

out for the rest of the day, but was, I assure hon. Members, the

ultimate in comfort school food. Sandal Magna school, in my

constituency, which I have mentioned before in Committee, has used the

healthy school approach to transform the school by cutting out sweets

and crisps, and switching to fruit and milk-based

snacks.</div><a name="06051157000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

yesterday&#146;s debate on clause 61, we spoke of the need for

children to learn how to cook and grow their own food. We should not

rely on TV celebrities to educate our children about what goes into

turkey twizzlers. On that subject, I know that one French department

has a food education programme, and that obesity there has risen by

less that 1 per cent. over the past decade. However, in the rest of the

country the increase is between 98 per cent. and 100 per cent. I

understand that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is

considering doing something similar at key stages 3 and 4.</div>

<a name="06051157000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am slightly disappointed that

the clause makes no mention of lunch boxes. I believe that all school

food should be good food. I know that it is difficult to legislate for

what people do in the privacy of their own homes, but I shall share

with the Committee perhaps the worst anecdote that I heard in all my

time working on the Children&#146;s Food Bill. I heard several

hair-raising stories, but the worst was that of a school dinner lady,

who asked another member of her staff to look into a child&#146;s

lunch box. The child had been sent to school with a can in their lunch

box, but it was a can of lager&#151;this was a six-year-old child at

a primary school. We need to give lunch boxes careful consideration. I

know that some head teachers are taking steps to ban pre-packed and

processed food. There is nothing wrong with a cheese sandwich and an

apple, but not all children bring that sort of food to

school.</div> <a name="06051157000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 428 and 429 seek to probe questions on the nutritional standards

of school meals available to pupils in academies and city technology

colleges. I want to know to what extent the clauses relating to school

food apply to children there. Ideally, we would like to see the

requirements for food and drink on school premises covering all

schools. Although they are categorised as independent schools, the

academies and technology colleges are publicly funded and should be

protected by the same legislation as other schools, particularly as

they are often intended to replace schools in deprived

areas.</div>

<a name="06051157000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051157000535"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I am

interested in what the hon. Lady has to say. One thing that I am trying

to grapple with is whether schools should permit children to leave the

premises during the day, for instance at lunch time, when they can buy

unhealthy food from the local shops. It is a difficult problem and I

have been to some schools that do not allow children to leave the

premises. What is the hon. Lady&#146;s

view?</div><a name="06051157000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000536"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> My instinct is that it is appropriate for head

teachers and governing bodies to make their own 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column815" />Column number: 816</div>choice. At the school in Coventry where I grew up, only sixth-formers

were allowed to leave the school premises. It is to do with keeping

children together, combating antisocial behaviour, ensuring child

safety on the roads and many other factors. Different schools will take

a different approach. For instance, some children might leave for lunch

and not come back. In other schools children will have lunch at home

because it is close by or because they have specific cultural needs.

Schools need to consider the local and cultural sensitivities, but my

instinct as a parent would be for my child to be kept on the school

premises&#151;for all sorts of reasons, not least the burger van that

the hon. Gentleman has at the back of his mind.</div>

<a name="06051157000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Poor nutrition, even in its

milder form, can have detrimental effects on cognitive development,

behaviour, concentration and school performance. Research shows that

people of all ages in low-income households have lower nutrient but

higher calorie intakes than those in richer houses. Including all

schools in the requirements would ensure that the food and drink

provided on school premises was not subject to undue influence from

outside parties such as school sponsors. The amendments are designed to

probe on that subject.</div>

<a name="06051157000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn briefly to what is

happening now. Ofsted inspectors are considering school meals and, with

the Food Standards Agency, visited primary and secondary schools in

three local authority areas. They found that the standard of school

meals had improved in a minority of schools, with primary schools

making more rapid progress than secondary schools. That comes back to

the point made by the hon. Gentleman; secondary school children have

more mobility, more flexibility and, being teenagers, more resistance

to doing the right thing, and they can use food as a means of

rebelling.</div> <a name="06051157000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although

primary school children are using the skills learned in the classroom

to make informed choices about healthy meals, secondary school students

do not always apply their knowledge when choosing meals. There is

limited choice in schools. I have seen for myself that if children are

given a choice&#151;perhaps pasta and sausage rolls or salad and an

apple&#151;they always choose what they like most, because it is

comforting. I wrestle with such issues myself as an adult; there is no

reason to expect a five-year-old to do any better than a

38-year-old.</div> <a name="06051157000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

be interested to hear the Under-Secretary&#146;s response to the

evidence that students do not have enough time to eat or enjoy the

social benefits of eating with others. There has been a move towards a

plastic tray culture and away from proper cutlery and plates. Lunch may

be the only time that some children sit down to eat with others in the

day. There is evidence that the lunch break is too short in some

secondary schools.</div> <a name="06051157000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

turn to amendment No. 430, which seeks to clarify whether the

provisions in part 6 apply to vending machines. I seek reassurances

from the Under-Secretary. The amendment might provide schools with an

opportunity to consider their contracts with vending machine companies.

Healthy eating messages should be reinforced across the whole

school&#151;in the tuck shop, in the breakfast club, at the vending

machines and through kitchen staff, so that the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column816" />Column number: 817</div>messages that children get about nutrition are consistent and mutually

reinforced. That is important. However, I am glad that the provisions

will not apply to the cakes brought into school for parents&#146;

cake sales; for me, those are one of the highlights of school

fêtes.</div> <a name="06051157000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment builds on the recommendation to remove fizzy drinks, crisps

and chocolates from school vending machines which was published in

February by the School Food Trust. The recommendation is in the middle

of its 12-week consultation period, but I hope that at the end of May,

when the time comes, the Under-Secretary will feel able to follow

it.</div> <a name="06051157000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Attempts to

improve school meals are likely to be undermined if children have

access to unhealthy foods at times other than lunch. Many of the foods

and drinks commonly stocked in vending machines have been shown to have

an impact on behaviour and concentration. There is evidence from

secondary schools of children using their dinner money to buy Coke,

crisps and chocolate bars at lunch time and nothing for

lunch.</div> <a name="06051157000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fizzy drinks

have a detrimental effect on concentration, behaviour and learning. A

survey by the Food Commission revealed that a single drink of Ribena or

Lucozade provides as much sugar as several packets of sweets. There is

a danger with sports drinks; schoolchildren require energy, but most

are not elite athletes training every day, and they do not take part in

very high-energy sports every day.</div>

<a name="06051157000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be grateful to hear

from the Under-Secretary about the lack of provision in the Bill to

support schools tied into long-term contracts with vending machine

suppliers providing unhealthy food and drink. All vending machines have

been taken out of schools in France, and, I believe, the United

States.</div> <a name="06051157000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 55

seeks to place a duty on governing bodies in all schools to promote

healthy food to children. Schools are more likely to be successful in

encouraging children to follow a healthy lifestyle if they adopt a

whole-school approach to improving health and well-being; that has

certainly been the case in Sandal Magna school in my constituency.

School messages need to be reflected in all aspects of school life,

including what is provided on the premises, in the science, food

technology and history curriculum, in extra-curricular activities and

in the social and physical environment. It is essential that

discussions on promoting healthy lifestyle messages involve not only

teachers and governors, but all members of the school

community&#151;support staff, caterers, parents and pupils. I should

also like Ofsted to consider the quality of school meals when

conducting inspections.</div>

<a name="06051157000494"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

pm</div><a name="06051157000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend the

Food Standards Agency for its work on this issue. Its traffic light

system for meals and food products has been taken up by

Sainsbury&#146;s, Asda and Waitrose, and I hope that Tesco will

follow suit. The system helps parents, outside the school, to make the

split-second supermarket choices that will help them feed their

families healthily.</div><a name="06051157000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

should like to mention the report, &#147;Tackling Child

Obesity&#151;First Steps&#148;, which is a joint National Audit 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column817" />Column number: 818</div>Office, Healthcare Commission and Audit Commission document that was

published in February. It considered what was effective in tackling

childhood obesity, and it found that school-based initiatives were the

one area in which there was evidence of effectiveness. They talked

about the effectiveness of nutrition education, physical activity

promotion, a reduction in sedentary behaviour, behavioural therapy,

teacher training, curriculum material and the modification of school

meals and tuck shops.</div>

<a name="06051157000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">They found that school-based

intervention was more effective than either family-based intervention

or the provision of exercise classes in schools. We must scotch the

myth that this issue is simply about exercise. It is about considering

the way in which the entire school works together and gets those

messages out to children. I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider

the amendment positive.</div>

<a name="06051157000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must get the food companies

out of our schools and classrooms. The provision before us is an

important step, but it does not tackle the issue of sponsorship by

multinational food companies of all sorts of things. In my

constituency, there is a McDonald&#146;s walking bus, which I am not

happy about, and I do not see why we should give such food companies

access to places where children are at their most eager to learn.

Exercise books, leaflets and websites all have one simple aim: to place

their products in front of children and disguise it as

philanthropy.</div>

hear what my hon. Friend is saying, and I wonder whether she is aware

of a parallel example in India. Alcohol advertising is banned, and

companies promote water using the alcohol brand. They are very

successful at promoting their brand while selling healthy

products.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000538"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> That sounds like an insidious promotion. If

multinational companies are serious about tackling child health issues,

they cannot do so just in this country. We must consider the

international actions of large food companies. They may say one thing

in this country, but if they do something else in other countries,

particularly in developing countries, we must consider that carefully,

too. There has been an explosion in obesity among certain sections of

the Indian population.</div>

<a name="06051157000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools exist to develop

children&#146;s minds and introduce them to the world around them,

but as Juvenal said in his satires, &#147;Mens sana in corpore

sano&#148;, or &#147;A healthy mind in a healthy body.&#148; I

was one of the five people who took Latin in Coventry in 1986. Catullus

was my favourite, I must say. We know that, sadly, for many of our most

disadvantaged children, the food that they eat in school is the only

food that they may get all day.</div>

<a name="06051157000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will ensure that all

schools, wherever they are and whatever their intake, provide healthy,

nutritious meals for their children. I hope that the Bill will be

remembered for improving the eating habits of a generation, and that we

will be remembered for changing the life chances of this generation and

those to come. Our children deserve nothing

less.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column818" />Column number: 819</div><a name="06051157000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051157000539"></a><b class="B">Mr.

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): I

congratulate the hon. Lady on a comprehensive and powerful advocacy of

her amendment. She and I went for a run earlier, and I do not think

that it would do either of us any favours if we were to comment on our

respective fitness, but it illustrated the importance of good health

and good food.</div>

<a name="06051157000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000540"></a>The

Chairman:</b> And amendments.</div>

<a name="06051157000069"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000541"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am delighted therefore, to speak to the

amendments that stand in my name and those of my hon. Friends. As the

hon. Lady said, schools meals matter, because they may be the only meal

that many children have during the day. They have the potential to be

nutritious and to contribute to childhood health. It is not only

schools meals that matter, but the type of school meals. Back on 27

February, the <i class="I">Daily Mirror</i> reported that the Bill could mean

free school meals for everyone. However, the Bill gives only those

local education authorities and governing bodies that wish to do so the

power to provide pupils with food and drink free of charge. Have the

Government made any estimate of how many schools are likely to do so?

The <i class="I">Daily Mirror </i>headline was misleading, I presume.</div>

<a name="06051157000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment would require the

Secretary of State to consult on the regulations and requirements for

school food and drink. Where regulations specify nutritional standards,

it is surely appropriate to take advice from appropriate bodies. The

hon. Lady mentioned a number of those bodies. I endorse what she said.

I, too, have met the Food Standards Agency to discuss this. It has a

genuine concern about the quality of food consumed by many young people

and the impact that has both on fitness and health more generally. We

know of the accounts of increasing childhood diabetes, and the many

other related conditions which are increasingly prevalent among younger

people. It is crucial that the advice of bodies such as health

organisations, nutritional organisations and others with useful

information and insight to bring to this matter is taken into account.

That is precisely what our amendment would deliver.</div>

<a name="06051157000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 270 to 272 are

probing amendments to ascertain precisely what the Government mean by

&#147;X&#148;. We suggest that &#147;X&#148; be replaced by

&#147;the contractor&#148; or &#147;contractor&#148;, but what

I am really interested in is the Government&#146;s view on that; what

do they perceive as the appropriate term to replace

&#147;X&#148;?</div>

<a name="06051157000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 269 refers to the

age of the pupil as the important issue in determining nutritional

requirements, rather than the somewhat paternalistic phrase that is

used:</div><a name="06051157000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;different classes

or descriptions of person&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051157000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are shades there of the

&#147;Lady Chatterley&#146;s Lover&#148;

trial&#151;&#147;different classes&#148; of people. I have in

mind people such as servants. I think &#147;different age

groups&#148; is a much more appropriate term. The amendment would

give us the opportunity to make the proper judgments that we need to

make about the different dietary requirements of children of different

ages as those change over time, as all parents

know.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column819" />Column number: 820</div><a name="06051157000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051157000542"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I wondered whether the reason

behind the Bill&#146;s description, clumsy at it is, was to include

different religious groups, for example, who may have distinct dietary

requirements. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will respond to that later.

It occurs to me that the description in the amendment might be more

prescriptive and therefore preclude such

groups.</div><a name="06051157000075"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000543"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Yes, it may be appropriate on that basis to add

&#147;descriptions&#148; or some other similar word, and we will

hear what the Government have to say on that. However, it seems to me

that &#147;classes of person&#148; is an inappropriate way of

describing even the groups that the hon. Lady refers to. A phrase such

as &#147;different ages and groups&#148; might be a more

appropriate term, so I do not argue that our amendment is perfect, but

I hope that it will at least tease out from the Government

consideration of the way they describe those categories. I am mindful

of the sensible remark the hon. Lady makes.</div>

<a name="06051157000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case made for amendment No.

428 by the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) is a strong one. It

is hard to understand why different requirements should pertain in

relation to this matter in the case of the governing bodies of

academies, city technology colleges, city colleges for the technology

of the arts and other specialist schools. I do not understand why

anyone would want to create difference between them, but, again, the

Government might have a logical explanation for that. However, there

is, at least at face value, some force to the hon. Lady&#146;s

argument that standards should be the same throughout.</div>

<a name="06051157000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">To repeat what I said at the

outset, this is an important part of the Bill. We are all conscious of

the fact that this matter has been driven into the public domain by the

work of Jamie Oliver. That is the second time he has been mentioned in

this Committee. He must be desperately pleased; I bet he is at home

reading <i class="I">Hansard </i>by the day to discover how often he is mentioned

in the Committee. The publicity that he has given this important matter

is valuable. It has had the effect of elevating it in the

considerations of all politicians, including those in the Government.

So I am disturbed that he has recently said that he has gone through

three Secretaries of State&#151;perhaps as many as he has had hot

dinners, one might say&#151;without seeing much progress. That is a

worrying report from

him.</div><a name="06051157000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051157000544"></a><b class="B">Ms

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): Is it not

true that many local authorities in the land have been advancing that

agenda for some time? With Government co-operation, Hull city council

has done a great job in introducing healthy school meals free of charge

for all primary school children. Should not that action of a Labour

council be applauded?</div>

<a name="06051157000079"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000545"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Yes, the hon. Lady is right. There are some local

education authorities that run very good school meal services. The

truth, however, as I think she would acknowledge, is that it is pretty

patchy. Different regimes prevail in different parts of the country

regarding what is provided, whether a hot meal is available, where it

is provided from, and the other circumstances that might pertain.

Nutritional standards also vary from one place to another.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column820" />Column number: 821</div><a name="06051157000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the concern about

vending machines that the hon. Member for Wakefield expressed when she

was speaking on her amendments. I do not want to see any vending

machines at all that sell crisps, chocolate or pop in schools. It is a

monstrous idea that one should be promoting nutritious food, yet as

children walk out of a dining hall they are confronted with the

opportunity to purchase food that is fundamentally unhealthy. I

understand that that is even the case in some primary schools; perhaps

the Under-Secretary will confirm the position. The idea of nine, 10 or

11-year-olds being subjected to that is unacceptable, and I support the

hon. Lady&#146;s

views.</div><a name="06051157000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for

McDonald&#146;s hamburgers having a handle on it, I believe that they

are the unacceptable face of capitalism, with all their brutal

ubiquity, and I am in agreement with the hon. Lady on that as well. We

need a cross-party consensus on delivering the best possible school

meals for all our children&#151;meals that encourage good health,

good diet and the kind of fitness for which the hon. Lady and I, as we

proved earlier, can only

yearn.</div><a name="06051157000082"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000546"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> This may be the only part of the Bill on which we

can guarantee a complete cross-party consensus, and the Liberal

Democrats thoroughly welcome these clauses. I congratulate the hon.

Member for Wakefield, who covered most aspects that I wanted to

address. I shall not repeat them, but, of the many excellent points

that she made, I should like to highlight the need to take a holistic

view. The point is not just one of diet and exercise. As the hon. Lady

mentioned yesterday, it is also about making sure that young people

learn the skill of cooking for themselves, learn the differences

between kinds of foods, and are able to apply that knowledge at a later

stage. They must also be able to exercise choice. If we enable people

to move in and out of school at 16, we need to make sure that they are

equipped with the skills and knowledge to make healthy decisions on

their lifestyles.</div><a name="06051157000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

strongly endorse amendment No. 428. Academies are going to be placed in

some of the most deprived areas of the country, so they are more likely

to have a large number of young people taking free school meals, and it

is particularly important that the regulations apply. My party has not

received the draft regulations, whereas in previous sittings we have

received copies&#151;albeit barely in time to be able to read them.

It is possible that they were simply not sent to our offices, but will

the Under-Secretary confirm whether the regulations have yet been

drafted or will appear later, and whether they will be made available

before the Report

stage?</div><a name="06051157000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

amendments tabled by the Conservatives, will the Under-Secretary

indicate whether the Government might encourage local authorities to

work with local traders in particular, and might also encourage locally

based partnerships between the local authority, schools and local

organisations, rather than simply encouraging multinationals to come

in?</div><a name="06051157000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) that the

words of the Bill highlighted in amendment No. 269 are clumsy. It is

not clear what they mean. It is vital that sensitivity and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column821" />Column number: 822</div>flexibility are allowed, particularly in multiracial areas, multi-ethnic

areas and multi-religious areas. We must ensure that schools have

enough money and flexibility to provide food that meets the dietary

requirements of the various religions. However, it is not clear whether

the amendment would make it any

easier.</div>

<a name="06051157000495"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

pm</div><a name="06051157000086"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000547"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Before the hon. Lady rushes on from what she is

saying about local provision, does she agree that Jamie Oliver has

highlighted the importance of fresh food? Fresh locally produced food

with a short food chain from the producer to the school would support

local businesses and local primary producers. The Bill could give rise

to an ideal

partnership.</div><a name="06051157000087"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000548"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Absolutely. I strongly endorse what the hon.

Gentleman says. Indeed, the Liberal Democrats, working with Labour,

have pushed forward the &#147;Hungry for Success&#148; programme in

Scotland. Jamie Oliver has highlighted it, and he has congratulated

people on running such partnerships. It demonstrates what can be done

with the right investment if one concentrates on nutritional standards

in the curriculum and ensures that young people are taught about the

various aspects of diet.</div>

<a name="06051157000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">One difficulty with vending

machines is the amount of money that schools are still making from

them. The hon. Member for Wakefield highlighted the problems that

schools sometimes have with getting out of long-term contracts. If we

want schools to move away from providing the unhealthy options that are

sold from vending machines, we should support them so that they can

move to another contract, although that may be expensive.</div>

<a name="06051157000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools now focus more on being

at the centre of the community and many are used by adult groups, adult

education and the voluntary sector over the weekends and in the

evenings. We need to be aware of that pressure on schools. However, I

see no reason why school vending machines should not offer healthy

options. It may not be practical to sell apples from vending machines,

but all sorts of healthy bars and drinks can be provided that would be

suitable for community use at the weekends and in the evenings, as well

as for young people. I welcome the

provisions.</div>

<a name="06051157000090"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000549"></a>The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Phil

Hope):</b> We have had a good debate on this important clause,

which establishes the provision for new and tougher nutritional

standards for food and drink served in maintained schools in England.

As we heard, it will establish regulation-making powers to ensure that

children have access throughout the day to food and drink of a high

nutritional standard and will replace the existing standards for school

lunches, which were introduced in 2001. The hon. Member for Brent, East

(Sarah Teather) was right to say that there is all-party consensus in

Committee on this important matter.</div>

<a name="06051157000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my hon. Friend the

Member for Wakefield for her ongoing interest and her commitment to

improving children&#146;s health. Her private Member&#146;s Bill,

the Children&#146;s Food Bill, has driven forward the agenda, raised

its profile and gained public support. I 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column822" />Column number: 823</div>am glad that she is a member of the Committee, and I thank her for

presenting her case so forcefully and eloquently. We have similar

goals, although our methods of achieving them may differ in detail. I

hope that my explanation of how we intend going about things will meet

the many concerns and issues that she raised.</div>

<a name="06051157000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a wider public

interest in what we are debating. It is not only Jamie

Oliver&#151;there we are; a third mention&#151;who is taking an

interest in the health of our schoolchildren, although his unique

position helps him to inspire pupils to consider their diet and to make

the right choices. I was pleased to be reminded by my hon. Friend the

Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) that the matter has been

of concern to local authorities, teachers and schools for many years.

Patchy though it has been, we want to apply best practice throughout

the country. I acknowledge the work of authorities such as Sheffield,

which have led the way. Long before the current high-profile

initiatives began, we were working with the Department of Health, the

Food Standards Agency and healthy schools teams on a range of

activities supporting healthier eating and drinking throughout the

school day.</div> <a name="06051157000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 263, it would serve no useful purpose to consult further

on the proposed standards for school food and drink. There is no

requirement in England to consult on the details of secondary

legislation. We have already consulted widely on the detailed proposals

for school lunch standards. We have sought the views of many different

key stakeholders&#151;the hon. Gentleman for South Holland and The

Deepings identified many of them&#151;on similar proposals for school

food served at other times of the day. Proposals for lunch standards

made by the school meals review panel were subject to a full, 12-week

public consultation, with responses from local authorities, schools,

health sector charities, the food industry, trade unions and caterers.

The proposals are still available on our DFES

website.</div><a name="06051157000094"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000550"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am impressed by the list of people that the hon.

Gentleman has consulted and I take his point. I wonder whether he has

taken into account the important issue of fair trade in this respect.

Has consultation included proper consideration of a fair trade agenda

and also proper consideration of those who advocate British produce,

where local supply can guarantee the kind of quality that we all spoke

about?</div>

<a name="06051157000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000551"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> Clearly the priority is nutritional health and

nutritional standards. I am sure that where fair trade products meet

those nutritional standards, there is clearly value in adopting those

products. I was reminded by my hon. Friend the Minister for Schools,

who has recently moved from the Department of the Environment, Food and

Rural Affairs, that DEFRA recently undertook a public procurement

initiative.</div>

<a name="06051157000096"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000552"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jim Knight):</b> Public sector

procurement.</div>

<a name="06051157000097"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000553"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> It is a public sector procurement initiative as part

of the sustainable foods and farming strategy 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column823" />Column number: 824</div>established by the Government. In my hon. Friend&#146;s new post, he

will almost have to talk to himself about how we might carry on

promoting the use of local fresh produce and of local producers of food

to be served in our schools, which is an important

consideration.</div> <a name="06051157000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

terms of consultation, we have held many detailed discussions with a

variety of stakeholders on many of the concerns that they have raised.

There has been plenty of opportunity for all interested parties to

comment on those. As a result of those discussions, we are consulting

on the new regulations, and when the consultation is complete, we will

publish the draft standards and regulations.</div>

<a name="06051157000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">A minor technical point is that

the position is slightly different in Wales. The Welsh Assembly

established a food in schools working group last year. The group has

considered how to improve nutrition in schools, and later this year

there will be a public consultation on its report. The Assembly

Government will then take account of the report and consultation in

making regulations. I am told that the Standing Orders of the National

Assembly require Welsh Assembly Ministers to prepare regulatory

appraisals of the cost and benefits of draft Assembly regulations.

Where costs are likely to be significant, there must be consultation

with business and other organisations with an interest in the draft

instrument and appraisals.

</div><a name="06051157000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 269

deals with the scope of the clause and suggests that it should be

narrowed. I hear the comments that hon. Members made about the wording.

Let me be clear: it does allow for regulations to set different

requirements in connection with food and drink provided by or to

different classes or descriptions of person. This is not about social

class in the way that the hon. Member for South Holland and Deepings

suggested; it is just a generic term to imply that there are groupings.

I am sorry if the wording jarred with him, but that is what it means in

practice. It encompasses the different age groups suggested in his

amendment, but gives wider flexibility.</div>

<a name="06051157000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Brent, East

made her point about sensitivity to different cultural norms very well.

The clause gives wider flexibility for school standards to be relaxed,

or indeed tightened, if the Secretary of State considers that

necessary.</div>

<a name="06051157000102"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000554"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Will the Under-Secretary consider going away again

and looking at a phrase like groups, ages and descriptions, which might

give him the breadth that he needs but will not be misinterpreted by

others?

</div><a name="06051157000103"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000555"></a>Phil

Hope:</b> I am happy to take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

concerns into account. We think that the measures we are talking about,

in addition to those mentioned by the hon. Member for Brent, East, will

result in us finding that children&#146;s dietary research offers new

insights into what might be best done in schools, and we therefore

might want to revise our standards. We might discover that nutritional

deficiencies are identified as having an impact on some medical

symptoms.</div><a name="06051157000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 270, 271 and 272 suggest narrowing the scope of subsection (6) to

cover only contractors. I understand that they are probing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column824" />Column number: 825</div>amendments to discover why we used the letter &#145;X&#146;. We want

to ensure that all food and drink provided to children at school by any

person, not just by those defined as contractors, must comply with the

requirements and regulations. We want the messages that we give to

children to be consistent, and we therefore believe that the same

standards must apply equally to all food providers, whether they are

the local authority, the governing body, a contractor or any other

person. I hope that that explains why we have used that

wording.</div><a name="06051157000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will relax

standards to exempt schools from the requirement to follow them when

food and drink is provided for parties or celebrations to mark

religious or cultural occasions, when parents bring in a birthday cake

and so on. We want such exemptions because we want common sense on the

matter.</div><a name="06051157000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments

Nos. 428 and 429, yes, the requirements of the clause extend only to

local authority maintained schools and will therefore not automatically

apply to academies. However, the point was made that academies serve

disadvantaged areas, where a high proportion of pupils are entitled to

free school meals, so the requirement to meet nutritional standards

will be made through amendments to their funding arrangements. CTCs

were also mentioned. Many CTCs have healthy eating rewards. Most are in

the process of converting to academy status or have already done so,

and will therefore be expected to comply through their funding

agreements.</div><a name="06051157000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 430, it is not necessary to state explicitly that

references to food and drink also include that sold in vending or

similar machines. The title of the clause is &#147;Provision of food

and drink on school premises etc&#148;, and it is intended to cover

all food and drink provided on school premises, regardless of how it is

provided. It therefore includes food and drink sold from vending

machines and tuck shops, or by any other method. On the detailed point

about contracts for vending machines&#151;the hon. Member for Brent,

East suggested that there are things that we need to consider&#151;we

are developing further information to assist with the variation of such

costs. We will make that available to schools and local authorities to

overcome the dilemmas that might

exist.</div><a name="06051157000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked how

regulations will set out specific, detailed requirements on the

provision of food and drink at lunch time and other times. The school

meals review panel commented on the importance of ensuring a

whole-school approach to healthy eating, which as my hon. Friend the

Member for Wakefield said, is very important. Placing an additional

duty on governors, as new clause 55 suggests, is not the best way

forward. Under current legislation, whichever body holds the budget for

school meals has a duty to ensure that nutritional standards are met.

If that budget has been delegated to school level, the governors become

responsible. We do not plan to change that arrangement.</div>

<a name="06051157000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Food Standards Agency has

published guidance on how the nutritional standards can practically be

achieved and how to develop approaches to providing children with

access to healthier food across the whole school day. Last year, the

National Governors Council 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column825" />Column number: 826</div>published &#147;Food Policy in Schools&#148;, a step-by-step guide

to adopting a strategic approach. We have also published guidance that

is not specifically school-related. It would not be sensible or

realistic to expect schools to be

Members, including my hon. Friend, made the point about the time

available at lunch time to eat a nutritious meal. The length of school

lunch times will remain a decision to be taken at a local level by head

teachers and school governors, but the School Food Trust will issue

guidance giving examples of good practice to help implement new

standards. It will address issues related to school

for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) made an intervention

about pupils going out of school at lunch time. I wish to make clear

the Government&#146;s view and support that of my hon. Friend the

Member for Wakefield. Wherever possible, we want schools to keep pupils

on site during the lunch hour and provide them with supervision and a

range of appropriate clubs, activities and sports. That approach will

ensure that pupils are well nourished and will have a better school

day. As it will minimise any friction with the community it will have

wider benefits too. I know that that approach creates challenges for

some schools, but it is one that we would

support.</div><a name="06051157000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, all

maintained schools will be required to achieve healthy school status by

2009, including healthy eating, using a whole-school approach and

involving the whole school community. There is a growing body of

healthy school initiatives, enough of which are statutory to ensure

that governors take their responsibility for healthy living in schools

seriously. I hope that I have addressed all the issues raised by hon.

Members and that they will not press their

amendments.</div><a name="06051157000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000556"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The communal consumption of food is important in

all cultures, including ours: it involves everything from the sacrament

to every feast and festival. School meals are important in that

respect. The Minister has been persuasive in his account of what the

Government are doing, and we urge them to do ever more. I certainly

urge them to take the comments of Conservative Members and of the hon.

Members for Wakefield and for Brent, East into account. They

demonstrate a collective view of the importance of this part of the

Bill. I am reassured to a degree and I certainly will not press my

amendments.</div><a name="06051157000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000557"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> I am delighted that there is finally an outbreak

of consensus in the Committee. I should like to bring to hon.

Members&#146; attention some of the realities on the ground in Hull.

We heard from the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings that

he supports what is happening there, with 24,000 primary school pupils

in the city getting free school meals. I wonder whether he is in

agreement with the Conservative group leader, John Fareham, who told

the <i class="I">Hull Daily Mail </i>on 24 March that Tories oppose universal

free school meals because</div>

<a name="06051157000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it perpetuates a culture of state

reliance.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column826" />Column number: 827</div><a name="06051157000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether the hon. Member

for Brent, East agrees with the Liberal Democrat leader, Carl Minns,

who before the election said that they would be asking parents to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000558"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000559"></a>Mary

Creagh:</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. Cook. I was responding

to the debate in its broadest sense, but I will move on and address my

comments to the Minister. I share his approach on amendment No. 263. I

agree that the consultation on these matters has been exhaustive. The

fact that hundreds of thousands of parents across the country have

signed up to the feed me better campaign is a demonstration that this

is one of the parts of Government policy that really has reached the

parts that other parts do not reach, to paraphrase a well-known alcohol

advert.</div> <a name="06051157000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also

relieved to hear that treats such as cakes, birthday food and

celebration food will be exempt from the regulations. As I have said

repeatedly, we have to have a sensible approach on this. I agree that

this is the middle way. I was relieved to hear what myhon.

Friend had to say about vending machines and tuck shops and I take on

board his comments about governors. I am also relieved to hear that he

will be advising schools on how to transfer to healthier school meals.

One of the problems is that when there is a big bang, televisual

approach, children stop taking the meals because, for example, they do

not like carrots and leeks, and it is hard for the school to make its

school meals financially viable. We need to think about how we make

that transition.</div> <a name="06051157000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

also glad to hear that guidance will be issued on lunch times and

making the lunch period last a full hour. I am grateful that there will

be a range of clubs and activities, but I also recommend the boredom of

the lunch hour. Children have far too little experience of the aching

boredom of the school lunch hour, which helps them find their own

creativity and internal resources. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): Clause 74

is a gem of a clause, which has not received the full recognition that

it deserves. Its importance lies in its removal of the duty on local

authorities and governing bodies to charge for food and drink provided

by them, replacing that with a power to charge instead. That is

important because local authorities and governing bodies that want to

do so are enabled to provide all or some of the meals that they provide

free of charge. If supported locally, that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column827" />Column number: 828</div>could revolutionise school meals, probably more so than Jamie Oliver has

done.</div><a name="06051157000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of us

visited Sweden earlier in the year and saw some excellent examples of a

free school meals service providing very good quality food. What was

excellent about the scheme was that teachers sat down with the pupils

at lunchtime and ate alongside them. I wish we could introduce that in

this country. That takes up the point that my hon. Friend the Member

Hope:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing

attention to this important clause, the significance of which, as she

says, could well have been overlooked. She need not have gone as far as

Sweden to find examples of schools taking such steps forward. Hull city

council used its powers under the power to innovate to introduce a

pilot scheme to offer free lunches to all primary school children,

which turned out to be very successful. On the basis of such

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000564"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> Amendment No. 570 concerns the adjustments to be

made for children with educational needs or disabled

children.</div><a name="06051157000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most

people would accept that schools should be required to have positive

behaviour management strategies to improve school discipline. However,

as noted by the Government in their special educational needs policy

document &#147;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#148;, too many

vulnerable children with special educational needs and disabilities,

including those unfortunate enough to benefit from a statement of

special educational needs, are either permanently or temporarily

excluded from school. In fact, they represent two thirds of the number

of exclusions nationally, when they represent less than 20 per cent. of

the school

population.</div><a name="06051157000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

example, recent statistics from the Office for National Statistics and

the Department of Health, published in August 2005, show that 27 per

cent. of all children with the autistic spectrum disorder are excluded

from school at any one time. If 27 per cent. of our generic school

population were excluded there would be a public outcry. Yet a very

vulnerable group of children with special needs face this prospect day

in and day out.</div><a name="06051157000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the

need to improve discipline in schools, I am concerned that we may well

be coming into conflict with the current policy of inclusion, which

Lord Adonis advised the Education and Skills Committee was the will of

Parliament. Will the Minister clarify what he believes Lord Adonis

meant? I ask that because my experience as a constituency MP tells me

that inclusion in a mainstream school is often against the express wish

of the parents. I describe myself as a pro-inclusionist in that I

believe that children who want to be and can be educated in a

mainstream school should be, but it is strange to describe the policy

of inclusion as the will of Parliament rather than as the will of the

Government of the day, particularly when &#147;Removing Barriers to

Achievement&#148; is a Government document that drives the policy of

inclusion.</div><a name="06051157000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving

that aside, we need to consider seriously whether, as a direct

consequence of the clause without the amendment, we may well increase

the number of children with special educational needs and disabilities

who, instead of being included, are excluded from

school.</div><a name="06051157000139"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000565"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I must point out to the hon. Lady that

the clause is about discipline rather than

inclusion.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column829" />Column number: 830</div><a name="06051157000140"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000566"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I apologise, Mr. Cook. Thank you for your

guidance.</div><a name="06051157000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must

ensure that any behaviour policies written by schools reflect the

individual needs of the child and their ability to conform to our

informed aspirations for socially acceptable behaviour. They may be

unable to understand, share or relate to those aspirations. At our

previous sitting, I mentioned a school in Southwark where 62.2 per

cent. of the children have special needs. What kind of behaviour or

discipline policy will a school have to address the needs of children

who do not have special needs and of children who

do?</div><a name="06051157000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worrying

that Sir Alan Steer, whose inquiry into behaviour management for

children informs the Bill, was not asked by the Government specifically

to investigate children with special educational needs. In fact, he was

specifically asked not to investigate children with special educational

needs and the impact that their behaviour may have on the efficient

education of their peers and school

discipline.</div><a name="06051157000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

amendment No. 571, we ask for the local authority as well as the

parents to be given 24 hours&#146; notice that the detention of a

pupil subject to a statement of special educational needs is due to

take place and for such notice to be appended to the pupil&#146;s

annual review report. It is important to note that many pupils subject

to a statement of special educational needs require transportation to

school and the local authority is responsible for making such

arrangements. In fact, some children with special educational needs,

particularly disabled children, have quite specific transport needs.

Therefore it seems perfectly reasonable that, as well as parents, the

local authority should be given appropriate notice so that it can make

alternative arrangements to meet its responsibilities to transport the

pupil to their home and to school after the detention

period.</div><a name="06051157000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also

important for such notifications to be appended to the pupil&#146;s

annual review report to reflect properly the fact that they have

experienced a number of penalties as a consequence of their behaviour.

Appended notifications could inform and prompt amendments to the

statement of special educational needs that would accurately reflect

those difficulties and the triggers for them&#151;that is, what

started the behavioural problem in the first place&#151;and as such

could well prevent further escalation of behavioural problems and

future

exclusions.</div><a name="06051157000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 573 relates to staff in the school having accredited training in

the use of physical restraint of children and young people. I am

concerned that if we reinforce the right or the power of the teaching

profession to use force, people could develop an expectation that it is

an acceptable practice physically to restrain or to use force on a

pupil when the teaching staff have neither the skills nor the desire to

do so. Moreover, the use of physical restraint or force on a pupil can

lead to further violence, rather than preventing it, which is the

desired effect.</div><a name="06051157000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want

to inform the Minister of a phone call that I received this morning

about a six-year-old girl who was this morning excluded from school. It

is a typical example of what happens to many special needs children

when they are restrained. It is worth noting that staff in special

schools are quite often trained in the restraint of disabled and

special needs children. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column830" />Column number: 831</div>The little girl to whom I am referring is quite high on the autistic

continuum and is in a mainstream school. She has a fear of water. I am

sure that the Minister will hear more about the case. The girl needed

to have her hands washed. Probably they were filthy and the teacher

felt that it was important to wash them. Perhaps she was about to eat.

I do not know the full details. The teacher held the child&#146;s

hands under the tap to wash them. The child did all that she had

available to her to defend herself and bit the teacher. She was

immediately excluded from

school.</div><a name="06051157000497"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

pm</div><a name="06051157000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have worked

as a nurse and, when I was told that story on the telephone this

morning, I thought of the many times that I had been bitten by

children, especially when conducting lumbar puncture procedures or

others that we knew would hurt a child, but which had to be carried

out. I cannot imagine what would have happened if, after those

procedures I had been bitten and had said, &#147;Right, that child is

excluded from the ward.&#148; It is a strange way to behave towards

children with special educational needs. Such a condition is an

illness.</div><a name="06051157000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We rightly

train police officers in the restraint of offenders, many of whom sadly

are young, yet we want to emphasise the right to use force while not

equipping our hard-pressed teaching professionals with basic skills to

enable them appropriately and safely to restrain pupils and ensure that

neither they nor staff members are caused undue injury. Moreover, it is

much more likely that, by using reasonable restraint or force,

appropriately trained teaching professionals are less likely to be

subject to an accusation of having used unreasonable force of a

criminal nature in the

future.</div><a name="06051157000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of

children with special educational needs and physical disabilities in

our schools require highly specialist behaviour management techniques

regarding restraint or force. As I said, all staff in special schools

are trained in that way. Along with designated powers, the Government

have ensured that the training of teaching staff in the use of force is

the subject of legislation to keep both pupils and staff safe. The

Minister may wish to consider ensuring that during initial teacher

training in the future all prospective teachers are provided with

accredited restraint and behaviour management skills such as team

teach, which has proved to be so successful in the restraint of

children with special

needs.</div><a name="06051157000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

574 concerns parenting orders. We all accept that we must address

antisocial behaviour and the need to exclude pupils. I do not object in

principle to parenting contracts or orders, with the proviso that the

parents do not present special educational needs at a level that

prevents them from engaging meaningfully in the contract or from

understanding the nature of the order. I am sure that all members of

the Committee are aware that parents of many children with special

educational needs also have special educational needs themselves. As

the Committee can probably tell, I am a mother of a child with special

needs. I am also dyslexic. I find it difficult to read from speaking

notes because I cannot sequence words. I will stumble 20 or 30 times

while reading from notes. It is much better for me to speak without

them.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column831" />Column number: 832</div><a name="06051157000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many parents have more complex

special needs than I do. They cannot understand sequencing or the

written word. Parenting orders must be understood by the parents to

whom they are issued. I remind the Government that two thirds of

children who are excluded from school have special educational needs

and that 27 per cent. of them are autistic. Many parents are under

considerable stress as they act as carers and advocates for their

disabled children.</div><a name="06051157000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">To

introduce measures that pass the responsibility for the excluded

special needs child to the parent rather than considering first whether

the child&#146;s behaviour may be a direct consequence of having

failed to receive the appropriate education in a suitable environment

must not be disregarded, or we could be responsible for creating social

injustices rather than addressing the needs of the child. We have

recently learned about the tragic consequences of a young mother who

was depressed and under pressure, and who took her life and that of her

autistic child, so let us consider whether, in our need to deal with

exclusion and poor behaviour, we could in haste punish the wrong

parents and further burden good, caring parents who are struggling to

meet the needs of their disabled children through unfair parenting

contracts and orders. The fact that a child&#146;s special

educational needs and disabilities might have led to their exclusion

rather than poor parenting must be reflected in the

Bill.</div><a name="06051157000153"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000567"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire

(Mrs. Dorries) spoke with passion and compassion in support of her

amendments, but also gave a thorough analysis of some issues associated

with this part of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051157000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although my hon.

Friend made a persuasive case, my first instinct was to resist her

amendments, because I fully appreciate that the Government are

approaching the matter against a sorry history of increasing disruption

and even violence in schools, which is doing immeasurable damage to

pupils&#146; quality of life, the morale of teachers and all

associated with school families. Of course, that is not the common

experience of every school in the country, but it is all too frequently

the experience of schools, some of which are in the most difficult

areas, dealing with the most challenging pupils. Given all that, I am

extremely sympathetic to the Government&#146;s conversion&#151;it

is perhaps a late conversion, but let us not be churlish&#151;to the

cause of better school

discipline.</div><a name="06051157000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

my hon. Friend made a compelling case in respect of special needs

pupils. It seems to be common sense&#151;I hope the Minister will not

dispute this&#151;to take a look at the impact of the changes on

special needs children in particular. Children with physical special

needs or disabilities that might affect their behaviour, and children

with emotional or behavioural difficulties&#151;which will,

implicitly, affect their behaviour&#151;will require very different

regimes from other children, as my hon. Friend pointed out. Good

teachers know that, of course, and good practice would, by its very

nature, take that into account, but it does not seem unreasonable to

suggest that that might form part of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051157000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

went on to talk about the repercussions of her argument for things such

as school transport&#151;for example, she talked about the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column832" />Column number: 833</div>effect of detention on arrangements to get very vulnerable children to

and from school, and again made a compelling case on that point. She

spoke about the training and preparation of staff dealing with those

difficult

situations.</div><a name="06051157000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expect

that my hon. Friend tabled the amendments to probe the

Minister&#151;it is not for me to make that judgment, but that is

probably her intention&#151;and she has done the Committee a service.

It is important that all the points that she made and that I amplified

are taken into account. Certainly, I was initially sceptical about the

amendments, but there is a case to answer, and we look forward to the

Minister answering it with his usual

accomplishment.</div><a name="06051157000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051157000568"></a><b class="B">Annette

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I, too, broadly

support the amendments. The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire made some

very good points, and I share her concern about the enormous

proportion&#151;60 per cent., I believe&#151;of pupils with special

needs who are subject to secondary exclusions, or discipline, in other

words. As she said,27 per cent. of children with autism have

been excluded, with 23 per cent. being excluded more than once. That

figure really does tell a

story.</div><a name="06051157000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in

some ways I was heartened by reading the draft regulations,

&#147;Values into principles&#148;, which we were supplied with

just the other day. There are some excellent sections in that document.

I agree with those in which a range of vulnerable pupils are

identified. We shall shortly come to some rather broader amendments on

the subject, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East, and

me. For example, they deal with picking up looked-after children, which

we think falls into the category of circumstances of that

sort.</div><a name="06051157000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we get to

the right point, I shall talk about young carers, who should be

mentioned in the regulations. The general principle that vulnerable

pupils should be supported would therefore become part of the behaviour

policy, and I endorse that. It would not lead to a lack of discipline,

but would be an appropriate reaction to behavioural problems. That is

the key, because bad behaviour must not be ignored, and the reaction to

it is all important. That, I hope, is what we are all

saying.</div><a name="06051157000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the

issue is dealt with in the draft regulations, there is a compelling

case for including provisions in the Bill. What happened in the past is

on the record, but the easy solution for some schools, as we are all

aware, is to exclude children, rather than address the issues. That

could be because staff have not received adequate resources or

training, or because of all sorts of other reasons, but I would rather

that there was something in the Bill to strengthen the

provisions.</div> <a name="06051157000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a

further question about an issue that rather worries me. This is the

heading for this group of clauses:</div>

<a name="06051157000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Certain schools

required to have behaviour

policy&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, why

should only certain schools be required to have a policy? There should

be no school without a behaviour policy in this day and age. Can I be

assured, therefore, that the draft regulations, which I have taken 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column833" />Column number: 834</div>the trouble to praise, will apply to academies and other schools that

are not listed in the

clause?</div><a name="06051157000164"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000569"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> It is a pleasure to take the baton back from my

hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. While mentioning him, I should also

congratulate him on the award of the world skills games to

London.</div><a name="06051157000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addressing

the amendments, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire

for the passion and experience that she brings to bear on these issues.

Throughout the Committee&#146;s discussions, she has wanted to raise

her concerns about children with special educational needs, and I pay

tribute to her for her work on the issue. Although all members of the

Committee share her concerns, it falls to me to demonstrate to her

satisfaction, and that of the rest of us, that the Bill satisfies her

requirement to meet the needs of such

children.</div><a name="06051157000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 570, the principles underlying a school&#146;s behaviour policy

must cover the full range of relevant issues, including how the policy

will apply to pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.

However, it makes no sense to set out all that detail in primary

legislation, not least because that would make it difficult to adjust

to changing circumstances. Clause 75 therefore requires governing

bodies to have regard to statutory guidance when setting principles and

giving guidance to the head.</div>

<a name="06051157000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members have seen the

illustrative guidance linked to clause 75, which makes it clear that

the governing body should consider including principles relating to

support for more vulnerable pupils, including those with special

educational needs and disabilities, as well as migrant, refugee and

looked-after children, whom the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North

Poole (Annette Brooke) mentioned. That would, of course, include

ensuring that the school&#146;s behaviour policy took account of all

its pupils&#146; needs and capabilities from its

inception.</div><a name="06051157000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire would seek

adjustments once the policy had been established, but it would be

better to have the provisions set out from the start so that they could

inform thinking. The guidance that the Committee has seen is purely

illustrative. I can assure the hon. Lady that my officials and I will

look at the text again in the light of her concerns to see whether we

need to strengthen it further to deal with the needs of vulnerable

pupils.</div> <a name="06051157000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 571, clause 78 makes it clear that for a penalty to be reasonable,

and therefore lawful, school staff must take account of a

pupil&#146;s special educational needs in deciding whether to impose

a penalty and what penalty to impose, including detention. The hon.

Lady rightly mentioned transport for special educational needs pupils,

and clause 78 requires school staff, in imposing any disciplinary

penalty, including detention, to take account of any special

circumstances affecting a pupil. That certainly includes transport

arrangements.</div><a name="06051157000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that that gives the hon. Lady some satisfaction. It is a solid

statutory safeguard against the unreasonable imposition of detention on

a pupil with special educational

needs.</div>



<div class="Column"><a name="Column834" />Column number: 835</div><a name="06051157000498"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

pm</div><a name="06051157000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also

right and proper for parents to receive24 hours&#146;

notice of detention to avoid the obvious concerns about their

child&#146;s whereabouts and safety. However, given what I have said

about transport, adding a requirement to notify the local authority as

well crosses the line between practical necessity and bureaucracy. I am

not convinced that such notifications would be of sufficient practical

value to the local authority, the school, the parents or, most

importantly, the

child.</div><a name="06051157000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same

applies to appending such notifications to the annual review report. If

the behaviour of a particular child is an issue, that must inevitably

be discussed as part of the annual review. Detention records, which

schools normally keep as a matter of course, might be relevant

evidence, but I am not convinced that extra pieces of paper would

necessarily help.</div> <a name="06051157000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

turn to amendment No. 573, which I assure the hon. Lady is also

unnecessary. Clause 80 does not give school staff carte blanche to use

force. Subsection (1) makes it clear that they have power to use

only</div><a name="06051157000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such force as is

reasonable in the

circumstances&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">They

cannot use unreasonable force.</div>

<a name="06051157000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Force should be used as a last

resort. We shall discuss that during debate on the relevant clause, but

clause 80 means what it says. In deciding whether to use force and what

sort of force to use, school staff will have to take account of all the

relevant circumstances. Those will certainly include a pupil&#146;s

special educational needs or

disability.</div><a name="06051157000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

addition, the Department already provides detailed guidance on the use

of force in schools, including guidance specific to pupils with special

educational needs and disabilities. We shall discuss that when we come

to amendment No. 572, and we will review the guidance in the light of

debates on the Bill with a view to making further

improvements.</div><a name="06051157000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 574, I do not see parenting contracts as a substitute for

identifying and making appropriate provision or reasonable adjustments

for pupils with special educational needs or disabilities, although

such pupils can benefit as much as others from parenting contracts and

their parents might well need support and improvement in their

parenting skills.</div>

<a name="06051157000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the amendment is

unnecessary. Safeguards are already in place for children with special

educational needs, including the special educational needs code of

practice, the Education Act 1996, which placed schools and LEAs under a

duty to identify, assess and make suitable provision to meet a

child&#146;s special educational needs, and the Special Educational

Needs and Disability Act 2001, which extended disability discrimination

legislation to education providers.</div>

<a name="06051157000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our existing guidance on

parenting contracts and the illustrative guidance provided to the

Committee fully restate schools&#146; and LEAs&#146; duties. Our

guidance also recognises that the issues behind misbehaviour can be

complex and that the common assessment framework should be used to

identify them unless concerns suggest an urgent need for specialist

assessment.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column835" />Column number: 836</div><a name="06051157000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to a question put by

the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole about whether the

provisions would apply to certain schools or to all schools, I shall

make a concession that I hope will be welcome to her party in an

amendment that we are about to discuss. I hope that it will clarify the

matter to her satisfaction and that, on the basis of all that I have

said, the amendments will be

withdrawn.</div><a name="06051157000181"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000570"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I am delighted by the Minister&#146;s response.

We might finally have a schools Minister with some compassion and

understanding of the problems faced by children with special

educational needs. I shall not get too excited, but he seemed to have

some understanding of the problems encountered, which is more than I

can say for some previous incumbents of his post. However, I do not

want to spoil things. I am delighted by his comments, and I beg to ask

leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06051157000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06051157000183"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000571"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 374, in clause 75,

page 59, line 1, leave out subsections (2)to

(4).</div><a name="06051157000184"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000572"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take clause

stand

part.</div><a name="06051157000185"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000573"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b><b class="B"> </b>I hope that this will prove helpful. Is

the Minister aware that paragraphs 664 to 666 on page 91 of the

explanatory notes are about parenting orders and contracts in relation

to article 8 of the European convention on human rights? Has he

considered that parents of a disabled child or a special needs child

might be housebound during school hours and may have redress under the

convention and that article in particular? Has he considered also how

these provisions may affect them? They might lack in terms of those

rights; they might lack the ability to have a proper family

life.</div> <a name="06051157000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once the Bill

has been enacted, I would not be surprised if somebody challenged it

under the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 8, because it will, in

effect, imprison parents of disabled or special educational needs

children within their home if those children are excluded. That is all

that I wanted to raise in the clause stand part debate. Will the

Minister consider that

point?</div><a name="06051157000187"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000574"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Perhaps you can help me, Mr. Cook. Has amendment

No. 374 been moved? Should I therefore respond to it, or should I

simply respond to the point being made by the hon.

Lady?</div><a name="06051157000188"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000575"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Amendment No. 374 has been moved. As the

Government&#146;s spokesman, the Minister can react to that amendment

and answer whatever points have been raised in relation to it. I would

have thought that that was common

practice.</div><a name="06051157000189"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000576"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am, as ever, most grateful to you,Mr.

Cook. I was just not clear about the procedure in respect of that

particular amendment, which, as I understand it, seeks to remove a

series of elements in the clause that would effectively require the

governing 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column836" />Column number: 837</div>body to introduce policies designed to promote good behaviour and

discipline, but does not set out how that should be done. The amendment

is not appropriate; everyone involved in the community of a school

should be able to have the expectation that there is guidance in

statute as to what the behaviour policy should look like and what the

governing body should do in respect of it. I will resist the amendment,

but I shall not dwell on it, because the hon. Member who tabled it is

not present. </div><a name="06051157000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Lady made comments about the Human Rights Act 1998. Clearly, the

previous Secretary of State included in the Bill the statement that she

is satisfied that it is compatible with the European convention on

human rights. I have no reason to challenge that.</div>

<a name="06051157000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady raised the

question of special educational needs families effectively being

housebound. We shall discuss that in later clauses, but my reading of

things is that there is not a requirement for children to be kept at

home; they just have to be kept out of a public place. Clearly, a good

parent would want them to be in a place of safety, but that need not be

at home or with the parents. The individual parent would have to make

such an arrangement. I hope that that helps the hon. Lady, and that the

Committee will allow the clause to stand part of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051157000192"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000580"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> We are beginning to have an interesting debate on

school discipline. That is a legitimate debate, given that a recent

survey revealed that 44 per cent. of British parents&#151;more than

in most other European countries, including Germany, Spain and

France&#151;agreed that there was not enough discipline at their

children&#146;s schools. The Government clearly acknowledge the

problem, otherwise this clause would not be in the Bill, but it is

important to say that the official Opposition acknowledge it, too, and

the aim of our amendments is to tighten the measures further.</div>

<a name="06051157000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">On May 8 last year, the

<i class="I">Independent on Sunday</i> reported that teachers are now being

assaulted by pupils at the rate of one a day. Statistics compiled by

teachers&#146; leaders show that attacks have more than doubled in a

year. It is estimated that more than 270 serious assaults are carried

out on teachers every year, and some of them are so serious that the

victims require hospital treatment. That is having a profound effect

not only on the life of schools but, even more importantly, on the

ability of us all to attract people to become teachers, to work in

schools and to stay in schools. It is wearing teachers down. It is also

having an effect on the many children who are not poorly disciplined

and who behave perfectly well. It is disrupting their education and

stunting their opportunities.</div>

<a name="06051157000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are absolutely right to

champion the cause of more discipline in schools, for the sake of both

children and teachers. That is what this part of the Bill does and that

is why we support it fully. However, we want to go a little further.

One of the key elements is the ability of teachers to restrain children

in a reasonable way, as the Bill suggests, when violent or potentially

violent incidents occur. For a long time, teachers have felt

emasculated; they have felt powerless to deal with such matters for

fear of repercussions. We have become a society in which litigation is

a constant fear in such circumstances. That is particularly sad when

teachers are trying to do their best, and so many of them do such a

good job in schools throughout the country. Once again, I want to put

on record, so that there is no doubt about it, the commitment of the

Conservative party to the teaching profession, and our further

commitment to elevating the status of teachers and celebrating their

good work. One way in which we can do that is to ensure that they have

the necessary powers when it comes to discipline.</div>

<a name="06051157000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 390 and 391

seek to tighten the provisions by replacing &#147;may&#148; with

&#147;shall&#148; and &#147;taken with a view&#148; with

&#147;in order&#148; in subsection (1). Amendments Nos. 414 to 419

would, I think the Minister will agree, improve the grammar a little.

In the generous spirit with which this Committee has been imbued, I am

sure that he will grasp these amendments with the alacrity that will do

him immense credit. He 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column838" />Column number: 839</div>will not want a Bill that is drafted less well than it might be, and we

have been happy to suggest these minor improvements.</div>

<a name="06051157000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of this part of the

Bill is to improve school discipline. Our amendments Nos. 391 and 391

are designed to ensure that the disciplinary measures are enforced in

practice. The Minister might argue that that would limit the discretion

of head teachers. However, I do not know many head teachers or teachers

who would not want clear signals from the Government about precisely

what steps will be taken to increase their powers to deal with what in

some schools has become quite a desperate

situation.</div><a name="06051157000499"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

pm</div><a name="06051157000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want

to exaggerate this matter because, as I said earlier, in many schools

things are working well. Much good work is being done in schools across

the country and not every school is in chaos. However, having said

that, more than 60 children are suspended or expelled for violent

behaviour each day in London schools according to an investigation

conducted in December 2005 by the <i class="I">Evening Standard</i>, which

reported at least 13,020 suspensions and expulsions for physical and

verbal assaults on teachers and other pupils in the previous year. That

is not acceptable, and the Government know it, as do we, the teaching

profession and the wider public. We have an absolute duty to get behind

our schools and teachers and to put good discipline back in place. A

disciplined environment is one in which good teaching and learning can

take place; an ill-disciplined one will mean that neither

happens.</div><a name="06051157000213"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000581"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I shall speak about this group of amendments in

three parts. First, I shall speak to the amendments to clause 76, of

which amendment No. 390 is the most substantive. As drafted, clause

76(1) enables a head teacher to include rules and provision for

disciplinary penalties in the measures that constitute a

school&#146;s behaviour policy. I cannot imagine the circumstances in

which any head would not include rules and disciplinary penalties in a

school&#146;s behaviour policy, so there is no reason I can think of

for not making their inclusion mandatory. I therefore welcome the

amendment in principle and undertake to introduce a Government

amendment with a similar effect on

Report.</div><a name="06051157000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I

cannot give a similar commitment on amendment No. 391, to which

amendments Nos. 414 to 418 are consequential. The hon. Member for South

Holland and The Deepings said that they involved minor improvements and

I hope that he will accept my argument and not press them. Subsection

(1) requires a head to determine measures &#147;with a view

to&#148; securing an acceptable standard of behaviour by pupils. The

focus is on the intentions behind the measures and the test of

lawfulness would be whether the measures were capable of securing the

outcome.</div> <a name="06051157000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term

&#147;with a view to&#148; is often the best wording when the

underlying idea is that everything possible is to be done to achieve a

goal but it is unrealistic or unreasonable to suppose that the goal can

always be attained. I am not a lawyer, but I have been advised that

replacing &#147;with a view to&#148; with &#147;in order

to&#148; would shift the focus to the outcome of the measures. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column839" />Column number: 840</div>For example, it could be argued that a head whose school Ofsted judged

to have inadequate standards of behaviour had acted unlawfully because

the measures that he had determined in good faith, acting reasonably,

had not worked. I think that that is going too

far.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000583"></a>Jim

agrees. With that in mind, I ask him not to press those

amendments.</div><a name="06051157000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 419 would replace the expression</div>

of pupils&#148;</div><a name="06051157000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">with

&#147;regulate in other respects&#148;. Clause 76(1)(e) is there to

ensure that heads have the widest possible scope for determining

measures to promote good behaviour&#151;something that the hon.

Gentleman anticipated I would say. The proposed change of wording would

not enhance the provision because it would have no practical effect.

That is our reading of it; again, I think that it deals with a

relatively minor issue, and I hope that he will not press it.</div>

<a name="06051157000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 392 would

reasonably be expected of

him&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would

remove the reasonableness requirement, which is qualified by the word

&#147;could&#148;. Unfortunately, some pupils can find new ways to

make mischief, which might not be expressly condemned by the school.

For example, there might be a rule that no one should cycle around the

playground for reasons of safety. If a pupil decided to skateboard

around the playground, on the existing wording one could deduce, by

analogy, that he &#147;could reasonably be expected&#148; not to do

so. If the words used were &#147;is expected&#148;, however, the

school would have to list exhaustively myriad forms of bad behaviour

and list skateboards, scooters and whatever else children should not

career around the playground upon. It could be argued that the school

should expressly have prohibited skateboarding around the playground,

which would be impractical. Aside from that, the word

&#147;reasonable&#148; makes it clear that those standards cannot

be draconian. I want to make it clear that the words used do not

prevent the school from expecting high standards of pupils; they ensure

that the standards expected are

reasonable.</div><a name="06051157000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 393 seeks to supplement the reference in clause 77 to a school

regulating a pupil&#146;s conduct with the words &#147;and impose

standards on&#148;. The &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148;

defines &#147;to regulate&#148; as &#147;to control by

rule&#148;. In practice, rules are the way in which schools impose

standards of behaviour on pupils, which means that references to

regulation encompass the imposition of standards, so the amendment is

unnecessary. The same applies to amendment No. 397 to clause 84. There

is no benefit in adding superfluous words to legislation, but there is

a risk, which I shall refer to again in respect of a later amendment.

That may bring some satisfaction to the Committee&#151;again, I

tease.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column840" />Column number: 841</div><a name="06051157000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts assume that every

word in statute is intended to have a distinct and separate meeting, so

they would try to find one. That means that the actual effect might be

one that neither the hon. Members who tabled the amendments nor I want.

With that in mind, I ask the hon. Gentleman to seek leave to withdraw

his

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000224"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000584"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s concession

in respect of amendment No. 390. His concession was made with good

grace. We acknowledge what he said about wanting to replace

&#147;may&#148; with &#147;shall&#148;, because as he said, it

is almost impossible to imagine a circumstance in which a head teacher

would not take the action that we want them to take to bring about the

effects of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051157000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to

amendment No. 391, the Minister made the most elegant rebuttal of the

argument, based on what he described as legal advice about the risks of

using the phrase &#147;in order&#148;. He argued convincingly that

if those words were used, a headmaster might find themselves in some

legal difficulty if the outcome that they had anticipated did not come

to pass. It is critical that people have a clear view about the likely

effect of all disciplinary measures. That relates to comments made from

the Government Benches and by my hon. Friend the Member for

Mid-Bedfordshire in respect of an earlier group of amendments.

Disciplinary measures must be measured by the perceived and actual

effects that they have on those being disciplined, but I take the

Minister&#146;s point that we do not want to put head teachers into

an impossible position in which they might face legal

challenge.</div><a name="06051157000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister&#146;s arguments in respect of what I describe as amendments

relating to language, rather than to the spirit of the provisions, seem

debatable&#151;but why would we want to make a meal of what is just a

snack, albeit a nutritious one? I shall not resort to the sentiment

expressed by Lynne Truss, who has become both famous and, I presume,

somewhat richer by focusing on the details of language. She

says:</div><a name="06051157000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I tend

to believe there is no point confronting the perpetrators of this

ignorant stuff because they always say the same thing: &#145;It

doesn't

matter.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="06051157000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister is neither ignorant, nor so rude. He made a good case and, in

applies only&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) on the

shall first quote the exact passage to which the amendment refers,

which is important:</div>

<a name="06051157000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The measures which a

head teacher determines under subsection (1) may, to such extent as is

reasonable&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051157000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">what

is reasonable is the thrust of my

question&#151;</div><a name="06051157000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;include

measures taken with a view to regulating the conduct of pupils at a

time when they are not on the premises of the school and are not under

the lawful control or charge of a member of the staff of the

school.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column841" />Column number: 842</div><a name="06051157000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is a probing amendment,

because it is very difficult for teachers to have any idea of what is

&#147;reasonable&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051157000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must confess to having two

hats: one as an MP and councillor, wanting the schools to control

pupils when they misbehave in the park and goodness knows where, and

one as a teacher, thinking the proposal grossly unfair. When I have

worked hard all day, should I be responsible for the pupils when they

are outside the school gates? That is a genuine dilemma. We had a

highly publicised event in a Bournemouth school, when a strong female

head teacher took action against a large number of pupils on the

pavement outside the school. That was unpopular with parents, but

incredibly popular with the general

public.</div><a name="06051157000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">What exactly

do we mean by &#147;reasonable&#148;? I hope that the term would

definitively cover outside and around the school. That seems crystal

clear, as misbehaviour there can be a great nuisance. The amendment

seeks to clarify whether we mean</div>

<a name="06051157000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on the journey to and from

school&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording is

clearly less than perfect, because the journey might be over some

distance, but there is sometimes a problem with litter that has clearly

been left by a particular cohort of pupils from a

school.</div><a name="06051157000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have

probably said before, I live a quarter of a mile from the grammar

school in our town and a quarter from a mile from a comprehensive

school. In the morning the grammar school boys cycle rapidly on the

pavement outside my house to get to school and in the evening the

comprehensive school pupils go at high speed down the same pavement

outside my house, causing equal disturbance, even though there is a

cycle track in the road. That is dangerous, and it is that sort of

issue to which one would hope that the head teacher would be responsive

when it is raised, but where on earth is the Minister drawing the line?

How is the term &#147;reasonable&#148; going to have any real

meaning?</div><a name="06051157000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are the staff

responsible 100 per cent. of the time on a school trip away from home,

when young people are let out to do something in the evening? That

seems a tricky area. An awful lot of questions can be raised about work

experience placements. I absolutely agree with the principle that the

school has a role to play in some clear areas, but where is the balance

as to the responsibility of the school, head teacher and parents? When

does something become the local police&#146;s responsibility? When

the disturbance is in the local park, it is all too easy to say,

&#147;Oh, it&#146;s those youngsters from that school.&#148;

There is a balance to be drawn, and if the provisions are to have any

effect, they must be

clear.</div><a name="06051157000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">To underline

the point, I should say that academies do not seem to be mentioned. I

have no confidence that pupils attending academies would be any better

behaved out of school than, for instance, some pupils attending my

local grammar school on their bicycles. I would like to be assured that

all schools and pupils are covered. With that, I invite the Minister to

respond, which might trigger a few more

points.</div><a name="06051157000239"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000586"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am always mindful of your advice to members of

the Committee, Mr. Cook, to stand up quickly and straight, so I

apologise if I am a little too quick.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column842" />Column number: 843</div><a name="06051157000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Lady said, the

amendment would limit the new powers to discipline pupils&#146;

behaviour outside school to journeys to and from school and to work

experience placements. I understand her argument. There is an issue

about where and how schools&#146; responsibilities begin and end.

Where do such matters become the responsibility of other agencies? She

mentioned the police and others. In the end, however, I am inclined to

the opposite view, because there are occasions on which children are

outside school, such as in lunch hours. We spoke earlier about the

desirability of keeping young people on the school premises during

lunch periods, but we know that that does not always happen. If a

teacher who was enjoying a lunchtime stroll saw children behaving in a

way that he was not happy with, it would be entirely inappropriate for

him not to have the power to do something about it. The amendment would

have the effect of rendering him or her

powerless.</div><a name="06051157000500"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

pm</div><a name="06051157000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,

there are a number of other occasions on which one could imagine a

young person outside school, not on their journey to or from school and

not on a work placement, interfacing with a member of staff. I am

highly sceptical about the amendments, but I look forward to the hon.

Lady persuading me in a pithy

intervention.</div><a name="06051157000242"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000587"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I just wanted to make it clear that the amendment

is intended to probe. It is pretty clear in my book that immediately

outside the school it is difficult to know what

&#147;reasonable&#148; means, and I think that the hon. Gentleman

would agree. How big a radius is going to be

drawn?</div><a name="06051157000243"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000588"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I acknowledge that the hon. Lady made that clear in

her opening remarks. She said that this was a probing amendment to test

the Government on the detail. I wanted to emphasise in my brief

contribution that, if anything, I would err in a direction opposite to

the likely effect of the amendment. We need to take a broader view of

where discipline begins and ends, and anything we do to limit the power

of teachers in that respect is likely to be unhelpful. Like her,

however, I shall be interested to hear the Government&#146;s

response.</div> <a name="06051157000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

powerful point the hon. Lady makes is that there must be clarity. If we

are going to extend teachers&#146; powers in the way that we all

want, it must be clear where the responsibilities lie and what they

are, and where power is limited. To that extent, the Minister&#146;s

response will be of great value.</div>

<a name="06051157000245"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000589"></a>Jim

Knight:</b><b class="B"> </b>As we have heard, subsection (4) deals with

the behaviour of pupils when they are out of school and not supervised

by school staff. The subsection enables a head teacher to regulate

their behaviour in those circumstances to such an extent as is

reasonable&#151;the key

word.</div><a name="06051157000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that

the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said that the amendment

was a probing one, and I shall seek to help. In essence, we are

striking a balance between clarity and flexibility. The amendment does

not cover the full range of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column843" />Column number: 844</div>circumstances in which a head might need to punish a

pupil for bad behaviour outside school. I understand that, and she has

said so, but neither would it be sensible, for example, to prevent a

school from punishing a pupil for misbehaviour at a further education

college in which he or she was receiving part of their education or for

verbally abusing a school staff member over the

weekend.</div><a name="06051157000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should we add

details of all the circumstances in which out-of-school behaviour can

be regulated in the Bill? I do not think so. I have a whole list of

different examples, which I shall not detain the Committee with.

Subsection (4) specifies that out-of-school behaviour can be regulated

by the school only</div><a name="06051157000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to

such an extent as is

reasonable&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

formulation was accepted by our stakeholder group on behaviour and

attendance, in which all the professional associations are represented.

They and I believe that we should leave it to the good sense and

experience of head teachers to determine what is reasonable in the

individual circumstances of their schools. There is no duty on teachers

and staff to regulate conduct off the school premises, but there is a

power for them to do so if that is reasonable. We shall provide

guidance and examples to schools on when we think it is reasonable to

use that power. In time, I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Lady,

even if she is frustrated about the matter now. Regarding her question

on academies, the powers in clauses 77 to 81 extend to academy staff.

On that basis, I hope that she will seek leave to withdraw the

amendment, particularly as it was probing in

nature.</div><a name="06051157000249"></a>

us personally come to our attention. If members of the public become

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000593"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> These amendments are technical and probing.

Amendments Nos. 543 and 551, which need to be taken together, probe

whether &#147;school&#148; is the right legal term, as there is a

difference between legal personality and legal identity. A legal

personality is an essential prerequisite for being able to exercise

legal power or perform a legal duty, whereas institutions such as

schools have a legal identity. Without the ability to hold legal

powers, they cannot be

sued.</div><a name="06051157000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally,

it is local education authorities or governing bodies that are referred

to in legislation, as they have a legal personality. Governing bodies

are statutory corporate bodies and have powers and duties such that

they are subject to legal action. However, as schools do not, we are

querying whether &#147;school&#148; is the right term. Use of it is

also probably

superfluous.</div><a name="06051157000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 544 is also a probing amendment. We are concerned that the wording

in subsection (3)(b) of clause 78&#151;the amendments cover both

clauses 77 and 78 because of the way in which they have been

grouped&#151;may leave space for frequent challenge by parents who

may consider that imposition of the penalty would be unlawful on the

basis that it was unreasonable. We are querying whether it might be

better to remove that reference and trust the judgment of head teachers

in this regard, as it could still be challenged on the basis that the

behaviour was irrational under the normal legal powers governed by

statute. The question is whether the wording may leave too much space

for

challenge.</div><a name="06051157000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 545 and 548, which are also probing amendments, are partly covered

by the Government amendment in the group. There appears to be a

contradiction between subsections (4)(a) and (8)(a) of clause 78 in

respect of head teachers conferring powers. There is a question as to

whether subsection (8)(a) fits with an authorisation

givenunder subsection (4)(b) rather than a determination

under subsection (4)(a). The wording appears to be slightly

contradictory, and we are querying whether it might be more tightly

drafted and whether the right terms have been

used.</div><a name="06051157000264"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000594"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I agree with what the hon. Lady said about these

being technical amendments. Sadly, because they are technical, my

explanation will be technical, but I hope that I will keep everyone

lively.</div><a name="06051157000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful

for the attempts at technical improvement in amendments Nos. 543 and

551. In this case, I am not convinced that the references in clauses 77

and 78 to a school taking action or being acted on behalf of are

defective. Although schools do not have separate legal personalities,

as the hon. Lady said, there are statutory references to action being

taken by a school that are perfectly clear in context, as I believe 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column845" />Column number: 846</div>are the references in question. I am satisfied on that point; it would

not make sense for clause 77(1) torefer

to</div><a name="06051157000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person having the

lawful authority to impose such a

penalty&#148;,</div><a name="06051157000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">because

technically an authorised person necessarily has the authority needed

in order to impose

it.</div><a name="06051157000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">If amendment No.

551 were accepted, clause 78(2) would require that a decision to impose

a penalty and its implementation occur on a school premises

or</div> <a name="06051157000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;elsewhere at a time

when the pupil was under the lawful control or charge of a member of

staff of that school.&#148;</div>

<a name="06051157000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not all disciplinary penalties will be

implemented at a school or while the pupil is in the charge of a member

of staff. For example, if a member of staff set a pupil additional

homework, that work would probably be completed, and action taken to

implement it, at home or at least not at school or while under staff

supervision. If the amendment were accepted, that additional homework

penalty would be unlawful.</div>

<a name="06051157000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The words &#147;on behalf of

the school&#148; make it clear that persons who decide to impose

penalties and take actions to implement them for the

school&#151;members of staff&#151;must be on the premises or in

control or charge of the pupil in question when doing

so.</div><a name="06051157000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000595"></a>Sarah

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000596"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> It could possibly. I was given very long speaking

notes to explain the potential tautology that might be created by the

amendment, and frankly I failed to understand it until I read them a

fourth time. I do not want to go too far down that road, but if the

hon. Lady would like me to send her a copy of those notes to help her

understand, I am perfectly happy to do

so.</div><a name="06051157000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be

teacher&#148;,</div><a name="06051157000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">but that would

not be any real improvement. We think that the provisions are clear as

they stand, and I am reluctant to agree to the amendments for the sake

of it. I hope that with those assurances, the hon. Lady will seek leave

to withdraw her

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government

amendment No. 106 is designed to repair a defect in the Bill. Our

intention has always been to qualify the general power of paid members

of staff to impose disciplinary penalties on pupils with a power for

the head to decide that particular members of staff should not have the

power to impose a particular penalty. We believe that that is necessary

because in some circumstances heads would need such a power. For

example, clause 79 allows schools to impose weekend detentions. That is

a serious provision and schools should use it sparingly. A head teacher

might reasonably decide that final decisions about such detention

should be made only by year heads or other senior

managers.</div><a name="06051157000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendments Nos. 544 to 546, clause 78 specifies the conditions under

which a disciplinary penalty may be lawfully imposed on a pupil. One of

those is that the imposition of the penalty must be

&#147;reasonable&#148;&#151;that word again&#151;&#147;in all

the circumstances&#148;. That condition will apply to every

individual member of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column846" />Column number: 847</div>staff who imposes a penalty. The amendments would remove that

responsibility from members of staff and make the head teacher the

judge of whether a particular penalty imposed by a particular member of

staff on a particular pupil was reasonable. Clause 78(6) requires that

staff have regard to the proportionality of the punishment in the

circumstances of the case&#151;the pupil&#146;s age and any special

educational needs, disabilities or religious

requirements.</div><a name="06051157000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

are at least two reasons for not accepting the amendments. First, there

is a point of principle: surely it is right to expect school staff to

behave reasonably and to accept personal responsibility for doing so.

It follows that the law should say that. Secondly, there is a practical

reason: in a school of any size, it would be wholly impractical for the

head to have to authorise every single penalty that any member of staff

wants to impose on any pupil in advance of that decision being made and

implemented. Such provision would also remove the professional autonomy

of teachers and other staff. I could continue, but I hope that I have

said enough to convince the hon. Member for Brent, East not to press

those

amendments.</div><a name="06051157000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

Nos. 547 and 548 would limit to unpaid staff such as parent volunteers

the head&#146;s ability to determine whether particular individuals

or groups of staff may impose particular penalties on particular

pupils. That would be wrong. As I said, our intention has always been

to qualify the general power of paid members of staff to impose

disciplinary penalties on pupils with a power for the head to decide

that particular members of staff should not have the power to impose a

particular penalty.</div><a name="06051157000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

discussed, Government amendment No. 106 will reinstate the required

words. We consulted key stakeholders on a version of clause 78 that

included that qualification. They agreed that that was sensible and

necessary. If the amendments were accepted, the head teacher would not

be able to determine that, for example, only heads of years should be

able to put pupils in detention or to oversee one. That would not allow

schools to make disciplinary arrangements, so I urge the hon. Lady not

to press the

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000501"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.00

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000603"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> You are too quick for me. I was about to say under

your steady

guidance.</div><a name="06051157000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the

clause, paid and other members of staff have the power to impose

penalties on pupils. However, subsection (8) gives the head teacher the

power to define as a member of staff particular pupils, which I suppose

means prefects. The amendment would remove the anomaly of defining

prefects as members of staff by including a new subsection 4(c), to

extend these powers to

a</div><a name="06051157000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;pupil (to be known as

a prefect) properly authorised by the head teacher to impose the

penalty.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

fully appreciate that occasionally schools will need to empower members

of the school community, such as prefects, to enforce discipline. It is

a good thing. I was a prefect at school as, I imagine, Mr. Cook, you

were. Indeed, many members of the Committee look like they would have

made excellent prefects. Prefects can play an important role in

maintaining good order in the school community. We have no problem with

the essence of that part of the Bill. It seems common sense.</div>

<a name="06051157000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is important that

we get the detail right. It seems odd that we describe, or define in

law, prefects as members of staff. The Minister may claim that that is

for legal reasons and say that, in light of any possible legal

challenge, it is important that the same legal protection is afforded

to prefects as to other members of staff. I bet that that is in his

briefing, which he is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column848" />Column number: 849</div>about to share with us. Undoubtedly, it will be a useful contribution to

our

considerations.</div><a name="06051157000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

it is most important that we do not get the details wrong. As the hon.

Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said earlier, clarity in this

part of the Bill is vital. It is a sensitive area and there is always

the possibility of legal challenges, as the Minister made clear in

response to earlier amendments. We must be even more certain of the

effects of our good intentions in this clause than in other parts of

the Bill, and our amendments are intended to probe the

provision.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000604"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I am a little dubious about putting too much

emphasis on the role of prefects in providing discipline. Their role is

usually in mentoring and support, as they are likely to be under the

age of 18, and certainly under the age of 19. Focusing on discipline

would be unwise. It is likely to break down the supportive relationship

that prefects have with their peers, especially in a house system when

they can encourage competition and the raising of standards and

behaviour. The amendment is designed to probe the Government&#146;s

intentions.</div><a name="06051157000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not

clear to me where the Conservatives are coming

from&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Yes, I was going to say &#147;Tom

Brown&#146;s Schooldays&#148;, but that is probably inappropriate.

We need to be careful about the responsibility that we place on young

people who are not legally responsible for other young people in their

care.</div>

<a name="06051157000298"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000605"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I delighted to have this opportunity to discuss

prefects. I confess that I, too, was a prefect and so was my daughter,

at the age of 15, which underlines the hon. Lady&#146;s point that

prefects may not be 19, or even 18.</div>

<a name="06051157000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">We considered the matter very

carefully when the clause was drafted and took advice from the six main

professional teaching associations and other key stakeholders in the

ministerial group on behaviour and attendance. Our conclusion was that

it would be inappropriate to give the statutory power to prefects,

because although they can make an important contribution to ensuring

that other pupils behave and may have the mentoring functions described

by the hon. Lady, they act only under the authority of the head teacher

or other school staff, helping them to maintain discipline. Moreover,

prefects may be under the age of 18 and thus legally children; even if

they have reached the age of 18 they are still part of the pupil

community and thus under the control or charge of teachers and other

professionals employed by the school.</div>

<a name="06051157000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the existing common law,

prefects are not recognised as being in loco parentis, nor will they be

trained or qualified in pupil management. It would therefore be

inappropriate to give prefects statutory powers over pupils. However,

that does not mean that prefects would have no protection from having

their authority overturned. They would be acting within the framework

of the school discipline policy, and helping staff to enforce school

rules. Thus defiance of reasonable instructions by prefects would be a

defiance 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column849" />Column number: 850</div>of the school discipline policy and of the authority of school staff,

especially the head, and the governing body. It would accordingly be

entirely proper for a school staff member in lawful control or charge

of pupils to punish a pupil for such unreasonable defiance.</div>

<a name="06051157000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 396 relates to a

similar issue: it specifies that the term &#147;member of

staff&#148; should not include pupils at the school. The amendment is

not necessary, first, because as I said the clause does not intend the

statutory power to impose penalties to be extended to pupils. It is the

Government&#146;s view that the clause, as currently worded, relates

only to adults employed at the school and would not include prefects or

any other pupils. I invite the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06051157000302"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000606"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> From what the Minister has said, I am not

absolutely clear whether prefects will have certain powers at the

discretion of the head teacher. I understood that the Bill talks of

prefects using the quite proper powers that the head teacher might want

to give them. |Like both the Minister and the hon. Member for Brent,

East, I believe that prefects can play an important part in both

mentoring and maintaining order in the school. However, I am not sure

whether the Minister was implying that prefects would be defined as

members of staff. If they were so defined for the purpose of doing the

bidding of the head teacher, I wonder whether that would both protect

them, in one sense, but perhaps render them liable, in a different

sense, to any action or challenge that might take place in law. That

was not clear from what the Minister said, but that may be my fault

rather than his, so perhaps he can clarify.</div>

<a name="06051157000303"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000607"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> To clarify, as what I tried to say clearly failed

to do, prefects are not members of staff and should not be regarded as

such. They have no statutory power. What influence or ability they

might have to gain respect from pupils would be through the authority

that the head teacher had given them and their place within the

disciplinary code. The code might say, for example, that to disobey a

prefect who has given a reasonable instruction would be a breach of a

code and that punishment would follow, but that sanction would be given

by the staff and not the prefect.</div>

<a name="06051157000304"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000608"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> So, if the prefect has no statutory power, does

that mean that he or she has no statutory protection given the kind of

challenge that one might anticipate? My anxiety here is that a prefect

doing the proper business that the head teacher has asked them to do

might be liable to a challenge due to having no statutory protection.

We are not absolutely clear about that point on the Conservative

Benches, so the Minister may want to intervene again to clarify

it.</div><a name="06051157000305"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000609"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I shall try to clarify that prefects have no power

to impose a penalty. They cannot enforce their instructions; members of

staff enforce. As long as that is made clear to prefects and they do

not breach that line they should not be vulnerable to the sort of

challenge that concerns the hon. Gentleman, because 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column850" />Column number: 851</div>they would simply be reporting misdemeanour, disrespect or whatever the

problem might be to the staff. It is then up to the staff to enforce it

and deal with the code.</div>

<a name="06051157000306"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000610"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Yes, I think that the Minister is making the point

that the absence of statutory power is the prefect&#146;s defence in

law. They could not be challenged legally because they have no legal

status, in that sense, except by proxy through their relationship with

the head teacher and other teachers in the school. On that basis, as

the Minister has clearly researched the matter, I beg to ask leave to

withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000307"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000613"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I ought to say at the outset that this is not the

Liberal Democrats being soft. In fact, we welcome the main proposals on

discipline in this Bill, but some caveats and protection are needed for

highly vulnerable members of our society. We have touched on this

already, but these amendments are clearly more far-reaching than those

put forward by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire&#151;who will, I

hope, be supporting these as the thrust behind them is exactly the

same. It simply brings in a wider group of people. We want to insert a

new paragraph into clause 78(6), to ensure that a child&#146;s

well-being will be taken into account, and to insert similar provisions

into clauses 84 and 85.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column851" />Column number: 852</div><a name="06051157000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why, we might ask, should we

think about well-being in considering discipline, when we could

probably be thinking some very vicious thoughts about the individuals

concerned? The idea stems from the Children Act 2004. The well-being of

the child is defined clearly with reference to the five outcomes

identified in the Act. I do not think that I need to read those out,

because they should be familiar to us all. They are important and they

are the backbone of all that we should do in this context.</div>

<a name="06051157000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">To determine whether the

disciplinary measures will improve the child&#146;s well-being an

assessment of their well-being should be made. The focus is on

individual children. We do not, of course, suggest that a complete

assessment should be carried out for every misdemeanour. However, we

want to ensure that vulnerable children will be identified in the

school framework and that there will be a teacher with responsibility

for looked-after children, for example.</div>

<a name="06051157000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the points that are

made in the practitioners&#146; guide about the common assessment

framework are particularly pertinent and suggest what we may need to

look out for. For

example:</div><a name="06051157000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Children

and families may experience a range of needs at different times in

their lives...All children require access to high quality

universal services. Some children are at risk of poor

outcomes&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is all

very obvious. Those are children with additional needs and they will

require targeted support from education, health, social services and

other services. Those points were made in the Children Act: a

multi-disciplinary and cross-cutting approach is needed. Disruptive,

antisocial behaviour, lack of parental support, risk of offending, and

poor attendance and other such circumstances may be factors.</div>

<a name="06051157000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the children in the

group of those with additional needs will have complex needs. It is at

that point that statutory involvement may be needed. That is the point

of &#147;Every Child Matters&#148;&#151;that the school should

play a part. We are well aware, in the context of child protection,

that in the past, before the Children Act was passed, schools did not

necessarily play a full part in the identification of children at risk.

Children with complex needs may include looked-after children, children

at risk,</div> <a name="06051157000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;care leavers;

children for whom adoption is the plan; children with severe and

complex special educational

needs&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051157000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">which we

have

covered&#151;</div><a name="06051157000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;children

with complex disabilities or complex health needs; children diagnosed

with significant mental health problems; young

offenders&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particular

circumstances in children&#146;s life may be relevant, such as

bereavement, or a parent in prison. Many of those are already mentioned

in the guidance, which I have praised, but it is by no means

exhaustive. More should be added, and I have already mentioned that

young carers should be included.</div>

<a name="06051157000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">At least in the guidance to be

applied when children face disciplinary measures, it should be clear

that the thrust and spirit of what we all fought for in the Children

Act is being carried through. I am sure that we can all think of

examples of inappropriate disciplinary action, such as an ASBO for a

child with severe Asperger&#146;s. That cannot be right, but unless

we all focus, and everyone plays a full part in the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column852" />Column number: 853</div>Government&#146;s agenda for &#147;Every Child

Matters&#148;&#151;particularly in the sphere that we are now

considering&#151;we may easily go down the slippery slope whereby bad

behaviour manifests at school and we may later be dealing with a young

offender. Many of us, though, faced with the same difficult

contributing factors, might not have stayed on a straight course in our

lives. What I ask of the Minister is that the work should be carried

through from the Children Act and reflected in the

Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000614"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> As we discuss the detail of this aspect of the

Bill, it is important to set in context why the Government are doing

what they plan to do should the Bill become law. The arguments

articulated by liberals and other radicals and progressives over the

decades have resulted in the kind of atmosphere in many schools that is

not conducive to learning. Of course it is a matter of balance, but it

is absolutely right that we should support parents, teachers and

children in ensuring that the atmosphere that prevails in our schools

and classrooms is an ordered one. To me&#151;and to most people, I

think&#151;that is fundamental to good educational practice. As I

have said repeatedly, that is what happens in most schools.</div>

<a name="06051157000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discipline is a symbol of

caring to a child. Most of us are parents and know that it is tough for

parents, teachers and children. I am strongly in favour of the spirit

that underlies this part of the Bill, and therefore worried by these

amendments. Amendments Nos. 549 and 550 would limit reasonable

punishment to punishment that contributes to a pupil&#146;s

well-being&#151;wording employed in section 10(2) of the Children Act

2004. However, the amendments neglect to mention the well-being of

other members of the school community, such as other children and staff

in the school, including teachers and others. The amendments would

weaken the good elements of the Bill in respect of discipline&#151;we

would be rowing back in favour of those whose policies have undermined

discipline in so many classrooms.</div>

<a name="06051157000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am inclined to the view

articulated by no lesser a personage than the Hollywood actress Bette

Davis, whose films we all enjoy. What did she have to say on this

subject? She said that discipline is essential, and

that:</div><a name="06051157000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If there

is love, there is no such thing as being too tough with a

child...If you have never been hated by your child, you have never

been a parent.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is

an unfashionable idea, but who among us has not, when we have

disciplined our children, had the kind of response that Bette Davis

implies in that statement? Not all interfaces between children and

parents or teachers are happy. I well remember my idyllic school days

during my idyllic childhood being punctuated by occasions on which my

parents or teachers were extremely tough in enforcing the sort of

discipline that I, like most children, desperately needed. If that is

done in an atmosphere of care and concern at school, and love and

security at home, it is entirely right that it should be done. I will

not support any amendments that would weaken this part of the Bill 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column853" />Column number: 854</div>and therefore urge the Committee, Minister and Conservative Members to

resist these well intentioned but muddled

amendments.</div><a name="06051157000328"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000615"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> For some it may be tempting to make mischief with

these Liberal Democrat amendments and, in doing so, tell them that it

is for their own good. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for

Mid-Dorset and North Poole and I fully respect the intention behind the

amendments and the spirit in which they were tabled. I fully respect

her commitment to promoting all children&#146;s well-being. That is a

major plank of Government policy, as well as a key reason for helping

schools to promote good behaviour. However, introducing a statutory

requirement for schools to take account of whether the imposition of a

penalty on a pupil contributes to his well-being, as the amendments

would do, is neither necessary nor even sensible.</div>

<a name="06051157000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools have a well established

duty of care towards all their pupils. That duty is to take care of

pupils in their charge as a careful parent would in like circumstances,

which includes a duty to take positive steps to protect their

well-being. It prevents them from imposing disciplinary penalties that

would, for example, physically or psychologically harm a pupil;

humiliating or degrading punishments also fall into that category. More

specifically, the clause requires disciplinary penalties to be

reasonable&#151;the hon. Lady&#146;s favourite word&#151;in all

circumstances. It goes on to specify what reasonable means, taking

account of whether the penalty is proportionate to the offence, the

pupil&#146;s age and special educational needs or disabilities, and

any religious requirements that affect him.</div>

<a name="06051157000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are solid safeguards for

the well-being of the child, but adding to them a requirement that

penalties contribute to pupils&#146; well-being is going too far. The

key point is that all disciplinary penalties, from the mildest to

permanent exclusion, have to strike a balance between the interests of

the individual and those of the school community as a whole. Of course

a penalty should signal to the individual that a particular behaviour

is unacceptable, and we hope that he will learn from it; but it should

also protect the rest of the school community by deterring him from

repeating such behaviour and signal to other pupils that the behaviour

is unacceptable.</div> <a name="06051157000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

means it is not always possible to argue that a particular penalty

promotes the well-being of the pupil on whom it is imposed. The

amendment would introduce into mind of the member of staff carrying out

discipline and enforcing an action uncertainty about whether they were

contributing to well-being, and therefore whether they were acting

illegally. It is not sensible to add the proposed requirement, and I

hope that on that basis, the hon. Lady will withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<a name="06051157000332"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000616"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I think I thank the Minister for his comments. He

tried hard to be kind.</div>

<a name="06051157000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments deal with an

important point. They are not about condoning disruptive behaviour and

allowing it to continue at the cost of others in the school. The

serious point is that we can get the balance wrong, and we have done so

in certain well publicised 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column854" />Column number: 855</div>circumstances. I make no apology for making what was always going to be

a tough argument. Somebody should make that argument, because we do not

always get the balance right.</div>

<a name="06051157000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be happy if within the

provision, which I regard as a good starting point, there was a wider

reference to the type of vulnerable children to whom I have referred

making it clear that some children require a different approach from

others. All sorts of measures that might be more appropriate: a pupil

referral unit in the school might be employed, or one-to-one support

might be needed. Any disciplinary policy that takes on board the

individual characteristics of young people must include flexibility.

That should not undermine the commitment of us all to strong discipline

in a school and orderly situations in the classroom. The learning

environment is one core aspect of truly improving the future of all our

children.</div> <a name="06051157000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the

Minister for his comments. I make no apology for proposing it, but I

beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

of disciplinary penalties: detention outside normal

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000617"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 264, in clause 79, page

62, line 17, at end insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;unless

the head teacher has previously made known within the school and to

parents of registered pupils at the school that the detention of pupils

outside normal school hours without notice is one of the measures that

may be taken with a view to regulating the conduct of

pupils.'.</div><a name="06051157000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment would prevent spurious travel concerns being used as a reason

for avoiding detention. Detention is widely used and is effective but,

unfortunately, teachers are often reticent about using it because

pupils or unco-operative parents claim that it would disrupt travel

arrangements. In some cases, such objections are reasonable&#151;for

example, the child may live a long way from school and have to catch

the school bus.</div> <a name="06051157000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

entirely appropriate that proper notice should be given of detention,

and that schools should make clear that detention may be used as one

means of regulating the conduct of pupils. The Leader of the

Opposition, who is in the ascendancy, said recently:</div>

<a name="06051157000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pupils can only learn

in classrooms where good order and discipline are

maintained.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pupils look

to school for order and stability. Just as the Government have moved to

a more Conservative view of discipline, so do I, in that co-operative

and consensual way, move the amendment, so that the Bill can be better

still.</div>

<a name="06051157000342"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000618"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I am little confused about what the hon.

Gentleman intends by the amendment. I understand that it would remove

the requirement to give 24 hours notice, but at the end of his speech

he seemed to accept that notice is required. I may have 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column855" />Column number: 856</div>misunderstood the amendment&#151;or perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not

speak to it.</div> <a name="06051157000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the

record, we would not be in favour of removing the period of notice. It

would be totally impractical. In rural areas, especially on dark

evenings, parents would not know what had happened to their child and

would be extremely concerned. It is perfectly acceptable to give 24

hours&#146; notice, as it will allow parents to make other

arrangements for travel or to arrange for a neighbour or other family

member to stay at home to provide cover. Anything else would be

unacceptable.</div>

<a name="06051157000344"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000619"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I agree with the hon. Member for Brent, East in

her interpretation of the amendment. For reasons of child protection,

it is important to regulate detention. One of the most important

conditions that governs detentions out of school hours&#151;it was

introduced in legislation that came into force in 1998&#151;is the

requirement to give parents 24 hours&#146; notice that detention is

to take place. It is crucial that parents are made aware that a child

is being kept back after school and will not be home at the expected

time. </div><a name="06051157000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

would remove that blanket obligation and allow schools to detain pupils

after the end of the school day without informing the parents. That

could cause all sorts of problems. For example, it may be difficult for

the child to travel home after detention&#151;that would certainly be

the case in parts of Dorset&#151;the absence may leave a younger

sibling unsupervised at home, and, as the evening draws in, parents

will become worried.</div>

<a name="06051157000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, because the Bill

extends the permitted days of detention to some weekends and staff

training days, the amendment would allow a school to compel a child to

attend detention on such a day without notifying the parents. That

would create entirely unnecessary anxiety for the parents and deny them

the opportunity to draw to the school&#146;s attention factors such

as family holidays or religious festivals that might make the detention

unreasonable.</div>

<a name="06051157000504"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000620"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman rose to the rank of

prefect, was he ever in detention?</div>

<a name="06051157000348"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000621"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I certainly was in detention at

school&#151;twice, I believe. On both occasions, I had to take a slip

home to inform my parents, but that was well over 20 years ago. The

1998 provisions requiring 24 hours&#146; notice have come in since I

left

school.</div><a name="06051157000349"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000622"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> We are all most interested in the Minister&#146;s

school career. I just want to tease out the details: is he suggesting

that, in those days, slips were taken home? I remember being put in

detention many times at school, and it was not common practice for

parents to be informed in advance. What about detentions in breaks,

lunchtimes and other times? Are not his proposals far less practical

than the very sensible ones in the

amendment?</div><a name="06051157000350"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000623"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I shall deal with lunchtimes in a second, but I

remember my very first detention, which was for not bringing a towel to

school on the day that we were 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column856" />Column number: 857</div>swimming&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>

&#147;Disgrace!&#148;] I was seven or eight, and it was important

to inform my mother that I had detention, because I did not have any

way of getting home after the obviously much-deserved detention for the

absent towel. I do not hold it against Mr. Lloyd.

<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>

<a name="06051157000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point about lunchtimes,

I recognise that written notice to parents is not appropriate for all

detentions. Such notice has never been required for detention during

ordinary school hours except for lunchtimes. The Bill abolishes the

requirement for notification of lunch-time detentions, given that

lunchtimes are part of normal school hours, and that it is simply not

practicable or necessary for schools to notify parents every time that

a pupil is kept back for, say, five minutes at the beginning of lunch

time. Schools may still choose to notify parents of a lunch-time

detention if, for example, the pupil was expected home for lunch and

the detention would disrupt such arrangements or cause anxiety, but

that is more appropriately covered in guidance than in primary

legislation.</div>

<a name="06051157000352"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000624"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I do not intend to interrogate the Minister further

about his colourful past in respect of swimming or anything else, but

if a parent was unco-operative about a pupil&#146;s detention, what

sanction would a school have? Would the Minister think it useful to

build into home-school contracts the provisions that we put in our

amendment, so that parents understand when their child starts at the

school that detention is one of the sanctions available to the school

to use, with the kind of notice that the Minister

described?</div><a name="06051157000353"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000625"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> We shall discuss home-school contracts under a

later amendment, but I would certainly expect the school&#146;s

disciplinary policy and code to be made clear to parents through

something like a home-school contract. The sanctions that would

accompany breaches of the rules, including detention, should be made

clear in such a policy. I believe that parents would be told what was

going on. If parents do not want to co-operate with the school, we

would have to discuss measures such as parenting contracts or parenting

orders, which are at the far end of the spectrum of measures to deal

with a breakdown in the relationship between the school and the parent.

For reasons of child protection and fairness to parents, I hope that

the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000354"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000626"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I did say when I moved the amendment that there

were cases in which, because of issues with, say, school

transport&#151;someone mentioned rural areas&#151;these things were

difficult. Although I remain concerned about unco-operative parents

undermining the policy of the school, there may be other, more

appropriate ways of dealing with that, and on that basis I beg to ask

leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06051157000355"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000629"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I should say at the outset that the amendments are

probing, because I can see things that are wrong with the

wording.</div> <a name="06051157000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a

teacher&#146;s point of view there is some help and clarification in

clause 80, but the some guidance to accompany the clause is needed. I

well remember my husband relating the story of how, one lunch time when

he was in charge of a school block, he was the only member of staff

present when two teenage girls were fighting&#151;to the death, it

seemed. He was faced with a dilemma: what on earth was he to do? He

tells me that his sheer force of personality solved the problem, but

not all situations can be solved in that way, and there are some cases

in which teachers have to intervene physically. It is a difficult

issue, and the probing amendments are designed to ask what type of

training and accreditation in the use of force could be

appropriate.</div> <a name="06051157000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress

that the amendments are probing, because of course one does not really

know which member of staff will come into contact with particular

situations and face the need to act within the terms of the clause.

However, it is essential that there be guidance about continuous

professional development in relation to the new power. I notice that

the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire has tabled a similar amendment. I

do not doubt the need for clarification. Members of my family have been

in difficult situations that are relevant to the amendment, so I know

that the problem needs to be addressed. Again, it is a matter of

balance.</div><a name="06051157000363"></a>

mentioned earlier that there are many instances of violence in schools

these days, but the amendment would mean that no teacher could use

reasonable force to deal with a disruptive pupil or a potentially

violent pupil unless they had received training or accreditation. At

the least, that would delay the Bill&#146;s impact for a considerable

time, because every teacher would have to undergo training and receive

accreditation, and that would be a mammoth task. I trust

teachers&#146; judgment. I think that they will exercise reasonable

judgment and use reasonable force according to the circumstances that

they

face.</div><a name="06051157000369"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000635"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I fear that the hon. Gentleman was not listening

carefully to me. I explained that I felt the wording of the amendment

continuous professional development. Given that a new power is in the

Bill, the extra training requirement must be made

clear.</div>

<a name="06051157000370"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000636"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am sorry, but every time the hon. Lady talks

about balance, she seems to use it as a euphemism for weakening this

part of the Bill. Of course training should be made available, but

putting such a requirement in the Bill would be unhelpful. Teachers

engaged in in-service training should, wherever possible, be encouraged

to take on the necessary additional skills to deal with difficult

situations, unruly pupils and extreme incidents such as those involving

violence. However, it would not be appropriate to put such a

requirement in the Bill.</div>

<a name="06051157000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was successful in urging the

Minister and other members of the Committee to resist a previous

Liberal Democrat amendment, and I hope to persuade them to resist this

one.</div><a name="06051157000372"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000637"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The amendments all deal with the use of force in

schools. Taking amendments Nos. 74 and 572 first, the clause enables

school staff to use reasonable force in specified circumstances. That

is not new; school staff have had a statutory power to use reasonable

force since 1998 and two sets of guidance govern its use. The clause

re-enacts current legislation. I am not aware that that essential

legislation has caused problems in the past eight years, so I do not

believe that it is broke or that it needs fixing.</div>

<a name="06051157000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Physical intervention should be

regarded as a last resort, but situations in which it is necessary can

arise in any school. As we have discussed, such intervention sometimes

has to be immediate, so it is not practical to rely entirely on a small

cadre of expert staff: every member of staff whose job includes

supervising pupils must have the power to intervene physically when 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column859" />Column number: 860</div>necessary. That makes the amendments undesirable. It is disproportionate

and impractical to require every school to give every member of staff

who has any responsibility for supervising pupils specialised training

in physical intervention.</div>

<a name="06051157000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there are some schools

and units&#151;for example, special schools for children with

behavioural difficulties&#151;where situations requiring physical

intervention may be more frequent and more serious and where there

might be a need to be more sensitive to the needs of the individual

children. In such settings, all relevant staff, I am sure, may need

specialist training, but that represents a different circumstance from

a reception class, for example.</div>

<a name="06051157000375"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000638"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The Minister makes a good point about the demands

on teachers who deal with children with emotional and behavioural

difficulties. When he says &#147;I am sure&#148;, does he mean that

he will amend the Bill to allow for that, or that he will include it in

guidance; or is he merely expressing a fond

hope?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000639"></a>Jim

force and, as I said, we are re-enacting the 1998 legislation, so such

a provision would not be in the Bill. We will update the guidance,

bearing in mind our earlier debate and the comments that are being made

now. We will consult on that guidance following the passage of the

Bill.</div> <a name="06051157000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000640"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. I said

at the outset that the matter needed to be highlighted in guidance. I

am pleased that guidance will be issued and that there will be

consultation on it, because it is difficult to anticipate all the

issues that might arise. I am pleased in principle to see the provision

possibility that further disciplinary action might need to be taken in

relation to the

pupil.'.</div><a name="06051157000388"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000643"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The amendments seek to clarify the provisions on

the confiscation of a pupil&#146;s property and to separate the

disposal of that property from its seizure and retention, which is what

we normally understand as

confiscation.</div><a name="06051157000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would

expect a teacher to return the majority of items that are confiscated

during the school day to the student or their parent or guardian, as

appropriate. However, there are occasions when that is not suitable,

perhaps because the item is dangerous or the young person was using it

to be disruptive. In such cases, the item is most likely to be a

weapon, such as a knife. We are simply trying to make it clear that

members of staff who do not return such items to the student, parent or

guardian have a legal

defence.</div><a name="06051157000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

556 would make it clear that the grounds for disposing of an item

included preventing the owner from using it to commit an offence or to

provoke further disciplinary action by repeating the behaviour that led

to the confiscation. We are trying to make it clear for staff and

students that those are the only grounds on which property could be

kept or disposed of, rather than given back to the

student.</div>

<a name="06051157000391"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000644"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady has done the Committee a service in

probing this issue. As she said, it is important that we draw a

distinction as to the kinds of item that might be confiscated. Mobile

phones are one such item and they are becoming a significant problem in

schools. The Newcastle secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Ian

Grayson,

says:</div><a name="06051157000485"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Virtually

every child has a mobile phone now. They are not supposed to be

switched on during lessons but they do get used for text and

communication, which is a distraction for children when they are there

to learn.&#148;</div> <a name="06051157000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

absolutely right that teachers should, as a matter of course,

confiscate mobile phones while children are on the school premises.

Many parents give their children mobile phones because they are worried

about their security, but it is right that teachers should confiscate

them, and we welcome the new powers in the Bill to allow staff to do

so.</div> <a name="06051157000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady is

right that other items, particularly weapons or items that could be

used as weapons, might be confiscated permanently. It is entirely

inappropriate for teachers to be in the business of giving knives or

other items back to children. For those reasons, the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column861" />Column number: 862</div>amendment is interesting. I wait to hear what the Minister says, because

the Government might want to address the matter, at least in

guidance.</div>

<a name="06051157000394"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000645"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> On the face of it, amendment No. 552 seems

reasonable. Having to prove that a confiscation was lawful seems to

reverse the &#147;innocent until proven guilty&#148; principle, but

that is not, in fact, what the clause is about. Clause 81 does not make

somebody guilty. Quite the opposite: it makes him innocent if he can

show that his actions were lawful. That is why the clause is

entitled</div><a name="06051157000486"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Defence

where confiscation

lawful&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause gives

a member of staff a defence if he shows that his actions&#151;the

seizure, retention or disposal of an item&#151;were lawful. That

includes actions that are lawful under clause 78 and which constitute a

lawful disciplinary penalty. The clause therefore strengthens the

position of school

staff.</div><a name="06051157000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">The seizure,

retention or disposal of somebody&#146;s property interferes with his

rights under article 1 of the protocol to the European convention on

human rights, which guarantees that a person is entitled to the

peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. That means that the person who

has seized, retained or disposed ofthe property must prove

that that interference was proportionate, necessary in a democratic

society and in pursuance of a legitimate aim. Removing the reference to

proof from clause 81 would not change that fundamental principle: state

schools are public authorities and must prove justification. All it

would do is make the legal position less manifest and clear. That is

the technical answer about the effect of the amendment.</div>

<a name="06051157000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Brent, East

mentioned knives. The issue of knives in schools was substantially

dealt with in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which, as hon. Members

may recall, will give staff the power to search for offensive weapons,

with only the police having a general power to search.</div>

<a name="06051157000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mobile phones were mentioned by

the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings. I agree that they

are a significant problem and, like iPods to some extent, they are not

a straightforward problem for some schools to deal with because of

their significant value. In respect of legal cases that might come

under human rights legislation in respect of the enjoyment of property,

to confiscate and dispose of something of such value as a mobile phone

or an iPod would potentially be quite difficult. It is appropriate that

such items would be returned at the end of the day, as the hon. Member

for Brent, East has said. I hope that that is sufficient to encourage

her to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000646"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply. Although I

accept that the provision is in accordance with section 1 of the Human

Rights Act 1998, I am not entirely clear whether it is compliant with

sections 6 and 7. However, I suspect he has a much greater legal team

than we do to check such matters

out.</div><a name="06051157000401"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000649"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I rise to express the support of the Conservative

party for the disciplinary powers in the Bill, subject to some

important concerns about children with special educational needs, which

we will discuss in respect of the next group of amendments.</div>

<a name="06051157000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause relates to parenting

contracts and allows a local education authority or governing body to

apply earlier for a parenting contract. At present, parenting contracts

are available only once a child has been excluded. The proposal is an

outcome of the recommendations of the practitioners group on school

behaviour and discipline. The group felt that parenting contracts were

an effective way of giving support to parents for whom home school

agreements would not be sufficient. It

said:</div><a name="06051157000487"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are

concerned that this requirement for an exclusion to have first taken

place inhibits the use of the parenting contract as part of an early

intervention

strategy.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Its

recommendation 3.72 stated

that</div><a name="06051157000488"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;schools should be

able to offer parenting contracts, prior to a pupil being excluded, as

part of an early intervention strategy for tackling poor behaviour at

school.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">We fully support

clause 84, and I wanted to put that support on the

record.</div>

<a name="06051157000411"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000650"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I have frequently confessed that I was wrong about

parenting contracts when we first discussed them in respect of the

Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. At that stage, I wondered how we would

make somebody do something if they did not want to play. The evidence

is there for us to see. There have been some great successes and I

think that this is the second time that I have stood up and said that

my fears did not come to fruition. The contracts have to be applied

with care but they are an important tool and show that early

intervention can have an effect. Ideally, of course, we would like to

get the parenting classes in much earlier, but given the situation they

are a tool that can have a positive impact if used in the right way.

When parents say that they wish they had undertaken the course earlier,

that shows that it can

work.</div><a name="06051157000412"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000654"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> The amendment is similar to amendment No. 574 and

raises similar concerns. If we are to support inclusion and ensure that

children with SEN become part of the larger school community and are

totally included, and if we are to support parents who want their SEN

children to be part of mainstream education, we must give them due

consideration and cover them specifically in the

Bill.</div><a name="06051157000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

mentioned earlier that an excluded child does not have to be excluded

to their home, just to a safe place. I am sure that he is aware that

many disabled or SEN children live in adapted surroundings with

specialist equipment. A child in my constituency with cystic fibrosis

attends a classroom and school that have been adapted, with ramps

leading into the dining room and toilets. Her home has an oxygen

supply, ramps, the specialist feeding and learning equipment that she

needs and bolsters to support her.</div>

<a name="06051157000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that a child

need only be excluded to a safe place. I think that a lawyer would

argue, with reference to article 8 of the European convention on human

rights, that it is unreasonable for the Government to expect a parent

to find an alternative safe place for their child to be excluded to,

given the amount of detailed planning and work that goes towards making

that child&#146;s environment safe. A lawyer could also effectively

argue that the Government have been made aware of the unreasonable

nature of that provision by the debate in the Committee. Will the

Minister re-examine article 8 of the convention and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column864" />Column number: 865</div>consider whether it is reasonable for disabled children to be excluded

at very short notice to an alternative safe

place?</div><a name="06051157000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

576 would require local authorities to undertake an assessment in

accordance with the Education Act 1996 of any pupil who is permanently

excluded. Although one third of children excluded from schools are

able, according to the Government&#146;s statistics, the remaining

two thirds have special educational needs. I refer to the

Government&#146;s response to the written question tabled by the hon.

Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) on26 March 2006,

which illustrated that point. Perhaps we should consider the

possibility that, by reducing statementing support for vulnerable

pupils and increasing placement in mainstream schools without offering

relevant training, support or resources to our hard-pressed teachers,

we have increased exclusion rather than, as desired, increased

inclusion.</div><a name="06051157000423"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000655"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend is making a compelling case, and I

shall support it by pointing out that the fastest growth area in

statementing is children with emotional and behavioural difficulties.

Many statemented children who are excluded are EBD children. I suspect

that, as my hon. Friend has suggested, had they been educated in

special schools they would have progressed further and their exclusions

might have been

avoided.</div><a name="06051157000424"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000656"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. Many children who

are excluded from mainstream schools would not have been excluded from

a special school. I have spoken to Labour Members who know of similar

cases to those that I have mentioned. I have spoken in the Chamber on a

number of occasions about the little boy named Jack who was the first

person to walk into my first surgery after I became an MP. Within five

minutes of arriving in my room, he had completely wrecked it: he had

taken every book off the bookcase; he had turned the chairs upside

down; he was buzzing the light switches; and his mother was distressed

and could not speak. He took everything off my

desk.</div><a name="06051157000506"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.45

pm</div><a name="06051157000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jack had been

excluded from mainstream school, which was where the local education

authority had said that he should be placed. However, because of his

particular problems, his mother had excluded him&#151;he drove the

children in that school mad. His behaviour in the classroom stopped

them learning and playing. They were pulling the chair out when he sat

down, if effect almost harming him, so his mother withdrew him from the

mainstream school environment, which meant that Jack, who needed

education more than most because of his particular problems, was

excluded from school. That illustrates things perfectly. There are not

just children excluded by the local authorities, but those excluded by

families and parents for their own

protection.</div><a name="06051157000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we

put legal steps in place through parenting orders and voluntary

contracts, and before we condemn a pupil to a referral unit, we explore

whether a hidden disability or learning need&#151;for example, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column865" />Column number: 866</div>Asperger&#146;s, a language impairment or severe specific learning

difficulties&#151;is present. Often, such children of average ability

hide their disability from teachers, but it emerges in poor behaviour

and wilful refusal to

conform.</div><a name="06051157000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us not

forget that 80 per cent. of young people in young offenders&#146;

institutions have special educational needs. Most did not benefit from

a statement, according to the Youth Justice Board. The number of adult

prisoners who are illiterate is a national scandal. I am not saying

that that is a problem of this Government&#146;s making&#151;it was

ever thus that such a number of prisoners were illiterate&#151;but

those prisoners are at greatest risk of becoming involved in further

crime. And who is at greatest risk of becoming involved in crime in our

schools today? Those children who are excluded. They are perhaps being

excluded because of underlying

problems.</div><a name="06051157000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we wish

to re-include in society those of our children and young people who

have been excluded, we must ensure that they are given the appropriate

support to receive an appropriate education. When a child is

permanently excluded is surely the time for us to look at that child

and say, &#147;Why is this child permanently excluded? Are there

underlying problems that we do not know about? Maybe we should take a

statutory assessment, just to see whether there are any particular

problems that could be

addressed.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

too many disadvantaged young people, such help is often available only

through the statement of special educational needs, but that should be

informed by multi-agency professionals. When a child presents such

behaviour&#151;wilful refusal to conform or to obey the teacher, or

do what the classroom requires&#151;speech therapists or educational

child psychologists might not be the only people who can identify the

problem. A number of professionals might need to come together and work

across agencies to be able to diagnose and decide what help that child

needs.</div><a name="06051157000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I

urge that the amendment be adopted to stop the increasing numbers of

our young people ending up in the criminal justice system or a pupil

referral unit. They are often denied the opportunity of access to a

good school, where they belong with statemented support. I am not

saying that those permanently excluded children should go to a special

school, which is often argued. I am saying that those permanently

excluded children could be diagnosed, the appropriate support could be

put in place and they could go back into mainstream school. They could

become part of that school community, which is where they

belong.</div> <a name="06051157000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

577, which is an amendment of sorts to Amendment No. 576, is about the

parents of excluded children who are subject to a statement of special

educational needs having an

exemption</div><a name="06051157000489"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unless...the

parents have contributed to that child&#146;s

exclusion&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

responsibility to provide an appropriate education to a child with a

statement of special educational needs rests with the local authority.

Too often I have heard of cases&#151;not just in my own constituency,

but nationally&#151;regarding children excluded from school whereby,

despite interim reviews and annual reports, the authority has either

been slow to act or failed to do so, which has led to the

child&#146;s exclusion. We know 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column866" />Column number: 867</div>some of the reasons&#151;there may be cash limitations or the local

authority might have overzealously interpreted what inclusion

means.</div><a name="06051157000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">A variety of

reasons might be involved, but that happens frequently. As such, is it

fair or just to penalise the parent of a statemented child who has been

excluded from school because of the inaction of the local authority,

implying that all exclusions are a result of poor

parenting?</div><a name="06051157000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

probably all witnessed degrees of bad parenting, but we should also

consider the fact that the majority of parents of excluded special

needs children are doing their best to meet their children&#146;s

needs, often in very difficult circumstances. Rather than introducing

penalties that could effectively punish responsible as well as

irresponsible parents, we must amend the legislation. Otherwise, we

will tar every parent of an excluded child with the same brush, instead

of looking at individual circumstances and needs, and making reasonable

adjustments.</div><a name="06051157000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 578 is a general amendment. I believe that any requirement for a

child to attend a specific school must include a duty on the education

authority to ensure that it is appropriate to meet the child&#146;s

individual learning

needs.</div><a name="06051157000436"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000657"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend, who makes

a compelling case for such exemptions and special provisions. Clause 85

relates to parenting orders, which are imposed by the magistrates court

following a successful application by the local authority and are

intended for parents unwilling to comply with voluntary measures. They

can force parents to attend a parenting course, which may be

residential. Breach of such an order is liable to a fine of

&#163;1,000.</div><a name="06051157000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause

85 will extend parenting orders so that they may be applied for before

exclusion. That will account for schools that can manage behaviour

without having to resort to exclusion. The clause will also allow

schools, as well as local authorities, to apply for orders. That was

recommended by the Steer group, which is why we support the clause

fully.</div><a name="06051157000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recommendation

3.73 said that</div><a name="06051157000490"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the legal

power to apply for a parenting order should be extended to schools

accompanied by clear guidance and examples of good practice in applying

parenting orders

effectively.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recommendation

3.74 said that</div> <a name="06051157000491"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it

should be possible to apply for a parenting order, following serious

misbehaviour at school, in cases where the pupil has not been

excluded.&#148;</div><a name="06051157000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we

have some concerns about the costs

involved.</div><a name="06051157000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to

paragraph 1.51 of the

guidance,</div><a name="06051157000492"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the applicant

for a parenting order is responsible for all costs associated with it

including the cost of the parenting

programme&#148;.</div><a name="06051157000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means

that if a school wishes to seek an order forcing a parent to attend a

parenting course, the cost will fall on the school. Has the Minister

considered whether that will be a disincentive for a school to apply

for such an order or is he confident that there will be sufficient

resources to overcome that problem?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column867" />Column number: 868</div><a name="06051157000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also reflecting on the

comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire. We

need to consider the impact of the provisions on the parents of

children with special educational needs. They feel very aggrieved.

Because of the inclusion agenda, their child might well be attending

what they regard as an inappropriate school. As a consequence, the

child&#146;s behaviour might have deteriorated, or the child might be

regarded as somebody who simply does not fit

in.</div><a name="06051157000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister might

correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the Steer committee was

asked not to consider problems related to special educational needs

when it discussed disciplinary issues in our schools. My hon. Friend

made important points about the proportion of excluded children with

special educational needs. We are therefore inclined to support one of

her amendments regarding a local authority&#146;s requirement to

assess the special educational needs of any child who is permanently

excluded, so that we can be sure that future educational provision for

that child is appropriate and sufficient for their needs. That is a

compassionate way to help such children to deal with their problems by

ensuring that they attend appropriate schools tailored to their special

needs.</div><a name="06051157000445"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000658"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> As we have heard, the amendments deal with the

important issue of addressing properly any special educational needs or

disabilities that a pupil might have. I acknowledge that children with

special educational needs are almost four times as likely to be

excluded than the rest of the school population. That has improved

during the last few years. I believe that some nine or 10 years ago,

the rate was twice

that.</div><a name="06051157000446"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000659"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister so early in

his response, but perhaps, either now or in a letter, he will let the

Committee know how that breaks down in terms of mainstream and special

schools, and by type of special need. We need to know how many of those

children have emotional and behavioural difficulties, and how many are

attending special schools for the reasons that my hon. Friend the

Member for Mid-Bedfordshire

mentioned.</div><a name="06051157000447"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000660"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> If I can reasonably and efficiently expedite that

for the Committee, I shall be delighted to do so, but as I stand here I

do not know how straightforward it is to get that information

together.</div> <a name="06051157000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could

have an interesting debate on inclusion, but it would not be about

parenting orders and it might get us into some difficulty. Our policy

is set out in the Education Act 1996, which provides for children to be

taught in mainstream schools where that is consistent with the wishes

of their parents, meets the child&#146;s needs and is not

incompatible with the efficient education of other

children.</div><a name="06051157000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wanted to know whether the

Steer review was asked to consider special educational needs pupils.

The report said that further, more detailed work was needed to consider

issues involving special educational needs pupils, which reflects the

real difficulties and complications that the hon. Member for

Mid-Bedfordshire described so well.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column868" />Column number: 869</div><a name="06051157000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 575 is simply

unnecessary, as safeguards are already in place to ensure that pupils

with disability or special educational needs are properly dealt with.

Illustrative guidance sets out what will be expected of schools and

local authorities when considering an application for a parenting

order. If the hon. Lady wants to write to me with her thoughts on that

guidance and how it can be improved, I shall read her letter with close

interest.</div><a name="06051157000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,

the court may make a parenting order&#151;this is crucial&#151;only

if it is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of improving

the behaviour of the pupil. In the case of a child&#146;s behaviour

that is a result of special educational needs or disability over which

the parent has no control&#151;or even, as the hon. Lady described,

where the child has a profound physical disability, and there might be

problems associated with their being kept at home or in the terms of

the order&#151;the court would have to bear that in mind when making

its decision and consider carefully whether a parenting order would

lead to improvements in the child&#146;s behaviour. That is the test

that it would need to

apply.</div><a name="06051157000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">There appears

to be an assumption behind amendment No. 576 that the special

educational needs of some children who are permanently excluded from

school have not yet been identified. However, the 1996 Act, to which I

referred earlier, and the special educational needs code of practice

already provide a framework for schools and local authorities to

identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with special

educational needs. The code provides statutory guidance to schools and

local authorities in meeting their special educational needs duties and

recommends a graduated approach to meeting children&#146;s special

educational needs.</div><a name="06051157000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

statutory guidance on exclusion, to which schools and local authorities

must have regard, states that school governing bodies must ensure that

appropriate provision is made for any pupil with special educational

needs. In cases where a pupil&#146;s special educational needs are

giving rise to disruptive behaviour, schools should already be taking

action to address those

needs.</div><a name="06051157000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our guidance is

that schools should try every practical means to maintain the pupil in

school, seeking local authority and other professional advice. However,

that does not mean that such pupils can never be excluded. The local

authority might need to consider whether children with special

educational needs, but without statements, require a statutory

assessment following a permanent exclusion and whether permanently

excluded children who have not been identified as having special

educational needs might indeed have special educational needs. However,

the amendment would mean local authorities having to carry out many

unnecessary assessments with all the bureaucracy that that involves, as

well as the cost, which in 2002 was estimated by the Audit Commission

to be &#163;2,500 per pupil.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column869" />Column number: 870</div><a name="06051157000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 577, a key

driver behind the new duty in clause 90 is our wish to ensure that the

child is supervised and not free to wander the streets, causing trouble

for themselves as well as others. Children with a statement of special

educational needs are as much in need of such supervision and

protection as any other&#151;perhaps more so. It is also important

that no child should consider exclusion a reward, in the form of

&#147;extra holidays&#148;. All children should continue their

education.</div><a name="06051157000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 90

achieves that with a mixture of parentally-arranged supervision,

homework set by the school and local authority-arranged provision;

exempting special educational needs children from the clause would

undermine it. No one would dispute that there should be safeguards for

children with special educational needs, but those are already in

place, as I have outlined, and the indicative guidance highlights how

we should proceed.</div><a name="06051157000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

recognise that there might be circumstances in which a child or his

parents have to be in a public place, such as a long-arranged medical

or other appointment or a medical emergency. Such explanations are

covered by the defence of reasonable justification and no children will

be prevented from accessing the services that they

need.</div><a name="06051157000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

578 is also unnecessary. It would place a duty on local authorities to

provide a suitable education for excluded pupils. The Government agree

that that is necessary. However, section 19 of the 1996 Act already

requires local authorities to make arrangements for children who are

not in school or are being educated otherwise to receive a suitable

education. That section specifically includes excluded children. It

also defines a suitable education as appropriate to the child&#146;s

age, ability, aptitude and any special educational need that he might

have. In fact, that very requirement is the subject of re-enactment by

clause 88(3). On the basis that the local authorities already have the

duty to provide the appropriate education sought by the amendment, I

ask for it to be withdrawn and for the other amendments not to be

pressed.</div><a name="06051157000459"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051157000661"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I thank the Minister for his offer to write and

to refer to the guidance. I am sure that I shall have the help of the

many organisations with which I have been working in the past few

months, and I shall take him up on that very kind offer. I am reassured

by his reply on other issues, but I am not sure that he is right about

the court order and the child being moved to a safe place. However, we

shall see what happens in future legislation. I beg to ask leave to

withdraw the amendment.</div>
