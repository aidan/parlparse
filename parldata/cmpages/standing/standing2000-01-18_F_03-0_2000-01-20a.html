Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 56, in page 2, line 11, leave out `one month' and insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`two months'.—[Mr. Pickles.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> First, I welcome you to the Committee, Sir David. I look forward to your chairmanship of our deliberations.
<P>
I was explaining why the amendment is unnecessary. I was about to give way to the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), but I did not realise that we were due to rise at 11.25 am, not 11.30 am. I gladly give way to her now.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I am most grateful; I know how difficult it can be when someone wants to intervene almost before one has started speaking.
<P>
It is probably my nit-picking brain, but the Minister referred to the current date when talking about someone who had dropped an assessment and then re-applied. I wonder whether the current date applies to the re-application. It has been such a long time since we last spoke about the subject, so I hope that my question makes sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> If it does not, I shall seek advice. As far as I understand it, the amendment will apply only if the parent with care has stopped receiving the relevant benefits before the maintenance calculations have been made. If a court order has not been made or if a pre-„1993 written maintenance agreement prevents it, the Secretary of State can continue the process of determining the child support liability. The parent carer has one month to respond to that letter. We know of no difficulties with a one-month timetable, and we do not want to change the period just for the sake of it. The present arrangement seems to be satisfactory, and we see no justification for changing from one month to two months.
<P>
I was asked about a re-application, but I am not able to answer now. However, I shall certainly come back to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Sir David. I understand that this is your first Bill. I am sure that we shall make our proceedings as unstressful and pleasant as we can. I am sure that you will do a marvellous job.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister. As I said this morning, it is a probing amendment. It is an important matter and I wanted to give the Minister the chance to give an explanation. I am completely satisfied with that explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 57, in page 2, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A) The Secretary of State shall report annually to Parliament on the change to the number and qualification of maintenance variations that have been made in the preceding year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 58, in page 2, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A) Any change in the nature and qualification of maintenance variations shall be agreed and ratified by Parliament before a change can be implemented.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is a matter of substance. The amendment takes account of matters that we raised this morning when discussing the possibility of variations. As I said, we intend to be as supportive as we cam in our deliberations. However, that means that we shall sometimes have to face unpleasant truths, both in our perception of the history of the Child Support Agency and in an endeavour to try to avoid many of the problems of the past.
<P>
Moving towards a simplified formula is a good thing. The evidence given to the Select Committee shows general consensus on that. I am not aware of anyone who wants to make the formula more complex. However, I am worried that making it simpler would repeat the mistakes made by a previous Committee when it considered the matter. We believe that net income should be the key to the variations. We want assessments to fit the particular circumstances of individuals more closely. That surely is desirable.
<P>
We foresee a problem. The amendments seek to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to consider the different variations. At the moment, there will be no variation for those who have excessive travel costs or excessive housing costs. Labour Members may say that the Tories are yet again trying to protect their friends in middle England, and that people who live in expensive houses or who have to commute into the City should learn that such expenses should not be taken into account. My view is that such variations should be allowed. However, they should not come through the back door; they should be made up front, and Parliament should have the opportunity to consider them.
<P>
The provision is an attack not only on middle England—an area much favoured by the Prime Minister—but will also affect people on low incomes. In a thoughtful speech on Tuesday, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) pointed out that the evidence to the Select Committee showed the sort of people who would be adversely affected by such decisions. I noted that my hon. Friend spoke of nursing auxiliaries. We know the sort of pressure that such people face because of the present crisis in the national health service, and we also know of the tremendous shortage of suitable hospital places.
<P>
I represent an Essex constituency, and many people commute regularly from there. I know of people in the nursing profession who commute daily to St. Thomas' hospital, just across the river. It will probably surprise hon. Members to learn that it is quite an expensive journey. I know of others on low incomes who make similarly long journeys. It is precisely those people who will miss out under the Bill. I am certain that the Minister will, in time, extend the Bill's powers with a statutory instrument or two. We want to know—we want Parliament to know—whether that will happen. We believe that the powers should be extended, and that that should be a matter for discussion.
<P>
Another example drawn from my understanding of my constituents is high housing costs. I come from a part of the world where housing is expensive. People who live in some of the villages in my constituency have to pay an exorbitant sum to do so, and they are not necessarily rich or well heeled. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) asks why they do not move. Why should they move from villages in which they can trace their ancestry through many generations that have lived there and been a part of the community? Such a callous remark about making them move is deeply offensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If the hon. Gentleman wants to withdraw his remarks, I will be happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I trust that the Official Report will not record that I said anything of the sort that he ascribes to me. I said nothing at all about people moving from villages in his constituency. I said, ``What has this got to do with the amendment?'' No doubt we shall come at some stage to the issue of variations, but what have variations to do with the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry that I gave way. I thought that the hon. Gentleman would withdraw his remarks. Instead, he has repeated one set of callous remarks and made them worse with another set.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> That is disgraceful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right—his remarks are disgraceful.
<P>
I shall demonstrate what my comments have to do with the amendment. New variations in the problems will occur, so there should be line-by-line scrutiny of the sort that we are enjoying. That is why the amendments are important. The hon. Gentleman is right, in that I would not have skipped over the subject with two brief examples now, were it not for the fact that we shall table amendments to a later part of the Bill that will rectify the problem.
<P>
We have a substantial problem. If we are to do justice to the public, we must be seen to be fair. I shall quote again Mr. Justice Kay, for whom I am beginning to form enormous admiration, tempered only by my understanding that that he is a great supporter of the Australian Labour party. Nevertheless, I am ecumenical in all matters. On acceptance by the public, he says on page 74 of the Select Committee on Social Security's report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Consider two separated fathers who occupy adjoining duplexes. They are both in the same employment, earning exactly the same income. One owns his apartment outright. The other is a tenant. One can clearly afford to pay more child support than the other. Is it fair that they be assessed merely upon their identical income without regard to . . . their financial positions?''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We shall have to consider that point deeply in the context of the number of variations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The hon. Gentleman has quoted from Mr. Justice Kay's letter quite extensively during the debate and on Second Reading. Has he read the letter in its entirety? The judge applauds the move to a simpler formula. His criticism of the Australian system is that it does not work, people do not pay, and enforcement takes a long time. The hon. Gentleman mentions the three stages of appeal that the variations have introduced, but does not seem to correlate the complexity of the Australian system and the difficulty of enforcement. He highlights the problems involved, but does not correlate those issues. Although he is correct in citing the letter, he should read it in its entirety and quote from it in full. 
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will discover, I have read the letter in its entirety. The problem is that it is full of gobbledegook quotes. I might be tempted to quote it in its entirety, but that would be a dreadful thing to do.
<P>
The entire letter refers to the central dilemma that hon. Members do not want to face. It is right to move towards a simplified formula. The Government have our 100 per cent., unequivocal support on that. Should fortune grace me, and I become a senior member of my party, that statement will probably appear in a Labour party booklet, to be quoted back at me, but we are completely on the Government's side on that matter. However, we want that decision to be tempered with justice and a close examination to be made of the variations. We shall have an opportunity to examine the variations in detail, and I want to protect the position of my and the Under-Secretary's successors in title to do that.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that, although he favours a simplified system, that system should in all cases include travel costs and high housing costs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> If the Under-Secretary would care to read the selection of amendments, she will see that we shall argue that point later, and we shall look to her to tell us why we are wrong. However, I do not want to try your patience, Sir David, by raising matters that relate to a subsequent amendment, as the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun suggested that I might be.
<P>
We want to protect our position and that of other hon. Members to be able to say that those variations will start off being fair, so that we do not have to face at another time in another place a new set of variations. If we do that, we start on the basis of examining them through proper scrutiny, line by line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> If I have understood the hon. Gentleman's argument correctly, he is calling for prospective scrutiny by Parliament of variations before their implementation. Unfortunately, the amendment does not call for that. It merely requires the Secretary of State, having made a variation, to report annually to Parliament about the number and qualifications involved. It is retrospective, rather than prospective. As yet, we have not heard an argument from the hon. Gentleman about the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am embarrassed to say this; I do not know how to say it nicely. We are debating two amendments. The hon. Gentleman should read the second amendment. You, Sir David, and the usual channels have selected the amendments with great skill, to enable us to take the two together. I politely point that out to the hon. Gentleman, who was wondering about it. If he looks at the selection list, he will see that there are horizontal lines, and sometimes plus signs, which mean that amendments can be debated together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> Yes, I see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am, as they say, here to help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a born teacher.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is a gift.
<P>
We are giving folks a choice. We want to argue our points in Committee and to scrutinise matters in the Bill, as we come to them. But we are also saying that we would settle for the second best option, which is the issue of the annual report—the retrospective stuff. Although I do not think that that is a good way of going about it, we are reasonable people and we are here to accept what the Committee wants to do. Despite the interventions which have been made, our hand of close friendship is held out to the Labour patty on these issues. I look forward to hearing the Minister and, if she can go some way towards allaying some of my fears, she will find that we are even more co-operative than we were on the previous group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): This is a crucial area and I appreciate the fact that we shall return to the issue of variations. I am making a sort of hors d'oeuvre speech—a taster of what might follow. Therefore, my remarks necessarily will be rather short.
<P>
The variations issue is one of the most interesting that we have had to discuss in our consideration of the Bill. I am convinced that the devil is in the detail and the devil in the proposed legislation is in the variations. When the Select Committee visited Falkirk, which is a Child Support Agency centre, we were told that the agency supported the concept of a simple formula, but the staff said, ``Please don't load any variations on us, because that is when things will start to go wrong.'' I am sure that it is the Government's intention to resist the amendments and to say that they do not need to report annually to Parliament, nor do they want to have such matters approved beforehand, as suggested by the amendment. They know that, if they load a new set of variations on to the simplied formula, the system will quickly revert to something approximating the present highly complex system. As time passes, the Government will be forced to make variations and the system will start to break down. Unless such an amendment is passed, there will be no proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
How will the variations be introduced? It will be interesting to tease out of the Minister what she intends to do. Obviously, neither officials nor the chief executive of the CSA will be introducing variations. They will have to come from the Minister, and she will have to make them. Before talking about the variations that she might be forced to make and which might be discussed in Parliament, I shall refer to the point made by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore), who mentioned to the Australian system. He said that, if there is virtue in the Australian system, it is that it is a simplified system. It may be a simplified system, but there is a sophisticated departures system, which, although it has lasted for a decade, has a problem. We have much to learn from the Australian system; we are moving to a simplified formula, albeit with a sophisticated departure system.
<P>
The non-resident parent's gross income is worked out and eventually a percentage is taken from it—just as we are doing. But in Australia, from that gross income is subtracted a self-support allowance, plus an allowance for each dependent child in the parent's care. So far, so good, but it becomes more difficult. The allowances are the unpartnered social security rate if the person has no dependent children. If he has dependent children, the allowance is double the partner's social security rate of just more than 15,000 Australian dollars, and for each dependent child, he is allowed a social security rate. An additional adjustment is made for what is called the custodial parent's excess income, which is calculated by first taking the custodial parent's disregarded income, which is the state average weekly earnings figure, plus social security allowance for the children in her care.
<P>
I do not know whether you are still following me, Sir David, but it is difficult stuff. We are reaching almost as complicated a position as we have now. The disregarded income is then subtracted from the actual gross income of the parent with care, giving her excess income. That is subtracted from the non-„resident parent's income. Has anyone in the Committee understood what I have been saying for the past couple of minutes? I know that the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) has several degrees, so she understands it, but I am not sure that I do. The resulting product is then divided by simple percentages. The Australian system may have been running for a decade, but it is already becoming apparent to them that although they started with a fairly simple system, they have had to move towards a more sophisticated one.
<P>
The other reason why Parliament will have to get involved is because it will be impossible to run with a simple formula. It will not be sustainable. On Tuesday, I read out a list of the current departures. I do not want to do that again, but they encompass all the sorts of problems that non-resident parents are likely to face. I well remember when the Bill was first introduced, just as the Minister came to Parliament. The hon. Member for Colne Valley said that the formula was very complicated. She said that it was impossible for anybody to understand. The formula introduced by the 1991 Act is AE = Z × Q × (A/A+C). I agree that it is difficult, though not for my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, who was educated in Scotland, and understands such things. We had a rather inadequate English education.
<P>
The problem is not with the formula because the system is computerised anyway. When the income details have been fed in, the computer can work out in a micro-second the exact assessment. The problem was never with the formula, but in collecting the information that went into making the formula. People started descending on our surgeries in a great mass in the summer of 1993 because no account was taken of the efforts that they were making, such as travelling to see their children or their housing costs, whether they were disabled or the cost of supporting other children, capital settlements or non-income producing assets, diverted income, and so on. There was a simple system, but under political pressure, which was not party political but pressure from our constituents, we had rapidly to introduce a much more flexible system that was based on these departures. I hope that the hon. Member for Colne Valley accepts what I am saying. The mistakes of the previous Conservative Government are being repeated. Because the CSA has to spend so much of its time on calculations, it has too little time for enforcement. That has almost become a cliché in the arguments that are going backwards and forwards on the Bill. The CSA has to spend too much time calculating people's income, so we must simplify the formula.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Does not the hon. Member for Colne Valley accept that we are repeating the mistake of going back to where we started in 1991? We are deluding ourselves that we can create a simple system that will stick. It will not because no two people are alike. Very soon, there will be a massive political row. It will not be a party political row; it will be engendered not by us but by all the people who feel that they are being treated unfairly. They will pour into our surgeries and there will be pressure on the Minister from her hon. Friends. She will have to bring in various variations. That is all very well, but it is crucial and central to everything we are talking about.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) is saying in his amendment that if the process is going to start up all over again and if we are to learn nothing from history, Parliament should have a chance to discuss these variations as they are introduced. Otherwise in 10 years' time the CSA will spend not, I hope 90 per cent., but possibly 70 or 80 per cent. of its time calculating people's income and only 20 or 30 per cent. of its time enforcing payments.
<P>
I have made my point. We can return to variations in future. But I challenge the Minister's ability to create a unique system that does not take account of all these factors to which I have referred both today and on Tuesday. When it comes down to it, a non-resident parent could rightly complain that, unlike his neighbour, he is making the effort to drive 300 miles every other weekend to see his children and that no account is taken of that. Another could complain that he lives and works in a part of Essex where housing is particularly expensive and is being forced to move.
<P>
All those practical human problems will start to derail the perfectly sensible proposals that the Minister is making. I hope that when she replies to the debate she will treat it as a serious amendment and will convince us that she is prepared to work with Parliament and Members who will meet these problems on the ground and that she will consult us before she makes any variations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar began by announcing that there was a consensus across the Committee. I caution him that we must be most careful to scrutinise the Bill carefully precisely where there is broad agreement between the sides. Many of the problems that we are addressing arose precisely out of the consensus on the 1991 Act.
<P>
My second cautionary note is that it is a consensus borne of expediency rather than principle. That is certainly the way I regard the consensus. My principled choice would be for a more complex and, therefore, fairer formula. My support for the clause is borne of expediency, given that the complexity of the formula has not worked. But it is precisely in the area of the variations, or the departures, as they used to be called, that we must be most careful to give proper scrutiny to the Bill.
<P>
The power to make departures under the earlier legislation is very wide. The clause refers to section 28F(4) of the 1991 Act. Now, Sir David, I took the strictures of your predecessor, Mr. O'Brien, quite literally and I went to the Library. I have acquired Halsbury's edition, volume 6, which gives the consolidated version of the Act. In some respects, therefore, I am at an advantage over many members of the Committee who have only unamended copies of the 1991 Act.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I understand that this is the only copy that exists so my hon. Friend may find that there are demands from the rest of us to use it as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> As I pointed out to Mr. O'Brien this morning, I am in possession of the only copy, so all other members of the Committee are at a disadvantage.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hesitate to think of any other member of the Committee being at a disadvantage because the hon. Gentleman has the only copy. Somehow I doubt that they are. For the Committee's information, we are drawing up a version of the paper which collects not only the 1991 Act and the two subsequent legislative changes to it, but the proposals in the Bill. We hope that it will be available in the Vote Office next week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is a most welcome development because this volume is a reference book which must not be taken away. It has to be returned to the Library. [Hon. Members: Oh!] It is with the express leave of the Library that I am able to bring it to the Committee for the purposes of the business of the House. Therefore I wish to draw to the Committee's attention the fact that under new section 28F of the 1991 Act the Secretary of State has power to make a departure if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is his opinion that in all circumstances of the case it would be just and equitable to give such a departure direction.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a wide power to make, what we now call, variations but what in his case are departures. The circumstances to which the Secretary of State must give consideration are the financial circumstances of the absent parent and the parent with care, and the welfare of and likely effect of the departure on the child. The power is wide and is constrained only by the schedule. We shall discuss the schedule and its amendments later. Nevertheless, in principle there is a wide power of variation. What is more, it is largely vested in the hands of the Secretary of State, which effectively means officials.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said on amendment No. 57 that justice had to be seen to be done. There is a delinquency there, in that when such powers are vested in officials justice is rarely seen to be done. The hon. Members for Hendon and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) will recall that when the Select Committee heard evidence, Mr. Mostyn QC was highly dubious about that power residing in the hands of officials alone, and questioned whether the Bill could really have the imprimatur of being within the bounds of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. We examined this issue in the Select Committee and produced a recommendation which endorsed the view of the independent case examiner that parameters of discretion allowed to officials should be specified in legislation. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has read the Government's response to the Select Committee's report which states that where discretion is to be exercised each case must be considered on its merits. It continues.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The rules governing the ability of officials to vary . . . liability . . . will be set out clearly in legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is not that the answer to the hon. Gentleman's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is indeed. The hon. Gentleman therefore obviates the need for me to develop the point. However, what I do say is that it is important to those who take up both sides of this preoccupation with variations or departures because it is a means of measuring the effectiveness of the clause. As a result, amendment No. 57 would be helpful. First, there is an expectation that the number of variations will have to increase substantially. The hon. Gentleman will recall that when Mr. Mostyn QC gave evidence to the Select Committee, he made the point strongly that the simplification in the formula would inevitably give rise to much greater pressure in the need for the number of variations. So a body of spectators expects the number of variations to increase as a demand of natural justice. Therefore, it is important to measure that increase precisely, which amendment No. 57 would make possible.
<P>
On the other side of the equation, I suspect that many members of the Social Security Committee, including myself, would naturally want a small, and declining, number of variations to arise. I also suspect that Ministers will have that expectation. Surely the Bill, the proposed change to the schedule and the reduction in the number of areas for which a departure can be given are all born of the intention that there will be fewer variations.
<P>
We want to reduce complexity, so we want a simple formula. We do not want to increase complexity by the back door with variations. So two separate expectations exist: first, that variations will increase and, secondly, that they will be controlled and reduced. Therefore, amendment No. 57 is vital so that we can watch, observe and monitor precisely what happens. That is why I urge the Committee to agree to amendment No. 57, which is entirely common sense.
<P>
The Secretary of State has the power to determine the variations by regulation. That huge regulatory power is currently in Ministers' hands. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that some of that power would be returned directly to Parliament under amendment No. 58. That is why I put my name to it. Variation has become a central issue, so it is important to accept amendment No. 58. That would mean that the key issue of variation is brought back to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right, but amendment No. 58 is also intended to make such matters clearer and more transparent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is a most welcome development, because the thrust of my remarks has been in favour of clarity and transparency so that the impact of the clause can be measured precisely. That is why I recommend that the Committee should adopt the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I, too, support the amendments, not just because of the arguments for clarity and transparency that have been put so ably by my hon. Friends the Members for Brentwood and Ongar and for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), but because of a further concern. I should be grateful to the Under-Secretary if she would address it in her reply. I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong, but the various pieces of guidance that have emerged about the variations state that, although a CSA official can take a decision about a variation under the authority of the Secretary of State, the case must then go before a tribunal. How overloaded will the tribunal service become if that happens, given the current difficulties in the service? What are the implications for parents with care, let alone everyone else who uses the tribunal service? What is the potential for judicial review?
<P>
Many hon. Members will be aware that the ratchet effect will apply if a variation is made and agreed for a set of cases. As soon as one variation is made, other people will apply for it. If their circumstances are different, they may be turned down, but they can then apply for judicial review. The Under-Secretary's face is a study: she can clearly envisage the difficulties in which we could find ourselves. However, if she could reassure me about such matters, I should be delighted, because I have a planning case in my constituency where judicial review is piling on judicial review. That is doing nothing for the judicial review system, let alone the finances of the Government or my local council.
<P>
Given the number of losers that we are identifying this morning, I can without great difficulty envisage a most difficult situation emerging—one that reflects the chaos we faced when the measure was introduced, when we suddenly realised the complexity of so many people's private lives. That was one cause of the original need for departures. I suspect that it, in a slightly different guise, will return to haunt all of us at our surgeries.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In addition to the points that I have already made, I should be grateful to receive reassurances from the Under-Secretary. Such problems lend weight to the argument that an annual report should be made to Parliament on the variations. We should also be made aware of the extent of regulation. According to the Library's first-class guide to the Bill, if one variation were allowed, the Secretary of State must apply it in several different areas. Some complex situations will arise as a result of that, so we must be able to examine how the variations will work.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The debate has been about more than the amendment. The discussion has strayed into clauses 5 to 7 and schedule 2 to which, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, amendments have already been tabled. We can discuss in detail how we envisage the variation scheme working in later proceedings, so I shall not spend too much time talking about it now. The amendments deal with the parliamentary scrutiny of variations rather than their nature. I do not want to ignite a huge debate, which it might be better to have at a later date.
<P>
Amendment No. 58 will require the Secretary of State to seek the approval of both this House and the other place for any changes that he or she may wish to make to the nature and qualifying criteria of the grounds on which he or she will consider a variation from the normal child support maintenance calculations. The amendment is pointless because the powers that it asks us to put into the Bill are already in it. Section 52 of the Child Support Act 1991, as amended by clause 24 of the Bill, already provides that no regulations made under schedule 4B can be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before Parliament and approved by both Houses. The parliamentary scrutiny that the Opposition, through amendment No. 58, have quite properly asked us to ensure takes place is already in the Bill. I ask them to accept that their desires in that area have already been fulfilled and to withdraw that amendment.
<P>
Many people may wonder what will happen with variations. The hon. Member for Gainsborough has made his views clear. We have tried, with support and consultation, to introduce a simpler system which will be easier for people to understand, predict and plan for. Opposition Members are right that if the power to vary gets out of control we shall arrive, by the back door, exactly where we are now. I reassure the Opposition that that is not our intention; we want variations to be tightly drawn. However, I do not want to go into too much detail now; the matter will be better debated at a later stage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not dissent from what the hon. Lady says. That is why our contributions were relatively short, although we obviously would like to debate the matter in greater detail. My question is about the technical nature of the power to vary. Is the hon. Lady saying that the Government have read the evidence and consulted widely, and that these are the right variations? Is she saying that the Government do not envisage other variations, and that they mention the possibility of further variations merely as a belt-and-braces operation? Is she saying that the Government do not believe that that will happen, or is she saying that they want to see how the Act beds down, and then gradually bring in new variations? Is that what she means?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The process of consultation was long and detailed, and we made it clear that we wanted a simple approach that was predictable and transparent. We want parents with care and non-resident parents to be able to work out how much maintenance will be payable for the care of their children. We do not want to move away from that. As I said earlier, the idea is to draw the variations powers tightly so as to avoid a huge increase in the number of variations, and to avoid a return to the same complexity that we have now—a complexity that had hampered the agency and prevented it from doing its job properly.
<P>
On departures—the current equivalent of variations—there may be a misunderstanding about how many there are. Last year, we completed 270,000 maintenance assessments, of which just under 4,000 came under the departure scheme. That is quite a tightly drawn area of the law and we do not intend to extend it significantly. However, I would be happy to discuss it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Perhaps it was a slip of the tongue, but the hon. Lady said that she was not intending to extend it significantly. Surely, she is reducing it significantly. If the numbers that she suggests are correct—I am sure that they are and she is saying that there is no problem with the current level of departures—again, she is probably right—why is it necessary to cut back on those departures under the new variations scheme?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not want to stray into a detailed discussion of why the variations that appear in the Bill are drawn up in that way. I would prefer to discuss that question when we debate the relevant amendments. I want to focus on the reasons for having a variation on child-related expenses rather than on a range of other expenses. I am more than happy to get into that debate when we have reached the appropriate stage of the Bill. [Interruption.] Does the hon. Gentleman wish to speak?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am hardly jumping up.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is good exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I can feel it doing me good. I know that we shall be debating the cost of travel to work and housing in later clauses, but I am raising a general point, and, with respect, this is the time to put it. We want to know where the Under-Secretary stands philosophically, and why she is cutting the number of variations. She said that it is not a problem, so why is she reducing the number? That contraction bears directly on our amendments, because it will determine whether the Government will be making regular changes by way of statutory instrument. It would be most helpful if the hon. Lady lifted the veil on the Government's thinking, and told us why, despite the fact that she said that there is no problem, the Government want to contract the number of variations?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I did not say that there was not a problem. The hon. Gentleman is confused. The hon. Member for Gainsborough pointed out that once we have moved to a simpler system, the pressure for variations may increase. Many of the variations that the hon. Gentleman speaks of are in the formula rather than the current departures scheme. We should not mix the two. We are slightly widening the basis on which new variations—or departures—can be granted in recognition of the rougher and readier formula that we seek to put into place. The variation scheme is likely to be wider than the departure scheme, but it will still be tightly drawn and focused upon child-related expenses. We shall debate these matters in more detail at a later stage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham was worried about overloading the tribunal service, but the backlog is now massively down. We are well aware of the pressure that may come from the transition, and we are planning for it. When I last looked, the backlog was significantly less, and current cases are being heard within 14 weeks. That is a huge improvement. We hope and trust that when the appeals service takes the stage in its new guise in April, it will be well equipped and able to handle the appeals that may come its way as a result of the changes. We certainly have not overlooked the problem.
<P>
Amendment No. 57 would require the Secretary of State to report annually to Parliament on the number of variations made in the preceding year. It is certainly not our intention to treat the number of variations as a state secret. However, the best way to deal with the information is not necessarily publishing it on its own every year. We do not intend to produce such a report, and we do not agree with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Perhaps the hon. Lady will let me finish. The relevant information will be compiled as a matter of routine by the Child Support Agency, and Members of Parliament who are interested will be able to obtain the latest figures at any time through the normal parliamentary channels. Given that amendment No. 58 is, in effect, already incorporated in the Bill, and that amendment No. 57 becomes irrelevant because the information can be gathered at any time by asking a parliamentary question, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I was hoping to intervene on the Under-Secretary, merely to thank her for the assurance that we would have access to the figures. I was about to say that we would be happy to have them published in the quarterly statistics that I referred to this morning. I did not want the hon. Lady to think that we were not feeling generous towards her for that concession.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I rise in some embarrassment. I was about to castigate the Under-Secretary for her inflexibility, but she has completely won my heart. She was most generous. She has offered us two routes to achieve what we want, which is satisfactory. I am embarrassed to have to praise the Minister because I am acutely aware of the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West has now castigated me twice for offering the hand of friendship across the Room. I shall obviously be reluctant to make further gestures of friendship.
<P>
We accept the Minister's second assurance on the use of orders for further variation. However, she must understand that the matter is not a parliamentary game: we are genuinely concerned that we are about to make a terrible mistake with the Bill. We tabled the amendment because we want the Bill to work and, on that basis, given the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw it.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 109, in page 71, leave out lines 35 and 36.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We now come to the matter which exercised the hon. Member for Colne Valley, who criticised us strongly for being on the side of rich fathers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Far from attacking the toffs, the matter is a fundamental attack on middle England. A Government Member was kind enough to lend me a copy of the White Paper, although I have since retrieved my copy. I shall refer to the ready reckoner, which appears on pages 59 to 65. It contains helpful calculations demonstrating how people would pay according to their liability or net income per week. We shall discuss net income later, but, for the moment, let us take those figures as gospel.
<P>
Liability stops at roughly £505 a week in relation to someone's net income. Perhaps the implied assumption is that someone with an income above that would be capped. If not, I dare say that the ready reckoner would go on for many more pages. Committee members will know that that weekly net income is equivalent to a salary of a little more than £26,000 a year net, or £35,500 gross.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is paid about £70,000 a year. I have not the slightest doubt that she is worth every penny. However, she is hardly a toff, indeed, she would be offended if I described her as being well heeled. Yet her income is well above the sums involved. I do not want to personalise the matter, so I shall I take the salary of someone in another place and examine the Lord Chancellor, who earns about £152,000 or £153,000 a year. That is quite a lot of money. If someone with that salary were assessed, he would pay about £5,500 in child maintenance, but no more.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Under the variation scheme, surely home decoration costs would be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend shows a wicked desire to bring politics into the matter. Considering the Lord Chancellor's eminence, I was gently circumventing the matter and did not want to imply anything about his personal circumstances. I am merely discussing salary and the cap. The Lord Chancellor's wallpaper expenses and lifestyle do not come into it. Under the new formula the Lord Chancellor would pay £14,000. ``Good,'' My hon. Friend might say, ``Good, less money to spend on wallpaper.''
<P>
However, that is not why we set up the Child Support Agency. We did not establish it as a new method for distributing sums between aggrieved parties. This morning, the Under-Secretary agreed that we should not extend arguments between former spouses, but said that the system could not be made perfect. She is probably right about that. Indeed, she was also right to say that I was an idealist. However, we should not go out of our way to create a system that is more likely to be used by warring former spouses. We should not set up a system that will be used by aggrieved parties wishing to slug it out on another level.
<P>
A new concept in English law is being created, which will have a great impact on people of relatively modest means: it is the concept that a child has a right to share m a parent's income. People may say that that is rather a good idea. However, no such right currently exists, and certainly does not exist in a happy and harmonious relationship. Next door neighbours with relatively modest incomes may each have a child, one with separated parents, the other with parents living together. One child has a right to share in the family's wealth and the other does not.
<P>
Currently, a child has an expectation that it will share in the family's wealth. That is entirely reasonable. The measure is a way of redistributing wealth between the parties. The Select Committee said that there will be only a handful of such cases; indeed, that was my initial reaction. However, those cases will grab the headlines. At the precise time when we are bedding in the new system, trying to get general acceptance, dealing with the backlog and getting a set of people into a new arrangement, we will be told a series of stories. Ordinary people will say, ``I told you the system wasn't fair: look at this.''
<P>
One does not need much imagination to guess the stories that will appear, such as footballers estranged from their spouses. That is the stuff of the tabloids. It may titillate a readership who enjoy a celebrity's misfortune. However, that is not my concern. I am anxious that the new arrangements achieve a high degree of public acceptance.
<P>
I am worried about whether the European convention on human rights allows us to do what we want to in the Bill. I saw in yesterday's Hansard an interesting response from the Minister on whether the Bill would comply with the European convention on human rights, but she did not address the point that I want to make—she was discussing the withdrawing of benefit. Surely, under this system, we will see a straightforward piece of spousal maintenance being redistributed without judicial determination. It is that lack of judicial determination that potentially puts us in breach of the convention; as that is now part of our law, we must comply with it.
<P>
I am of the view, which I am sure you share, Sir David—I hope that all hon. Members share it—that it is preferable for the House to make decisions on law, rather than placing matters in the hands of judges. There should be an upper limit—the limit which we suggest is reasonably high—because we are, after all, talking about the maintenance of children. I want to quote, with approval, a recommendation of the Select Committee on Social Security. Paragraph 17 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The percentages are based on the perceived cost of a child rather than on the ability to pay of the non-resident parents.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
In the example of the Lord Chancellor, maintenance jumped from £5,000 to £14,000. No one could possibly make a case for a child's maintenance to be £14,000; that is clearly ridiculous. Perhaps I may compare that with a further, very well-written statement from an amendment to paragraph 40 in the original draft of the report at the bottom of page xlii, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In the final analysis, the child support formula should be seen clearly to be related to the cost of bringing up children and not as a straightforward `tax' levied on a non-resident parent. We recommend that the Government should re-examine the possibility of inserting in the legislation an upper limit on the automatic application of the revised CSA formula.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, that is not in the final draft of the report. The original draft at least has the merit of being consistent with, and flowing naturally from, the evidence.
<P>
I have read the report carefully. Distinguished members of the Select Committee are sitting on both sides of this Committee and they may want to correct me. The report is a lengthy document and it could be that I have missed evidence suggesting how desirable the other approach would be. However, the Select Committee chose not to go along with a proposed upper limit. It said on page xix that it was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``persuaded by the case that the children of wealthier parents should have the right to continue to share in their parental wealth. We therefore do not support the introduction of an upper limit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I have clearly demonstrated, we are not talking only about high-profile people such as footballers, who I suspect must earn salaries considerably greater than that of the Lord Chancellor. The ready reckoner in the White Paper shows that not only famous footballers will come to our surgeries, but people from middle England. I am pleased to say that I represent a town with several famous residents, but we are talking about ordinary people on ordinary levels of income.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): Does my hon. Friend agree that our amendments will not prevent children from sharing the wealth of their parents? We are seeking to prevent the situation from becoming iniquitous to all parties involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend anticipates the point that I was about to make, and I am grateful for it. There is some consensus about what we are attempting, so one tends to argue a little aggressively on points about which we disagree. Sometimes we do not state the obvious. Under the law, people can rightly share wealth with their children. However, it makes no sense to create a situation whereby children of a particular circumstance will have a right to share in a non-resident parent's wealth. That right does not exist for children in any other circumstance.
<P>
Despite the Committee being full of distinguished hon. Members, no one has corrected me and said that there were lots of compelling reasons to demonstrate clearly why there should be no upper limit. The Select Committee was still worried and tabled a motion stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We accept that there is a risk that a few high-profile cases involving payments above the maximum contribution may negatively affect public perception.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those words were pooh-poohed by Government Members and I received a lot of heckling when I quoted them on the sittings motion. However, a risk exists. I have no idea why hon. Members tabled that motion, but, with respect, I believe that they have done the law no service, and that it will cause quite a mess.
<P>
Someone wrote to us to say that we shall place children in better financial positions than they would have been in if they been the offspring of happy and harmonious marriages. Although it would be a ridiculous flight of fancy to say that that would encourage parents to split, there is undoubtedly a financial incentive involved. One might say that that was part of social policy, that we want to do it, and that it is another way to redistribute wealth. Although it is not what I think would be the most sensible way to do so, that is a legitimate political view to hold.
<P>
One would think that there would be another step, however, which would be to ensure that the money distributed in that way went to the child. The Bill provides no means of creating a mechanism whereby that could happen. Without an upper limit, all we have is a way to redistribute the money between the two spouses. If in that redistribution that money is not passed on to the child, the child has no recourse. If the child is denied food and shelter, there is recourse, under various legislation, but if the extra £1,000, £10,000 or £100,000 a year—in most cases we are talking about middle England, so it would not be £100,000—is not passed on and is used just for the purposes of the parent who has care, the child has no recourse to law. If the Bill represents a new venture and a new concept in English law because it gives children a right, rather than an exception, to share in the wealth of the family, we should at least do them the courtesy of ensuring that that money goes to them.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Given our earlier discussion, does not the hon. Gentleman accept that whether a family is of medium means or very wealthy, the child has a share in the family's lifestyle? This morning I contended that children should at the very least have shelter, clothing, and warmth, but does it not follow that, if a father lives in a six-bedroomed house and the mother in a two-bedroomed terraced house, the child does not share in the lifestyle of the father?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The tragedy is that nothing in the Bill ensures that the child will benefit from a share of that six-bedroomed house. It achieves only redistribution of wealth between the spouses. If the hon. Lady wants to table amendments and to announce that the Government will set up a trust fund or find other ways of ensuring that the child benefits, there would be some merit in what she said. As it is, there is no merit in it. The hon. Lady must grasp the fact—which is as plain as a pikestaff when one looks at the ready reckoner—that when Secretaries of State say, ``You can see the figures at a glance'', the assumption is that they do not go beyond a person of relatively modest salary. The highest salary quoted is £35,000 a year—that is more than a lot of people earn, but it is a lot less than anyone in this Room earns, excluding the good folks in the Public Gallery.
<P>
So we are not talking about people in six-bedroomed houses. In many cases, we are talking about the neighbours—ordinary people from the Prime Minister classically described as middle England. I have to say to Labour Members that when the Prime Minister asks who on earth was on the Bill, it is Labour Members' names that will be given. I do not think that I will be blamed for it—the Prime Minister will not care one way or the other what my views are. We are making social legislation on the basis of a whim—someone's passing idea.
<P>
If there is a logic to the measure, the Government should for goodness sake tell us what it is so that we can argue the point. If it is social engineering, they should say so. If the Child Support Agency is about something more than supporting children, they should say so. The Bill is a back way of levying taxation. One might think that that is a laudable aim, but we must bear in mind the way in which the CSA will be able to unravel settlements. Under various settlements, everything will be taken into account—property, trusts, pensions and so on. Nobody will try to reach an accommodation because within less than a year an aggrieved spouse will be able to go straight back to the CSA, a larger slice of income will be taken away and the child will not receive a penny piece of the share of the wealth. I hope that we will face reality and stop talking about wealthy absent parents.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I apologise for intervening on my hon. Friend's most interesting exposition, but is he aware that a family with an income of up to £38,000 can claim working families tax credit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is a most interesting point, but that family would have to have as many children as the von Trapp family. The point had completely escaped me and it shows that the schedule will cause enormous problems. It achieves nothing—not even the social aims that the Select Committee suggested. Not a penny piece will go to the child. The schedule will simply redistribute the resources of a failed relationship. The CSA should be securing good, generous maintenance for children and ensuring that it is paid; it should not be rewriting old divorce settlements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Sir David.
<P>
I find it odd that our amendments have been grouped with amendments with which we do not sympathise. Our aim is to question the rationale of including percentages in paragraph 2 of schedule 1. We all accept that there must be rough justice—it must be roughly right or roughly wrong—because rough justice is better than no justice at all, although we would all broadly support a simpler formula. Liberal Democrats would prefer a different system, but must amend the system that the Government intend to pursue to ensure that rough justice is not inappropriately rough. Under the schedule, however, that rough justice might become crude and inflexible rough justice.
<P>
How confident are the Government that the proposed percentages—15, 20 or 25 per cent.—are appropriate? They are clearly rounded figures and we do not know the basis on which they were reached. We are still grappling with who will gain and who will lose: we are walking into uncertain circumstances. We need measures to improve the system, but it is unnecessary to build those percentages into the Bill. They should be introduced through regulation, as our amendment makes clear. Evidence from the Select Committee suggests that when it comes to the percentages, the jury is still out. The report refers to international comparisons, which are interesting, but we must ask how applicable they are to the United Kingdom.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, we query the logic of incorporating such a level of detail in primary legislation. It is unusual for the Government to tie their hands in this way and they have not explained why. Illustrative percentages may be useful for the purposes of debate, so that we are clear about the Government's thinking. However, we cannot understand why the Government wish to build them into primary legislation—effectively for all time, until we return to the debate five years hence, as we will if the system is still failing.
<P>
The Bill refers to income net of tax. Income tax is variable but, as our debate has revealed, so are council tax, VAT, car tax, petrol tax and others. The variables alter at the behest of the Government. If they all increase and child support fails to take account of that, it will remain an unhelpful constant. If the percentages in the Bill are either too harsh or not harsh enough, the Minister will require primary legislation to overturn the decisions taken by the House of Commons. That is our fundamental concern. The Select Committee came to a clear conclusion on an issue about which, as the report makes clear, it felt most strongly. Primary legislation will be necessary to change the percentages.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) could not be with us today. He is overloaded with duties elsewhere and did not choose to be a member of this Committee. He is not here, so on the basis of what the hon. Member for St. Ives says, do the Liberal Democrats now accept the principle of percentages?
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I made the Liberal Democrat position clear in my opening remarks on Tuesday. We prefer a court welfare system to tinkering around with existing legislation. As to the percentages, we want a simplified formula, but if at a later stage it becomes clear that the 15 per cent. level is too high or too low, it will show how inappropriate it is to have the figure built into the Bill.
<P>
Although we query the principle behind the Government's attempt to deal with the problems that the existing child support legislation has created, we intend to engage constructively in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has already engaged in the debate positively and constructively, and although I have come rather late to it, I am proud to have had the opportunity to engage in it. It is legitimate to question the logic and appropriateness of incorporating percentages as explicitly as they have been in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Perhaps I can put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. Paragraph 10A(1)(a) provides for amendment of the prescribed rates by regulation, should that prove necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I appreciate the Under-Secretary's drawing my attention to that provision. How confident is she that the percentages specified in paragraph 2 are adequate for the purposes of implementation of the Bill? How often will she review them?
<P>
On the Tory amendments that are grouped with ours, I would not want to be in the circumstances with which we are dealing, as I am sure other hon. Members will agree. However, if I were separated, divorced and a non-resident parent, and lucky enough to be wealthy—which I am not—I would want to ensure that my natural children shared in that, just as they would have to share in my poverty if I were poor. If we must include an upper limit in the Bill, I would consider another proposal that the Conservatives have appropriately drawn to our attention. A parent with care may become wealthy through partnership or marriage with someone who is wealthy or through a windfall gain, such as a lottery win or an inheritance, while the non-resident parent lives in penury. Such circumstances would raise serious questions about the Bill and call it into disrepute, and in such circumstances perhaps an upper limit would be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> To return to the first circumstance that the hon. Gentleman described, in which he fancied himself as fortunate in being wealthy but unfortunate in being divorced and therefore having to make such payments, nothing would prevent him from continuing to allow his children to share in his wealth by making additional voluntary payments. Would he want to be constrained by an upper limit?
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> It is a matter of principle that we as a Parliament and as a society would want to endorse in the Bill that fact that, irrespective of income and wealth, the children living with the parent with care should share in the circumstances of the non-resident parent, whether it be wealth or, as sadly happens in some cases—we want to improve this—poverty. I cannot see why those who are particularly wealthy should be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I am not entirely sure what he is saying. It could be yes, no or maybe. If he thinks that it is so important and a matter of principle—we are talking about wealthy people, whom I call middle England—is he not slightly concerned that there is nothing in the Bill to pass that wealth to the child?
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I agree. The primary purpose of the Bill is to support the child, not to support adults. If the hon. Gentleman and the Minister can tell us that there are ways of ensuring that the benefit of that income, that wealth, that child maintenance is conveyed to the child and not salted away by the parent with care, we would clearly wish to support that, but, fundamentally, we cannot support the Conservative amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 65 and 66. It is always important to understand why an organisation has been set up. As I understand it, although I was not in the House at the time, the Child Support Agency was set up to make payments to spouses or partners with care so that the state did not have to carry the burden of that cost. It is right that it should have been set up to do that.
<P>
I understand that the Government want to move that on now and to talk about relieving child poverty, which is commendable. As regards taking the burden off the state, I would quote from the Select Committee report. I was not a member of the Select Committee when the report was written, although I am now. Mr. Nicholas Mostyn QC, who has been quoted before, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A child has no more right than the right to be maintained or supported.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important principle. The Families Need Fathers group questioned what right the state has, so long as it is not picking up the bill, to determine how much one partner should give to another partner or ex-partner.
<P>
That, too, is an important point. I certainly agree that the absent spouse—the spouse without care—should make payments to the ex-partner. But after taking the partner with care beyond the range of social security, is it really for the state to determine how much should be paid?
<P>
I have sympathy with the argument that the child should to some extent enjoy the parents' wealth. In an earlier intervention I said that our amendments do not restrict that too much. They would enable the child to enjoy the parents' wealth, but there are good arguments for setting a limit.
<P>
Many people who come to my surgeries—I am sure that the same is true of my colleagues' surgeries—say that their ex-spouse has not paid them any money and they need the money to look after the children. But parents without care also come to our surgeries complaining about the CSA, saying that they have been unfairly assessed. The parent without care also has a right to consideration and should not be unfairly treated. He—if it is a he, as it usually is, although not always—is entitled to a good standard of living himself, and it is important that he is protected. We should not pass legislation that ignores the plight of that person. I remind colleagues that 50 per cent. of the time it is that person who comes to the constituency surgery with a complaint. Although it is beyond the remit of this debate, I am worried about the way in which net income will be calculated, because of the uncertainties involved. It is important that we look after the person who does not have care of the child.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Colne Valley asked whether it was right that one parent should have a six-bedroomed house while the parent with care has a two-bedroomed house. As I said in a speech the other day, I am fortunate that my daughter lives with me and my wife. If I had to choose between a six-bedroomed house and some money, and a two-bedroomed house—which I have lived in for most of my life—with my child, I would choose the latter. The Committee cannot make compassionate judgments or compensate the parent who does not live with the child, but it can be conscious that there is more to this than money. We can probably only discuss money, but we should take into account the fact that the circumstances of the parent without care change considerably when he does not live with his child.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford:</B> On Tuesday, the hon. Gentleman made similar points. The Committee should not try to substitute money for affection, or buy time with children. That is a dangerous road to go down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am glad that the hon. Lady remembered my speech, although I am sure that it was not that memorable. I accept that it is difficult for the Committee to do anything about the fact that a parent is estranged from his children. We should perhaps recognise, however, that the circumstances of that parent have changed. There should be a way not of compensating him but of recognising that his life is different. People who do not have children or family responsibilities might be able to earn more money—they might want to work all day and all night, or work abroad to earn more money, because they have nothing else to do with their lives. Therefore, there should be a cap on what the CSA can charge.
<P>
Others might argue that the spouse who has care cannot earn as much, which is a valid point. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, however, this is not a question of giving money from spouse to spouse. It is about giving money to enable the child to have a reasonable standard of living. Baroness Hollis is quoted in the report as saying that it should be a matter not of spousal maintenance but of the child benefiting. However, the Bill provides no such guarantee. I accept that such a guarantee would be difficult to reach, and I would hope for cross-party consensus to try to achieve it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, there is no guarantee that the child would benefit from money passing from one spouse to another. I shall not rehearse the figures that he quoted, but he argued eloquently that, even with a limit, that would be difficult to achieve. Our proposed limit is quite high. I shall not try to work out the figures, but a significant sum of money would go from spouse to spouse. We do not want to restrict the provisions too tightly. We are making two points—that we want a limit, and that our proposed limit is quite high.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The limit is £200,000 gross income a year, or £140,000 net.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> That is rather a lot of money, which is the point that I was making. I do not want to repeat arguments that have already been advanced—
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister's intervention is interesting. We wanted to examine not a person's income but the level at which children are maintained, and we were seeking not to help the Lord Chancellor's figures but to provide a high cap relating to children. If someone suggests that the £400 figure should be £600, we should be flexible about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend has examined the figures in greater detail than I have, and I agree with him. The limit of £400 per qualifying child is quite high. When the sums are added together, a sizeable figure would be reached. However, I shall end there because I do not want to cover ground that my hon. Friend has already gone over. I endorse all his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> On amendments Nos. 117 and 65, I reiterate what I said on Tuesday during our debate on the sittings motion: that a cynical view of our proceedings might suggest that the Opposition do not want their amendments to be adopted—they want the Bill to be bad and the Government to take the blame.
<P>
When I placed my name against amendment No. 65, I acted against my principles, but I did so to improve the Bill. My principle has always been that I disapprove of secondary legislation—I want all legislation to be primary legislation. As a result, we should have much less legislation, but we should be better governed. In this context, I have supported an amendment that would remove words from the Bill and suggested that the matter should be dealt with in secondary legislation, but I did so in an honest attempt to improve the Bill.
<P>
The Government appear to be digging themselves into an enormous hole. I cannot imagine why the Minister will not accept amendments Nos. 117 and 65. If the Government have developed a fondness for the percentages, they can have them. If the amendments were agreed to, the system would be much more flexible and the Government would have an increased ability to alter the percentages. The Select Committee on Social Security was unanimous in that regard. The hon. Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and for Hendon may have changed their views and decided to vote against the amendments, but by what logic would they have done so? The Social Security Committee cast the aspersion that there was nothing especially scientific about the percentages. To be fair, Baroness Hollis returned with a substantial pile of learned papers that showed that thought had gone into the percentages. However, the Social Security Committee was not persuaded that they were right.
<P>
The key principle that the Social Security Committee enunciated was that whatever the percentages were, they had to be achievable. That has not been established in relation to the Government's figures. Labour Members should retain the flexibility of being able to change it quickly if it does not work. I therefore suggest that amendments Nos. 117 and 65 should be accepted.
<P>
I turn to amendment No. 66. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who said that a great issue of principle was involved because a new right was being created. That is why I voted, during the proceedings of the Select Committee to which he referred, to retain the original words rather than the words that now appear in the Committee's report. Rights must be balanced by responsibilities. In what way does a child's responsibility change as a consequence of family breakdown? Do children who live in an intact family enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as those in a family that has broken down? What additional responsibilities have been placed on the children of a family that has broken down that entitles them to this additional right that an ordinary child will not enjoy? The ordinary child enjoys the right to be maintained—to have a decent standard of living that is consistent with the parents' income—but the child who is unfortunate enough to be in a family that has broken down will enjoy the additional right of an increasing percentage of the parents' income. That is wrong.
<P>
However, I found myself to be entirely out of sympathy with what my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) said. When he quoted the cases of parents saying, ``But I deserve a standard of living'', I was reminded of my earlier preoccupation in the Select Committee, which was to be able to take a normative stance of disapproval and say, ``Well, you should have thought of that before you landed yourself in this position.'' That reminded me of my thought process on the proceedings of the Select Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and I voted against changing the paragraph in the proceedings. However, we did not subsequently vote against that paragraph standing part of the report. I began to wonder why that was. Why had I voted against the new right, but not then voted to take the entire paragraph out of the report?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Because my hon. Friend did what he was told.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> No—I remember my thought processes. My hon. Friend will recall the beginning of the Select Committee's proceedings, when the Baroness was present. In many respects, his questioning mirrored mine. We shared a preoccupation about what I described as the normative aspects of the White Paper and the Bill—namely, what should and should not be the case. That is not just a question of the Bill's practical implications.
<P>
My questioning was along the following lines. Should we not build into the Bill an expression of society's disapproval at certain states of affairs? In particular, should we not build in disincentives or measures to prevent family breakdown in the first place? Should we not create a principle of less eligibility, so that people who find themselves in such circumstances, unfortunate as that may be, will have a life that is less eligible than if they had not so arranged their affairs or made such a lifestyle choice as to deliver themselves into that condition? In other words, parents should think very carefully before countenancing the breakdown of a family. I have no doubt that families in that position do enter those thought processes, but what can we put in the Bill to create additional caveats for them to think about? Here we have discovered one.
<P>
A wealthy man who contemplates the breakdown of his family will face a penalty under the clause. Previously, he would have expected to part with only a reasonable amount of money to maintain his child with decency. Now, if he countenances the breakdown of his family, the child will have a right to a proportion of his income. His financial affairs will be less eligible as a consequence of the breakdown of that family. A new right is being created for the child to compensate for the breakdown of the family, and the father—it is usually the father—will be punished by having a greater proportion of his income taken. That is a proper principle of less eligibility to have in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury reminded me of my thought processes during the proceedings of the Select Committee, so I ask my hon. Friends to rescue me and persuade me of the merits of amendment No. 65, to which I put my name, now that I have discovered those arguments against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend referred to the wealthy partner contemplating the breakdown of the marriage, but it may not be his decision.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall be brief, but I want to tease out from the Minister why she believes that the annual income of a parent without care who pays £400 a week would be £200,000. Depending on the number of children, the figure would be £400, £800 or £1,200 a week. When multiplied by 52 it would be £20,800, £41,600 or £62,400. If that is 25 per cent. of the income—

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Net.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have not reached that yet.
<P>
Those figures represent 25 per cent. of the net income, so they must be multiplied by four, to which tax and national insurance must be added. I would have thought that a parent with one child would have to be earning around £120,000, a parent with two children would have to be earning £200,000 and a parent with three children would have to be earning £300,000. We are discussing people whose incomes vary dramatically. Those who are earning £200,000 or £300,000 would be better off sorting out their affairs through the courts, but we are also discussing people with one child paying £400 a week when they earn £130,000
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I apologise to my hon. Friend, but there is nothing special about the figure of £400. I considered tabling a series of amendments stating £100, £200, £300 and £400. I would drop dead with shock if the Under-Secretary accepted a particular figure, but I wanted to discuss the principle. If she could be persuaded by our argument, I am sure that she could consider the matter and come up with a sensible figure. I am not hung up on the £400 figure.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed, nor am I. However, I would hate the thought to go into the ether that everyone earning £200,000 would have to pay a blanket maintenance charge. I am, therefore, equally flexible on the level of the upper earnings limit, but I agree with my hon. Friends that there should be such a limit. That may be one imposed by choice because people may choose to go through the courts. However, as I have said, a huge variation in income is required to make that decision. That is why it is common sense to have an upper earnings limit, so that people are clear about where they stand. I understand that it is one of the main aims of the Bill to get clarity into the system, and we thought that we might help the Government by putting a figure in, whatever figure it might be.
<P>
I also accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar about the potential for social engineering, in not having a figure for the upper earnings limit. I am worried that there could be a temptation for those earning reasonable sums of money—middle Englanders, as we say and firmly believe who feel that their maintenance payments are too high. Given that a marriage breakdown is not an amicable agreement, it would add to the resentment of a parent if they felt that too much of their income was being taken away. We already see it at the lower end of the income scale, but there is also a problem at the upper end.
<P>
The area most difficult to deal with is that of the self-employed, who have, in the past, been able to get away with not paying maintenance at all. They may possibly form a percentage of the 30,000 who do not pay, as the Under Secretary said earlier. One element of a difficult situation, in which emotions are running high, could be removed by putting in an upper earnings limit. I urge the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> When my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar introduced the amendment this afternoon, he quoted the example of the Lord Chancellor. He was not doing that in order to tease, but using it as an example which provides convenient figures given to the Select Committee. It is, therefore, a serious point. When one thinks through this issue, one comes inescapably to the conclusion that the Minister responsible for the Bill was right to say, originally, that she had an open mind on the issue.
<P>
There has to be an upper limit for those on higher incomes. That can be illustrated by the example of someone on the same salary as the Lord Chancellor, who nets £92,000 a year and who, at present, would have a liability of £5,600. If there is no ceiling, he will have to contribute £14,000 a year for one child. Hon. Members say, rightly, that a child has a right to share in the wealth of both parents. However, assuming that the money goes to the child—a matter to which I shall return in a moment—are they seriously contending that any child has a right in law to £14,000 a year? A child has a right to be maintained by his parents—to be housed, to be educated, to be fed, to be clothed and to be looked after—but not at a cost of £14,000 a year.
<P>
I have a much-loved child called Theodore, who is aged two and a half. I am fortunate because I live with my wife, so the problem does not arise. Theodore is not entirely logical about what he needs in life. His most important possession is currently a three-horned dinosaur, which he calls Sarah. We were given Sarah during the Kids' Club party before Christmas; I reckon that it is worth about £2.50. Theodore does not care about his clothes or about what he eats: he cares about Sarah and about how many dinosaurs he has. If I were an absent parent earning what the Lord Chancellor earns, Theodore could buy 5,000 Sarahs. That would be ridiculous, but the example illustrates the absurdity of establishing a system by which a child is entitled to a set sum—it makes no sense.
<P>
If we did not amend the Bill, we would create a system unique in the world. Every other country that has addressed the problem has an upper earnings limit. In Australia, that limit is sensibly set at 2.5 times national earnings. I would have thought that we could have compromised. It will be ludicrous to have no ceiling.
<P>
The evidence given to the Select Committee suggests that we may be in breach of the European convention on human rights because the measure would be disguised spousal maintenance. There might be a transfer of £15,000 from an absent father to a mother with care. Members of the Committee will accept that it is hard to spend that much on a child—some of the money will be used to maintain the wife or former wife. That would be disguised spousal maintenance, which at least one person who came before the Select Committee thought would be in breach of the convention, The Government should therefore think carefully about the matter.
<P>
The issue need not be party political—it is entirely a matter of common sense. It will be said that I am picking a rare example—that only a tiny proportion of the population earns such an income. However, as has already been explained, we may not be talking merely about high court or circuit judges but about police inspectors, head masters of a middle-sized comprehensive school or of MPs. Such people are, admittedly, professionals, but they are not the super rich. Many hundreds of thousands of people on a similar salary might pay what they consider to be absurd sums because the maximum payment is not capped. Such a person would know that the sum was not being used entirely for the maintenance of his children, but was being passed on to his wife.
<P>
The evidence given to the Select Committee by Families Need Fathers has not been mentioned. I know that the organisation is unpopular, but we must be fair—we cannot put the opinion of only one side. The organisation came up with useful evidence, which I commend to the Committee—it appears on page 117 of the report. It is not extreme but sensible. In the report, it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Failure to impose a maximum payment or taper for high earners will undermine entirely the argument that `the money is for the child'. This will affect the credibility of the new system and hinder compliance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would have thought that that statement was unremarkable rather than extreme. It does not come from people who say that they do not want to pay anything: they say that the argument that the money is for the child will be undermined.
<P>
The correspondence that we receive from the Child Support Agency makes it clear that the agency is all about money for the child rather than money for the adult. Families Needs Fathers proposes that child support should be tapered for high earners or capped, perhaps at twice the average income. The Australians do that and it is entirely sensible.
<P>
In conclusion—the hon. Member for Colne Valley and others have repeatedly made this point—we accept that children should share the life style of their parents. But that is not what the Bill is about; its purpose is to ensure that children are maintained.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We should encourage absent fathers to share parenting as a way of getting involved in their children—an idea that is advocated by Families Need Fathers. If we talk about the rights of children to share the lives of their parents, we should emphasise the broken relationships, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury alluded. Many fathers are depressed because they do not have sufficient contact with their children. They are often not allowed to have the contact that they want.
<P>
There are procedures in the Bill to encourage fathers to take more interest in their children. A major social problem in modern society is that too many fathers lose contact with their children or see too little of them. We should concentrate on the right of a child to be part of the father's life. The idea that we can put a child on the right road in life by saying that he or she has an absolute right to 15 per cent. of the father's income, whatever that father is earning, is not justice; it is nonsensical. We cannot make children happy by giving them money. Instead, we need to provide love and care. If we do not set a cap, we might make relationships more bitter and divided. Our proposal is not radical or surprising. It has been tried in other societies. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not dismiss it out of hand, but reconsider it and examine all the facts.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Amendments Nos. 65 and 66 would restrict the amount of maintenance payable under the intended percentage calculations to £400 a week for any one child. That would reverse the Government's intention that there should be no upper limit on the amount of maintenance payable and create one child support law for the rich and another for the poor.
<P>
Children should come first, whatever the non-resident parent's income. They should be able to benefit from their parents' wealth and share their standard of living just as if they were still living with them. Let us get this into perspective. Under the new liability calculation, all non-resident parents will keep a minimum of 75 per cent. of their net income, which is less than the current maximum limit. The hon. Member for Beckenham noted that in the vast majority of cases private arrangements will be made in the Courts and the Child Support Agency will not be involved.
<P>
Setting a maximum amount that limits the effect of the percentage-based calculation for non-resident parents with income over a certain level is inconsistent with the Government's plan to introduce a simple and transparent system of rates that protects the rights of all children to receive support from non-resident parents.
<P>
The European convention on human rights features large in our considerations. I assure Opposition Members that the Secretary of State's declaration on the front of the Bill is not there on a whim. It has been the subject of a great deal of legal advice. We are confident that the measures in the Bill satisfy the requirements of the convention. In addition, we have received legal advice that an upper limit on the amount of maintenance payable would be vulnerable to challenge in the European Court of Human Rights. Arguments about the matter therefore cut both ways and the lawyers gain a great deal of fun and interest from them. The hon. Member for Gainsborough advanced some arguments that he thinks are relevant, but we have legal advice that the introduction of a cap would leave us vulnerable to legal challenge. The Committee could continue in this vein and discuss the European convention on human rights for a very long time; indeed, the theme recurs in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 117 and 118 would remove from the Bill details of the intended percentage rates to be used to calculate child support maintenance. The amendments provide instead for the Secretary of State to prescribe the rates in regulations. I am used to Liberal Democrats wanting provisions to be included in the Bill rather than removed from it, so it has been a unique experience for me to listen to the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), which were the reverse of what I have come to expect. I hope that in my response I reassured him that we have got the balance right. We wanted the Bill to include an upfront declaration of what we think the percentages will be. Obviously, it is only prudent to include a provision enabling us to amend the provisions, especially after our experiences of the formula in the previous Act. We should be able to make amendments without the need for recourse to primary legislation, although the usual protections of parliamentary scrutiny will of course apply.
<P>
It is important that the level of maintenance set is fair to children. We believe that the intended rates strike the right balance between the non-resident parent's responsibility to his children and the need to meet his own expenses. Again, I should refer to the 75 per cent. of net income that such parents retain. They cannot lose more than 25 per cent. of their net income, regardless of the number of children that they have. Other countries have larger percentage rates; in Australia, the corresponding rates for one, two and three or more children are 18, 27 and 32 per cent. of gross income. In New Zealand, they are 18, 24 and 27 per cent. Wisconsin in the United States has corresponding rates of 17, 25 and 29 per cent. Those are just a few examples.
<P>
There are many ways of dealing with the matter, and we have considered other systems in reaching our decision to set the rates at 15, 20 and 25 per cent. The hon. Member for New Forest, West, a member of the Select Committee on Social Security, said that Baroness Hollis had sent the Committee some evidence on how we have settled the rates. The research that she sent shows that the base rate of 15 per cent. is roughly half the average amount that a two-parent family spends on a child. In larger families, less is spent on each individual child but overall spending is more. The higher rates of 20 per cent. for two children and 25 per cent. for three or more children are designed to reflect that.
<P>
To ensure that non-resident families on low incomes are left with sufficient means to live on, they will be asked to pay less. A reduced rate of liability will be payable where the non-resident parent's net weekly income is more than £100 but less than £200. Non-resident parents with incomes of £100 a week or less will pay a flat rate of £5, which is lower than the current lowest rate of £5.35.
<P>
Parents on benefit have as much responsibility for their children's upkeep as those with earnings, so non-resident parents who receive social security benefits will also pay the flat rate of £5, removing some of the current exemptions. Removing the intended percentages from the Bill, as the amendment proposes, is therefore inconsistent with the Government's plan for a simple and transparent reform of the child maintenance system, which will protect the rights of all children to support from both parents.
<P>
We have consulted on the figures for a long time since the publication of the Green Paper. We have had many meetings with interested organisations and many minutes of evidence containing comments on the rates have been sent to us as well as to the Select Committee. It would cause consternation if the rates were not included in the Bill and if I said that we would put them in regulations later. Had I done so, I would have been subjected to a hostile barrage from Conservative Members telling me that I had to make things more explicit, but I hope that we have struck a balance between putting the percentages that we think are about right in the Bill, and retaining the flexibility to vary them in future if there is evidence to the contrary.

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): In planning for the implementation of these changes when the Bill is enacted, can the Under-Secretary say whether the Government have in mind a period in which they will consider the workings of the changes in percentages before using the regulation-making powers to vary them? Over what period will they be considered?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I was about to come to that matter. Amendment No. 109 removes the power to make regulations changing the percentage rate. If that were in the Bill, we would be stuck with the rates in primary legislation.
<P>
The provision to change is a sensible precaution to allow us to change the fixed rates should future changes in society or children's costs make that necessary. I hope that all members of the Committee will be pleased to note that we do not intend to use the provision before the child support reforms come into effect. We have no current plans to depart from the simple and transparent 15, 20 and 25 per cent. basis for child support liability. We spoke earlier about predicting the future; I cannot, of course, predict exactly what might be needed in future, and members of the Committee would not expect me to do so. That being so, the regulation-making power gives us a fallback position and the flexibility to react to future circumstances.
<P>
To put his mind at rest, I can tell the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) that we do not envisage changing the percentages in the near future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I listened to the Under-Secretary. It was noticeable that she did not say how the amount would go to the child.
<P>
I emphasise that the £400 is not set in concrete; it is important to note that the amount is in the spirit of the Bill, which sets maintenance with regard to the child, not to the parent's income. In that respect, it is no different from the upper limit that the Government sought to impose by setting a 25 per cent. maximum; it is therefore consistent. The hon. Lady said various interesting things about the legal advice available in respect of the European Convention on Human Rights which—I summarise it—is that the indecision of the lawyers is final. I should therefore like an opportunity to reflect on the clause and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]
