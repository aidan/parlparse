We might not have the opportunity for another 40years to deal with common land. It is therefore our duty to give theBill full scrutiny and attention so that we can put it in a form thatwill serve the interests of not only landowners and rights holders, butthe public who regard commons as an important national resource fortheir recreation, nature conservation and other conservation issues.

The clause says, &#147;Regulationsmay&#148;. Throughout the Bill, there are many issues relating tocommons that would be subject to regulation. The Minister said jokinglyon one occasion that there will be enough statutory instruments inrelation to the Bill to see us through our parliamentary careers.Looking around the room, in terms of longevity, perhaps my hon. Friendthe Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson) has more chance of seeinganother Bill relating to commons than most of us. That being the case,we are concerned that the form of the regulation is not obviouslyclear.</div><a name="06042581000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any regulationthat allows information to be put on a register raises data protectionand human rights issues. We are concerned about the nature of theinformation that may be put on the register. I understand that theDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Bill team, in itsguidance document on identifying the ownership of rights of common,said that if not only the dominant tenement was included, but therights pertaining to it and the holder of those rights, that might leadto confusion about who holds the rights, because they refer to thedominant tenement, not a person. The only way to establish who owns thedominant tenement is to refer to the land register. If there were to bea problem in resolving an entry in the commons register and an entry inthe Land Registry, there might be some difficulty in agreeing who wasthe holder of therights.</div><a name="06042581000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having saidthat, I have already had my hand slapped by Mrs. Griffiths, the commonsregistration officer for Powys county council, who says that thecommons registry officers for Powys and the Marches insist that theclause is included in the Bill, and she tells me that she has puttremendous effort and activity into ensuring that that takes place. Herargument for doing so is that it has been helpful to farmers whoexercise rights of common, when claiming subsidies through theintegrated administration and control scheme, and now through thesingle farm payment, because they have been able to prove that theyhave rights overthe common by getting copies of the registerin which Mrs. Griffiths has included the individuals who own therights.</div><a name="06042581000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understandthat Powys county council has been reprimanded by DEFRA for taking thiscourse of action, so we are in quite a difficult position. I shall readbriefly a letter from Mrs.Griffiths:</div><a name="06042581000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Currently,the Rights section of the register shows the name of the originalapplicant for registration (1967-70) against the details of grazing fora particular farm holding. If a farm with grazing rights is sold inlots then application can be made to apportion the grazing rightsbetween the various parties on a pro rata basis according to acreage.We then amend the register and cross out the original 1960s entry andinsert two or more new entries.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="06042581000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">If the farm is transferred, as awhole, to the next generation on the death of the original applicant oris sold in its entirety to a new owner, there is no requirement underthe 1965 Act to amend the register. It is legally correct to show thename of a person who died or moved away 30-plus years ago and this isone of the reasons why the register needsupdating.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Shegives an example from the area that she administers of the importanceof entering the names of rightsholders:</div><a name="06042581000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When...Llanbedrand Llandeilo hill (Ireland moor) went into the ESA, Maureen Lloyd, thecommoners&#146; association secretary, had to ensure that theregister was amended to show all the current commoners&#146; nameswere in the register or else they wouldn&#146;t receive payments foragreeing to reduce the number of animals grazing on thecommon.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is itthe Minister&#146;s intention that as a result of clause 3, commonsregistration authorities will include the names of the holders ofcommon rights? If so, that goes against the advice of the Bill team,which is a problem. We are concerned that the register, a publicdocument, might contain unnecessary information or information thatrights holders do not want to be there.</div><a name="06042581000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (5) says thatregulations may</div> <a name="06042581000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;requireor permit other information to be included in aregister&#148;.</div><a name="06042581000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not havea problem with &#147;permit&#148;, but we do with&#147;require&#148;. The provision is so open-ended that it wouldallow the publication of lots of quiteimproper andunnecessary information&#151;perhaps even information that goesagainst the nature of the legislation. Will the Minister respondpositively, indicating how he envisages that the regulation will actand what will be init?</div><a name="06042581000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000395"></a>JimKnight:</b> I would be pleased if the hon. Gentleman passed onmy best wishes to Mrs. Griffiths of Powys council, who clearly showswisdom. We will return to the registration of ownership of rights whenwe discuss clause 8 and the interesting issue of apportionment, so Ishall not dwell on it unduly.</div><a name="06042581000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The register&#146;s coreelements are the land register and the rights register. The landregister contains a conclusive record of the extent of common land andgreens, and the rights register contains a conclusive record of thenature and quantification of rights exercisable over the land to whichthey are attached.</div><a name="06042581000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power in subsection (5) isintended to amplify what can or must be shown in the register. Forexample, we expect to provide that the registers may continue to showall the additional information&#151;information about mineral rightsand public rights of access, for example&#151;that the 1965 Actpermitted them to show. That the register should continue to show thatinformation does not raise any new data registration or human rightsissues.</div><a name="06042581000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have alsoproposed that commoners should be able to enter in the register adeclaration of their entitlement to exercise rights of common when theyown the land to which such rights are attached. I think that thatanswers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question&#151;they would be ableto register those rights, but would not necessarily have to. We willreturn to that when we discuss apportionment. It is not realistic torequire people to register those rights, because in the real world itwould be difficult to make them do so. The <div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>measures will improve the availability of information about who isentitled to exercise the rights over a particular common. The provisionof such information will be for assistance only, as the informationwill not beconclusive.</div><a name="06042581000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theregulation-making power in subsection (5) is an essential tool forobtaining the information that must be shown in registers undersubsections (1) to (4). The Government will consult on draft proposalsfor regulations under subsection (5), so some of these issues, whichthe hon. Gentleman has rightly raised, will be subject to debate underthose order-making powers and as those orders go through. However, wewill consult, as part of our commitment to consult, on the detailedimplementation of part 1 generally.</div><a name="06042581000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45am</div><a name="06042581000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect ofthe hon. Gentleman&#146;s question as to why we should&#147;require&#148; rather than &#147;permit&#148;, it must bepossible for regulations to require certain additional information tobe included in the register, rather than leave it to theauthorities&#146; discretion, for example, declarations ofentitlements to rights to which I have just referred.

Friends the Members for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) andfor Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) and myself seeks to add alittle flexibility with regard to how commons registration authoritiesmay co-operate with each other in the exercising of their functionsunder the Bill. I, in my quick year as a Member of the House, have seena number of powers passed on to local authorities in all sorts ofareas.

I fear that I may refer to Bodmin moor a few timesduring our proceedings. Cornwall, my own commons registrationauthority, has large areas of common land and therefore has officesdedicated to dealing with it. However, I am sure that smaller or indeedurban local authorities have far fewer commons within their boundariesand therefore may not be able to devote resources to having specificofficer expertise to deal with commonsregistration.</div><a name="06042581000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hopeis that if the Minister accepts the amendment, the commons registrationauthorities will co-operate. Those with more specialism could offer tosupport those that have less. Presumably, there would need to be someagreement on resources on that, should that be a problem. It wouldensure that landowners and people who have rights over common land, inwhichever authority the commons are based, would be able to haverecourse to specialist officers with the time and resources to resolveany issues that may need to be resolved.

Partof the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that if a power is givento a local authority to use another organisation to carry out itsfunctions as a commons registration authority, that organisation wouldbe another commons registration authority, not an agency.</div><a name="06042581000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">To help the Minister a littlebit, I can say that such informal arrangements are already carried outin Wales. The Swansea unitary authority and the Neath Port Talbotunitary authority share a commons registration officer. The Blackmountains in Powys are a series of contiguous commons for which thePowys commons registration officer also holds the registerforthe Herefordshire part. It is a transnational arrangement, not just across-authority arrangement.</div><a name="06042581000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such arrangements happen inpractice.

Thelocal authority, acting as the commons registration authority, willperform its duties in a quasi-judicial form, much as it does in <div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>respect of planning. From my experience of chairing a planning committeeon a local authority, I recall that issues were often controversialwith views held strongly on both sides. I have no reason to doubt thatthat was anything but thenorm.</div><a name="06042581000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Localauthorities are in a good position to perform such duties as long asthey are performed subject to advice. In the same way, when theyperform their duties as a planning authority, they carry out thosefunctions with advice.

Paragraph 50 of the explanatory notescontains an example of a common <div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>that is subject to rights to graze 100 sheep and that is divided equallybetween two farms A and B.

It goes on tosay:</div><a name="06042581000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Farm B issold to a developer who in turn sells it off in 50 plots, each with ahouse built on it.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underthe rules and regulations, the owners of each of those houses</div><a name="06042581000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be able to show that theyoccupy 1/50<span class="Sup">th</span> part of the area of the historic dominanttenement B, and (applying the rules of pro rata apportionment)therefore each has attached to it 1/50<span class="Sup">th</span> of the rightsrecorded as attached to historic dominant tenementB&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06042581000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">namely, onesheep.</div><a name="06042581000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sort ofthing undermines the integrity of the commons and the credibility ofthe system. As I understand it, that is what must happen under the Billas it is drafted. There is no alternative, as somebody once said. Theexample prompts some detailed questions. Obviously, not all thosehouses will occupy exactly one fiftieth of the original area. We mightget into serious fractions of sheep, because some houses occupyslightly more square metres than others, but I set that pointaside.</div><a name="06042581000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although such asituation could happen in many different scenarios, I raise an ideasimply to get the Minister&#146;s response: there should be a systemwhereby the developer who bought plot B ought to be able under certaincircumstances to sever the rights from all the modern houses and giveor sell them back to the association, or make them available for otherrights owners to acquire. That would keep those rights in the hands ofpeople who seriously want them rather than in the hands of those peoplewho buy houses and end up with the right to one sheep.</div><a name="06042581000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that, in somecircumstances, development might mean that house owners would end upwith a number of rights that would have a value. I am not suggestingthat anything should be compulsory, but the developer should have anopportunity to sever the rights. As long as the rights remain on thecommon and must go to a rights holder with a dominant tenement of thecommon, all the principles that the Bill is trying toespouse&#151;principles with cross-Committee and cross-Housesupport&#151;will be retained without leading to the somewhatludicrous and extreme outlined in the explanatory notes, whichnevertheless can and, indeed, does happen.

For example, that may occur when the owner sells only partof his farm holding and retains the remainder. Traditionally, where aland holding is divided between separate new owners, the rights ofcommon attached to that land must be divided between the new owners inproportion to their share of the land, as we have heard in relation tosheep.</div><a name="06042581000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to thehon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that there is an alternative.It is set out in clause 11, which, as we will perhaps discuss, enablesa right of common attached to a dominant tenement to be concentrated onpart of the dominant tenement, where another part is to be developedfor non-agricultural use. I hope that that satisfieshim.</div><a name="06042581000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8 providesthat regulations may enable the registration of apportionment, butsubsection (2) implies, as is our intention, that regulations will notrequire apportionment to be registered, as we discussed in respect ofan earlierclause.</div><a name="06042581000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somestakeholders have asked why we do not ensure the mandatory registrationof apportionment. The answer is a little complex, but to summarise:first, we do not think it possible to require apportionment to beregistered, because there is no sensible sanction that could be appliedin default, nor any likelihood of its enforcement; and secondly, thecommons registers will not show who owns and occupies the land to whicha right is attached. There is little point seeking to registerapportionment, because there will be nothing to change in the registerin consequence of it. The reality is as the hon. Member for Brecon andRadnorshire described it during the debate on clause 3 in respect ofthe Land Registry. We have undertaken to explore whether regulationsunder clause 4 can enable commoners to make a declaration ofentitlement to exercise rights of commonÂ that would be includedin the register as additionalinformation.</div><a name="06042581000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000415"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, but Iam going to challenge him, because I am not entirely convinced thatclause 11, to which he has drawn my attention, addresses the issue thatI raised and that is raised in paragraph 50 of the explanatory notesthat describes the scenario of the whole dominant tenement beingdeveloped.

When I was Environment Ministerin the 1990s, we looked into commons law, and I was advised by theFederation of Cumbria Commoners that it was important that it be tidiedup. Then I listened to the wise advice of my officials in theDepartment, who said, &#147;For God&#146;s sake, Minister,don&#146;t touch this with a bargepole; it&#146;s anightmare.&#148; So I congratulate the Minister on having the courageto tidy up the law; we support what he is doing. I also congratulatehis officials, who, I believe, have been to Cumbria on a couple ofoccasions to meet the Federation of Cumbria Commoners. Cumbria&#146;sfederation is one of the largest in the country, and Cumbria has one ofthe largest patches&#151;or lots of patches&#151;of common land inthe country.</div> <a name="06042581000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">AlthoughI have been briefed by that organisation, I apologise to the Ministerif I do not do justice to the complicated brief that I have beenseeking to understand. I wish to raise points about the regulationsthat may be made under the clause. The Government have stated that thepurpose of the Bill is to provide accurate and up-to-date commonsregisters to underpin commons management, through a duty on localauthorities to update and maintain the registers of common land, and toprovide that future transactions have no legal effect unless they areregistered. The problem is that the Bill does not do that completely;it is only 95 per cent. there.</div><a name="06042581000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will be conclusive onwhat land rights attach to, and on the ownership of those rights ingross. But the register will not be updated or maintained to show whoowns the vast majority of rights&#151;those that are attached. TheGovernment acknowledge that, and they rightly comment that it is notpossible for both the Land Registry and the commons register to beconclusive about the ownership of the dominant tenant. The federationagrees, but does not see a problem with requiring all transfers to benotified to the commons registration authorities. The registers havenever given proof of ownership, but if they are not kept up to date,they are useless for management purposes when commoners need to belocated. Also, significant costs will accrue to the Government andcommoners in cases in which identifying and communicating withcommoners is essential&#151;for example, in respect of applicationsto establish statutory commons associations, applications for <div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>environmental stewardship schemes, applications to undertake works oncommons and compulsory purchaseprocedures.</div><a name="06042581000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">In theother place, the Government argued that there can be only onedefinitive record of ownership. Otherwise, which would take priority ifthere were inconsistencies between the Land Registry and commonsregister entries? The reason is undoubtedly correct; even I understandand agree with it, and that is what the federation says, too. However,it also says that that should not prevent the making of a requirementthat transfers of rights be notified&#151;notified only&#151;to thelocal authority and perhaps be accompanied by a certificate from theLand Registry, or something like that. The commons registers would notbe proof of ownership, but they would have all that informationattached to them, so at least they would then be useful workingdocuments. Without such up-to-date records, otherschemes&#151;applications for commons associations and environmentalstewardship schemes&#151;would become very difficult to set up. Thatwas recognised in the otherplace.</div><a name="06042581000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want toconclude by pressing the Minister to state in this place what hiscolleague Lord Bach said in the other place when pressed on a similarissue. Hesaid:</div><a name="06042581000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I acceptthat we should try to make the commons registers as helpful as possibleto those who do not need conclusive proof of the matters but who wishto have some idea of entitlement. We therefore intend to explore, inconsultation on implementation of Part 1, whether regulations shouldprovide that a declaration of entitlement to exercise rights can beincluded in the registers. I must stress that such a declaration couldnot and would not be conclusive or binding on any person, but it may behelpful that such information can be entered on the register, with anappropriate caveat. We will also consult on whether other informationcould be noted on the registers at the discretion of the registrationauthority, such as Land Registry title numbers and the identity of theowner of the dominant tenement when the authority last sought thatinformation from the registeroftitle.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 25October 2005; Vol. 674, c.GC315-16.]</div><a name="06042581000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a weewhile since that debate in the other place when Lord Bach made thatcomment. I hope that the Minister will be able to say today that theGovernment&#146;s thinking has moved forward&#151;that theintention to consult has firmed up a bit, or that the Government havedone some preliminary consultation and come to a conclusion that thatis a route down which they wish togo.</div><a name="06042581000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want anassurance from the Minister that regulations will be made under thelegislation that enable dealings with the owner of the dominanttenement to be at least recorded on the commons register with asufficient sanction imposed for any failure to notify, so thatnotification becomes the standard conveyancing practice. When rightsare bought or sold and the Land Registry is informed, the registrationauthority should be automatically notified so that the commons registercan be similarly annotated or updated&#151;I probably should not say&#147;annotated&#148; as that probably has some technical legalconnotation. An assurance on that from the Minister would make us veryhappy, and the Cumbria Federation of Commoners would be delighted thatI may have got the point across halfsensibly.</div><a name="06042581000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000427"></a>Mr.Drew:</b> I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship,Miss Begg.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="06042581000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not intend to dwell on thissubject. However, the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border(David Maclean) referred to a debate in the other place, and I wouldlike to address another aspect of the matter, which was an amendment ofLord Greaves on how to fast-track a registration of a common or avillage green. Through my noble Friend Lord Bach, the Governmentpromised to look into how that might be achieved. I know that they havedone so, but I am a little uncertain about what their position is inthis regard.</div> <a name="06042581000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let usaddress a possible scenario. Someone in their later years might wish topass over a piece of land that has been used for many years for acertain purpose&#151;the example of cricket use has been offered. Itmight have been used for that purpose for more than the 20years&#151;that seems to be the key period&#151;but if that personhappens to die before the land is passed over, according to theexisting law, it cannot be seen as either a common or a village green.I wish the Government to make it absolutely clear that there is amechanism whereby if someone wishes to pass a piece of land over foruse by the people for the people that is now possible and that we donot have to wait for the so-called statutory 20 years for that to beachieved. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify exactlywhat resulted from the debate in the otherplace.</div><a name="06042581000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30am</div><a name="06042581000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000428"></a>JimKnight:</b> We have had a wide-ranging debate.

He shouldhave no worries on thatscore.</div><a name="06042581000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It wouldprobably be ideal for all transfers to be recorded as he suggested, butI explained earlier that enforcing such a requirement would bedifficult. We are enabling it because we recognise that it would behelpful for the register to indicate who is entitled to exerciserights. I do not want to disagree with a single word that my nobleFriend the Lord Bach said in the other place. We will enable commonersto enter a supplementary note on the register declaring theirentitlement to exercise rights. The declaration will not be conclusive,but might be informative.</div><a name="06042581000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also exploring thepossibility, which I hope the right hon. Member for Penrith and TheBorder will welcome, of providing in regulations under the Bill that acommoner need not be consulted on any matter affecting the commonunless he has declared his entitlement to those rights. We areexploring that at the moment. It would be an incentive for thosetransfers to be properly registered. If they are not, ownership ofrights and entitlements can be traced back through the Land Registry,but we agree that ideally it would be better to record that informationon the register. That is what we seek to achieve, but we cannot foreseea scenario in which a requirement to do so could be enforced. If,having read what I said earlier, the hon.

That situation mightarise if land had already been used as of right by local inhabitantsfor lawful sports and pastimes for at least 20 years before thedevelopment took place. It would be an unusual circumstance, but itwould be unacceptable if the clause were to allow the registration ofland where houses stand today. The amendments will prevent that fromhappening.

He will recall, being a representative of Nottinghamshire, that the case was Skerritts of NottinghamLtd <i class="I">v.</i> Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and theRegions. The court held that land is considered to be within thecurtilage if it is part and parcel of the principal building or otherstructure. Land is within the curtilage if it is owned and enjoyed withthe principal building and can be regarded as ancillary to it. It is aquestion of fact and degree in each case, and examples include a yard,basement area, passageway, driveway and garden, which are intrinsicallypart and parcel of the house. If houses have been built on one part ofa larger area of <div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>land that has been used as a green, one would not expect the whole ofthe land to be regarded as the curtilage of the houses. If such houseshad physical enclosures around them to create their own space, theircurtilages might well be taken to be defined by those enclosures, butthose curtilages would not extend to the rest of the land.

I want to getback to the word &#147;building&#148;. My question will not be asobtuse as some others. Does &#147;building&#148; mean a completedbuilding? Bearing in mind that the <div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>designation of the land is triggered on a specific date, therewill&#151;I have been told of examples&#151;be buildings underconstruction to which the clause would apply.

Gentleman for askingsomething about which I have thought. Any particular case would be amatter for interpretation on all the facts and evidence, but ourgeneral view is that if a building was already in the course ofconstruction on 18 April 2006, it would be covered by the exemption, aswould any curtilage set out for it on the planning consent. If it hadgot no further than a few trenches or drains, that might be a differentmatter. If a start had been made on erecting the fabric of thebuilding, we think that it would be exempted under the formulation.That would not apply to other buildings that were scheduled under thesame development but had not yet been constructed on that date. Thepurpose of amendment No. 4 is to come to the assistance of buildingsthat already existed on 18 April, rather than to help implement partsof planning consents that had not by then beenimplemented.</div><a name="06042581000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000443"></a>Mr.Drew:</b> This intervention is germane to that point. One ofthe problems with the planning system is that someone could havereceived permission for a building many years before and they can provethat they have started its construction. My hon. Friend the Member forHigh Peak (Tom Levitt) asks what we mean by &#147;underconstruction&#148;. If someone wanted to prove the point, the factthat someone has laid a brick might mean that a building was underconstruction. Subsequent to that, the piece of land might have comeinto common use. How does one overcome that dichotomy? The originalpermission might have been granted but the present use is as a villagegreen or as a piece of common land. Who can resolve that issue and howcan that be done?</div><a name="06042581000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000444"></a>JimKnight:</b> As I said in response to the hon.

One would hope thatthe registration authority and any other body, if the matter werereferred elsewhere&#151;ultimately these things are challengeable byjudicial review&#151;would examine the facts and the evidence in theparticular case. If the view was that planning consent had been givenbut had effectively lapsed and instead the land was then used as agreen, perhaps it would approve the application. The amendment that weare discussing could therefore be put to one side. Such a decisionwould be made on the basis of the facts and the evidence in thecase.</div> <a name="06042581000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prior to thatflurry of debate and interest, I was detailing the Governmentamendments. To give effect to the principle that we have justdiscussed, we have restructured the clause slightly. We think that isworth doing, even though it requires six amendments. Essentially, theexisting subsection (3) would deal with cases where use &#147;as ofright&#148; is ended after commencement of the clause, whereasproposed new subsection (3A), introduced by amendment No. 4, deals withcases where such use had already ended before commencement. I can gothrough that in more detail should hon. Members wish me to do so, but I<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>hope that my comments have proved sufficient.

I cannot accept the amendment, because it is based on apresumption that we believe to be wrong, which is that the owner of anarea of land that has had that kind of long-standing pattern of use&#147;as of right&#148; should be able to remove the registrabilityas a green by, for example, putting up a welcoming sign on the land.That kind of action does not put the local inhabitants on notice thattheir future ability to use the land is underthreat.</div><a name="06042581000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000445"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> Obviously, I have not reached the point with myargument yet.

No, it does notreally, because the point I am making now and in amendment No. 47 isthat when the owner may have consistently given consent, on theunderstanding that it was not giving rise to permanent rights, it isunreasonable, and contrary to human rights, that that owner&#146;sinterests should be taken away.</div><a name="06042581000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree entirely with the hon.Gentleman&#146;s response to my amendment, which is that someoneshould not be able to plonk up a sign after 19 and a half years andsay, &#147;I have let you have it out of the goodness of my heart forall this time, but now you cannot have it as a village green.&#148;Of course that would be an abuse. However, the provision is actuallyremoving retrospectively something that may have been permissive allthe waythrough.</div><a name="06042581000364"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45am</div><a name="06042581000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000448"></a>JimKnight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for hiscomments. It may be helpful if I listen to his argument in favour ofthe amendment and then I may have the opportunity to address mattersmore fully. Amendments Nos. 44 and 45 were also tabled by the hon.Gentleman. In a situation where 20 years' qualifying use of land has been ended, for example, by excluding people, clause 15 allows a period of grace during which application may be made to register the land as a green. A period is normally two years, but is to be five years in a case where qualifying use ends <div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>before the clause takes effect. Those two amendments, taken together,seek to replace the two periods with a single period of grace of oneyear in all cases.</div><a name="06042581000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government resist theprinciple of shortening the period of grace because, if long-standinguse is ended, there needs to be a fair opportunity for application.There is much to do before a viable case for registration can be made,as my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell) outlined duringour debate on Second Reading.</div><a name="06042581000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local people have to find outthat that area of law exists. It is not everyday knowledge that it doesexist. They must then get hold of the guidance material and assesswhether their circumstances are likely to meet the stringent criteriafor registration. If so, they must find a range of witnesses to thequalifying use of the land and collect all of their detailedstatements. They must then bring the statements and supportinginformation together in the prescribed form in a proper application tothe authority.</div><a name="06042581000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Peoplelead busy lives. They are usually doing the work in their spare time oron a voluntary basis. They can not just drop everything and concentrateon getting their local green registered. In addition, under thecustomary law, any freestanding period of use would potentially havebeen enough to get land recognised as a green, even if there had been asubstantial interruption to use since. Clause 15 tightens that upconsiderably so that there will only be a limited window for localpeople to act before it is too late to register the land. However, Ifeel that we have gone as far as we intend to go, and as is reasonable,in imposing such alimitation.</div><a name="06042581000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000449"></a>TheChairman:</b> It would be useful now to discuss the remainingamendments to the clause. Therefore, it is convenient to take also thefollowing amendments: No. 42, in clause 15, page 7, line 24, at endinsert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) subsection (1)does not apply to land for which atcommencement&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a)planning consent has been granted,or</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) an application forregistration as a town or village green has been refused within aperiod of fiveyears.'.</div><a name="06042581000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.46, in clause 15, page 8, line 14, at endinsert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;( ) before agreeingto register any land the registration authority must take reasonablesteps to inform the owner of any part of the land and consider whetherthe owner(s) has taken reasonable steps to prevent the land being usedas described in subsections (2) and(3).'.</div><a name="06042581000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.47, in clause 15, page 8, line 14, at endinsert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;( ) beforeregistration of any land the registration authority must considerwhether the owner(s) of that land shall be able to show that the usersof the land were informed throughout the period that consent to suchuse was temporary and would not give rise to permanentrights.'.</div><a name="06042581000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000450"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> That is a wise decision, Miss Begg. It means thatall the remaining amendments stand in my name. Clause 15 is probablythe most controversial aspect of the Bill. Obviously I, as did theMinister, listened to the debate on Second Reading. I will give way ifthe hon. Member for Pudsey thinks that I am misrepresenting him, but hewas using the debate as the last opportunity&#151;the fall-backposition&#151;to prevent a <div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>piece of land from possibly being used for development if people hadbeen using it to exercise their &#147;lawful sports andpastimes&#148;, which is a funny choice ofwords.</div><a name="06042581000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of usaccept and agree that there are lots of pieces of land that, asregistered village greens, would be a huge addition to the community.Therefore, we wholly support the principle of being able to registernew land as a village green. Nevertheless, as Members of this House, wemust find the right balance between the rights and needs of society andof the owner. It would be easy to couch this debate in terms of a localcommunity against some rapacious developer. I do not doubt that thereare examples of rapacious developers who have sought to build on whatmost people would consider to be a village green. However, there willbe many more examples in which the land is not owned by a rapaciousdeveloper, but by, for example, a small village builder or an elderlylady who has left it there for years thinking that it would be a placefor her son or grandson to build a house.</div><a name="06042581000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are all sorts ofpermutations and possibilities for the type of the land that we aredebating. It would be regrettable if we couched the debate purely interms of large-scale development.</div><a name="06042581000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000451"></a>Mr.Truswell:</b> I have listened with interest to the hon.Gentleman&#146;s comments following his reference to my contributionon Second Reading, and I take exception to his use of the term&#147;fall-back position&#148;. On Second Reading, I explained thecircumstances around Yeadon Banks. Local people had used the land inquestion for generations. It had been green belt land, ceased to be asresult of the unitary development plan process and the public inquiry,and therefore the local community felt that the planning process hadfailed to help them retain that piece of land. When they discoveredthat they could apply for town green registration, they started thatprocess. So it was not really a fall-back position, but an attempt toprotect land that had been used forgenerations.</div><a name="06042581000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000452"></a>Mr.Paice:</b> I am happy to accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;scorrection of my understanding of his words. Clearly, I do not haveknowledge of his particular constituency case, and nor shouldI.</div><a name="06042581000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">My general pointremains: there is a whole raft of possible scenarios for the type ofland to which we are referring, and we must not carry out this debateon the basis of one particular perception. We have a responsibilitytherefore to find a balance between those rights and needs of societyand a community, and the owner of the land&#151;whoever he, she or itmight be.</div> <a name="06042581000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I readilyaccept that the amendments are designed to tilt the balance backtowards the landowner slightly&#151;although not excessively. I amsorry that the Minister concluded his opening speech by saying,&#147;That is as far as we intend to go.&#148; Perhaps that is hismarker, but I hope that he will listen to and consider mypoints.</div><a name="06042581000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">AmendmentsNos. 44 and 45 address the period in which an application can be made.In fact, amendment No. 44 will fall, given that we are likely toapprove the Minister&#146;s amendment No. 6 which deletes the wholeof subsection (6). He has achieved what I tried to do with amendmentNo. 44, although he has reintroduced the <div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>five years provision in amendment No. 4. I must challenge that. Fiveyears is a very long time, and if the public, or&#147;inhabitants&#148;&#151;the word used in theBill&#151;have been using land as of right for 20 years, it isastonishing that that use may stop five years before completion of anapplication.</div><a name="06042581000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Actually, I do not agree withthe Minister&#146;s pleadings that two years is necessary for anyother case. A year is still a long time, and if people feel stronglyabout the need to protect their land, one year is a more than adequateperiod in which to complete the application with all the relevantdetails&#151;I think that the Minister rather over-laboured theproblems with getting that information in place. I challenge himparticularly on the five years. If people ceased using land five yearsago, I cannot for the life of me understand why they should then havethe whole of the five years to put in the application. I cannot see thejustification in such action, nor can I even envisage an appropriateexample.</div> <a name="06042581000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall moveon now, Miss Begg, to the other amendments that you rightly suggestedwe should also debate. Amendment No. 42 goes back to the discussionthat began with a series of interventions on the Minister&#146;sspeech. I welcome the Government&#146;s amendments which, as theMinister rightly said, were tabled in response to issues raised by mynoble Friends in the other place. I am also grateful for his coming upwith the principle of proposed subsection(3A).</div><a name="06042581000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">When answeringthe question about a definition of a building, the Minister said that,if it meant only that the odd ditch or two had been dug, that might notapply. It certainly would not apply to other properties on thedevelopment that had not been commenced. I am grateful to see theMinister nodding. Some examples of developments being under way havebeen drawn to my attention. As he knows, a development is, to use anold-fashioned Labour word, a composite. Its infrastructure is the roadsand utilities. It is integrated. If we then say to the developer thatthat section cannot now be built, it will throw the rest out ofproportion. It means that the roads are in the wrong place and the costof the infrastructure that the developer will have planned to shareacross all the properties will have to be shared among the fewerproperties that can be built or have been completed. There might not beany properties. Therefore, the Minister is wrong to suggest that thebuilding has to be well under construction before the clause ceases toapply. He should go back a stage ortwo.</div><a name="06042581000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other matteris cost. Again, examples have been drawn to my attention. For obviousreasons, the individuals concerned do not want me to announce who theyare because they are carrying out developments at present. Manyhundreds&#151;if not millions&#151;of pounds have been spent bybusinesses and local authorities on public inquiries. In some cases,development has commenced but not completed, yet the Minister isproposing that all that money could be lost at huge cost to thebusinesses because someone might apply for a village green. In fact, inone case a person did apply for a village green under the currentlegislation. The application was lost. The matter then went to publicinquiry. The developers won planning consent and they are two thirds ofthe way through the development. They will lose the other third on the <div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>basis of the discussion that we have just had. Although I cannot speakfor them, there is likely to be a law suit against the Government inrespect of the costs that have beenincurred.</div><a name="06042581000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite hisclosing remarks, the Minister needs to consider matters further. Wemust bear in mind a major planning proposal, especially when a grouphas already applied for registration as a town or village green thathas been refused within a recent time. In amendment No. 42, I used thesame five-year period that the Minister used and I am happy to reduceit to a much lesser period if he will do so under his amendment. Heneeds to think more about the balance between the two situations,especially given that there could be major legal disputes andchallenges against the Government if they continue acting as they havebeendoing.</div><a name="06042581000365"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12noon</div> <a name="06042581000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would alsomake the smaller point that often a development is about not justhousing but community services. There may even be&#151;althoughprobably not that often&#151;a new post office, or certainly acommunity centre. It would be pretty ironic if the community centre wasnot allowed to be built because it happened to be the last thing on thedevelopment schedule to be built. The houses would be put up, but notthe community centre that was part of the development, and so, becauseof the Bill, the community would lose out on its community centre. TheMinister needs to take the provision away and look at it a little morecarefully.</div> <a name="06042581000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come toamendments Nos. 46 and 47. I shall refer to notes that I expect otherhon. Members have also received from the Country Land and BusinessAssociation. It refers to the common land policy statement that theGovernment issued in 2002, in which they proposed</div><a name="06042581000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;introducing a formal mechanism bywhich landowners could clearly indicate that, although use of the landmay continue for the time being, the nature of the use has ceased tomeet the criteria for registration as a town or village green. Anyfurther use would be by general permission of the owner. There wassupport for providing a clear and unambiguous mechanism for making thepublic aware of their position and we plan to do so. This will requireprimarylegislation.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,that has not found its way into the Bill, but it is the genesis ofamendments Nos. 46 and 47. Both of them simply require the registrationauthority to consider two possible actions that the owner of the landmay have taken before the authority agrees to register. The first istaking action to prevent the land from being used by putting up somesort of fencing or security system. To come back to the point that theMinister made about amendment No. 43, I certainly agree that the ownershould not be allowed suddenly to come along, 19 and a half years afterthe public started using a piece of land for lawful pursuits, and stopthat use, and expect to evade the requirements of clause 15.</div><a name="06042581000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, on amendmentNo. 47, what if someone has a piece of land and expects, or is happyfor, people to walk across it, walk their dogs on it or play ball onit, but wants to retain their interest in the property? Of course, onceit becomes a village green it is effectively of no value to theowner.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div><a name="06042581000236"></a></td></tr></table><a name="end"><table width=90%><tr valign=top><td colspan=2>&nbsp;<br><page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/d/st060425/am/60425s06.htm"/>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000453"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> To help the debate, in respect of amendment No.

43, the supplementary words are significant. Subsection (5)(b), which

the hon. Gentleman seeks to remove, applies only when subsection (2)(a)

applies&#151;that is, after 20 years have passed. With the leave of

the Committee, I will respond to the other amendments later, including

No. 47. But I hope that my interpretation of amendment No. 43 is

helpful.</div><a name="06042581000237"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000454"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. Perhaps while he is

replying to the other amendments, I will have a think about that reply.

He is right that we need our debates to be as constructive as

possible.</div> <a name="06042581000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress

that under amendment No. 47 I am referring to cases in which the users

of the land were informed throughout the period that consent to such

use was temporary and would not give rise to permanent rights.

Arguably, it would be difficult for someone to demonstrate or prove

that; nevertheless, the owner should have the right to do so. Equally,

on amendment No. 46, if the owner has taken serious steps&#151;I am

not talking about just a piece of string&#151;to prevent the land

from being used as described, that should be taken into account. If the

owner has erected sensible fencing and people have consistently broken

it down so as to get on to a piece of ground to walk their dogs, I

wonder whether they should have their property confiscated. That is

what the impact of clause 15might be.</div>

<a name="06042581000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry to have taken some

time over this group of amendments, but I think that it was right to

discuss them all together. I seek, through a variety of propositions,

to shift the balance slightly back towards the genuine landowner, who

could be of any type, and to introduce a little more proportionality

into the idea of the creation of village greens. If land has been used

for 20 years without let or hindrance or the owner&#146;s trying to

stop that use, I entirely support what the Minister is trying to do. We

want more village greens, but we also support the general principle of

property ownership: the owner has a right to protect his property and

the rights that accrue to him from it. At the moment, the clause tilts

the balance rather too far away from that. I hope that the Minister

will consider our points seriously. While he responds, I shall think

further about his point on amendment No.

43.</div>

<a name="06042581000240"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000455"></a>Tom

Levitt:</b> Like other Committee members, I am pleased to

serve under your chairmanship, Miss Begg. The last time that I

scrutinised legislation line by line in a Committee, I was sitting

beside you on the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee for the Disability

Discrimination Bill. You showed a lot of common sense then, and

&#147;commons sense&#148; is clearly what we all require today. I

cannot let the moment pass without pointing out that this week marks

the 74th anniversary of the Kinder trespass&#151;a wonderful moment

in the history of this country, and of my constituency in particular.

In that spirit, I am very much in favour of the Bill and its measures.

I also have some sympathy for the points made by the hon. Member for

South-East Cambridgeshire, although I put the problem down to

inadequate guidance rather than to a need to amend the Bill in the way

that he advocates.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="06042581000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that, I should like

to take the opportunity to question the Minister about a situation that

has arisen in my constituency. As I mentioned in an intervention on the

Minister for Climate Change and the Environment on Second Reading,

there have been two instances in which I believe that the town green

applications have been misguided and unhelpful for the common good of

the community. The first was in an area in Buxton called Fairfield

where planning permission has been given for some 300 houses, including

a significant proportion of much-needed social housing, on a large

piece of land adjacent to a huge and well established common. I stress

that the application is not for land that is or ever has been regarded

as common land, but access to the new site is across a smaller piece of

land for which a town green application has been submitted. That

application was submitted after the planning permission was given. As a

result, because of unresolved cases going through the courts, the

decision as to whether the town green application should be granted has

been delayed by several years&#151;even the main campaigner for the

town green no longer lives in the area, so presumably no longer has an

interest. Everything is waiting for court cases to be decided

elsewhere.</div> <a name="06042581000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second

instance is in New Mills where, the Minister will not be surprised to

hear, a derelict Methodist church and its graveyard, along with a small

piece of adjacent land owned by the town council, has been designated

as the site of a new magistrates court to serve the whole of the High

Peak. It is a facility that is badly needed; we have inadequate

magistrates court facilities. Although the planning application was

initially refused by High Peak borough council, it went to appeal and

public inquiry and was granted to Derbyshire courts on

appeal&#151;from memory, about three years ago. Immediately after the

appeal had been granted and the planning permission was given, a town

green application was made on a small part of the site that was,

nevertheless, crucial in giving access to where the magistrates court

was going to be situated. That piece of land is in an entirely urban

residential area. From recollection, it is roughly the size of this

room, but it has held up major public works for several years. At one

point, a public inquiry was established by the county council for a

hearing into the town green application. That public inquiry was

cancelled on legal advice, at a cost to the taxpayer, because of the

outstanding cases going through the courts in relation to other town

green applications

elsewhere.</div><a name="06042581000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I consider

that both town green applications were made not on the merits of the

land in question, or for the purpose of enhancing the environment or

retaining rights of common usage, but to frustrate planning

permissions. In one case, since April 2005, the applicant is no longer

Derbyshire courts but the Department for Constitutional Affairs, which

now has direct responsibility for the provision of magistrates

courts.</div><a name="06042581000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those

delays are at a great cost to the taxpayer and we cannot see, at the

moment, how or when these matters will be resolved, because every time

that a case comes up, another one follows it through. The problem is

the paucity of the guidance that is given. The courts are simply

deciding a succession of case law each time and, because of an

inadequate guidance framework, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>new case law leads to future guidance changes, which means that the

authorities making the decisions on whether to grant a town green

application are on shifting sands and can never be really sure of their

ground.</div><a name="06042581000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have written

to the Department following my intervention on Second Reading last week

and I await the full, detailed responses. I hope that the Minister and

the Committee agree that town green applications should normally be

made before planning permission is given, that applications designed

principally to thwart the legitimate planning process should get short

shrift and that the use of repeated town green applications for the

same land should not be allowed to cause inordinate delays to the

development

process.</div><a name="06042581000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">How does the

Minister see the contents of the Bill&#151;or the Act, when it

becomes enacted&#151;affecting outstanding town green applications

that have not yet been decided on? Would those become subject to the

Bill?</div><a name="06042581000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a matter

of strengthening guidance, rather than changing the Bill. I am happy to

go along with the Government amendments and pleased and proud to

support the Bill. However, where cases arise that are tantamount to

abuse of the system&#151;as I think is so in two instances in High

Peak&#151;I hope that they can be addressed through firmer

guidance.</div><a name="06042581000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042581000456"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): Thank you, Miss Begg, for

calling me. I should like to endorse the comments of other Committee

members: it is a pleasure to serve under your

chairmanship.</div><a name="06042581000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for

South-East Cambridgeshire. I remind the Committee of my declaration of

interests, which I identified on Second Reading, in relation to some

grazing rights and modest ownership rights in common

land.</div><a name="06042581000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to

draw the Minister&#146;s attention to two areas of conflict, which

may arise if we do not take into account the amendments tabled by my

hon. Friend. One relates to the Highways Act 1980 provisions that I

referred to on Second Reading, which provide protections for landowners

to give rights of way over their property, although those are not

permanently enshrined. Section 31 of that Act allows a landowner to

give notice that it is not his or her intention that land should become

permanently dedicated as a right of way.</div>

<a name="06042581000366"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

pm</div><a name="06042581000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar

provision ought to apply to a green to which a landowner gives

permissive access. The two approaches will be inconsistent if the Bill

is more prescriptive than the 1980 Act. The Minister might argue that

we should change the 1980 Act. That will be for him to say, but I do

not favour it.</div> <a name="06042581000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part

of my concern arises from the length of time involved and the

retrospective nature of the proposals. On Second Reading, I raised an

example from my constituency in which some Glebe land owned by the

Church had been used for pastimes such as leisure pursuits and

dog-walking for much longer than 20 years. If the landowner does not

wish their land to be registered, it will in effect be confiscated as a

result of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>the provisions unless we pass the amendments, and I am not sure that it

is the Bill&#146;s intention to disfranchise that kind of owner in

such circumstances.</div><a name="06042581000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

related point concerns Human Rights Act 1998 implications. A particular

case was brought to my attention by one of my constituents. The Bill,

if not amended, could fall foul for not being compatible with the Human

Rights Act, particularly article 1, protocol 1 on the protection of

property. The disproportionate limitation of property rights has no

viable means of protecting the right to freely enjoy possession. The

case that my constituent highlighted was JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd <i class="I">v.</i>

United Kingdom 2005. I can give the Minister the reference number if he

needs to look it up. I should be interested to know whether he has

considered the Bill&#146;s Human Rights Act implications for

landowners. He might like to comment on that before the question is

put.</div><a name="06042581000254"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000457"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I shall ask the Minister a number of questions.

During debate in the other place, a considerable amount of time was

spent on the matter that we are discussing. I agree with the hon.

Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that it is at the centre of the

Bill. Hon. Members in the other place were trying to define the term

&#147;public interest&#148;. Having read that debate and heard what

the Minister said subsequently on Second Reading here, I am still not

sure whether we have managed to clarify exactly what we mean by the

public interest. It is crucial to the maintenance and enhancement of

common land and village greens in

particular.</div><a name="06042581000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take

note of what other hon. Members said about curtilage in their

interventions. Given that we are all awaiting with bated breath the

verdict in the Oxfordshire Trap Grounds case, I am concerned that we

could make the situation more confusing if we are not careful. We might

even be making it more restrictive for those who, like myself, want

common land, access and proper use of land to be restored. If we are

not careful, we could make it

worse.</div><a name="06042581000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask my hon.

Friend the Minister: having obtained some more balance in the

legislative framework than was originally proposed, why does he feel

duty bound to delete subsection (6) in particular? I disagree with the

hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire on the time scale. We need

proper safeguards. By altering the time when an application can be made

where there has been a lack of use and changing the definition of the

relevant period, we seem to be erring in favour of those who wish to

redefine and reuse the land. I accept that this issue will always be

problematic, because we run directly into the planning process as

against the nature of what I see as public land that should be

protected as such, but I am not sure whether my hon. Friend is not

making it more difficult for people who wish, as my hon. Friend the

Member for Pudsey described, to make a genuine

application.</div><a name="06042581000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

problem is the abuses that we all know about. As my hon. Friend the

Member for High Peak said, applications can be used as an opportunity

to forestall what seems to be the best use of the land. However, we

have to be careful&#151;obviously, this clause will be considered

carefully, linking directly with the next clause; I am sure that my

hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood and I will have things to say about



<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>that&#151;when people are trying to change the use of public land.

Sometimes that is for a good purpose, such as my hon. Friend the Member

for High Peak described, but we must be careful that the safeguards are

not being eroded.</div><a name="06042581000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

is why I ask why the Government are taking out clause 15(6) and, with

regard to the Minister&#146;s earlier responses on how the curtilage

of a building affects common land and, in particular, the designation

of a village green, why what the Government now propose seems less

strong than what was originally in place when the Bill came from the

other

place.</div><a name="06042581000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000458"></a>Mr.

Rogerson:</b> I am, to a great extent, convinced by the

arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Stroud about not seeking to

be obstructive to attempts to preserve rights of access to open spaces

and common land. I have specifically used the phrase &#147;open

spaces&#148;. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman, like me and other

hon. Members, has received information from the Open Spaces Society.

The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire referred to valuable

briefings from the Country Land and Business Association. As always,

there are many sides to the various discussions, so it has been useful

to read the submissions given to

us.</div><a name="06042581000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

referred to the capacity of volunteer organisations to take advantage

of the provision made by the Bill to apply to register greens. We need

to preserve that facility for such organisations. The maximum time

should be given to allow such applications to be made and to move

forward.</div><a name="06042581000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard

to applications that have failed, the hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire was keen to say that further applications could not be

made within a specified period. Again, I am sure that volunteer

organisations will make every effort to get applications right the

first time around, but it is important that if an application fails on

a technicality, they should have the right to submit a further

application, having reflected on

that.</div><a name="06042581000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

considering Government amendments and amendments tabled by the hon.

Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. His amendments Nos. 46 and 47

relate to attempts by landowners to make it clear that any rights being

given are temporary, or rather that any access given is temporary. I am

more sympathetic to that. It is clear that in respect of an event

possibly taking place or a community activity occurring in a village or

town, this could act as a great disincentive to people allowing that to

happen on their land. It is important that we take on board the

provisions in amendments Nos. 46 and 47 to allow landowners the

opportunity to demonstrate that they have allowed these permissions on

a temporary basis.</div>

<a name="06042581000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 are

sensible, but I am less sympathetic to the Government&#146;s

amendments to the clause, and to amendment No.

42.</div><a name="06042581000264"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000459"></a>Mr.

Truswell:</b> I want to speak on this clause not only because,

as I made clear on Second Reading, I have a particular constituency

interest, but because I have observed the process that my constituents

have had to go through in some detail. I caution Committee members

against the comments of the hon. Member 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>for South-East Cambridgeshire&#151;and also, I have to say, of my hon.

Friend the Member for High Peak&#151;in respect of adopting a lowest

common denominator approach that aims to prevent the few cases of

abuse, but at the same time throws the baby out with the bathwater in

terms of the many legitimate applications that have been

made&#151;some of which are in abeyance&#151;and that I am sure

will be made in the future.</div>

<a name="06042581000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the problem is that the

hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire predicates his view and

approach on the belief that the process is now loaded against the

landowner. My experience is that putting in a town or village green

application is an extremely difficult and complex process. My hon.

Friend the Minister alluded to some of the components of

that.</div><a name="06042581000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea of not

being allowed to submit an application within five years of an

unsuccessful application should be fiercely resisted. As was recently

alluded to, because this is a complex process that is undertaken by

what are essentially volunteers from within the community, it is quite

possible that they will get it wrong. Indeed, I suspect that some of

the applications submitted in order to thwart planning applications

might not be fully considered&#151;might not be submitted in the most

cogent way possible&#151;and that they may fail because of

that.</div><a name="06042581000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We obviously

have a problem with Trap Grounds. Some applications have probably

failed. I do not know what records have been kept throughout the

country on how many applications have been heard and automatically

rejected because of Trap Grounds. I know that many local authorities,

including Leeds city council in my area, have tried to defer

consideration of these applications. The application in respect of

Yeadon Banks in my constituency was submitted in July 2004; clearly,

some time has elapsed since then, because of Trap

Grounds.</div><a name="06042581000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with

the comments of my hon. Friendthe Member for Stroud about the

deletion of subsection (6). I support him in pressing the Minister for

clarification on that. We do not want a situation to arise whereby some

of the

applications&#151;</div><a name="06042581000269"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000460"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> If it will help my hon. Friend, let me say that

the provisions of subsection (6) are simply re-enacted by subsections

&#147;(3) or (3A)&#148; as referred to in one of my amendments.

They are all still included. This is just a case of what I referred to

in my opening remarks as reordering everything to make better sense. I

hope that the fact that those provisions are all still included

reassures my hon. Friend, and helps to move the debate

forward.</div><a name="06042581000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000461"></a>Mr.

Truswell:</b> I am grateful for those comments.</div>

<a name="06042581000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further to amendment No. 42 and

the suggestion that the existence of a substantive planning permission

should be an obstacle to the further progress of a town green

application, I suggest that the two processes are entirely separate.

Again, I can cite my own parochial example; the planning process has

not been particularly helpful in protecting an area of land that has

been in public use for generations and, certainly on a prima facie

basis, meets all the tests that in due 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>course it will have to satisfy, when and if the local authority gets

round to determining things, in the context either of the Bill or of

the decision on Trap

Grounds.</div><a name="06042581000367"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

pm</div><a name="06042581000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea that

we are dealing with landowners with limited resources is not the point

that we should examine. We should defend the town green process and, if

anything, make it far easier. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud

indicated, the application in my constituency has been a lengthy

process. Advice has had to be sought and people have had to mull over

complex and arcane legal commentaries. There has been a need to raise

awareness within the local community, organise public meetings and

establish a committee to carry out the application process. People have

gone round to try to get sufficient statements of evidence to

demonstrate that the town green application meets the

requirements.</div> <a name="06042581000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

process is one of the reasons why I hope that the Committee will resist

amendment No. 45. In my experience, reducing the period available to

undertake such a convoluted process would be an obstacle to some

communities. As my hon. Friend said, we are talking about volunteers in

the community who have other

lives.</div><a name="06042581000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would

caricature the application process as being a little like getting a

complex piece of do-it-yourself furniture and having to piece it

together in some sort of treasure hunt, only to discover that some

essential pieces are missing. I counsel Members who are persuaded or

influenced by comments made from the Opposition Front Bench and by my

hon. Friend the Member for High Peak not to throw the baby out with the

bathwater and make the process more restrictive.</div>

<a name="06042581000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">My experience shows that the

vast majority of people do not know what a town green is. I am sure

that many communities have town or village greens but do not realise

that they might be able to achieve that legislative and formal status

until a planning application or unitary development plan demonstrates

that the land is not as sacrosanct as they had

hoped.</div><a name="06042581000276"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000462"></a>Paddy

Tipping:</b> This has been an important debate with historical

relevance in this place. There has always been an argument between

those who believe in the rights of the private owner and those who

favour the wider, informal rights of the public good. If one were to

look at the records of Parliament, one would see that that has been

debated strongly many times.</div>

<a name="06042581000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire, with whom I agree on many issues, made

thecase, supported by the hon. Member for

Ludlow(Mr. Dunne), for the primacy of the right of private

ownership. However, the world has changed. The importance of the wider

public good and the right of public participation has increased, and

that trend will continue. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak

talked about the Kinder Scout trespass, and one of this

Government&#146;s monumental achievements has been the Countryside

and Rights of Way Act 2000, creating the right of wider access to wild

and open spaces. My hon. Friend the Minister and his officials have

worked hard to balance that wider public right against that of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>private ownership. He listened to the debate in the other place and has

tabled amendments that recognise some of the concerns expressed by the

hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire.</div><a name="06042581000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some

of us feel that the powers of the Bill do not go far enough in looking

after the public good and the right of wider informal use of land. The

Minister and his officials have listened to the debate and tried to

find a balance, and I urge him not to go any further. Having watched

the progress of the Bill, I have seen movement towards the rights of

private ownership. I counsel him to maintain his present position and

not to give further ground, because informal areas that have acquired a

tradition of usage over many years are important for the community at

large and should not be given away in the manner that is being asked

today. The balance is right and we should stick with it,

because&#151;in the old phrase&#151;this land is

ours.</div><a name="06042581000279"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000463"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Those Members who were on the Standing Committee

of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill will remember

that I always took seriously the words of counsel from my hon. Friend

the Member for Sherwood, and I see no reason to deviate from that

course now. The debate has been useful and I shall try to address the

points that have been made as best I can. If I fail in one or two cases

I shall write to Members

accordingly.</div><a name="06042581000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for South-East Cambridgeshire raised a question about the

five-year grace period from commencement for cases in which access to a

green was ceased prior to commencement. My hon. Friend the Member for

Pudsey made a strong and passionate case for a sensible grace period.

The five-year period applies when use as of right has ceased, and I

think that five years is appropriate to allow a

catch-up.</div><a name="06042581000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for South-East Cambridgeshire also talked about development and

made some interesting points about larger developments and about

community developments that may be happening, which may be frustrated

by the April date of a week ago. I shall reflect on what he says, but I

ask him also to reflect on the fact that clause 15 re-enacts, with some

modifications, the existing regime for registering land that has had 20

years&#146; recreational use as of right by local people. It reflects

the customary law position in which any free-standing period of that

kind gave rise to a presumption that land was a green, even if it had

occurred many years earlier. The element of risk that the developer

undertakes, therefore, has in many respects not changed and will not do

so by virtue of the amendment. If the development of a community centre

that is wanted by the whole community is affected then obviously there

is capacity for exchange in order to allow that, although it may not be

entirely to the satisfaction of the hon.

Gentleman.</div><a name="06042581000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 42, determination of a planning application turns

essentially on policy considerations. A committee of local politicians

decides, in light of national and local guidelines, whether to allow a

development to proceed, and it is well established that any consent

that it gives is without prejudice to other constraints that may affect

the use of the same land, such as the existence of prior rights over

the land that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>may make the development unlawful. I recognise, of course, that some

particularly difficult and emotive situations can arise locally in

cases when, after the giving of planning consent, there is an

application to register the same land as a green&#151;my hon. Friend

the Member for High Peak has explained

that.</div><a name="06042581000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately,

determination of an application to register land as a town or village

green is a legal, rather than a policy matter. The sole issue is

whether the qualifying recreational use by local people has occurred.

The tests are tough, but if the local inhabitants can meet them, they

prove that the land is a green and should be registered as such. It

would be wholly inappropriate for the Bill to treat a planning consent

as overriding the scope for such

registrations.</div><a name="06042581000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

second point in the amendment, the Government do not agree that

registration should not be possible if an application to register the

land was refused in the five years before the commencement of clause

15. As Committee members know, the Court of Appeal decision in the Trap

Grounds case that we have discussed has for some time effectively

prevented registration of greens, even in the most deserving cases

where it was clear that the qualifying use had taken place before

application. I have no accurate figures of the numbers that have been

affected, for which my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey asked,

although I have various other figures. I will not delay the Committee

by running through the information that I have if it is not exactly

what my hon. Friend

wants.</div><a name="06042581000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be

wrong for the Bill to treat determination in such circumstances as a

definitive indication of the status of the land. On the other hand, if

an application was without any substance when determined before, as

perhaps might be the case in High Peak, it would remain without any

substance if remade under clause 15. Indeed, depending on the

circumstances, it might not even be possible for the authority to

entertain it again if nothing has changed and the application remains

as hopeless as ever. I will want to reflect on the guidance, as my hon.

Friend the Member for High Peak said. It is true that case law has been

evolving rapidly in recent years; we hope that the outcome in the Trap

Grounds case and the passage of the Bill will make the criteria clearer

for all.</div> <a name="06042581000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Open

Spaces Society has issued comprehensive guidance on the subject,

entitled &#147;Getting Greens Registered&#148;. We will need to

speak to the society and others about how updated guidance on these

matters should best be provided. If my hon. Friend wants to write to me

I shall be happy to discuss his ideas and the problems in his

constituency, given his generally progressive attitude to town and

village

greens.</div><a name="06042581000287"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000464"></a>Tom

Levitt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. One of the

problems of the guidance versus case law issue is that case law takes

so long. The delay in waiting for case law to be decided means that the

town green applications cannot be processed with the speed that anyone

would want without the need for rushing. Does the Minister think that

the net effect of the Bill&#151;a swing towards guidance rather than

case law&#151;would reduce the present unnecessary waste of time

between the application and the decision in some

cases?</div><a name="06042581000288"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000465"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I certainly hope that developing the expertise of

commons registration officers and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>authorities will make things easier. The Bill is a tidying-up process

that largely repeats the 1965 Act. If I can further streamline things

through guidance I will do so and perhaps we can discuss

it.</div><a name="06042581000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of

amendments Nos. 46 and 47, the first proposed requirement of notifying

the owner is a matter for regulations under clause 24, which we will

develop and consult on in due course. The current regulations require

the authority to notify the owner where known, to advertise the

application and to place a notice on the land. We would expect the new

regulations to contain something

comparable.</div><a name="06042581000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second

and third proposed requirements&#151;to consider whether the owner

has taken reasonable steps to prevent qualifying use by local

inhabitants and to consider whether the owner can show that users were

informed throughout the relevant period that consent to such use was

temporary and not intended to lead to permanent rights&#151;are

simply elements of what, by definition, the authority must do when it

is considering whether the use as of right by local inhabitants has

occurred for at least 20 years. Use as of right is without permission

or secrecy. If the owner can show that he prevented the use or that he

informed users throughout that their use was permissive, the

application must fail.

</div><a name="06042581000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis that the

amendments are unnecessary, I ask the hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire to ask leave to withdraw

them.</div><a name="06042581000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Ludlow asked a couple of questions to which I shall respond. In

respect of section 31 of the Highways Act 1980, we concluded that it

was unnecessary, and would not always be appropriate, to introduce the

possibility for a landowner to declare that recreational use of his

land is not as of right. A landowner who wants to continue to allow

local people to use the land simply needs to communicate his permission

clearly to them&#151;for example, by putting prominent notices on the

land which he maintains or periodically renews. The difficulty with

substituting a paper procedure is that people may be unaware that their

use of the land as of right is challenged. That is unsatisfactory when

20 years&#146; use as of right has already taken place and it is

important for any challenge to as-of-right use to be overt so that

people recognise it as such and, if appropriate, take action to secure

registration of the land before the two-year period of grace

elapses.</div>

<a name="06042581000368"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

pm</div><a name="06042581000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that

reason, clause 15 does not treat the mere giving of permission as

enough to end as-of-right use. It would be unfair if an apparently

welcoming action taken after a long period of as-of-right use were able

to cancel out long-established as-of-right use in that way and thereby

prevent registration of the land.</div>

<a name="06042581000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally, although I cannot

comment on specific cases, I do not believe that a provision similar to

section 31(6) of the Highways Act 1980 would be of any assistance when

20 years&#146; use had already accumulated because that section can

be used to prevent the presumed dedication of rights of way only when

20 years&#146; use has not already taken

place.</div><a name="06042581000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall write

to the hon. Member for Ludlow about the Glebe land that he referred

to.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div><a name="06042581000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of applications to

register land as a green infringing the owner&#146;s human rights, we

do not accept that that is so, but the Judicial Committee of the other

place is considering that issue in the Trap Grounds

case.</div><a name="06042581000297"></a>

Paice:</b> I appreciate your tolerance, Miss

Begg.</div><a name="06042581000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful

for various things that the Minister said. Starting at the end, he

talked about amendments Nos. 46 and 47 and I am grateful for his

explanation that owners will be notified and that whether an owner has

sought to prevent or has given permission would both nullify the

as-of-right clause. I confess that I was not aware of that definition

of &#147;as of right&#148;, so I accept that the amendments are

unnecessary, but the points are important and it is worth having them

on the record.</div><a name="06042581000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

earlier amendments and planning consent, I confess that I am still

slightly concerned about the Minister&#146;s response. I appreciate

the technical distinction between a judgment on policy and a judgment

on law, but the Government will have a serious problem with the present

situation. The Minister kindly said that he would reflect on the

matter, but he may want to reflect on the developments that will be hit

by the measure now and he might want to consider an amendment to exempt

that much of the provision is just re-enshrining previous legislation,

but there are some twists that change it slightly and it is important

that people who will be caught by the measure should be exempted. It is

fair enough that anyone who applies for planning consent in future

should be covered by the legislation and I accept the Minister&#146;s

point, but those who have already received it and believe that

everything is going forward need an opportunity to make

representations.</div><a name="06042581000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

heard what the Minister and other hon. Members said about the period of

one to five years, but I still think that people could go a bit quicker

than has been 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>suggested, although I have not considered the Trap Grounds issue, which

I accept as a reason for needing a fair period.</div>

<a name="06042581000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unusually, I found myself at

odds with the hon. Member for Sherwood, although that will not surprise

him. I fully recognise that the world has moved on. If he was implying

that I was defending property rights as they might have existed 50

years ago, he is living in a different world. I certainly am not doing

that, norwas I.</div>

<a name="06042581000309"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000472"></a>Paddy

Tipping:</b> Some of the discussions reminded me of the

debates about enclosures, so we are talking about centuries ago, not 50

years ago.</div>

<a name="06042581000310"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000473"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I was not a Member of the House then, so I shall

have to bow to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s memory, although I think

that he is straining the point. As I made clear at the outset of my

remarks, I wholly support the principle of registering village greens.

However, owners should not be caught unwittingly by the legislation,

which could, in effect, nullify the value of an asset.</div>

<a name="06042581000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only other point relates to

the Minister&#146;s intervention on me on amendment No. 43. He said

that the fact that subsection (5)(b) depends on subsection

(5)(a)&#151;that is, the end of paragraph (a) ends with

&#147;and&#148;&#151;makes it subsequent. Having spent a few

minutes reading the provisions, but like him not having a legal

background, I am not entirely convinced that he is right. His assertion

that subsection (5)(b) is dependent on subsection (5)(a) is of course

correct, but subsection (5)(a) refers to prohibition under subsection

(4), which refers to

prohibition</div><a name="06042581000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by reason of

any

enactment.&#148;</div><a name="06042581000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Logically,

therefore, subsection (5)(b) refers to prohibition by reason of an

enactment.</div> <a name="06042581000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

understanding of the Minister&#146;s response to amendment No. 43 is

that landowners who have previously done nothing should not suddenly be

able to put up a welcome board to avoid registration. I entirely agree

that that should not be permissible, but that is not how I read

subsection (5), linking it to subsections (2) and (4). There is no

reference to subsequent and the prohibition appears to refer only to an

enactment. Unless I am wildly wrong, I do not think that an enactment

means an action by a private

individual.</div><a name="06042581000314"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000474"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> We might need to get our collective non-legal

heads together and work out the wiring of the provisions. To go back

through all the stages, subsection (4)

says:</div><a name="06042581000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

determining the period of 20 years&#148;.</div>

<a name="06042581000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">To my mind, that informs the subsequent

nature of subsection (4). Subsection (5)(b) is free-standing from

subsection (5)(a), but both are subject to the words</div>

<a name="06042581000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in a case where the condition in

subsection (2)(a) is

satisfied&#148;.</div><a name="06042581000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

could probably have this debate for some time and we might want to

return to it on Report, but in the meantime we might want to have a

chat and clarify it for ourselves.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div><a name="06042581000317"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000475"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> That may well be necessary, especially as the

Minister just said that subsection (5)(b) is free-standing from

subsection (5)(a), whereas I thought that he told me earlier that it

was dependent on paragraph (a), which indeed ends with the word

&#147;and&#148;, which suggests that paragraph (b) is not

free-standing. I am happy to have the discussion that the Minister

suggests.</div><a name="06042581000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">To conclude,

I have attempted to remove too much of an element of retrospection.

That is why I talked about planning consent, particularly involving

developments that are already under way, and why I sought to remove

subsection (5)(b), which strikes me as a retrospective provision. It

seems odd that only a few months ago the Minister and I were debating

retrospection about a different form of access. He was arguing against

my case because it was retrospective, but today the boot is on the

other foot. He is trying to do things retrospectively that I believe he

should not.</div> <a name="06042581000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have

had a good debate, and I am grateful to the Minister for his offer to

reconsider certain aspects and explain others.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000478"></a>Paddy

Tipping:</b> I shall use my time constructively. Clause 16

deals with the deregistration and exchange of common land. Amendment

No. 32, in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud,

and the other amendments all reflect the concern of the Committee that

pieces of land of less than 200 sq m may not be properly

protected.</div> <a name="06042581000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

gives a permissive power of replacement, but under the amendments, when

an exchange of land is to take place, whatever its size, new common

land should be put in place. My feeling&#151;I am delighted that it

is shared by other members of the Committee&#151;is that common land

is mostly not large areas of open countryside but small, fragmented

spaces. If land of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>less than 200 sq m is not replaced, we will see the gradual eating away

of commons. That is the purpose of the amendments. I hope that the

Minister will consider

them.</div><a name="06042581000334"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042581000479"></a>Mr.
