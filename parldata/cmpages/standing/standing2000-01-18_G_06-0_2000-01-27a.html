<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 29, line 31, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or who at his death was ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom and had within the previous five years been registered in an electoral register.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a slight tendency to jet lag this morning, but I hope nevertheless to focus the minds of members of the Committee on the amendment. Clause 48(3) deals with the disqualification of bequests as permissible donations where those who made the bequests were not registered on an electoral register at the time of death. The amendment would ensure that such people must, at the time of death, be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and registered on an electoral register for the previous five years.
<P>
That would make a practical, common-sense change, with which I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will agree. Many Committee members will know that people who become infirm or ill, perhaps seriously so, often change address in the last year or few months of their lives. They might enter a nursing home, or move in with relatives. Having had to act as an executor for a relative who died in similar circumstances, it is my experience that such people are not registered on the electoral register at that point. Often, their names are taken off the electoral register at their former address, where they may have lived for 20, 30, 40 or 50 years. However, for one reason or another, such people are often not registered anywhere at the time of death. There are various reasons for that. They might be mentally incapable, or so physically infirm that their carers decide that it is inappropriate to register them. Carers might even overlook registering the new address.
<P>
Committee members may want to reflect on our deeply paranoid fear of the misuse of postal votes in such circumstances. Perhaps a proper way to avoid misuse would be to register such people on the electoral roll to maintain the validity of bequests that would otherwise not be valid according to a common- sense interpretation of the Bill. The amendment would take account of those who have moved in the recent past and are no longer on the electoral register. It would not be right, and it is surely not the intention of the Bill, for bequests to fall simply because such people were not registered during the last year or two of their lives.
<P>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will respond positively to the amendment. He should bear in mind that, as we speak, legislation is passing through the House that will introduce the rolling register. Its purpose is to keep the register up to date, but it is likely to be even more effective than the present system in deleting such people from their previous addresses. However, it is unlikely to be much more effective at re-registering them at their new addresses.
<P>
The amendment would provide a perfectly sensible safeguard for the intentions of people who, in many cases, have given almost a life time's service to a good cause, and have made a series of bequests. It would be strange if their bequest to the dogs' home or to the Children's Society could continue to be honoured, but their commitment to civic society via a political party could not be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) has made some extremely sensible points. It is absurd that a person should be unable to make a bequest simply because he had spent a short period of time out of the United Kingdom at the very end of his life, and was therefore off the register. In all likelihood, the person's estate would still be located in this country.
<P>
The Bill imposes a rather onerous restriction. In many instances, a person might not have picked up the fact that he was no longer in a position to make a donation, when making his will. Will the Minister tell us—leaving out the theoretical issues sometimes raised by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton)—what, in practical terms, would be the disadvantage of allowing a person who died within five years of being on the register, because he had moved away in the last few years of his life, to make such a bequest? Why do the Government fear that it would be wrong, in practice, to allow that? If they can offer no reason—having read the amendment, I cannot think of one—they should adopt this sensible provision.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> This is what might be called a fine-tuning amendment. It does not add greatly to the Bill, which has been out for consultation since last July. I do not wish to deny the right of the Committee to take a legitimate interest in these matters, but some of these small amendments could have been picked up by political parties and fed in through the consultation process. Perhaps we all deserve a hand slapping.
<P>
Two examples have been given. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove focused on a real problem of nursing homes, and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) talked about people overseas. The intention of clause 48 is straightforward, and was discussed at length at our previous sitting. It defines permissible donors. I was asked what the practical consequences of the amendment would be. I do not think that there would be any. There is a philosophical difficulty, which I shall spell out. To be able to donate, one has to be on the register. It would be strange—I will not put it more strongly than that—if people could donate when they were dead. That is a philosophical rather than a practical difficulty.
<P>
On those grounds alone, I am inclined to resist the amendment today, although I shall reflect on it. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove talked about the rolling register, which is covered in other legislation. I take the view that the rolling register will allow a person to come back on to a register within six weeks. We are dealing with a very small period of time and with relatively small situations. I will reflect on the matter. If the hon. Member for Hazel Grove will withdraw the amendment, we will consider what might be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister is right to point out that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and I are talking about two different situations. I was focusing on the situation of people who—in the words of the amendment—are ``ordinarily resident'' in the United Kingdom. I was a little disappointed by the Minister's remarks. The explanatory notes to the Bill are extremely detailed, but on subsection (3) they are absolutely silent—they jump straight from subsection (2) to subsection (4). That is probably right, because it is not clear what mischief the Bill is trying to prevent. We should prevent absentee millionaires from donating large sums to political parties, but I do not want that to mean that a dedicated party worker of 40 years, who puts a small bequest in their will and moves to live with their son-in-law in another part of the country, finds that their wish to make a final donation is not allowed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. However, he is talking about a very small group of people. A dedicated party member who moved would, because of that dedication and their knowledge of the system, register themselves. Cases such as that which he described would be few and far between. I told the hon. Gentleman that we will look at the matter. I am trying to be emollient and cast oil on the water—perhaps he should take note of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister. I explained that an element of jet lag might affect my contribution this morning, and perhaps I should have been listening more carefully. I appreciate his offer to have a further look at the matter, but I hope that, in doing that, he does not use a sledgehammer provision to prevent something other than that which was intended. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): I beg to move amendment No. 30 in page 30, line 30, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9A) No donation by an individual under subsection (2) (a) above may exceed £250,000 in any financial year (as defined in section 36 (6))'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 31 , in page 30, line 30, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9A) A donation by an individual under subsection 2(a) above which is required to be recorded under section 55 must be made by means of a personal cheque drawn on the account of the donor.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Amendment No. 30 would put a limit of £250,000 on the size of individual donations and amendment No. 31 would ensure that donors must write individual donations on a personal cheque on their own bank account.
<P>
If, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, the previous amendment was a piece of fine tuning, amendment No. 30 probably comes under the heading of re-„engineering. It is intended to deal with what many people see as the one major issue that the Bill has not addressed.
<P>
In recent years, public concern has centred on overseas donations and the non-disclosure of donations, both of which are well addressed by the Bill. However, worries about millionaire donors have not been addressed—although, of course, many such donors are overseas and will therefore be covered by the relevant provisions. It makes no difference if a £1 million donation comes from somebody who is resident in this country—a £1 million donation from a single individual will always be a cause for concern. The fact that the donation is disclosed, or that the donor is not foreign, does not address the central problem—that party treasurers, however high minded, will never be able to tread on the toes of somebody who has just given their party £1 million. However well intentioned it may be, a party that relies on big individual donations will always feel beholden to millionaire donors. It will always be nervous of offending them and anxious not to jeopardise the possibility of another donation.
<P>
Parties might be incorruptible in their own eyes, but the public will not necessarily believe that. The public believe that the integrity of parties had been compromised, as we saw with the Ecclestone affair. I believe that the Prime Minister behaved with the utmost integrity in seeking advice from Lord Neill and returning the donation, but justifiably came under attack. That is why I want to impose an upper limit on permissible donations from an individual.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not deny that the figure of £250,000 is arbitrary. Any figure that is suggested will be arbitrary. The Liberal Democrats, in their evidence, suggested a limit of £50,000 for individual donations. I think that that is a little too low because donations of £50,000 or £100,000 are unlikely to buy favours from a Government or be thought to buy favours. The risk of that, or at least of creating the perception of that, arises when donations of £250,000, £500,000 and more are made. My suggested figure is very generous. In Quebec, parties are not allowed accept donations of more than $3,000—£1,500. In the United States, the limit is $25,000—£17,000. There is some talk of increasing that to $75,000, but even that would bring it only to the £50,000 limit proposed by the Liberal Democrats. I propose a limit five times higher than that at £250,000, which would provide plenty of leeway and freedom for individuals who want to give money but stops short of the amount that begins to compromise, or is believed to compromise, the integrity of parties.
<P>
The Neill committee considered donation limits. It argued against a limit on donations for four reasons. First, disclosure should effectively contain the arms race between the main parties. Disclosure is desirable in itself and the Bill forces parties to disclose donations of more than £5,000, which is an important measure, but disclosure alone does not transform the situation in the way that some people believe. The United States has had disclosure for the past 25 years. It has not stopped large donations being made; it has made them more blatant. Some people might be deterred by the threat of disclosure from making a donation, but many others are not. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with those donations, but the mere fact of disclosure does not stop large individual donations.

<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): I thought that the purpose of the restrictions in the Bill was to stop corruption rather than large donations per se. Surely the test that should be applied is not whether large donations cease to be made, but whether the taint or suspicion of corrupt practices following from the making of large donations persists. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that people are happy to continue to make large donations in the full knowledge that everyone knows that they will have done so, what is wrong with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The test of disclosure is merely a test of whether the public know about the donation. They may not know about the strings attached or any understanding between the donor and donee. I do not want to reiterate history unnecessarily, but it is important to understand that many of the donations to both major parties in the past few years became public knowledge not because they were disclosed, but because the donor volunteered the information or it got into the press. Asil Nadir gave £450,000, John Latsis gave £2 million and there have been million-pound donations to the Labour party. The fact of the donations may have been disclosed, but we shall never know what the donor intended, what he hoped to secure from it or, what the recipient was told or led to believe in private. We will never know what possibilities of reward were held out.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> In that case, the limit will not achieve the objective. If someone can give as much as £250,000 openly, is the hon. Gentleman saying that the process will bring into the open any secret strings that might have been attached, whereas if the limit were higher, it would not? If someone is known to have given a large sum, it might be blindingly obvious that a favour has followed: but why should favours be any less concealed when the donation is below £250,000 than when above it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Gentleman's faultless logic misses the issue of magnitude. Political parties are small organisations. The entire budget of the Liberal party is about that of a primary school, while that of the Labour party is about the same as—
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> A secondary school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Indeed. The Labour party's is similar to that of a small college, and even the Conservative party, with all its riches, does not have a budget to match any hospital in the country. Political parties are small organisations. Large donations are always in danger either of influencing us or of being seen by the public to influence us. Many Ministers spend their working lives juggling with billions of pounds— sometimes a Department's budget might be £40 billion or £50 billion. When they go home to their constituencies on Saturdays, they might be running a tombola in a local fete, collecting 50p off the public. There is a big disjunction between the poverty of political parties and the budgets that they bid for when they stand for election to run the country. In those circumstances, large donations can be seen to exert undue influence on the hard-pressed treasurers of political parties. It is important to understand that in any country, there will be important issues of public perception.
<P>
Let me continue with some of the other arguments advanced by Neill. It was argued that it would be easy for a donor to evade an upper limit by spreading resources among friends or by setting up subsidiary companies. In fact, clause 54 will make it illegal to use a friend as a conduit for a donation. The objection has already been dealt with.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): Would the clause cover the case of someone wanting to purchase the handbag of a former Prime Minister? If it were intended to purchase such an item for £500,000, would the clause prevent it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that interesting point. It would cover not only cash donations, but donations in kind. My hon. Friend would agree that the Bill makes it clear that donations in kind are to be treated in exactly the same way as donations in cash. When someone pays an excessive price, the excess will be treated as a cash donation. So £500,000 for a second-hand handbag at the North Dorset Conservative fete or auction would, apart from about £15, be treated as a cash donation. I may, of course, have underestimated the intrinsic value of the handbag: it may have been a Gucci or another of high quality. As my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) said, the handbag of such a famous person would, even in the normal course of events, fetch a few hundred pounds. It would be up to the Electoral Commission to estimate and to agree with the treasurer of the party the excess that would be considered a donation.
<P>
It is important to understand that while the opportunities for evasion will always exist, they must not make us over cautious about legislation. In Quebec, for example, there is a limit of $3,000 or £1,500 on any donation from anybody, including businesses and trade unions. There was much talk in the early days of the big companies, which all support the Liberal party in Quebec, hiring tables at a Liberal lobster dinner and giving all their executives $3,000 to donate which they could then claim back on company expenses. Instead of giving $3,000, a company could in that way give perhaps $24,000. In fact some companies did that, but the Quebec legislature passed a simple law saying that individual donations had to be drawn on a personal bank account, which effectively stopped that practice.
<P>
That is the basis of amendment No. 31. Nobody argues that evasion does not exist, but just as with taxation there are ways of plugging loopholes. New laws sometimes have to be passed to do so. The fact that there are ways of evading tax does not mean that we should not have taxes, and the fact that there are ways of evading the limit on a donation should not stop us setting one.
<P>
Neill's third recommendation, to which we must play close attention, was that the proposals on tax relief would encourage parties to switch from a few big donations to a lot of small donations—the basic move we are trying to encourage in the Bill. Neill said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is therefore unnecessary to introduce a new ban or a donations limit to produce the same result.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the reason Neill gave for not putting forward a donations limit was that that objective would be achieved by the tax relief on donations. The Government have decided—I do not disagree with them on this—that the tax relief on donations has two major faults. One is that it is an indirect and barely disguised form of state funding, which not everyone would agree with. The other is that it gives an unfair advantage to parties that are likely to be supported by richer donors.
<P>
It is not my job, on this amendment, to argue the pros and cons of tax relief on donations, I merely point out that that central part of the Neill recommendations has been rejected. It was intended to achieve exactly what has been achieved in countries such as Canada, where, through the tax system, they have persuaded parties to rely on a large number of small donations rather than on a small number of large donations. Indeed, although the Progressive Conservatives in Canada fought that legislation tooth and nail, they instantly set up a data bank of small donors and replaced all the money that they had lost from large donations. Within a couple of years they were the most effective fundraisers in Canadian politics. All the parties in Canada quickly adapted their fundraising techniques, they forgot about the millionaires and put their energies into finding small donations.
<P>
That was Neill's objective and it is a worthy one. Neill hoped that it would be achieved through tax relief. That is why he did not suggest a donations limit. That tax relief has not materialised. The argument for a donations limit is now much stronger. Neill's objective was to get away from millionaire funding. He proposed one method. It has not been adopted therefore at the very least we should consider a direct limit on donations as a way of achieving the same result.
<P>
There is an argument in Neill, lest anyone thinks that I am trying to overlook this part, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Individuals should have the freedom to contribute to political parties, and the parties should be free to compete for donations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not deny that that freedom is essential. People want to express their support for political parties by giving money. That is not in dispute. What is in dispute, however, is the level to which individuals should be free to make donations and the level to which parties should be free to compete for those donations. In other words we do not want the give and take of politics and the free for all of fundraising to turn into a grubby searching after millionaire donations.
<P>
Before the election the Labour party had no choice but to try to match the fundraising of our main rival, the Conservative party, by seeking large donations of our own. No one denies that. I have already mentioned Ecclestone; Lord Sainsbury has also given donations of more than £1 million. No one denies that that has happened in the past. We are trying to make it impossible for it to happen in future.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the past the Labour party's only argument against a donations limit was that it would stop trade unions or other large organisations giving large sums of money. The aggregate total of all the individual donations given by a single trade union may well be more than £1 million, but that was at a time when no legal distinction could be made between an individual donation, a company donation, a trade union donation and a friendly society donation.
<P>
That difference has been made in the clause. Subsection (2)(a) deals with individual donations and another subsection deals with company donations, which are subject to shareholder ballots. Parties are subject to the Registration of Parties Act 1998. Trade unions are subject to their own political fund ballots. The clause clearly differentiates between the various kinds of donations. It is now possible for the first time to put into legislation a limit on individual donations that does not have the unintended consequence of closing off the possibility of funding from companies or trade unions or corporate bodies of any kind.
<P>
We all know the mischief that has been caused by big individual donations. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield took a rather hostile tone on my amendment about tax exiles. I understand that, but he must realise that the objective of the Bill is not to gain party advantage but to put all parties on a level playing field. Nothing in the amendment is intended to do anything that harms any party. A donations limit will affect all parties in the same way, It will simply remove the possibility—the temptation if you like—of going for rich individuals, and will force us into the good habit of fundraising small amounts of money from members, subscribers, and supporters. They can still give quite generous sums of money, but not sums that will raise the spectre of influence and even corruption.
<P>
Over the past few years we have seen far too much of that kind of thing ever to want even to leave open the possibility that we could go back to it. When Lord McAlpine was treasurer of the Tory party he made no secret of the fact that in the late 1980s, as company donations dried up when companies understandably became more reluctant to give large sums to political parties, he deliberately switched to large individual donations. We only know the ones that have become public. I mentioned Asil Nadir and John Latcis, but British donors gave large amounts of money. Graham Kirkham is one example. Shortly after that he became Sir Graham and he is now Lord Kirkham. I am sure that is just coincidence. Many others have given large individual donations. Because there was no disclosure we do not know how many there were.
<P>
A researcher who has looked into Conservative party accounts from the 1920s and 1930s told me that it was the practice during those years to mark large individual donations with a code. It was not even the initials of the donor. The donor's identity was known only to the party treasurer. There was a letter in the correspondence in which the treasurer wrote to the donor, ``For goodness sake, I've told you before, don't write to me at head office, write to my home address.'' The practice of collecting large individual donations, being careful not to reveal the identity of the donor and receiving them at home addresses, goes back to the 1920s and 1930s.
<P>
No one will convince me or the ordinary voter that such party fundraising is not deeply unhealthy or does not open up a real danger of corruption. One has only to scrutinise the honours list to see at a fairly benign level what it can lead to. Indeed, in more recent times, Brigadier General Sir Brian Wyldbore-Smith who for many years was treasurer of the Conservative party, made no secret of the fact that in the 1980s he was fundraising from wealthy individuals from his home address.
<P>
There is a chapter of political fundraising that every party wants ended. This system forced parties into the arms of individual rich people—who may have been well motivated and gave money for idealistic reasons. We do not know, but it raised in the public mind a great suspicion that favours could be linked. This was all too apparent with overseas donors, who clearly could not have been buying peerages or knighthoods because they did not qualify for them. People obviously wondered what kind of reward they expected for their donation, but that is not very different from home-grown donors of this magnitude. The ordinary voter would not believe that they were all giving money for idealistic reasons, especially when they went to such great lengths to keep this knowledge from the public.
<P>
If we want a new chapter in fundraising in this country—all parties have an equal interest in that—we need not only a ban on overseas donations, and disclosure, but the one reform that is missing from the Bill, which is a limit on very large donations. That will force us all into the better habit of raising our funds from members and small donors.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It is always a pleasure to listen to the hon. Member for Battersea. However, I confess that when I do, a sort of strange state comes over me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> A mist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> It is partly that and partly a sense of the moral world that the hon. Member for Battersea believes can be created by legislation.
<P>
I have some sympathy with some of the hon. Gentleman's points. I accept that one purpose of the Bill is to take a stage further—into, we hope, a reasonably definitive state—the whole issue of transparency. The hon. Gentleman was right: secret donations have been a feature of all political parties for years. Let us take the Liberal party, for example. In the early part of the century the sale of honours by Lloyd George became a matter of well-documented record and it was done to fill party coffers. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman: we want to move beyond that, which is one reason for the Bill.
<P>
Where I part company with the hon. Member for Battersea, however, is that he sees some finite figure, a maximum, as being of assistance in deciding the secret of the donor's heart. It seems to me that some political parties may be bought for far less than £250,000, depending on their size and what they do at the time. The hon. Gentleman seems to be putting a fetter on individual choice, which is a serious matter. If, having won the national lottery, I chose to give £1 million to my party because I believe its cause is a good one, I would feel that Parliament's legislating to tell me that I could not dispose of my money in that way would be a very serious step, all the more so because if there is transparency, the public—the electorate—make the judgment. If they do not like the look of a party because it is bankrolled by four or five individual donors, and it is clear that it is so bankrolled, their approach to it will reflect that. There may be press comment—the hon. Member for Battersea, in his days as a journalist, would have written that that was a terrible thing that showed that the party was losing touch with its grass roots, that it should raise money only from small individual donors and that their motives should be questioned. That is legitimate public comment, and it applies to all parties. If there is transparency, imposing a £250,000 limit will not meet the objective that the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve, is unnecessary and a serious fetter on individual rights.
<P>
The second issue is the personal cheque drawn on the account of the donor. Again, I fail to see what will be achieved. Let us suppose for a moment that I am a wealthy international businessman resident in this country, therefore qualifying to make donations here. I have a current account with tuppence in it at Lloyds bank and in a foreign country I have a trust account, which I control and which has millions of pounds in it. There is nothing to prevent me from transferring the amount of the donation that I wish to make into my personal bank account here before handing over the cheque, nor is there anything to prevent me—if I have a trust account or some suitable account in Britain which I control but in some other form—from transferring the money straight through. The issue is transparency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> If a cheque has to be drawn on a private bank account, it becomes possible for the authorities to check not only payments out of the account but payments into it. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the cases of both Democrats and Republicans in the United States—which has laws against acting as conduits for donations, as well as a limit on donations. By examining personal bank accounts, it was possible to trace where money came from. There have been many cases in the recent past where even presidential candidates have been accused of using individuals in the US as conduits for overseas funding, which is, of course, banned there. It would be important to have that control, whereby money has to pass through a personal bank account, so that one can see whether money has gone in from another source before being passed down in the form of a donation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not follow that argument. Political parties will have to be responsible for identifying the donor. If I gave the Conservative party a cheque that happens to be from an account that is not in my name but on which I am a signatory, the Conservative party would be under a duty to say, ``That money does not come from the name on the account, it comes from Dominic Grieve''. If subsequently the commission mounted an investigation, the onus would be on the party to justify accepting the money. I would then have to say, ``It's perfectly all right. It may have some bizarre name—which I shall not attempt to invent—on the account, but this is me'', and I would have to prove it. The mechanism already exists. Of course the name on the account could indeed be a front. I could give a cheque written in my name on my bank account and signed ``Dominic Grieve'' which had been contributed to by a transfer into my account of millions of pounds from a third party who was not eligible to make that donation. The name that appears on the cheque is completely irrelevant. The Bill rightly puts the onus on the party to ensure that the money comes from the person who is giving it and to identify that person. If it gets that wrong, serious penalties may be visited on the poor unfortunate party treasurer who accepted the donation.
<P>
On the other hand, on occasion—someone might quite legitimately hand over money that is theirs but which is not in the form of a personal cheque drawn on the donor's account. For example, it is not clear from clause 48 what happens with joint accounts. Suppose I wished to donate money from my joint account with my wife; would that fall foul of the amendment? I understand what the hon. Member for Battersea is getting at, but amendment No. 31 would in no way achieve his aim.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I shall not delay the Committee for long because I suspect—although I may be wrong—that the Government are not minded to accept either of the amendments. I was intrigued to hear the hon. Member for Battersea say that the Labour party sought large individual donations only catch up with the Conservative party in this war. I suspect that there were other motives as well.
<P>
The amendment is somewhat illogical in that it deals with individuals having undue influence. If it were logical, the hon. Gentleman would table further amendments to impose similar limits on donations by companies.
<P>
It is right to say that £250,000 to one man might be the equivalent of £250 or even £25 to another; it depends on one's relative wealth. I would like to have £250,000, let alone be in a position to donate it to the Conservative party. The real question that is begged by amendment No. 30 is whether it is right for Parliament to decide whether a large donor has undue influence, or whether that is for the electorate to decide. The Bill aims to introduce transparency; it will then be for the electorate to decide whether Mr. Bernie Ecclestone donating £1 million to the Labour party was in any way related to advertising on formula one motor cars and the likely legislation that would come as a result of EU directives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> What is the electorate to do when all parties receive donations in the same way? Would not the inevitable consequence of not having legislation such as this be that all parties would try to attract funding in the same way to match their rivals? The idea that one party will raise funds in one way and another party in another, and that the electorate can, by the exercise of their votes, choose between different forms of fundraising is deeply flawed—if it were not, it might be a solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I fear that it is a solution and that the electorate can say, ``A plague on both your houses''; perhaps they would then be misguided enough to vote for the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
The Conservative party has made it clear that making donations does not buy political influence. In his evidence to the Neill committee, Lord McAlpine talked about party treasurers tearing their hair out when the previous Government did things that were not in the interests of some of the party's donors. I fully acknowledge that the Labour party returned Mr. Ecclestone's donation because it was felt that it had been given for the wrong reasons. Mr. Ecclestone was still allowed to carry on his business with tobacco advertising for a further nine years; nevertheless, the judgment of Labour party treasurers got the better of them.
<P>
It is for the electorate to decide on this, in the same way as they may wish to make a judgment on donations that are made to individual Members of Parliament or on whether Members are sponsored by trade unions.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 deals with bank accounts, but we do not favour it for practical reasons. What about a donor who runs a small close company and uses a company cheque? That money is his money—he is probably the principal or only shareholder in the company. Again, what about a partnership account? We can clearly distinguish who the partners are, and if one partner has a cheque drawn on the partnership account as a matter of convenience we can still see that it is the partner in question who wished to make that donation.
<P>
Then there is the fatal flaw, which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield touched on: cheques that are paid on a joint account. I can think of some practical examples from my constituency. I am still considering the consequences of this measure and I want to raise this issue in later amendments.
<P>
What about a marriage wherein one partner is eligible and the other is ineligible? I can think of several donors in my local association; their cumulative donations in any one year are more than £200, but while the husband is British, the wife is American, which makes her an ineligible donor to the party. If the husband writes out a cheque for £250 that is drawn on a joint bank account, I presume that under the terms of the amendment the party would have to return that donation or the donor would have to say, ``This is my money which I am giving''. For that very practical reason, the amendment should fall, if it is not withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Davidson </B>(Glasgow, Pollok): I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea for drawing the parallel, which had not occurred to me, between the Liberal party and a primary school. I do not think that I will ever view the Liberal Benches in the same way again. Perhaps I should be more cautious with you in the Chair, Mrs. Michie, but I now see you as the head girl and hockey captain—a highly reputable figure, if I may say so, unlike other Liberal Democrat Members whom I see as the class swot, the one who smokes behind the bike sheds and the one who tugs the girls' hair and runs away. I digress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): Carry on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> There is more, which I shall come to in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend would tell us who the head boy is these days.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> Indeed, we have gone from the male equivalent of Sporty Spice to the under-developed swot who has not yet properly matured.
<P>
I take the view that money in politics has a corrupting effect. Over the years I have seen the way in which money has bought influence and there is no doubt that its use and misuse has a corrupting effect. I would much prefer a degree of state funding, which would avoid the cap-in-hand dependency that is created by individual donors.
<P>
If we are not to take that route, we must recognise that giving, seeking and obtaining money and dialogues about exchanging it create dependency. The need continually to obtain money creates a sense of obligation towards the donor on the part of the recipient. We must look for ways to minimise the effect of that on the body politic.
<P>
Experience undoubtedly shows that those who contribute substantial sums to political parties have had greater access. They have not necessarily enjoyed direct favours, but they have, at the least, been able to command greater understanding of their views. They have had an opportunity to express their views, which have been listened to, although not necessarily acted on. That goes far beyond the opportunities of the ordinary voter in the street, who does not have such access. We should consider ways in which to rectify that, and a scale limit would be a helpful way of doing so. It would force political parties to move more towards a mass base of supporters from whom they would raise money, rather than relying on a few wealthy people.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> If one accepted the hon. Gentleman's argument, somebody who gave as much as £250,000—that would still be allowed—would get all the access that he wanted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> The number of people giving £250,000 will, I hope, be far larger than the number of multi-million pound donors. There is a balance to be struck between the numbers involved and the degree of access. The biggest donors are obviously the foreign potentates who have given money to the Conservative party. There is a question of scale. The amount of access that such people had to Conservative Prime Ministers and Ministers was obscene, and nobody could possibly defend it. Reducing the amount would increase the number of people involved. I would have reduced the amount still further, but I am prepared to accept the proposed figure. However, I would have thought that £50,000 or £100,000 was more reasonable.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter) spoke about Conservative treasurers tearing their hair out—I have great sympathy in that regard—because of decisions made by their Government. Such anxiety on the part of the treasurer would be communicated in some way or other, formally or informally, through the party mechanism and would be understood by those who took the decisions. That is not to say that those involved would directly amend a decision. However, that anxiety would be in back of their minds and would undoubtedly be taken into account when future decisions were made. That is not a healthy relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that no fewer than four successive chairmen of the Conservative party in the l980s had been either Secretaries of State or junior Ministers at the Department for Trade and Industry? I do not believe for a moment that they could have applied Conservative fundraising principles to their decisions at the DTI. However, they must always have had such things at the forefront of their minds, and they dealt with the same people across the negotiating table when seeking party funds as they did when they were DTI Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> That demonstrates clearly the unhealthy relationship that can arise and which has arisen between fundraising and political influence. I went to the United States with the British American group as part of an exchange with Congressmen. I spoke with a Congressman who had a marginal seat, and he explained that, on average, he spent two hours every day fundraising. He went all round the country speaking to people and trying to get money out of them for his next campaign. Every two years, his congressional seat came up for election. I have no doubt that people were buying influence, and the Congressman was quite open about that. He approached people on the basis of the decisions that he had taken, those that he was likely to take and what people regarded as a reasonable way of spending their money to obtain political influence.
<P>
We are not moving in quite that direction, but my experiences demonstrate that there is an unhealthy link between political funding and political influence. The amendments are a step in the right direction, and the Government should accept the spirit of them.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I will not go too far into the comparable organisations of the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives and the Labour party. However, it might be better to have the ethics and finances of a well-run secondary school than those of a casino.
<P>
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) on Second Reading. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am arguing only for a cap on expenditure that is substantially below what the Bill proposes, for a cap on individual giving of around £50,000, and for a modicum of state funding for elections.''— [Official Report, 10 January 2000; Vol. 342, c. 59.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Inevitably, when one considers a Bill clause by clause in Committee, one examines the twigs, never mind the trees, with great care and skill, and does not necessarily see the forest. If one considers the measures in isolation and not as part of the whole package in the Bill and if one considers the amendment without thinking about the wider implications, one could be led astray and end up with a less than satisfactory situation.
<P>
We must consider the approach that we are taking in the Bill to limiting overall national campaign spending. That must be a good and healthy step forward. I should perhaps mention that substantial national campaign spending does not necessarily mean substantial national campaign success. My well-run secondary school spent about one fifth of the amounts spent by the two major parties in the election, but got about half the votes that they did. We certainly got a more efficient return for our national campaign spending.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I do not know how the hon. Gentleman's party's spending on the election compared with that on the previous election, but I guess that it was greater. However, his party managed to get 1 million fewer votes than it did in 1992. I wonder whether that was a good return on its investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I suppose that my point was that we doubled the number of our Members of Parliament. That is a record of which we are proud, and we might look to a further doubling at the next election. It is perhaps inevitable on such a sensitive issue that we should lurch towards a slightly more partisan approach, although I am happy to join in.
<P>
Amendment No. 53 deals with the tip of the iceberg. If we do not take a longer look, we may miss some important points. One point on which Labour colleagues might reflect is that, although they have for a long time been chasing the large commercial, industrial and financial donations that have gone to the Conservatives, they have a ready source of funding in the form of the trade unions. The potential for disproportionate influence and access is just as dangerous with one source of funding as it is with another. I do not seek to excuse the things that the Conservatives have done. I join the hon. Member for Battersea in criticising many of them, as I have publicly in the past. However, I must remind him that I have also criticised the Labour party for the excess influence and funding of the trade unions. We need a balanced approach. We need to consider what we are trying to stop, and then establish the best mechanisms to achieve it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson), aside from his interesting analogies, argued that nobody could doubt that money gains access to a political party. Perhaps we should reflect on what else, apart from money, gains access. It could be hard work, commitment, devotion or the votes that one can command through a trade union organisation, for example. It could be popular support, leading to the potential for more subscriptions from members who will subsequently vote in the policy-making process. In each case, one can see how excesses have occurred in the past. This section of the Bill essentially deals with the problem of the excessive influence that can come from large sums of money.
<P>
On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross argued the same point that we put to the Neill committee—that it is necessary to regulate the maximum donation that any individual, as any other source, can make. My right hon. Friend was not naïve about it: if parties cannot acquire funding from one source, they must either acquire it from another or reduce their expenditure.
<P>
Let me deal with the reduction of expenditure argument. It might be a good idea to reduce excessive spending on national campaigns in British politics, but there is also the argument that the general public are finding it increasingly difficult to get excited by, or interested in, British politics—so reducing expenditure on national campaigns might not lead to an increase in turnout. Those who criticise excess spending, as I have, also need to reflect on how to ensure that, if spending is reduced, the British public remain engaged with British politics and the democratic system. As I said, my right hon. Friend was not naïve in arguing that, to bolster the performance of national or other campaigns of political parties, the issue of state funding must be addressed.
<P>
The amendment does not relate directly to state funding and I do not want to stray out of order. However, there must be linkage. Imposing a cap or a ceiling links in with the issue of where alternative resources will come from. Instead of one donor of £5 million, there might be 20 donors of £250,000. Perhaps the Quebec experience shows that that is right, although sources tell me that Canadian legislation has been fraught with difficulties.
<P>
Does the hon. Member for Battersea, who tabled the amendment, also support the view on the state funding? I understood him to say no to that and to tax exemptions for small donations. Will he clarify exactly what his approach amounts to in going down this track? One cannot expect half a remedy to provide a full cure.
<P>
In relation to the hon. Gentleman's amendment on personal cheques, I hope that he will respond later to some of my points. He wants to prevent someone handing over shedfuls of money in brown envelopes by ensuring that donations are traceable. Responding to an intervention from the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), he said that he intended donations of goods and services in kind to be included. However, what prevents me from donating, instead of a shedful of money, a shedful of Rolls-Royces or computers, which would bypass amendment No. 31? If it is that easy to bypass such a provision, it is unlikely to be useful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea described the amendment as a piece of re-engineering. It would change the Bill radically. My hon. Friend has obviously used his idle hours during the past three days to sharpen his arguments, which were persuasive. He acknowledged that the Neill committee had considered the matter in great detail.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove reminded me, as did my hon. Friend, that one of the Neill committee's more important recommendations was for a cap on funding. Later in our proceedings, my hon. Friend will want to explore that matter in more detail; he likens the desire to gain extra money to an arms race.
<P>
Neill covered the matters raised in amendment No. 30 at some length. First, Neill concluded that individual donors should have the freedom—a word used by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—to decide how much to spend. I see no compelling case for restricting people in that way. Call me an old-fashioned liberal—hon. Members may want to call me something else—but a strong, final case cannot be made for saying that, by definition, individuals should not spend more than a certain amount. I understand the spirit of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson), but one of the realities of the Neill approach, which is reflected in the Bill, is that parties will have to work hard for smaller individual donations. A sea change is taking place, which is right, but it must be for individual parties to decide.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea and others acknowledged that the key argument is for disclosure. If donations are to be acknowledged—if they are put in the public arena—there will be no need to push for such large donations.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I support what the Minister is saying. As a former researcher, I would say that the Conservative party made a great deal of political capital out of the financial donations made by trade unions to the Labour party. If the public can see what is being given, they can judge for themselves how much weight to put on it. That is quite different from saying, once it is known what donations are being made, that people cannot donate more than a certain sum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea have a long history of researching such matters and shining light into dark corners, They represent different sides of the political argument, but they both have the tenacity to seek out dark secrets. though sometimes they may look for secrets that are not there. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that if we can move away from that secrecy, if we can lift the veil and make clear to the public at large the nature and the size of donations, the problem will, to a large extent, go away.
<P>
A subsidiary argument is that Neill took the view that it would be extremely difficult to enforce any limit on donations. However, that is a practical matter, so I shall not make much of it.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea referred also to another matter. He rightly said that clause 48 differentiates for the first time between individuals and organisations such as the trade union movement. Amendment No. 30 would not affect that. In fact, that argument works against him. If we were to put a cap on individuals, a case could be made for reconsidering the matter and extending the provision to trade unions and other organisations. That would create a sense of equity.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I realise that I may not have wholly persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), who is not in the Room at the moment, knows that our hon. Friend has form on such matters. I have no doubt that he will continue his campaign, but I ask him to consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 is different, although the two amendments are clearly linked in my hon. Friend's mind. He did not speak at length about it, which leads me to suspect that he thought amendment No. 30 to be more important—which it is. He was right to say that if amendment No. 31 was agreed to, it would make it easier to identify the key donor.
<P>
Amendment No. 31 is deficient in several ways. The hon. Member for North Dorset spoke about some practical problems, which I shall deal with in a moment. First, I want to speak gently to the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. If a director makes a donation on a company account, the donation would clearly come from the company. The director might have a large, personal financial stake in it, but, in the example given, the donation would be made by the company.
<P>
I shall speak briefly about the practical issues. The changes in the banking system mean that people have a variety of ways to make payments. Armchair banking appears to be the rage. Amendment No. 31 would not totally resolve the problem. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield argued strongly that the Bill includes a raft of safeguards. He was right to say that one of the key elements of the Bill is the restrictions that it puts on parties, which have to identify the source of donations. I know that some hon. Members feel that that provision might be too onerous, but one of the Bill's strengths is that the party treasurer or the person who receives donations must search out the source of the money. That safeguard makes amendment No. 31 unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> My hon. Friend challenged me to call him an old-fashioned liberal. I would not want to disappoint him, so I shall call him an old-fashioned liberal—not an old-fashioned Liberal, of course—
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Like Lloyd George.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Not like Lloyd George, who sold peerages in great numbers; indeed, many of the ancestors of the hereditary peers who have now left the other place bought their peerages by paying money, not to Liberal party accounts as such, but to the Lloyd George fund. They included not only newspaper proprietors but industrialists of all kinds, down to the famous custard powder manufacturer.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary obviously means liberal with a small ``L''—an old-fashioned liberal. I happily call him that, because the argument in the amendment, like that of my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok, is not based on denial of freedom. Setting the limit as high as £250,000 is a clear acknowledgement that, as far as is compatible with other considerations, we want to leave the maximum room in our society for people to express their support for political parties, as they do for charities and many other organisations. However, the limit is also a recognition of the fact that unlimited donations to political parties present an impossible difficulty.
<P>
We do not know what the largest single individual donation to a political party has been in this country, although we know the largest company donations. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove may not remember, but for many years a Liberal party donor held the record. Anthony Jacobs of the British School of Motoring was the record-holding donor to a political party. His donation was a mere £200,000, however. Multi-million pound donations may have been made to political parties and remained obscured from view.
<P>
Such donations raise serious questions about how we conduct our democracy. I do not understand how anyone, old-fashioned liberal or not, can deny that someone who gives £5 million, £10 million, £15 million or £20 million to a political party, as many could afford to do from the loose change in their pockets, might provide a genuine challenge, not for them or for issues of freedom but for issues of democracy. Should we allow parties to accept donations of that size?
<P>
I merely ask for an acknowledgement of the fact that, although people should have the freedom to give money to political parties, a limit must be specified. Perhaps disclosure will show what sort of donations continue to be made happily by people who know that their donations will be disclosed. If donors give £5 million or £10 million, I should have thought that even old-fashioned liberals such as my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary would begin to ask whether that is more of a strain than political parties can bear, in relation not only to fair rivalry between parties but to buying influence, or at least the public perception of doing so. The problem relates not necessarily to donors' motivation in giving money but to the fact that because political parties are intrinsically such small organisations, bidding to run a Government with a budget of £300 billion, the political process has a natural vulnerability. More than from any other route, that vulnerability comes from the funding of political parties. That is why different rules must apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am intrigued by what the hon. Gentleman says. In the last general election, the Referendum party was personally financed by one man. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that if one man decided to field candidates throughout the country and fund their campaigns and a party to support them, he should be denied the right to do so? Not that the late Sir James Goldsmith did me any good; he won 2,500 votes in my constituency, and, on its own estimate, my party lost about 13 seats in which that party made the difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I am not trying to deny the right of individual multi-millionaires to establish their own parties; indeed, one of the implications of placing a limit on giving money to existing political parties is that if they want to influence the political process, they should do so themselves and fund their own parties. [Interruption.]
<P>
The Referendum party was not an existing party—it was a new party set up by Sir James Goldsmith. Under the Bill, there would be a limitation on how much can be spent. The point is illustrated by American politics—
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I was with the hon. Gentleman up to that point, but now he seems to have confused himself Is he saying that the amendment would not have applied to Sir James Goldsmith if part way through an election campaign, he decided to top up the party's funds with a £1 million donation? Would he not have been caught by amendment No. 31?

<P>

<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Even Sir James Goldsmith, as leader of his own Referendum party, could not make donations to his own party without coming under the legislation. It is open to Ross Perot in the United States, for example, to spend $30 million or $40 million on a campaign. The hon. Member for North Dorset is saying that even with that kind of money success cannot be bought, yet it is amazing that someone like Ross Perot can get 20 per cent. of the vote simply by the expenditure of a large amount of money. That is more of an argument for an overall limit on campaign expenditure than it is for a limit on individual donations. Both limits should apply because democracy cannot stand the strain of funding either by individual millionaires or unlimited spending. Both apply in the example that he cites of people who want to buy into the political process in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): I am interested in and enjoying the debate. However, the hon. Gentleman misunderstands a fundamental point—although the motives behind his amendment are entirely honourable—because there is an essential element of freedom, without which freedom democracy cannot operate. The hon. Gentleman has admitted that Sir James Goldsmith would not now have been able to fund his party in the way that he did. Our party admitted that Sir James Goldsmith's party inflicted considerable damage on a number of our colleagues, including me, in Cheadle. However, we protect and support the right of people in a democratic system to have the freedom to do that if they so wish. The hon. Gentleman may be in danger of getting into conflict over the concept of freedom within the political system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I think we would be straining your tolerance, Mrs. Michie, if we digressed into a general philosophical debate, interesting though it would be and important though it is for underlining the political philosophy behind the Bill. This is the first time that we have legislated on party funding. Freedom must be given its maximum play in the system, but limits must be placed on it. A limit must be placed not only on a party's overall spending but on the contribution of an individual donor. I do not think that the same arguments would be applied to donations from companies or trade unions, because they are aggregates of many individual decisions. A trade union can give money only if levy-paying members agree to it, and the money goes into a central fund for donations. Under the Bill, a company can give money only if its shareholders so decided in a ballot. A donation that is an aggregate of many individual decisions is distinct from that of a single person in its effect on the political process because a Government who know that a company or trade union has given money is not under immediate threat because they know that that decision, resting as it does on the decisions of hundreds of thousands of members or shareholders, cannot easily be overturned by its executive or board of directors, whereas when decisions are made by individuals, one is always at the mercy of them changing their mind.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I cannot let that go unchallenged. If the hon. Gentleman believes that trade union decisions are immutable because they rest on a broad pyramid of decisions taken at mass membership level, he has never heard the expression ``trade union barons''. The people who run large organisations—the same applies to companies and shareholders—have a massive ability to switch the policy of individuals when opportunities arise. If the hon. Gentleman is not aware of that, he is not living in the real world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The hon. Gentleman had a little window of experience into the Labour party in Newham in the late 1970s. He and I crossed swords many times then because I believed that he was a bedsit Tory infiltrator long before he admitted it to himself.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> The only flattery of him that I can give is that he did enormous damage in his short period there, mainly by his attempts to bring lawyers into internal party disputes. I know that my remarks are tangential, but the hon. Gentleman's limited experience is frozen in time. If there ever was a time and level of activity when individuals could make decisions about trade union political funds and how they should be spent, it is long passed. Trade union leaders have some discretion over the use of political funds, but it is not that great. They cannot turn off the tap. Sooner or later the money must find its way to the cause for which it was donated and intended.
<P>
The fact that company boards and trade union executives have some power over the funds does not alter the basic difference that a donation of £5 million or £10 million from an individual puts the Government far more at the mercy of that donor. It is a far more powerful tool if the donor can immediately switch off that funding. We often think that large donations are made in a single lump sum, but that is not necessarily the case. The point about Azil Nadir was not that he gave £450,000 to the Conservative party, but that he did so in lumps of £50,000 every six months for three years.
<P>
The treasurer of the Conservative party would have known that any action to clip the wings of that business man would have cut off an important source of funds. It is deeply worrying to the Conservative party, as much as it is to the Labour party that that situation continued until, months after, the Department of Trade and Industry started to investigate Azil Nadir's company. From that experience, the Conservatives must see the enormous dangers that such large donations can cause to the political process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am intrigued that the hon. Gentleman has cited an historical example, given that, at the general election, his party was committed to the transparency of political donations. His party is also committed to preventing people from smoking, yet the treasurer of the Labour party openly accepted donations from Mr. Bernie Ecclestone, and did not return them until the heat became intense. Can the hon. Gentleman explain that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I started from the premise that the problem affects both parties. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that we were in danger of lurching to a more partisan approach. If I have contributed to that, I apologise. We have a rare window of opportunity to put party funding legislation on a level playing field that favours no party more than another.
<P>
The precondition for party funding legislation in any country is the party that is committed to it getting into government, but often the poorer party wins and the richer party loses. The richer party recognises that, although it might have a short-term advantage under a system that allows it to attract more money than its competitors, in the long term it will not have such an advantage.
<P>
The Labour party is committed to the introduction of a fair party funding system, and the Conservative party has now recognised that the law must be put on a sound and fair basis. In his first speech as party leader, the Leader of the Opposition committed his party to the essential pillars of the Bill—a ban on overseas funding and disclosure of large donations. If he reflects on his party's recent history, he will acknowledge that a third pillar is needed—a limit on individual donations. Most of the problems that his party experienced at the election resulted not from overseas donors but from donors in this country whose donations were so large that, in the public's mind at least, they created undue influence.
<P>
To object to the drift of my arguments on that basis that the Inland Revenue will have trouble distinguishing between joint and individual bank accounts is to miss the point. The method proposed in amendment No. 31 is not the only method that can be used to identify an individual donation; it is one of a battery of methods. Clause 54 creates an offence punishable by up to a year in jail for acting as a conduit through which money can be passed to political parties.
<P>
Under the amendment, individual donations would have to be made from a personal bank account, which would be an extra arrow in the armoury to make it more difficult to evade the law. Its reference to ``personal bank account'' is not meant to be personal as opposed to joint, but personal as opposed to company bank account. Company donations would be covered by other tight rules under the Bill. We are talking about individual donations from bank accounts in individuals' names.
<P>
Amendment No. 30 proposes the figure of £250,000 to deal with the problem of millionaire funding. If the limit were £1 million, it would be relatively easy for a multi-millionaire to use his joint bank account with his wife to give £2 million or to use his family account to give, perhaps, £4 million. Even if a multi-millionaire could justify a double donation with his wife through their joint bank account, or a donation from his family account, it still would not bring the donation over £1 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am still not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has answered my point. I gave constituency examples of husbands and wives where the wife is not a permissible donor but has a joint account with her husband. Would the party treasurer have to return half a donation because it was not from a permissible donor although the cheque was drawn on a joint account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> No, because the Bill would not make it illegal to give money from joint accounts; nor would it be illegal to give £250,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I accept that these are probing amendments that can be tidied up, but as they are drafted it would be impossible to draw a cheque on a joint account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> If that is how the banking industry uses the word, I am not aware of it. I mean an account of a person as opposed to of a company. I am sure that such problems of definition can be sorted out through careful wording. The amendment is intended not to prohibit the use of joint bank accounts, but to ensure that individual donations in cash are made through personal bank accounts rather than company bank accounts.
<P>
I do not propose to press either amendment to a vote, as I have an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that he agrees with their spirit. I do not know how far he is prepared to go down the road, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say on the issue in future. I should like an acknowledgement that the problem of the level of individual donations is real and is separate from the problem of the expenditure in terms of a campaign. On the understanding that the Government recognise that the problem must be addressed, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 31, line 27, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is notified in the usual way'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`has received notification in writing'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a minor probing amendment to elicit some clarification from the Minister. Clause 49 contains provisions that govern when a donation can be said to have been received. They are therefore important, so they should be clear.
<P>
Clause 49(6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where a donation is received by a registered party in the form of an amount paid into any account held by the party with a financial institution''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a bank or building society
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it shall be taken for the purposes of this Part to have been received by the party at the time when the party is notified in the usual way of the payment into the account.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that the expression ``usual way'' will turn out to be some term of art that has crept into financial legislation. However, what is being referred to may not be wholly clear to Mrs. Brown or another such treasurer, so I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify what is meant.
<P>
Generally speaking, we normally receive notification that money has been paid into an account and that a cheque has not bounced when we receive a monthly statement. Such statements are in writing, which is why we tabled our amendment. If something else is intended, I should be grateful to hear about it. The ``usual way'' is deliciously opaque.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I also want to hear what the Minister has to say. I shall bring back Mrs. Brown once again, with her Post Office account. When a major national party receives a huge donation, it presumably knows that it has received it, but even a monthly statement might not be automatic for an accounting unit that might be small in scale. We should have some clarification of what is meant.
<P>
I remind the Minister that we are in many cases talking about people with fairly amateur skills in the relevant matters. It should be clear what they are expected to do, when they are expected to do it and what their response should be when they know about it.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful for the amendment—I did not think that the phrase ``in the usual way'' was a term of art. This is an issue of drafting; we need to find some way of ensuring that a party's treasurer knows that a donation has been received. If a donation is not valid, he or she must return it within 30 days.
<P>
Of course, if a cheque drops through Central Office's letter box, someone will know about it, but, in our increasingly technological age, much of such work is done by automatic credit transfer. It is therefore important to define the time when the party will know of a donation. If Mrs. Brown has a very small account, she may not get her statement for at least a month more, so there is a problem. In the light of the amendment, I think that we need to refresh the words and find another term of art. If the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is content, therefore, we will take his amendment away and work on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I do not intend to take up any more of the Committee's time on this. On the assurance that something better is to be put together—if it is not, obviously we will want to return to the issue on Report—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Cause 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>Forfeiture of donations made by impermissible or unidentifiable donors</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I rise merely to seek clarification from the Minister on how the clause will operate with respect to forfeiture when a party earns interest on a non-permissible loan and when it has received not cash but material benefit. How will the forfeiture rules apply then? Perhaps I may elucidate with a couple of examples.
<P>
Would a party forfeit the interest that it had received on a loan from a non-permissible donor for the period of that loan? If the party had received a large donation, there would have been interest on it. Even after the party had returned the donation, would that interest be an impermissible donation, which would therefore be forfeited, or would the party have to return the interest to the donor?
<P>
The real problem with the clause may be when the party has been loaned material in the real sense—of facilities, for example, or computer equipment—by a non-permissible donor. It occurs to me that while the computer equipment might be returned, the party would have benefited from it in the meantime—for instance, it could have conducted an election campaign with it. Is some value placed on the use of computer equipment which turns into a fine to be paid into the consolidated fund, or do we simply write it off? I should like some practical guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> I should like to pursue a similar point in relation to material provision. I understand how arrangements could be made in relation to the cost of loaning computer equipment or cars, for example, but how could data that have been provided be given back or forfeited? If computer data on groups of target voters, for example, were to be provided by someone who is not a permissible donor, and had to be given back or was forfeited, that would be different from merely charging those involved for the use of a car or a computer. It might include several computer lists of eligible voters in particular categories, which involved an enormous cost to collect but might involve only the cost of printing to supply.
<P>
Would a penalty such as forfeiture apply in such circumstances? I can understand why campaigns might decide to use assets that they receive, knowing that they will ultimately have to return them but that they will have had the use of them in the meantime. No sanction seems to have been provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): I should like to comment on the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Pollok that another Act contains specific penalties for the improper distribution of intellectual property. In dealing with something as abstract as data, which could be transmitted down a wire and might not even constitute a piece of paper, the Data Protection Registrar has extensive powers, which, I shall argue later, need to be strengthened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davidson:</B> Perhaps I explained myself poorly; I am relatively illiterate in these matters. Let us suppose that the information was not improperly obtained but was obtained through commercial activity and is of enormous commercial value to a political party, such as lists of pensioners in a particular constituency. In such circumstances, the question would be not whether there has been impropriety in acquiring the information but what value it has once it has been transferred to a political party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> It is impossible to put a figure on the value that such information may have. Although it is possible to value the cost of the piece of paper received, the value of information is difficult to identify.
<P>
If I were to pass my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary a 10p piece in full view of the Committee, you, Mrs. Michie, might object that had breached a rule of the House, but at least it would be obvious and transparent. However, if I were to put it in a brown paper envelope and pass it to him, you would not know whether—
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That is not the going rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I accept that, as a Minister of this Government, my hon. Friend cannot be bought at any price. In such circumstance, you, Mrs. Michie, would not know whether I was in breach of a rule of the House. If that envelope contained large wads or ``wodges'', to use a term used in a recent court case, of notes that were the property of a company, it may, because of the nature of that company—because it is an offshore operation, for example—be difficult to identify using reasonable means the source of those funds. The commission would therefore have a problem.
<P>
Is it the Minister's intention that the commission should be able to advise the court that an entry in a party's books can be presumed to have been dubious even if it is not identified as a fraud? We can think of many bookkeeping fiddles to get around these problems, so the commission should, in the absence of transparency, have the power to urge the court to consider that this was an inappropriate donation. That applies to large sums of cash that are transferred and to some electronic transfers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made an observation about armchair banking. The banking system cannot identify how much money transfers across national frontiers on any given night, such is the scope of electronic transfer of funds. Little information about credit transfers appears automatically on one's personal bank account statements. Although one can ask the transferrer to provide supporting documentation, which would be the rational thing to do and a reasonable expectation of the commission, it is extremely difficult, merely by reading bank statements, to identify the source of such funds. In the absence of such information, it should be within the commission's power to invite the court to presume that the source was inappropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This has been an interesting, if unexpected, short debate. I should explain to the Committee that there is a history to clause 51. The Neill committee recommended that impermissible donations should be forfeited, and a levy of 10 times the value should be imposed. The view has been taken that that is contrary to human rights, and would not stand up in court. Therefore, the clause has been drafted in this way.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset gave me two examples: a loan and material such as a computer. Clause 51(2) makes it clear that the order is for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an amount equal to the value of the donation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The court would have to make a decision about the value of the computer and of the data, and that is not an easy judgment. Subsection (5) clearly specifies that courts are different in different parts of the country. It will be up to the individual court to make a decision. They will be tough decisions to make.
<P>
On a loan, the issue is quite clear. The party has had the impermissible benefit of the loan and of the interest that has accrued to it. The court may decide that the interest has to be returned as well.
<P>
I shall not be drawn too far on the issue of data. I know from what I read in the newspapers that this issue has exercised the Labour mayoral candidates in London—the publishing of data to some but not to others. They all have the data now. There could be an interesting discussion on what the value of those data might be.
<P>

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) took us on to the wider issue of legislation surrounding new technology, automated credit transfer, e-mail and so on. He is far more familiar with those issues than I am. We are going through a new industrial revolution. Let us not minimise what is happening. The world is changing in a fundamental way, and we have not yet caught up with the consequences, or even begun to imagine what they might be. The law has not caught up with those consequences either.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, who takes a great interest in these matters, will know the difficulties that this Government and the previous Government had in devising legislation on this matter. I cannot give him an answer today.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should be grateful if the Minister would face this way so that we can hear him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I cannot give my hon. Friend the answers that he seeks, because this is a new, difficult area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I totally understand the point that the Minister is making, and he is absolutely right. Even if it were possible to frame a clause pertaining to the technology of today, it would not accommodate the technology of tomorrow. That is why we should say that it is our intention, in principle, in passing the clause, that the commission should have the right to present the argument to the court that, in the absence of reasonable proof of the source of the finds, the donation should be considered impermissible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That would take us into a very difficult area, because the balance of judgment has traditionally been with the defendant. That proposal would radically reshape the law, and we cannot ask the courts or the commission to go down that road. The wider issue is that of devising legislation that keeps in touch with the wider legislation.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok asked what sanctions there were on the individual. Clause 54 will make it a criminal offence to act improperly. Clause 52 deals with the civil issue of forfeiture. Criminal sanctions will apply to wrongdoers, and have been written into the Bill.

of restrictions on donations
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 33, line 23, at the beginning insert `knowingly'.
<P>
This is a simple amendment which I hope the Government will accept. All our political parties rely on volunteers, and we do not always have absolute control over their thought processes as they go about their business in the interests of the party. Obviously, the Bill contains provision for criminal sanction against party treasurers. The clause creates an offence for anyone else who supports or works for a party by collecting donations.
<P>
Inserting the word ``knowingly'' in clause (1)(a) would make it consistent with clause (1)(b). The clause would then state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person commits an offence if he''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
knowingly—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``enters into, or ... knowingly does any act in furtherance of''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an arrangement that is going to lead to concealment or disguise. It is incumbent on the party treasurer to decide whether he has received a permissible donation. The party treasurer may decide that a donation is permissible when it is not, and consequently take a donation that is not permissible and commit an offence.
<P>
In my party and, I suspect in others, donations are still collected by volunteers who knock on people's doors. Somebody may, in their generosity, say, ``Yes, of course, I will give you some money for the party.'' That money could arrive in a roundabout way, which, when the circumstances were retold in a court of law, might suggest that the person was somehow party to the concealment. For example, Mrs. Smith, the donor, may say, ``Yes, dear, I'll give you some money, but I haven't been to collect it from the bank this week—if you come back tomorrow it will be in a brown envelope under the flowerpot''. If that were later deemed to be an impermissible donation, it might appear that the collector had entered into some form of concealment.
<P>
If the clause is to be of use, it must be incumbent on anybody launching a prosecution for such an offence to prove that the person who was party to the collecting of the money had some form of criminal intent. Clearly, the volunteer collector in my example did not, because they did not knowingly enter into a scheme for ``concealment or disguise''—neither did they, under the clause, knowingly do anything else in furtherance of such concealment.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment or, if not, offer an alternative phraseology that will reassure us that our many hundreds of volunteer collectors across the country are not going to walk unknowingly into the commission of a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I seek some clarification. Incidentally, during my next holiday in North Dorset I shall be careful not to open my door, in case I am bearded by a member of the local Conservative association soliciting funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> They are a friendly society.
<P>
<B>Mr. Linton:</B> I am sure they are.
<P>
What might the use of the word ``knowingly'' introduce? I should not like it to create a situation whereby ignorance could be used as a defence against the law. For instance, if someone were to ask a resident of this country to open a bank account which was to be used as a conduit for donations from an overseas donor, would the person who opened the bank account have to be aware that the donation was impermissible and against the law for it to be an offence? It should be an offence if someone enters into an arrangement to evade the law, and it should not have to rely on the offender knowing the law or the precise purpose of the arrangement.
<P>
Clause 54 is the crux of the Bill in that it holds it in place and it is important that we do not inadvertently open a loophole through which large-scale evasion can take place. History is riddled with small loopholes that later caused enormous problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> When I read the clause, I confess that I was troubled by the absence of the word ``knowingly'' in subsection (l)(a). The drafting is odd because the clause deals with a criminal offence. I know from my experience as a barrister that the use of the word ``knowingly'' is very common in criminal statutes and it provides the classic defence that someone may unknowingly do something with no intention of facilitating the criminal act complained of. Subsection (1) is odd because an act in furtherance of any arrangement that is designed to facilitate, or is likely to facilitate, concealment or disguise for the making of donations has the ``knowingly'' defence, but entering into such an arrangement has not. I could understand that if it stated that a person commits an offence if he enters into any arrangement that is designed to facilitate, with the insertion of a new word in line 25, but that is unnecessary because the problem can be dealt with by stating ``knowingly enters into''.
<P>
If we have got that wrong and have not understood something, I should be grateful to hear from the Minister what it is. It seems very odd that, whereas a series of defences are properly offered to someone who had no idea that the result would be to perpetrate or further a criminal offence, the most basic issue of entering into such an arrangement cannot, apparently, be done innocently.
<P>
If that is really what the Government intend, I hope that the Minister will accept that it is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation I have ever seen on the statute book. It will impose an absolute offence to which there is no defence once it is established that an arrangement was set up. That seems to be contradicted by clause 54(1)(b). I wait to hear the Minister's comments on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for North Dorset asks for comfort and I am happy to give it to him. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield spotted a drafting error and I am happy to accept that. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea asked us to ensure that loopholes are not opened. Defence arguments are given in some parts of the Bill. We are happy to accept the amendment.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 107, line 43, leave out from `paragraph' to end of line 45.
<P>
The schedule is very detailed, and sets out clearly what individuals must do when giving details in donation reports. The Minister will therefore forgive me if I ask why we need paragraph 2(b), which worries me. It envisages that the Secretary of State will be able to make new regulations merely after consulting the commission. This is a probing amendment, and we have already asked whether it is right for the Secretary of State to make regulations merely on the basis of consulting the commission, rather than according to a recommendation by the commission. That is a sub-issue to which the schedule gives rise, but the important question is: what other information could the Secretary of State or the commission possibly require? If the rules in such a detailed document are to be changed, Parliament should be told why.
<P>
There is an important issue here. We are trying to de-politicise party funding and establish clear ground rules with which everyone is familiar, and which command widespread acceptance. Let us imagine that the day comes when the Secretary of State, after consulting the commission, announces that the detailed provisions in schedule 5 need alteration. Although that may constitute a response to a particular and widely recognised problem, it may not do so in respect of other, more sensitive issues. If such an announcement were made during an election campaign, for example, the Minister could doubtless imagine the resulting turmoil.
<P>
That is perhaps a rather far-fetched example, but it shows that we must establish what it is that we want people to do, and leave them to do it without risk or threat of subsequent interference. Before I can accept the schedule, the Minister must convince me that there are good grounds for doing so. Of course, circumstances can change and, as we know, rapid interventions may be required. However, given the schedule's purpose, it is not clear what change or emergency might arise that would require the Secretary of State to intervene in the way that the schedule describes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. During previous sittings of this Committee, I pointed out that we are trying to put in place a robust network of legislative rules that will last a long time. If a Labour Government were to last another 117 years, those who occupy the Minister's post will have participated in many different Parliaments. Even the Minister might concede that possibility, as reference has recently been made to 1,000 days and 1,000 years. During that time, not all Secretaries of State and Ministers will wish their opponents or the democratic system well. A catch-all provision should be resisted.
<P>
If the Minister were able to tell us that the application of paragraph 2 related to the quarterly and weekly reports purely in terms of the reporting requirements, a loophole that cannot at present be envisaged, but might open up in future could be plugged. Even then, I say to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, the procedure would be difficult to come to terms with, and be at least as complex as the electoral rules and regulations with which election agents must become familiar. Changing them during or in the run-up to a campaign would pose great difficulties for parties.
<P>
I am sure that the Secretary of State will say that he understands the issues raised. I hope that he also appreciates that, if such wide powers are given to a Secretary of State, there must be a way of containing their application in certain circumstances. For example, that might be necessary if a Secretary of State were not as well intentioned as the present Secretary of State and his ministerial team, or if the application of a change of rules would be very difficult for the parties to administer.
<P>
An example of the latter might be a local government election campaign, with goodness knows how many election accounts for different parties across the country. Parties might hold 10,000 or 20,000 election accounts during such elections. I seek reassurance about the measure's narrow application, and about the way in which it might be used during an election.

<P>

<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I shall not delay the Committee long. The amendment could be described as philosophical. I am concerned that we have not yet had a debate on part 1, which will be considered not in this Committee but on the Floor of the House. It concerns how the Electoral Commission will be structured, how it will work and how it will be perceived by the electorate.
<P>
If it is the will of Parliament, during the debate on the Floor of the House, that the Electoral Commission should be seen as a strong body, independent of the political process, parties and the Executive, we should insert into the schedule such a phrase as ``such other information as may be required by regulations made by the Secretary of State after consulting the commission.''
<P>
It would be unwise to incorporate the concept of the Secretary of State being able to override the legislation, either after consultation with the commission, or because he was minded to do so anyway, especially we want the Electoral Commission to gain the confidence of those internally involved in politics, and of the wider electorate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall try to persuade the Committee that neither a hidden agenda nor ulterior motives lies behind this part of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield has spelt out the nature of the amendment, which would delete the powers given to the Secretary of State. He said that the schedule was complex and detailed. I remind the Committee that these regulation powers can be exercised only to specify additional information about the donor that must be included in the donation report. That is a precise, focused paragraph and sub-paragraph.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
