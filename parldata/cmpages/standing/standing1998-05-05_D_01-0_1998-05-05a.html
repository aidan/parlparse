<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): I beg to move, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the Data Protection Bill [Lords], with effect from Tuesday 12 May the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the 1995 European Community data protection directive, which was adopted on 24 October 1995. Member states have three years from that date in which to give effect to it in their national law, which means that the target date for bringing the Bill into force is 24 October this year. That background establishes the context behind the timing of the Committee's work.
<P>
The subject matter of the Bill is technical and complex. The time spent on the Second Reading debate emphasises that point. Given the very short Second Reading debate, it is important that the Committee should have a proper opportunity to study the Bill thoroughly and, if necessary, improve it further. However, the overall timetable means that we must allow for careful scrutiny while expediting the Bill as quickly as we can. I am sure that everyone will agree with that.
<P>
The Bill's effects will be felt widely. It will affect probably the whole population and very many organisations. There can be few people in this country about whom information is not held by one organisation or another. Most commercial, government and other organisations hold considerable personal information that will be covered by the Bill.
<P>
The Bill will regulate the way in which information is held, and it needs to do that in a way that provides good protection for individuals, but does not pose unnecessary burdens on organisations.
<P>
It is a long Bill, because it needs to give as much clarity and precision as possible to a highly complex subject. The Bill's scope is wide, and it is essential that we get the regime right.
<P>
The Committee will have seen that the Government have already tabled a number of amendments. Many simply make technical improvements to the Bill, and some give effect to undertakings to consider points that were raised in another place. The bulk of the amendments, however, complete the provision needed to give effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Gaskin.
<P>
I give the Committee notice that the Government have not yet tabled all the amendments that they intend to bring forward at this stage. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department said that we hoped to deal in Committee with the problem of enforced subject access. That remains our resolve. We shall also table an amendment to deal with ethnic monitoring in order to fulfil an undertaking that the Government gave in another place. We intend to table those amendments shortly. There are likely to be others.
<P>
On Second Reading, hon. Members on both sides of the House expressed their general support for the Bill and their willingness to work in a spirit of co-operation and in a way that would make such improvements to the Bill as are necessary. We welcome such an approach and hope that it will help the Committee to complete its work harmoniously and in good time.
<P>
Given the objective of saving time, the Government are willing to deal informally with any questions raised by hon. Members outside the Committee. We do not want to circumvent or short circuit the Committee's work, but merely to make it easier for hon. Members seeking informal clarification and assistance.
<P>
One of the reasons, Mr. Welsh, for my being only just on time for this sitting is that I was fulfilling an obligation to an Opposition Back Bencher. He asked some relevant questions on Second Reading, and I wanted him to have the chance to discuss them with me even before the sittings motion was decided. Those members of the Committee who have guessed which Opposition Member I am talking about will know why I only just made it to the Room on time.
<P>
Finally, I emphasise that the passage of the Bill through the House will not be the end of the debate: that will continue in connection with the directive to which the Bill gives effect. The Bill makes extensive provision for subordinate legislation, much of which will need to be in place for the regime introduced by the Bill to work effectively. If we are to meet the 24 October target, the Government and the House will have much more work to do once the Bill is enacted.
<P>
Given the spirit of co-operation in the Committee, I hope that the sittings motion will allow us to deal with the Bill as quickly as is consistent with the importance and complexity of the subject matter. I know that you, Mr. Welsh, will be as fair and tolerant as you always are. I am sure that the Committee will succeed in improving this important Bill during our proceedings.
<P>
<H5>4.36 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): First, may I say what a pleasure it is to have you, Mr. Welsh, as our Chairman. I am sure that all hon. Members look forward to the Tuesdays and Thursdays that we will spend in your company and that of Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
I shall begin by making a few declarations of interest. For 10 years or more, I have been parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Sales Promotion and to the British Promotional Merchandising Association. Those two trade bodies are distant cousins of the Direct Marketing Association--although the familial distance is only as great as that between the football clubs of Liverpool and Everton in the Minister's area, or between Arsenal and Spurs in north London. The organisations know rather a lot about each other, and I thought it appropriate to mention them, as the Bill contains one provision that affects the direct marketing industry and many of the anxieties that they have expressed are shared by other commercial organisations.
<P>
Furthermore, for 28 years I have had a longstanding interest in the insurance industry. The Minister know that there are some worries about the interests of the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters. I hold no brief whatsoever for that organisation, but I thought it better to air the matter now and so remove any doubt. I hope that my knowledge of those two industries will help the Committee.
<P>
As the Minister said, the Bill will affect every facet of this country's commercial life, every voluntary organisation and every Government Department. As we meet at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm in the weeks ahead, I am sure that the extent of the Bill's influence will become ever clearer.
<P>
Conservative Members do not intend to delay the Bill's progress unnecessarily, but it requires in-depth scrutiny. As the Minister said, the Second Reading debate was very short, and large sections of the Bill were not discussed in the House of Lords. I do not mean to be discourteous or critical towards the other place. It is important that we ensure, taking a constructive and co-operative approach, that the Bill is scrutinised thoroughly. The Minister, Conservative Members and other hon. Members have all tabled several amendments, which shows that we all want to do whatever we can to improve the Bill's clarity and to ensure that it operates as the directive and the Government intended.
<P>
Our key objective is to ascertain the meaning of the Bill's various provisions. The only Opposition Members present are myself and my three hon. Friends. I suspect that we may joined on the odd occasion by one or two Liberal Democrat Members, but I am sure that we can proceed without them. Neither I nor my hon. Friends are lawyers--we are all business men with business experience. Having thought about that a great deal, I have come to the conclusion that it will be to the Committee's advantage. Having studied the Bill, possibly following legal advice, business men and trade associations may derive a meaning that is neither the meaning that the Government intended nor the interpretation that would be arrived at by a court.
<P>
We shall see, where appropriate, to improve the Bill's meaning and definition and to achieve greater clarity. We shall also wish to challenge the Bill's intentions. As my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir B. Mawhinney), the shadow Home Secretary, said on Second Reading, we shall try to identify the areas of the Bill that go beyond that which is necessary under the terms of the directive. That does not mean that we shall seek to change the wording to that of the directive--clearly, that would be nonsensical. ``Gold plating'' is the oft-used phrase that is at the back of our minds.
<P>
Complex matters are involved, and it will take us some time to study them properly. I cannot, at this juncture, give any indication as to how long that will take, but the Committee will clearly be sitting on several Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 am and 4.30 pm.
<P>
I understand that the Government have a heavy legislative programme and that they are therefore anxious to make progress. We were ready to get started on the Bill before now. However, we understand the reason for the delay between Second Reading and the Committee's proceedings--the Government needed to draft a number of key amendments, not all of which have yet been tabled. Given that this issue affects people outside the House so greatly, they should be given the opportunity to consider the amendments and our deliberations on them.
<P>
Our constructive view has already borne fruit. The order paper reveals that the Minister has added his name to one of our amendments. I hope that that was an intentional act and not a May Bank holiday prank. The addition is a clear indication of common agreement on the areas that the Bill should cover.
<P>
Our spirit is one of constructive co-operation. However, we wish to examine the Bill in considerable detail. I hope, Mr. Welsh, that you and your co-Chairman, Mr. Stevenson, will not be inconvenienced by the Committee sitting overly late into the evening beyond supper time. We should not anticipate all-night sittings, or sitting beyond 7 or 7.30 pm in the most extreme cases. I do not know what the Minister thinks about that.
<P>
<b>Mr. George Howarth:</b> We shall see.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As the Minister says, we shall see.
<P>
Data protection is a complex subject, but it touches on everyday issues. Those applications, along with our constructive spirit, will make sitting on the Committee an enjoyable experience. Some hon. Members have been subjected to coercion to serve on the Committee--I will not go into detail about that. However, they may find the experience more enjoyable and interesting than they might have expected.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) is ``the silent one''. He is unlikely to remain so, given the resources that the Committee has at its disposal, but he reminds me to say that Conservative members are willing to sit today and on Thursday. We understand why the Minister wishes the Committee to adjourn until Tuesday of next week, but we want to put our wishes on the record, as the proceedings may continue for longer than the Minister would like. I hope that that will not happen, but we need time to consider some meaty issues.
<P>
<H5>4.47 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): Thank you, Mr. Welsh, for allowing me to comment on the sittings motion. I am happy to sit until 10.30 am and 4.30 pm for however long it takes the Committee to consider the Bill.
<P>
As the former Under-Secretary of State for Science and Technology, I come to the Bill from a non-Home Office angle. There is an argument-- naturally, I will not reveal it--that the Committee might not even be sitting if I did not come from that angle. The Home Office is less enthusiastic about the European directive than those of us formerly in the Department of Trade and Industry. We realise that considerable implications for encouraging electronic commerce and data transmission are hidden in the semi-impenetrable language of a parliamentary draftsman.
<P>
If we enforce provisions that go beyond the European Union and allow data to go into countries that do not have comparable legislation, that has implications for the future of our technology and for trans-national conveyance of data. There may even be an incipient threat of trade wars outside the European Union. We will confront those joys when we consider the detail of the Bill.
<P>I may have declarable interests: since the election I have advised on venture capital, especially in the field of information technology. Those whom I have advised may have interests, although I have no prior knowledge of any. Nevertheless, I thought it advisable to put that on the record.
<P>I look forward to you chairing the Committee with dispatch, Mr. Welsh, while allowing detailed discussions during future sittings.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved.
