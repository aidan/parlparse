<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, it may help hon. Members if I explain the arrangements for tabling amendments during the Easter recess. Amendments tabled up to 4.30 pm on Thursday 27 April will be published on the blue notice paper on Friday 28 April and will be unstarred on Tuesday 2 May. Amendments may be tabled on Friday 28 April up to 4.30 pm but will be starred on 2 May.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I beg to move, amendment No. 90, in page 13, line 9, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for a term of 12 months or more'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 91, in page 13, line 11, leave out `for a term of 12 months or more'.
<P>
No. 92, in page 13, line 14, leave out `for a period of 12 months or more'.
<P>
No. 93, in page 13, line 18, leave out `for a term of 12 months or more'.
<P>
No. 94, in page 13, line 20, leave out `for a term of 12 months or more'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The amendments would delete ``for a term of 12 months or more''. We are discussing matters that were touched on during debates on amendments to earlier clauses at our previous sitting. We are conscious of well publicised cases such as that of Mr. Longmuir, the former drummer with the pop group, Bay City Rollers, who received a sentence of only three months' imprisonment for quite serious offences. The Bill would not catch someone in that position.
<P>
The Minister and other hon. Members will realise the seriousness with which we are suggesting that the Government should reconsider the matter. I do not expect the Minister to tell me today that he agrees entirely, but I hope that he will recognise, as he has helpfully done in earlier debates, that we want a serious debate on the matter and that he will consider the matter further. When serious offences, particularly if they involve child pornography being downloaded from the internet, attract only moderate sentences, ordinary members of the public will feel that offenders should be subject to the automatic trigger disqualification provisions that the Government are introducing in the Bill. We await with interest the Government's response.
<P>
No doubt there will be a continuing debate with child care organisations and we may need to return to the matter on Report and in another place. I hope that the Minister will accept our sensible and constructive approach. It is a matter for debate and the Minister may say that it is a matter for judgment, but our judgment is different and based on what ordinary members of the public are likely to feel about such serious offences. It would be better if there was no limitation that only those who receive a sentence of 12 months or more will be subject to the disqualification. We hope that the Government will reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> These are serious amendments and we are dealing with serious issues. We visited the matter earlier in the course of our proceedings. The amendments would lower the threshold for the imposition of the disqualification from a minimum of 12 months' custodial sentence to any custodial sentence. The effect would be that for those aged 18 or over the offence would carry a quasi-automatic disqualification and for those under 18 it would be at the discretion of the judge.
<P>
Our concern has been to ensure that we have a scheme that will be effective for the protection of children. Disqualification is the serious consequence of a serious offence, and should be imposed by the judge wherever conditions warrant it. That will almost certainly be the case where a prison sentence is imposed that is longer than the term prescribed in the legislation. A reduction in the minimum sentence attracting disqualification would risk weakening the entire scheme. Judges would be reluctant to go down that path, and would find reasons for not doing so. We are determined that the scheme should be as strong as possible, and that disqualification should be treated with the seriousness that it warrants. For that reason alone, in the light of representations that were made, and having consulted on the issue, our view of the matter differs from that held by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and his colleagues. However, he is right to say that these are matters of judgment, and I appreciate the sincerity with which he argues his case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Given that the Minister has accepted that these are matters of judgment, would he, his officials and others with whom the Government wish to consult consider a different approach? Although the automatic trigger mechanism will work in the way that the Government describe, perhaps they should table an amendment at a later stage to enable an order to be made in other circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Of course, it is open to a judge to impose a disqualification. Indeed, if the judge in the Gary Glitter case, to which the hon. Gentleman referred in the previous sitting, had decided that Gary Glitter should not work with children, he would have been able to take the necessary steps. He could have drawn the matter to the attention of the relevant Secretaries of State, so that Gary Glitter would have appeared on their list, or he could have taken other steps under the existing scheme.
<P>
Judges should heed section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which makes it clear that the custodial sentence shall be,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where the offence is a violent or sexual offence, for such longer term (not exceeding that maximum) as in the opinion of the court is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In sentencing a person convicted of a violent or sexual offence, judges should have in mind the need always to protect the public through the length of sentence imposed. We are encouraging courts to take that fully into account, and we are open to suggestions on how to ensure that the Criminal Justice Act 1991 is kept in the forefront of judges' minds. I appreciate the circumstances that the hon. Member for Surrey Heath is trying to avoid, but such an approach might be more useful than that adopted in the amendment.
<P>
I and my officials will reflect on how we might ensure that, in imposing an initial sentence, judges are aware of all available options, including drawing a particular case to the attention of the relevant Secretaries of State. In terms of the length of sentence imposed, judges should also have in mind the impact of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. In the light of that assurance, and for the reasons I have given, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for approaching the matter in exactly the way in which I hoped he would. He might also agree that it could be helpful to judges and magistrates if the Bill were to contain a provision to add to the automatic trigger disqualification orders, so that they need not constantly refer back to earlier legislation. I take his point about the existing powers. However—to return to a helpful point that was made during the previous sitting by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry)—we should seek to avoid complexity and to ensure that judges and magistrates can easily see, in one piece of legislation, what their powers are. That was my point; I am sorry if I did not express it clearly. The Minister has helpfully suggested that he will reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> He clearly understands my point. Although he has made no commitments, I am sure that he will consider with his officials whether there is scope—perhaps through a Government amendment—to incorporate that discretion within the Bill for sentences of less than 12 months. On that basis, and given that we are certain to return to the matter in another place and on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I rise briefly to refer to an amendment that we tabled for debate under an earlier group, as members of the Committee may recall from the previous sitting. It would have inserted some words into clause 29(1)(a) to add an alternative third condition where the first or second condition is satisfied. We have dealt with that matter, Mr. Maxton, but you kindly gave me leave under a point of order to return to it, so that those who read the Committee's proceedings will know that we hoped at one stage to persuade the Government to consider the proposal. Having reminded the Committee of that, I do not seek to discuss it further.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss new clause 1—
<P>
Reinstatement of Disqualification Order—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) This section applies where the Tribunal has directed under the provisions of section 30 that a disqualification order is to cease to have effect in respect of an individual.
<P>
(2) A relevant person may at any time apply to the Tribunal for the reinstatement of the disqualification order.
<P>
(3) An application under subsection (2) may only be granted if the Tribunal is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it is likely that the individual may commit a further offence against a child.
<P>
(4) Where the Tribunal reinstates an order under this section, it must state its reasons for doing so and cause those reasons to be included in the record of the proceedings.
<P>
(5) In this section, ``relevant person'' means—

(a) the Secretary of State;

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> New clause 1 would introduce an arrangement whereby disqualification orders that had ceased to have effect could, in certain circumstances, be reinstated. This is an extremely serious issue, and the new clause would add a helpful provision to the Bill. We recognise that the introduction of disqualification orders will create a useful additional power for the courts. The Government should therefore consider the circumstances in which a tribunal may—understandably—direct, under clause 30, that a disqualification order is to cease to have effect. Under the new clause, a ``relevant person''—defined in subsection (5) of the new clause as the Secretary of State, a police superintendent or a local authority director of social services—could subsequently apply to the tribunal for a reinstatement of the disqualification order. The basis for that, which is set out in subsection (3), would be that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Tribunal is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances, that it is likely that the individual may—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
not will, but may—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>commit a further offence against a child.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is possible that the police, directors of social services or the Secretary of State—from information supplied to him or her—could become aware of a person who still posed a risk, even after a disqualification order from an earlier ruling of the tribunal had ceased to have effect. In such circumstances, this reserve power would ensure that the disqualification order could be brought back into effect. We think that the public would consider that to be useful to protect children, if a person's circumstances had changed after a disqualification order had ceased to have effect.
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee at length on this matter. I have made the point. We would be surprised if the Government did not feel that, even if they cannot accept the new clause today, something along these lines could be useful, but we wait with interest to hear what the Minister says about it. We hope that he will be prepared to say, as he has already done on a number of issues, that he will consider the matter again with officials, talk to those whom the Government consult and perhaps return to it in another place or on Report.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 30 provides for the application to a tribunal for a review of a disqualification. The tribunal established under the Protection of Children Act 1999 to deal with appeals will also be the tribunal to which an offender will be able to apply for a review of his disqualification. The right of review, especially where the disqualification is otherwise permanent, is an important element in maintaining justice and fairness for all, while putting the protection of children at the heart of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 30 provides for an application to the tribunal by an individual for a review of his disqualification. The conditions of the application are set out in more detail in clause 31. Clause 30 deals with applications from a court-imposed disqualification to the tribunal only. However, individuals should also be able to apply to the tribunal against bans imposed by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Secretary of State for Health. That is provided by amendments to the relevant legislation, which are set out in paragraphs 44 and 45 of schedule 6. Therefore, there is a cross-over between schedule 6 and the clause.
<P>
How does the provision tie in with the overall scheme and what would the impact be of the new clause? Although undoubtedly well intentioned, the new clause could have the reverse effect from that intended and weaken the scheme. The Government are committed to ensuring that those who should be disqualified remain disqualified if any risk to children remains. Therefore, an applicant must overcome a considerable hurdle before the disqualification is removed. My fear is that if tribunals are aware that it is always open to them subsequently, at the behest of a director of social services, a superintendent or even a Secretary of State, to reimpose a disqualification, they might be more willing to lift it in the first place. We do not expect tribunals to lift the disqualification unless they are positively satisfied that there is no risk to children and that it is desirable that the disqualification be lifted.
<P>
Therefore, the process is heavily weighted so that the ban can be lifted only if the person disqualified can positively satisfy the tribunal that he is no longer a risk to children. It is a strong test and, in our view, a substantial safeguard. We would be unwilling to allow anything to interfere with the effectiveness of the scheme as a whole.
<P>
The new clause properly sets a high criterion for the reimposition of the ban, because of the impact of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights. However, again in a perverse way, it could limit the powers that are available to protect children, because it undermines the statutory route, which does not have such a high test as the new clause would impose. If someone from whom a disqualification order has been lifted gives further cause for concern, there are three possible avenues for meeting that concern. If the person is working with children in areas covered by a ban imposed by the Department for Education and Employment or the Department of Health, the ban could be reimposed in the same manner as before, if the person's conduct was sufficiently serious to merit dismissal or removal from work with children. In the case of a sex offender who falls back into former ways, a sex offender order, which could include a ban on work with children, could be applied for. In the case of a violent offender, the precursor activity might itself be criminal; alternatively, an antisocial behaviour order might be sought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am listening carefully to the Minister. I understand his point, and it is helpful, in the context of the ruling in Pepper v Hart, to have an explanation. However, should not the phrase ``beyond reasonable doubt'' be added to subsection (3) after the word ``satisfied'', in order to make clear the seriousness of the provisions in the clause? That would certainly do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is considerable legal debate about the meaning of ``satisfied'' and how it might be tested. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on that matter. I do not want to usurp the role of the parliamentary draftsmen by responding on the hoof.
<P>
We believe that the new clause, although well intentioned, would have the reverse effect to that which is intended. The avenues that are already available, which I have just outlined, are sufficient to satisfy the need for the scheme to remove the risk to children, so far as is possible. Setting in statute the high criterion envisaged in the new clause could, in fact, make protection more difficult.
<P>
 Therefore, although I understand the hon. Gentleman's motives for moving the new clause—and I will write to him on the point that he raised—I am unable to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the way that he has approached the matter, and I look forward to his letter.
<P>
We want to make it clear that, in moving the new clause, we have no intention of weakening the existing provisions. We do not agree that the new clause would do so, although I understand his point that, if there were a way of reimposing a ban, the tribunal might think that it could lift a ban more easily. Making the test ``satisfied beyond reasonable doubt'', as I suggested, would make it clear that the tribunal has to reach the criminal standard of proof, rather than the civil standard. The Minister rightly said that there is much debate about the exact legal connotations of the word ``satisfied''. I am sure that the Minister will accept that there is a danger that the current wording of the clause will lead a tribunal to conclude that the meaning of ``satisfied'' is as for the civil standard; that is, on a balance of probabilities. That is another way to approach the matter and make clause 30 stronger. The Minister has kindly said that he would be prepared to consider that further, and that he will also consider what we have suggested. If there is a way of using something along the lines of our new clause, without running any danger of weakening the provisions of the current clause, I hope that the Government will propose it.
<P>
Clearly, there will be an on-going debate about the issue—the Minister said that he would be considering the matter—and it would be helpful if it were discussed again in another place and/or on Report. At this stage, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The question before the Committee is that clause 30 stand part of the Bill. The new clause, as such, has not been moved. If the hon. Gentleman wished to move it, he would have to do so formally, at the appropriate point in our debate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 15, line 12, leave out `he is released' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the sentence passed on him expires'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This small amendment is significant because sometimes people are released early. On Second Reading we discussed the way in which home detention curfews operate—our view is that they do so in a way that is contrary to the Government's original suggestions. However, that is a debate for another day—I shall not take up the Committee's time by repeating the arguments.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister recognises the significance of making the clause's operation dependent on the expiry of the whole sentence rather than on the date on which the person is released. That would be a helpful change. We hope that the Minister will understand that we are putting the amendment forward seriously. I have sought not to score any partisan political points and I hope therefore that the Minister will say, as he helpfully did earlier this morning, that he is prepared to think about the matter again. The public may feel that there would be a greater degree of protection if this relatively modest but nevertheless important change were to be introduced. If the Government cannot accept it today, perhaps they will table an amendment at a later stage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> We are all concerned to ensure that individuals subject to a disqualification order under this part of the Bill are not able to escape easily the terms of the order; that is a given on which we are all of one mind. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not believe that the Bill as currently drafted will make it at all easy for an individual to escape the effect of the ban before it is right and appropriate—it ever is—for it to be lifted.
<P>
In this clause, the date we are talking about is the point at which an individual can approach the tribunal. It provides an opportunity only for those who are genuinely rehabilitated to approach the tribunal if they wish to have the disqualification order lifted. It is only after that first hurdle has been passed that the individual can ask for the disqualification order to be removed.
<P>
The first issue for the tribunal is whether the offender should be given leave to apply; that is far from automatic. I am happy to make it clear that the offender must first demonstrate that his circumstances have changed sufficiently since the order was made for leave to apply to be granted. An example might be where an offender has successfully reared children of his own in the intervening period. Having obtained leave to apply the individual must then prove that he is now actually suitable to work with children by having demonstrated that during his period at liberty in the community. It would not be acceptable for someone to leave prison at the completion of a period in custody—as opposed to the end of the sentence, as the amendment states—and immediately apply to have the ban lifted. Such a person would be unlikely to get past the first hurdle. Even if that were to be achieved, I hope that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that they would not have been able to demonstrate that they were of such trustworthiness as to meet the criteria of the test that I have outlined.
<P>
The issue is not whether an individual has ceased to pose a danger to children, but whether he or she is positively suitable to work with them. Unless that rigorous criterion is satisfied, there is no question of the ban being lifted. The critical issue is the period after release from custody. In order to consider whether this leave should be granted in any demonstration of suitability, the tribunal must consider the individual's record in the community.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many sex offenders turn out to be exemplary prisoners, but once they leave prison they revert to their old ways. They can be extremely guileful and cunning in their method of operation, and that is part of their danger. Tribunals will need to be aware of that, and will need to consider the period during which an individual was not in custody before applying either of the tests. Their record in the community must count. We are concerned first and foremost with the protection of children. The disqualification is not intended primarily to punish an individual but to protect children. For that reason, there will be no requirement to tie the date on which an offender is first able to approach the tribunal to the date on which the sentence expires. That is a matter of punishment. We are concerned with protection above all else.
<P>
We need to be able to judge an individual during the period that they spend in the community, in order to ensure that the protection of children is the paramount consideration in the mind of the tribunal. The relevant period will begin on the date on which the individual is first released into the community. To discount the years after an offender is released simply because the sentence still stands would not add to the protection of children and is, at first sight, unnecessarily onerous. The offender might have returned to prison during the period, perhaps even before the initial sentence had expired, for a different or a similar offence.
<P>
However, that would not undermine the process, because such an offender would be even more unlikely to be granted leave for a review. Indeed, it is almost inconceivable that such leave would be granted in those circumstances. That is why we have adopted a two-key approach. One must obtain leave, and one must satisfy the onerous test that I have outlined. I hope that that will put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. I understand where he is coming from, but I do not think that the amendment would add anything to the rigour either of the disqualification order or of the review process. We must ensure that the protection of children is seen as the main objective in this exercise. I do not believe that the Bill will make it easy for those seeking to have their disqualification lifted to have their case listed for consideration by a tribunal on leave. On the contrary, the test for leave is itself a demanding one.
<P>
I hope that when the hon. Member for Surrey Heath considers the test that needs to be satisfied after leave has been granted, and the proposed two-key approach, he will agree that the amendment is not necessary. However, the debate that it has initiated has given us the opportunity to make it clear to those who take note of these proceedings—as the tribunals will have to when considering how they should exercise their powers—that Parliament did not intend the test to be passed without the most rigorous care and consideration being given by the tribunal to matters that they are required in statute to address, and without the protection of children being at the forefront of their minds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I hope that the Minister is right that all tribunals will look at his remarks on the amendment and in the stand part debate on clause 30, which should be incorporated in future guidance to them. However, this matter may need to be considered further.
<P>
The Minister was kind enough to say that he knows where the Opposition are coming from. He is right that a rigorous test is involved, and I understand what he is saying about the two stages or two keys. Somebody looking at the clause will believe that, if a person is released early, the clock then starts running for five or 10 years, but if the clock did not start running until the sentence had expired, that would introduce an extra element of rigour. I accept that the provision is already rigorous, which is a good thing—on that there is common ground across the Committee—but it is a matter to which we will have to return. I envisage that it might arouse further discussion in another place and on Report.
<P>
Because of the usefulness of the debate and the helpful way in which the Minister has responded, I shall not press the amendment to a Division. Although I do not accept all his arguments, and believe that our amendment would add something further that the public and those involved professionally might find helpful, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 31 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Persons disqualified from working</center></H4>
with children: offences

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 15, line 40 after `position', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or performs on a casual basis (whether for financial reward or not) any functions which would constitute work in a regulated position.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would insert at the end of subsection (1) words relating to those who perform work of this kind on a casual basis. Again, we seek to toughen up the provision. At our previous sitting we discussed the Minister's and my involvement in the past on a voluntary basis with church youth clubs and that kind of thing. There are a number of casual positions that people can take up when working with children. As the hon. Members for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) and for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), who, sadly, cannot be with us this morning, no doubt for understandable reasons, stressed at our last sitting and as the Minister said this morning, child sex offenders are often devious people. They set out to look as if they are helpful to children, they purport to be solid, upstanding and respectable members of the community and they actively seek out such positions. The Minister and other members of the Committee will recognise that the danger is that people may not take paid employment ``in a regulated position'', to use the words in the Bill, but may seek out casual positions.
<P>
We, therefore, hope that the Minister will treat the amendment as a serious and useful addition to the clause. Even if he cannot accept it today, I hope that, as on previous occasions, he will say that he will consider our suggestion seriously with officials and with those whom the Government consult and perhaps table a Government amendment at a later stage. We believe that it would be sensible to extend the wording of the Bill to cover the kind of risk to which I referred, in the light of what the Minister said about the guileful way in which child sex offenders often behave. However we choose to describe that behaviour, we know that such people are deliberately devious and actively seek to work with children in any way possible. I hope that the Minister's response to this amendment will be as constructive as his response to some others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Clause 32 will establish new criminal offences that will bite on individuals who seek to work with children while disqualified. This legislation is a major strand in the provision of an integrated umbrella of child protection measures. All individuals who are banned from working with children—whether through this legislation, or by virtue of being included in lists maintained by the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Employment or the National Assembly for Wales—but who seek to do so while disqualified will be guilty of an offence.
<P>
The first offence will be to seek, offer, accept or continue to work with children while under a disqualification order. That offence simply provides for the punishment of a banned individual who tries to ignore the terms of the ban. However, the clause also provides that an individual may offer a defence by proving
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that he did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to know,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that he was disqualified from such work. The phrase ``reasonably be expected to know'' is intended to ensure that an individual cannot escape liability by, for example, moving house to avoid having a notification of disqualification served on him by the Secretary of State.
<P>
The second offence will be knowingly to offer work in a regulated position to a disqualified person. That is intended to cover those who know that the persons concerned are disqualified, but nevertheless offer them work in a regulated position. It will catch the predator—the person who deliberately and wilfully employs a disqualified person—but will not bite on the merely inefficient or foolish. The inclusion of the second offence is necessary in the light of the guile, to which I have referred, of people who doubtless operate in rings. If one such person is put in a position of authority, he may employ another, and in doing so groom, use and abuse children.
<P>
I should stress that the creation of this offence is not a back-door way of ensuring that people are compelled to carry out checks. In some circumstances, checks are compelled under other legislation. For example, a requirement to check Department of Health lists is imposed on child care organisations under the Protection of Children Act 1999. Outside those areas, the decision whether to carry out checks must be regarded as part of an organisation's overall child protection arrangements.
<P>
I should stress that all organisations that look after children should cultivate a culture of vigilance. Our debates, and the Act that one hopes will emerge from this process, are vital to the creation of the correct context, but there is no substitute for an employment and management culture that is itself the depositary of vigilance. Experience shows that, without such a culture, children are at risk. There needs to be a process of interviewing, taking up references and continuous monitoring.
<P>
The committing of either offence will incur an appropriately stiff penalty. The ban will act as a barrier to unsuitable people's access to children, and we believe that the offences will prove a meaningful deterrent. It will be evident to those who are disqualified that the law will not allow them to find positions in which they can threaten or harm children.
<P>
I understand the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but I hope that I can reassure him that it is not necessary to achieving his objectives. We want to ensure that those who pose a risk are prevented from acquiring a position from which they can prey upon children. We have introduced these measures to ensure that, when such people are disqualified, they are banned from a comprehensive range of work in ``regulated positions''. The new offence should be a powerful disincentive to breaching that disqualification order. The definition specifically covers, by virtue of the definitions in clause 35, work of any kind, whether paid or unpaid. That covers casual work if it falls within the regulated positions in clause 33, so the bite of the provision will not be avoided by casualising labour in a ``regulated position''.

The reference to regular work is important. For example, a builder who normally works on various sites might happen on one occasion to work on the roof of a school. The provision has not been designed to catch such work and it is important that it is not caught because that would go beyond what is fair, acceptable or justified. We want a proportionate response and to protect children without creating a pariah group which cannot work at all and is driven to the margins of society where it would present an even greater risk than if society were able to have an impact.

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand entirely the Minister's point about proportionality and it was helpful of him to refer to the words in a later clause. However, will he consider with his officials whether a phrase such as ``on a casual basis'' in the later clause, if not the clause before us, would strengthen the description of what constitutes a regulated position? It would be helpful if he would be prepared to consider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am prepared to consider that, but I am doubtful about it because the clause has been subject to great and careful examination by the parliamentary draftsmen and those with policy responsibility in this area. We believe that ``work of any kind'' is clear, and covers work that is paid or unpaid, casual or not. ``Regular'' was chosen with the need to embrace and encompass proportionality, so I cannot accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that this part of the Bill has been drafted to achieve our objective of protecting children, which is the overriding need, but to do so in a way that is balanced and proportionate. I must oppose the amendment, but recognise the hon. Gentleman's good intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Once again, the Minister has been helpful. I am grateful for his response and that he will continue to think about the matter. We still believe that it would helpful to include a phrase such as ``on a casual basis'' because that would strengthen clause 35, if not clause 32. I am happy to allow that continuing discussion and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Mike Hall.]
