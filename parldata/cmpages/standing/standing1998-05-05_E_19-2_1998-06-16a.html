On resuming--
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Good evening, Mr. Gale. Before adjourning for dinner we were discussing amendments Nos. 274 and 280. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made two essential points--rebasing and election.
<P>
On rebasing, our intention in proposing changes to the taxation of offshore trusts was to ensure fairness. We believe that people with a close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom who have set up or benefited from an offshore trust should pay their fair share of tax. Our proposals close the gaps left by the previous Administration when they undertook their changes. It would be ironic, but not, I am sure, their intention, if the Opposition had tabled amendments that would allow other loopholes to emerge. That is precisely what the amendments would do. They would allow gains that have accrued within an offshore trust set up before 17 March 1998 but which have not yet been realised to fall out of the charge in our proposals. The amendments go further and would allow gains, which would otherwise be chargeable under existing rules, to escape tax altogether.
<P>
That may go beyond the intentions of the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds. I am not sure whether it was his intention, but that would be the effect of the amendments and I could not accept such a proposal. They would prevent an effective tax charge on those who set up or benefit from an offshore trust, and they would go further and open up new opportunities to escape a tax charge under provisions introduced by a Conservative Government.
<P>
<b>Mr. Ruffley:</b> How would the amendment make people exempt under the transitional provisions and make them liable for tax for which they would not have been liable under the old regime?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Amendment No. 274 would allow all the assets held by offshore trusts that are brought onshore before 5 April 2000 to be rebased on their open market values at 17 March 1998. That would cause further problems, as I explained. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that he does not accept my explanation. He knows that I have not been slow to rebut amendments that the Government simply cannot accept.
<P>
On election, the amendments would provide an election for the trustees or the beneficiaries of an offshore trust set up before 19 March 1991 that is not brought onshore before 5 April 2000 to be charged in respect of gains realised by the trust instead of the settlor. Clause 130 brings trusts set up before 19 March 1991 within the scope of an existing charge on settlors where they, their immediate family or companies that they control can benefit from the trust. You, Mrs. Dunwoody, implored the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds not to venture into that subject until we reached clause 130, and I shall not do so. The charge was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1991 but did not apply to existing trusts unless, in broad terms, the funds were added or the trusts had migrated. We did not think that those who set up trusts before 1991 should continue to be in an advantageous position and therefore proposed that they should be brought within the charge on the settlor.
<P>
For those reasons, we reject the amendment. I call on the Committee to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Financial Secretary has been fulsome in her explanations. Will she explain why, in 1991, the Government differentiated between pre-1991 and post-1991 trusts? As she knows, the decision related to stimulating and helping the venture capital industry in this country in the 1980s. What does she understand to be the rationale behind the 1991 legislation?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> What I do know is that there was great expectation that the 1991 legislation would go further than it did. For some reason, the Government at the time decided against such an approach. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could ask his right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor, who was Financial Secretary at the time, exactly what was in his mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I rise merely to ask the Financial Secretary my original question. What advice has she received from officials on why a clear distinction was made between post-1991 and pre-1991 trusts? Was not the intention to assist an entrepreneurial culture and venture capitalists in this country? Yes or no.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that the Government have encouraged entrepreneurial activity and venture capital through our amendments to the Finance Bill. If he seeks to suggest that we have not, he is wrong.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 122, line 7, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) In the case of a settlement to which subsection (4) above applies, if the Trustees so elect, in computing the gain or loss accruing on a disposal to which subsection (4) of section 87 of that Act applies it shall be assumed that an asset held by them on 16th March 1998 was at that date sold, and immediately reacquired by them, at its market value on that date.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (6) An election by trustees under subsection (5) above shall be irrevocable and shall be made by notice to an officer of the Board at any time before 6th April 2000 or at any time during the period beginning with the day on which the first relevant capital payment is made and ending:--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) with the first anniversary of the 31st January next following the year of assessment in which the capital payment is made; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) at such later time as the Board may allow;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and ``the first relevant capital payment'' means the first capital payment made after 16th March 1998 to a beneficiary who is domiciled and either resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we debated amendment No. 257 a number of questions were left unanswered. The debate on this amendment, which I hope will be short, will give the Financial Secretary an opportunity to answer my points.
<P>
The clause brings into tax UK beneficiaries of trusts based abroad that were set up by non-UK resident settlors. That is an acceptable intention, but it has already been established that the clause will also bring into the UK tax net a number of foreign trusts set up by people who never dreamt that the trusts would have a United Kingdom beneficiary. Those trusts have therefore not kept the necessary records from which to calculate capital gains tax. The clause is based on the assumption that the trustees of such overseas trusts will be able to provide information that they do not have. I gave the example of an American trust, which was set up many years ago without any tax avoidance motive and has acquired a UK beneficiary. That UK beneficiary will now become liable to capital gains tax on distributions paid to him or her. In order to compute the capital gain, that person will have to obtain from the trustees information stretching back to perhaps a century ago. It is not inconceivable that the trust will have shares in an unquoted company, the base cost of which may be lost in the mists of time. Therefore, it is simply unrealistic to expect that that information will be forthcoming. The trustees have had no previous connection with this country; they never dreamt that they would have to provide information to the United Kingdom Inland Revenue; they have paid tax in the United States for many years.
<P>
In practice, an almost endless conflict will arise between the United Kingdom beneficiary and the Inland Revenue. How, in those circumstances, is the matter to be resolved? Self-assessment will prove something of a joke. The person concerned will not have, and will not be able to acquire, the information requested by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
What is the estimated yield from the clause? Why are we pursuing those trusts? I presume that the hon. Lady thinks that the revenue will be significant; if so, on what basis? The clause will act as a deterrent to foreign trusts' acquiring or paying UK beneficiaries, because the trustees will not want to become involved in endless disputes about the base cost of historic assets. They would rather keep their trust offshore, payable to non-UK residents only. Such an outcome will conflict with the requirement that the Government should not seek to deter the payment of foreign capital or income to United Kingdom citizens, which I laid down at the beginning of this group of amendments. It would be daft for us to erect a barrier against foreign earnings.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Lady will answer those two questions on the workability of the clause and the revenue that it will generate. I hope that she will also explain why she cannot accept an amendment that seeks in part to obviate the clause's main difficulty by rebasing the assets at a recent date. That would build up certain problems for the future, but at least it would not require taxpayers and trustees to trawl back through past years--perhaps through a past century--in order to acquire information that they do not have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The clause deals specifically with beneficiaries of settlements that have non-resident settlors. The Paymaster General, who has just joined the Committee, is a beneficiary of a trust with a non-resident settler. Can you therefore rule on whether he is able to vote on any Division that may be called during the debate on this clause?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is up to hon. Members properly to make declarations of interest in the Register of Members' Interests. I have no information to suggest that that has not been done, and the matter is therefore not one for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to clarify one or two aspects of what is a widely drawn clause.
<P>
As I understand it, if a UK beneficiary receives money from a foreign trust, declarations as to whether a capital gain is involved will have to be made. What evidence will be required from the trustees of that foreign trust? The clause seems not to have been thoroughly thought through, given that a number of huge anomalies occur. Are the trustees of that foreign trust to be required to make capital gains computations on donations at nil value? One can think of large foreign trusts where a 99 year reversion was put in. At the time that it was put in, its value was small; today its value is huge. How will that value be computed?
<P>
Are we to ask the trustees to seek values of all the assets that were put into the trust and to make computations? Will those computations be from the 1982 values? What will happen regarding pooling arrangements and indexation? The Committee should know what evidence will be required on trustees. If they cannot produce that evidence, will the clause act as an accessions tax, and a simple tax of capital gain be made irrespective of whether there is a gain? Those questions are serious, and trustees of foreign trusts should know the answers, so that they know how to deal with the tax returns in question.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There is nothing new about offshore trusts having to provide information to UK beneficiaries. They do so under the provisions introduced by the Conservative party when in government in 1981. The points made by the hon. Member for Cotswold and by the right hon. Member for Wells are covered in that respect. The Opposition are clutching at straws in trying to say that the clause involves anything else.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells spoke about the obligations of trustees. I have already answered the point about trustees. They have been providing the information since 1981--not will, but have. There have been no problems in the supply of that information. That will be the case under the clause, and there is no reason why other difficulties should occur. The right hon. Gentleman has tried to leap back through the centuries. It cannot be necessary to go back a century, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested that we should, because the base cost for CGT purposes does not go back before 1982.
<P>
Finally, the right hon. Member for Wells gave the example of an American citizen. American rules are similar to UK rules with regard to the information in question. There is, therefore, no problem in the provision of the information. The amendment seeks to allow time apportionment of the gain accruing but unrealised by Budget day so that the proportion of the gain that accrued before 17 March 1998 will escape a charge under the clause.
<P>
It is ironic that, when the Government seek to remedy the defects that the Opposition left us in legislation for 16 years, Opposition Members table amendments that would potentially allow a larger portion of gains to drop out of the charge introduced by the clause. The Government have made clear from the outset that we will ensure fairness and equity in the tax system. Unlike Opposition Members, we believe that it is right and fair that people with a close and continuing connection with the UK should be subject to a tax charge on payments that they receive from offshore trusts. To ensure that that is the case, we have sought to extend the provision introduced by the party now in opposition.
<P>
We have been careful in our proposals to avoid any element of retrospection. The clause applies only to gains made on or after 17 March 1998. That is the normal way in which capital gains tax charge changes, whether relieving or charging, apply. Capital gains tax is an event-based tax. Neither a gain nor a loss can arise until an asset is disposed of. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Lady says that there is no problem. She clearly did not listen to my example, which concerned a trust that currently, as we sit here, has no connection with the United Kingdom. In future, however, through a transfer residency or a marriage, a UK beneficiary is acquired, perhaps one beneficiary out of several hundred. That person becomes liable for tax, which has to be computed on gains within the foreign trust. My point, which the hon. Lady is in no position to contradict because it is true, is that the records in that trust are not kept for the Inland Revenue's purposes--how could they be? They are based and settled in a foreign country.
<P>
Does the hon. Lady accept that several other countries have no capital gains tax system and that people do not have to keep historic acquisition costs for any purpose whatever? If they do keep records, they frequently do so on annual uprating basis of the share portfolio for assets that they have. The UK beneficiary in my example will not be able to acquire the necessary information from the trustees even if they want to co-operate with him.
<P>
The hon. Lady said that there has been no problem, but that is irrelevant or untrue. I wish that the Paymaster General would get to his feet and answer our questions about the clause. He knows a great deal about overseas trusts and should not be inhibited by the fact that he may be a beneficiary under the clause, because he could declare that interest. We would be interested in his opinion on whether the clause is workable in practice, whether it will be evaded or whether it will create endless and unnecessary disputes between United Kingdom taxpayers and the Revenue authorities. Unless the hon. Lady can clarify the measures, we will press the amendment to a Division.

<H4><center>[Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> It would be helpful to remind the Committee of what the clause will do. Gains in respect of offshore trusts with settlors domiciled in the UK, and thus UK residents for tax purposes, will be charged to tax, provided that the settlors have an interest in the trust. Such an interest is defined as an interest of the settlor, or of the family of the settlor, or of companies that the settlor controls--in other words, an interest is defined as when the settlor is a beneficiary under the trust.
<P>
That was not the case before 1991. Offshore trusts then enjoyed that tax advantage because the Conservative Government of the time decided--for policy reasons that the Financial Secretary was not prepared to discuss--that the hugely successful and important venture capital industry should, for technical reasons, be able to take advantage of existing offshore arrangements.
<P>
There were two reasons for that. First, professional trustees resident in this country would bring the trust onshore. That was perceived to be a deterrent to onshore trusts, so trusts went offshore. Secondly, the regime in operation before limited partnerships were introduced meant that there was more incentive to go offshore.
<P>
The net result was that the offshore regime was important for the venture capitalists who did so much to generate a truly entrepreneurial spirit in what many of us consider to be the high water mark of modern British politics. This country thrived: it was the sick man of Europe when the Conservative Government were first elected. We turned the country around, not least by means of our low-tax, entrepreneurial policies, which have given the Labour Government the golden economic legacy that they seem so determined to fritter away.
<P>
I notice a scowl on your face, Mrs. Dunwoody. I merely want to explain why pre-1991 trusts enjoyed that tax treatment. Clause 130 will charge capital gains tax against current offshore trusts with a settlor who has an interest in the trust. The charge will apply to all gains, not just those realised after Budget day, as the Financial Secretary seemed to imply. The charge will also hoover up any gains made before Budget day. Capital gains going back 10 years or more may have crystallised after that day, and that is why we consider the clause to be unjustifiably penal.
<P>
Amendment No. 275 refers to the transitional arrangements. The Government say that those arrangements will benefit trusts subject to the clause. One of the reasons that they adduce is that those who will be affected by clause 130 will be able to reorganise their affairs. One of the ways in which they can do that, we are told, is to wind up the trust. Alternatively, the beneficiaries can give up any interest that they have in the trust. That does not appear to be a particularly helpful advantage under the transitional arrangements.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments, in common with the related amendments that have been tabled on schedule 23, would extend the transitional period by one year from 6 April 1999 to 6 April 2000. That would be a modest improvement to a set of wholly unacceptable transitional arrangements. It is worth reminding the Committee about the practitioners--that is, the venture capitalists who have done so much to rejuvenate British industry. [Laughter.] Hon. Members may laugh, but I remind them of a seminar that was held at No. 11 Downing street in which the Paymaster General, whom I believe to have a genuinely entrepreneurial attitude towards such matters, talked to venture capitalists about vibrant entrepreneurialism. I understand that the clause and related clauses were raised by those venture capitalists. They will now be getting on into their 50s, having been younger men in the 1980s, and they are resentful of the fact that the clause is introducing a two-tier system. Younger entrepreneurs who are just setting out may, as a result of taper relief, achieve a charge to tax of 10 per cent. Older entrepreneurs face, under the provisions, a minimum of 40 per cent. CGT on gains that go back well before Budget day, as well as a potential surcharge, which the Conservative Government introduced, of up to 24 per cent. in addition to the extent that capital payments are made to beneficiaries. These matters cut across party lines. The palpable unfairness of discriminating against older venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is a question to which the Financial Secretary and the Paymaster General should turn their minds.
<P>
There is concern about the transitional arrangements to which the amendments refer. The reasons that has been given for the transitional arrangement is that beneficiaries may be able to divest themselves of their beneficial interest. A venture capitalist has written to me and, I understand, to Treasury Ministers. He commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I and my advisers can see no practical advantage in the transitional period where a settlor needs to retain an interest in the trust and I would be grateful if you would explain how the transitional arrangements offer advantage in this case.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The extension of the transitional period by one year would give some modicum of relief. We should like to know how the transitional arrangements can possibly assist the older entrepreneurs with pre-1991 trusts who are caught by the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> For clarification, are we debating the entire group of amendments?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are debating amendment Nos. 275, 276 to 279 and 281 to 312.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was seeking to clarify whether we were debating the entire group of amendments, or just the first line.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy, if it will be more convenient for the Committee, to take the next group of amendments, but I have just called the group that we are debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendments that have been tabled in my name are Nos. 259, 260, 261 and 262.
<P>
I am anxious about the retrospective nature of the clause, especially because it will impose a tax charge on settlors even though they may have no beneficial interest in the trust. When they set up the trust, they may have nominated their children or a wife from whom they may now be separated. The children may be grown up and leading separate lives. The settlor may not only receive no benefit, but suddenly be confronted with a tax charge.
<P>
It is objectionable on constitutional grounds for a taxpayer suddenly and unexpectedly to be liable to tax which he is in no position to avoid and, in some cases, to pay. That conflicts with a basic principle of British taxation. I should be interested to hear whether hon. Gentlemen know of any other tax statutes that impose a tax charge on our constituents in such circumstances.
<P>
Our amendment would remove trusts from the clause when the settlor and spouses are not beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries. That would leave in place the majority of the clause, while removing the objectionable features which I have already mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I take it that we are now debating the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. I am sorry if it is not clear; I called the first amendment in the group.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am replying to amendments Nos. 275 to 312 only in this debate. All the amendments extend by one year the transitional period before the charge on the settlor applies. That is all that they do.
<P>
We gave careful consideration to the transitional period; it was criticised because it was too long to allow settlors to reorganise their affairs, and because it was too short. On balance, our judgment is that the period to 6 April 1999 is appropriate. I am not persuaded that a longer period would be justified and hon. Gentlemen did not put the case for the extension. There is no justification for it and I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am sorry if I have added to the confusion; I spoke to the second group of amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the sake of clarity, as I called the first set of the amendments we should get them out of the way first and then proceed in a coherent way which, although astonishing, is supposed to be parliamentary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I wish to press the amendment to a vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This sub-paragraph to paragraph 9 of schedule 5 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 would take out of the provisions circumstances where the only members of the settlor's family who can benefit from a trust are children--that is, anybody under 18--unborn children or future spouses of the settlor or the settlor's children.
<P>
A divorced spouse could be a co-settlor. Without the amendments, the trust fund would be brought within the 1991 code and the gains assessed on the settlor if the only minor was the child of a later marrige of the ex-spouse. We would not want that to happen, would we?
<P>
The amendments are important. They are technical, but they are also consistent with paragraphs 2(8)(c)(ii) and 3(9)(b) of schedule 23. I look forward to hearing the Financial Secretary`s response.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I hope that the Committee will bear with me, because it is important that I put on the record the Government's position on each amendment in this large group.
<P>
Clause 130 brings trusts that were set up before 19 March 1991 within the scope of the charge on the settlor in respect of gains realised by the trustees. The charge applies only where the settlor, the settlor's spouse, their children, their children's spouses and companies that they control can benefit from the trust. Generally, the clause will apply only to gains realised by the trustees on or after 6 April 1999, which gives a transitional period for those affected to re-organise their affairs if they so wish by, for example, winding up the trust, bringing it onshore or removing themselves and their family from benefit.
<P>
However, we recognise that some beneficiaries will not have the legal capacity to remove themselves from benefit--children under the age of 18, for example. For that reason, we have been careful to exclude from this charge trusts where the only members of the settlor's family who can benefit from the trust are people who cannot remove themselves from benefit. Clause 130 creates a class of protected settlements and prevents the charge from applying to such settlements. However, protected settlements are not limited to cases in which the immediate members of the settlor's family cannot remove themselves from benefit. It also includes trusts whose beneficiaries do not include members of the settlor's immediate family--the settlor, the settlor's spouse, children or spouses of children.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to extend the categories of persons who are within the definition of a protected settlement. Some of the amendments are unnecessary because they cover categories of persons who are not immediate members of the settlor's family and so already fall within the definition of a protected settlement. The others are inappropriate as they cover categories of persons who have the capacity to remove themselves from benefit, and I can see no reason for including them in the protected category. Perhaps it will assist the Committee if I refer to each amendment and state into which category the class of beneficiaries falls.
<P>
Amendment No. 97 covers children of a former spouse of a settlor. The amendment is unnecessary because such people already fall within the definition of a protected settlement. Amendment No. 98 covers unborn children of a former spouse of a settlor. The amendment is unnecessary because such people already fall within the definition of a protected settlement.
<P>
Amendment No. 99 covers future spouses of a child of a former spouse of a settlor. The amendment is unnecessary because such people fall within the definition of a protected settlement. Amendment No. 100 covers current spouses of a child of a settlor. The amendment is inappropriate. Such persons have the capacity to remove themselves from benefit and should not fall within the definition of a protected settlement.
<P>
Amendment No. 229 covers children of a settlor over the age of 18. The amendment is inappropriate. Such persons will have the capacity to remove themselves from benefit, and so do not fall within the definition of a protected settlement. Amendment No. 230 covers former spouses of a settlor. The amendment is unnecessary because such people fall within the definition of a protected settlement.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 259 and 260 cover children of a settlor over the age of 18. The amendments are inappropriate. Such persons will have the capacity to remove themselves from benefit, so should not fall within the definition of a protected settlement. Such people are also covered by amendment No. 229. Amendment No. 261 covers current spouses of a child of a settlor. The amendment is inappropriate. Such persons will have the capacity to remove themselves from benefit and should not fall within the definition.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 262 covers separated spouses of the settlor. The amendment is unnecessary. Such people already fall within the definition of a protected settlement.
<P>
I sincerely hope that that helps the Committee with this very long list of amendments, and that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Not for the first time, the Financial Secretary has completely missed the point that we were making. This is becoming somewhat repetitive, which I regret. It would shorten our proceedings considerably if, instead of reading her brief--which she does beautifully--the Financial Secretary could answer our specific objections.
<P>
She said more than once that the beneficiaries should simply waive their entitlement, and that would be the end of the matter. However, we alluded to examples in which the beneficiaries have fallen out with, or are estranged from, the settlor. As the result of a divorce or separation, the beneficiaries are disconnected from the settlor, who, nevertheless, will be made liable for this new tax burden. There is nothing the settlor can do about it and, in some cases, the settlor may be quite unable to meet the tax burden. Is that equitable or just?
<P>
My other point is that trustees do not simply do what the settlor tells them to do. The trustees have a duty to conduct themselves and to make distributions to the benefit of the beneficiaries. It is not open to the settlor to tell the trustees to stop payments to a particular category of beneficiary or individual beneficiary. The Financial Secretary's comments do not address our point. There will be examples of where settlors, quite unable to avoid the charge, will be made liable to it. They cannot instruct the trustees or the beneficiaries, and that is entirely unjust.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): In addition to the settlor having no influence over the trustees, is it not also the case that the trustees are under no obligation to tell the settlor what gains have been raised by the trust, let alone what distributions they may be making? Those can be done behind the settlor's back and yet he or she has to foot the bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend elaborates helpfully. We have shown beyond doubt that the Financial Secretary's brief did not anticipate our objections or deal with them. I invite her to respond, as a matter of courtesy, to the points we raised instead of to those that she wanted us to raise. In the absence of a proper response, we are alarmed at the Treasury's lack of grasp of an important measure which will unjustly affect many people.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman waffles. The Opposition have tabled amendments and I have responded to every point that they made. The fact is that they do not like being caught out because they have not read the legislation properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We know that we have won the argument when the Financial Secretary becomes petulant. We will divide the Committee on this, although we know that we have won a moral victory. The serious point is that the victims of the Teasury's lack of grasp of the measure's importance are not in the Committee. Those people rely on this House and the Committee to defend their interests. We know that we have met that duty and that the Government have failed.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule as amended, be the Twenty-third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I wonder whether we can pause for a moment in our headlong rush to clause 131. Are the schedule's provisions that appertain to the age of majority of the child of the settlor right? It appears from the schedule's drafting--[
Interruption.] I am clearly making such a powerful point that three Treasury Ministers are needed to deal with it. My commiserations to the Chief Secretary on the draw that his team suffered tonight--although I think that it means that the Scottish team will not be home before the postcards.
<P>
Will the protected settlement provisions, which apply towards the end of the year in which a child of a settlor attains majority, apply to the transitional year 1998-99? Paragraph (1)(c) appears to tax such gains to the settlor on 6 April 1999, when the beneficiary attains majority in that year. Will the Financial Secretary clarify the situation?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I hope that I understand the hon. Gentleman's question correctly. A trust may realise gains during the transitional period but if, by 6 April 1999, children have reached the age of 18 and are no longer beneficiaries of the trust, the settlor charge will not apply. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question, but if it does not, he should write to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Financial Secretary answer a technical point that arises from the schedule? We have already heard that a settlor will be brought in to be charged tax, but that settlor may not have a beneficial interest in the offshore trust in question. In such circumstances, the settlor may not have funds available to pay the capital gains tax levied on him or her. If a trustee wants to put the impecunious settlor in funds, a legal question arises whether the act of the trustee in paying that money to a settlor is a breach of fiduciary duty by the trustees of the beneficiary. Will the Financial Secretary explain that current legal issue, on which, I am told, she has already received representations?
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, it is an extremely technical point. He will forgive me if I say that I shall examine it closely and write to each member of the Committee.

<P>
No. 19, in schedule 25, page 370, line 16, leave out paragraph 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Anxiety has been expressed that the provisions in clause 140 and schedule 25 have a huge element of retrospection to them. The group of amendments is designed to mitigate or remove some of the retrospective elements. In particular, the amendments relate to paragraph 8 of schedule 25 and change the wording of clause 140.
<P>
My hon. Friends will expand further on the matter, but one of the most reprehensible aspects of a tax measure is the introduction of retrospective measures that affect property rights and agreements entered into in good faith many years ago, which are retrospectively changed by subsequent legislation. This Parliament has avoided that, and must avoid it when legislating. It has contravened that rule with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The amendments are in many ways connected with the next group of amendments. We must recognise that the outside world is beginning to see how the Government, through the Treasury, are proceeding against the national heritage. I use those words advisedly, and not by chance, because a leader in this week's edition of the magazine Country Life states that a disaster for heritage is hidden in the Finance Bill. The article refers to the Committee's debates on clause 39.
<P>
Clause 140, schedule 25 and the amendments thereto are interrelated, because they all touch on how much we value our national heritage and whether we believe that public access is paramount. Just as with clause 39, the heart of the amendments is a straightforward choice. On the one hand is the choice exercised by the Treasury, as it sets about grabbing every penny that it can; on the other hand is the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, formerly the Department of National Heritage, which is concerned principally with safeguarding and promoting our heritage.
<P>
I am sure that many hon. Members will have noted that the Evening Standard today predicts that, in the Chancellor's forthcoming review of expenditure, we shall see the budget of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport slashed, with the sad prospect of losing the body that organises tourism in England and Wales. Again, the importance of tourism to our economy, especially the rural economy, is relevant.
<P>
We must remember that changes that affect our national heritage will also have a dramatic impact upon our tourist industry and on the livelihood of rural economies throughout the country. Although Country Life referred to the Bill being a disaster for heritage, many places will see it is a disaster for tourism.
<P>
Conditional exemption has been around for 102 years, since 1896. The idea was to allow families and individuals who were prepared to do so to open up their houses or the objects contained within them to public access; in return, the owners made a contract with the Inland Revenue under which they would be exempted from inheritance tax. It was possible for the heirs of the owners of those objects to apply to pay no duty or tax on the death of the owner, but to pay tax only if the objects were sold.
<P>
In 1930, that arrangement was revised so that tax was charged on the value of the objects when sold rather than their value at the date of death. Since 1949, it has been essential for owners who have been given that conditional exemption to promise that they would offer safekeeping for those objects; and from 1975, they had to guarantee that there would be some public access.
<P>
The amendments to clause 140 go to the heart of the matter. We are not talking about objects that are not accessible to the public. The objects are already available for public inspection. They are not hidden away; any member of the Committee, any Member of the House of Commons and any member of the British public can find out about and see those objects. The principle of access is already firmly established. The objects are now accessible to the general public.
<P>
The amendments tackle the problem predicted by many organisations, including the National Trust and the major art houses, which all stand to benefit. If Sotheby's and Christie's handle the sale of such objects, they will make large commissions. They are warning us of the dangers, but they have an interest; they are absolutely confident that those items will come onto the market.
<P>
We are talking about 20,000 items which are regarded as being of such historical, national or scientific interest that they have been placed on the register of conditionally exempt objects--otherwise known as the V and A list. Anyone can consult that list at the V and A, and it is available on the internet. Some members of the Committee might have taken advantage of that information, others might have an object on the list.
<P>
All owners of such objects must show them on demand to the public. Under the exemption, the public have a right to see those objects. If one believes in the importance of our national heritage, it is crucial to ensure that the public can see them.
<P>
The Bill refers to objects of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest. Until now, the capital taxes office has interpreted that to mean objects of sufficiently high quality to be displayed in public collections--whether national, local authority or university. Undoubtedly, some secondary objects have gone onto the list--by which I mean that not everything on the V and A list ought to be there, as everyone who works in the field acknowledges.
<P>
No one is saying that there should not be a major revision of the V and A list. No one is saying that we should not reconsider the criteria by which objects go on to the list or are made accessible to the public. However, the clause and the Government's failure properly to consult on it represent a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. As a matter of principle, all the major art bodies throughout the country are saying that the Government have got it wrong and that they need to reconsider the clause.
<P>
The retrospective nature of the clause is worrying. In effect, taxpayers now have a contract between themselves and the Inland Revenue. In return for meeting that contract, they receive an exemption for a set of undertakings. I have referred to those undertakings, which are principally based on the idea that the objects must be publicly accessible, having been accepted as of eminent quality. So long as the taxpayer retains the property and keeps it in good condition, the tax is payable only on a breach of those undertakings.
<P>
The rules of those undertakings will be changed under the clause. We may consider those undertakings in a later debate. Many people have spoken to me about the impossibility of getting good information from the Inland Revenue, for reasons that I shall outline when we debate the next group of amendments. The impossibility of getting good guidelines from the Inland Revenue is such that nobody knows whether the tax will be fully retrospective. Organisations such as the Museums and Galleries Commission and the Historic Houses Association believe that if a taxpayer cannot comply with the new conditions of access--not those agreed between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue at the time of exemption, but the new ones being imposed under the Bill--a tax charge will become payable by reference to the original chargeable event--or death, in other words. That is wrong in principle. The rules are being changed and people will have to pay the bill because the onus will be put on them suddenly to comply.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many people will be forced to sell assets and the art market will be flooded with extremely important objects. Almost certainly those objects, which are now accessible to the public, will go out of circulation and probably out of the United Kingdom.
<P>
The Government's proposal is a clear breach of the contract made at the time of the undertaking. The Minister has made much of the importance of the principle of fairness, but how fair is it for the Government to change the contract terms, while not allowing those involved the chance to come back? There is no recourse to an ombudsman to apply for a variance, other than the provisions that will be statutorily laid down.
<P>
I am conscious that many areas need to be explored further, but they relate to schedule 25--amendment No. 19 relates to the schedule rather than the clause. There are crucial questions about the retrospective nature of the measure, how it will operate and its the consequences for our national heritage. Given the principles of fairness to which the Financial Secretary referred, I wonder whether she believes that it is fair to change the terms of the contract.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I think that he is exaggerating the likely impact of the changes. I shall return to the question of fairness, since he dwelt on it so much. The Government are firmly committed to ensuring that owners who take, or have taken, valuable tax exemptions for their assets, which are conditional on allowing public access to those assets, deliver that access. That is what the clause will achieve. It is a balance between the rights of owners, the rights of taxpayers and the rights of access to assets and the enjoyment of heritage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) said that we were tearing up existing contracts with owners. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that it is an essential condition of the exemption--the so-called contract--that there will be ongoing reasonable public access to assets that are exempt. If the agreed method of delivering access to public assets does not work effectively because it is abused or honoured in the letter only, surely it is right--and fair--to revise the system by mutual agreement, which the clauses will do, or with the consent of the special commissioner.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Witney does not believe that the current system is working properly and does not provide the access for members of the public to assets that are tax exempt, I suggest that he look at the substantial criticism of the scheme. Existing undertakings can be varied only if they already contain a commitment to provide reasonable public access. For the life of me, I cannot see how the hon. Gentleman could argue against reasonable public access to assets for which taxpayers' money has been paid.
<P>
We are not asking owners to provide access where none has to be provided at present, but in partnership with owners we are taking steps to ensure that the benefits of such assets are available to members of the public. When we discuss other amendments, we will consider the questions of access and of pre-eminent and eminent assets, on which the hon. Gentleman touched; I will not do so now.
<P>
Let me remind the hon. Member for Witney of our primary objectives. We want to reform the exemption scheme, so that the public get proper access to the heritage assets that they as taxpayers help to preserve. I should have thought that that would help tourism, because it will ensure access to everything that is provided for as part of our heritage. Let us not overstate the case; we are talking about a narrow range of objects.
<P>
We also want to ensure that the changes are as fair all round as we can make them. Letting existing undertakings run their course might be considered fair to owners of assets that have been exempt, but that is not the only side of the equation. Leaving existing undertakings in place would not be fair to the public or to taxpayers at large, who keep paying for the preservation of assets without necessarily gaining proper access to them. That is what the clause is intended to achieve.
<P>
The clause is not retrospective; it will operate by agreement where reasonable public access has already been agreed. It will ensure that public access works; at present, it does not. That is what we want to achieve. The clause is fair to owners, fair to the taxpayer and fair to members of the public. Even the hon. Member for Witney should recognise that it is fair, and he should vote for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): My hon. Friend the Member for Witney made his case on the basis of the morality of breaking a commitment--a contract--that has been made with the taxpayer. I should like to ask the Financial Secretary a simple question. I understand the principle that she is expounding: that it would be preferable where possible to have more public access. Does she accept that in many cases there is a practical difficulty? If the practical alternative is to have no public access, because the asset will be disposed of--possibly abroad, or into a private collection to which the conditional exemption does not apply--does she consider that preferable to a continuation of the present, admittedly imperfect, arrangements for limited public access by appointment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I was extremely interested to hear the Financial Secretary talk about not arguing against reasonable access. No one in this Room wants to argue against reasonable access, but the idea could be extended to the hon. Lady's Department and her officials. When we discussed clause 39 we were given an undertaking by the Paymaster General that a meeting would take place with bodies concerned about the impact on the heritage of this country. During the past half hour I have spoken to members of the Historic Houses Association who want to see the Minister on this and related matters. They have had a number of telephone calls and exchanged a number of letters with the Treasury on the basis of the undertaking that was given in good faith by the Paymaster General--I am not questioning the faith of the Paymaster General--but they are not being given access to Ministers.
<P>
I am sure that this will appal you, Mrs. Dunwoody, but when the Historic Houses Association contacted the Minister on the subject of clause 39 and other matters, it was told by the Paymaster General's office that the matter should be dealt with on the telephone because the Minister was rather busy. That is a serious matter. The Financial Secretary told us this evening that she supported the principle of reasonable access, but that does not seem to extend to her Department. If there is to be proper consultation and, in the light of what we may go on to discuss this evening, if the hon. Lady and the Paymaster General believe it appropriate to revisit some of the questions, I hope that Treasury Ministers will instruct their officials not to tell bodies such as the Historic Houses Association and others that the matter can be dealt with on the telephone because the Minister is busy, but will have the courtesy to see them if a meeting is suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Two points need to be summarised before the Financial Secretary replies further. Before coming to the specific amendments on access, we are discussing the existing undertakings and the extent to which the arrangements should be retrospective. By the sleight of hand with which we are becoming familiar, the Financial Secretary suggested that the matter might proceed by agreement. I refer her to the notes on clause 140, which state in paragraph 25:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Owners will have six months from the Inland Revenue's initial proposal for change, to agree revisions to their undertakings. If no agreement can be reached and a Special Commissioner considers it just and reasonable to require the proposed change to be made, he or she may make a direction accordingly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not discussing something that will be reached by agreement. If there is no agreement on the undertakings that have been in existence now for more than 20 years, the special commissioner can make a direction. The Financial Secretary, presumably inadvertently, is misleading the commissioner if she is suggesting that such matters can be dealt with only by agreement. On the contrary, she is taking power under the Bill to enforce directions by the special commissioner if agreement cannot be reached.
<P>
It has been suggested that there is support in the arts world for the proposal. Again, let me remind the Financial Secretary and the Committee of the evidence that we have received from the Museums and Galleries Commission to convene a special meeting to consider this very provision and the existing undertakings that we are discussing in the amendment. That Meeting was attended by the Committee of Area Museum Councils, the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, the national heritage memorial fund, the Historic Houses Association and a range of other bodies. The Museums and Galleries Commission specifically urged the Government to retain by-appointment viewing in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has not made provision in the Bill, nor has she said in reply to the amendments and following the undertakings that were given before the new provisions were introduced, that there could now be exceptional cases.
