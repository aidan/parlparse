<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must tell the Committee that there is a small change to the selection list compared with the list made available yesterday. Following the correction of the text of amendment No. 161, I have decided to include it within the group headed by amendment No. 111.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Northern Ireland Policing Board</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [13 June], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): May I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins? It will be a fairly long and difficult task to make some sense out of a Bill which, as shown by the number of Government amendments already tabled, is full of flaws and in need of considerable emendation.
<P>
I do not want to repeat what I said on Tuesday. I am sure that the Minister would agree about that-it might be the only thing on which we agree today. The one thing that bears some emphasis is that the Bill should be about how Northern Ireland is policed and how society is protected from criminal and terrorist elements. It should not be about a political accommodation where those with the greatest muscle are pandered to over what happens to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That is where the emphasis appears to lie at present.
<P>
It is a source of considerable disquiet to many of us that the Bill appears to involve a competition between the Social Democratic and Labour party and Sinn Fein-IRA about who, to put it bluntly, can be the nastiest about policing in Northern Ireland over the past 30 difficult years. That will not lead us anywhere. I read with some alarm that the SDLP is embarking on a tour of Northern Ireland to whip up interest in the Bill. I wish that I could have an assurance that it will be about participation in the interests of all society and not, as I indicated earlier, to prove that that party is more macho than Sinn Fein-IRA.
<P>
Mistakes have been made in the past. The Good Friday or Belfast agreement, call it what one will, was about putting those mistakes right. I am sure that I would not be wrong to take some comfort from the words of the leader of the SDLP, who said in his Nobel peace prize acceptance speech that people should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>come together and jointly work together in shared endeavour for the good of all.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill will not be for the good of all. If the freedom of the police service in Northern Ireland is to be constrained by those who have criminal records-we shall come to that on schedule 1-it will be a sad day, not just for Northern Ireland but for the United Kingdom as a whole and for all the people in the island of Ireland. I noted well, as many others may have done, that when the Home Office looked at the Patten report it considered it a good report about something, but certainly not about policing. That is an opinion that I wholeheartedly share.
<P>
The leader of the SDLP went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All of us are asked to respect the views and rights of others as equal of our own, and together, to forge a covenant of shared ideals based on a commitment to the rights of all allied to a new generosity of purpose.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That cannot be achieved unless considerably more realism is applied to the Bill. It must be about law and order. It must not be seen as discriminating against my tradition or someone else's tradition. It must be seen as competent to protect both our traditions and to give us the confidence in each other's generosity or good will that we do not naturally have after 30 years of violence.
<P>
I hope that the opportunity that the debate on the clause has given us to express our views will encourage other members of the Committee, who may not be as well versed in the affairs of Northern Ireland as, for example, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and myself, to put aside any partisanship and look at the Bill in terms of how for the next two decades or longer, we can move forward with confidence in our police and in those who have responsibility for oversight of the police, including the body that will replace the Police Authority for Northern Ireland. Each of those elements must be confident that we are not an area of the United Kingdom that is cast aside to endure some peculiar type of law, but that we have the same rights as the people in the Irish Republic or in the rest of the United Kingdom. We want the same rights and the same expectations. We want the Bill to concentrate on delivering that necessary capability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit Oùpik </B>(Montgomeryshire): I want to make a general point about the clause to highlight the importance of us debating the nature of the board in some detail. I impress on Ministers the importance of being true to their words on Second Reading and listening carefully to the concerns that will be expressed in Committee.
<P>
We shall debate the details later, but I want to emphasise that many people on both sides of the Northern Ireland community are worried that the board may not have sufficient powers to carry out its duties and that the triumvirate relationship between the board, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State has been compromised, with the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State being primary.
<P>
I hope that we can have a proper debate about the board's rightful level of responsibilities. I attest that it should have more than is currently specified in the clause and associated schedule. A couple a weeks ago, I was not so worried, but on further investigation, I concluded that an increase in its powers would enhance the effectiveness of the board and of the police service as a whole-especially with respect to accountability and financial probity. As we move into the associated schedule, I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to our various proposals
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> I echo the welcome given to you, Mr. Malins, by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis). We have participated in Northern Ireland debates before and I know that you are familiar with the personalities and the arguments that will be rehearsed in Committee.
<P>
I take issue with two points raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone-not to extend the debate unnecessarily, but to correct a couple of his views about the Bill. First, he said that the high number of Government amendments shows that the Bill is flawed. As emerged in response to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Oùpik), the Government amendments reflect our listening approach. We said all along that we were prepared to consider reasoned arguments and to fine tune the Bill as it proceeds. The amendments before us today provide a good example.
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman claimed that the Home Office was critical of the Patten report, which it viewed as a distasteful document. The Government-and I include all Departments are firmly behind the Bill. Even the Scottish Parliament, which has a devolved responsibility for policing and criminal justice, may follow the Bill to study how best practice arises with a view to transferring it to their own jurisdiction. I simply do not accept what the hon. Gentleman said about the Home Office.
<P>
I acknowledge, but do not accept, the charge levelled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. Examination of the Bill will show that the Government's case is well founded. The criticisms made by the hon. Gentleman today will not pass muster. For example, at least five areas of responsibility are given to the new Policing Board, which do not apply to the Police Authority at present. The relationships making up the tripartite structure will be rearranged. The Bill is about transferring responsibility to the appropriate level to create accountability and respect within all parts of the tripartite structure.
<P>
Clause 1 is an enabling clause. The real heart of the debate will emerge from our examination of the amendments and of schedule 1. I invite the Committee to accept the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>THE NORTHERN IRELAND POLICING BOARD</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 36, line 25, after `of' insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`no fewer than 14 members and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 107, in page 36, line 25, leave out `not more than'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 133 
<P>
No. 108, in page 36, line 27, leave out sub-paragraph (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> Briefly to respond to the Minister, I was not criticising him. I regard criticism as an ugly word. Rather, I sought to provide some constructive input to the debate. That is the positive spirit in which we shall speak to most of our amendments. As he said, we will eventually reach the key debate over whether the triumvirate structure is properly balanced. We shall return to the issue then.
<P>
Amendment No. 126 would set a lower minimum number of board members, at 14. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides the background: that number appears there.
<P>
Under the Bill, there is no minimum number, so theoretically it could drop below 14, which could cause all sorts of problems, not least regarding the interrelations with quorums in other parts of the Bill. I assume that the drafting is an oversight, which the amendment would correct.
<P>
I am in good company because Government amendment No. 133 seems to be the Minister's attempt to achieve the same objective, so I am fairly optimistic-but not certain of success. The Government's intention seems to be to correct the same error that I spotted. English is my second language, so I may be more pedantic than others, but the statement should say ``fewer than 14'', not ``less than 14'', because ``less'' is inappropriate for specific and whole numbers. I humbly suggest that my amendment is better than the Government's.
<P>
Amendment No. 107 would set the number of board members at 19-a reasonable position, but mine is different, because allowing the board some flexibility between 14 and 19 members would be advantageous for administrative and practical reasons. Otherwise, technical problems might arise in the event of a resignation. I look forward to hearing what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone has to say about that and to further clarification from the Minister. I hope that there will be some gratitude to me, a foreigner, for my brief English lesson.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> It was almost inevitable that we would not move too far into schedule 1 before the sloppiness of the Bill was made manifest. That is clear in paragraphs 3(1) and (2). No one would disagree with the board comprising not more than 19 members. That seems to be an appropriate figure, but when one reads on and looks for a minimum number, it does not exist. No one thought about how ridiculous a one-member board would be. The reality is that that could arise. The Government have recognised the problem. Amendment No. 107 would have dealt with it by removing the words ``not more than'', so that schedule 1 read, ``The Board shall consist of 19 members.''
<P>
I shall not worry greatly about whether there is a range between the figures 14 and 19. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) is seeking to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman was not seeking to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I apologise, Mr. Malins. I heard those dulcet tones that I find so attractive. With amendment No. 108, we are calling into question sub-paragraph (2), because it gives the Secretary of State complete control over the size of the police board. At will, he can
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>amend the number for the time being.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why on earth is that proposed? One comes up with the inevitable answer that the board will have to be manipulated from time to time to ensure that a party-I shall not name it at the moment-that might not be fulfilling the requirements for membership can be catered for in the longer term.
<P>
Will the Minister reassure me that if any party excludes itself from membership of the board, the number of members on the board will not be reduced below the maximum of 19, so that when things change and that party and its associates have perhaps engaged in enough intimidation, they can retake their places on the board? Someone who feels that it is not important that he has infringed the constraints placed on members of the board could be brought back willy-nilly.
<P>
I do not oppose Government amendment No. 133. I take the point made by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire about its grammar, but I do not quarrel with the range of 14 to 19 as the size of the board. However, I ask the Minister to give a categorical assurance that that latitude for the board to vary between 14 and 19 members will not be used simply to accommodate the most recalcitrant elements in our society. If that assurance is given unequivocally, we can accept the Government amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): First, may I add my welcome to you, Mr. Malins? It is good to have you chairing our proceedings.
<P>
I will detain the Committee no more than a moment. Amendment No. 108 is the most significant amendment in the group. I share the sentiments about amendments Nos. 126 and 107 expressed by the hon. Member for Fermauragh and South Tyrone. We must specify a minimum, but it is relatively immaterial whether the level is 19, 14 or somewhere between. One could spend a long time unprofitably discussing the merits of having 15, 16, 17 or 18 members. A reasonably high number is essential to maintain the breadth of opinion and experience that one hopes that the board will contain. That could not be sustained if the number of members were allowed to drop.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 covers the essential point. It would be a mistake, and wholly undesirable, to allow the Secretary of State to have at his disposal the power to play around with the number on the board. The board should ideally be above politics. It should not be a pawn, so it is essential that the Bill clearly states the minimum and maximum number of board members.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I add my welcome to those that others have extended to you, Mr. Malins.
<P>
In my approach to the issue, I follow the spirit of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter). The Committee and not least the Minister are trying to get the position right in paragraph 3(1). I have no objection to a board of between 14 and 19 members. That sounds about right, but it is ironic that we try so hard in paragraph 3(1), yet casually give the Secretary of State the power to set the number at whatever he wants, elsewhere. Why should we endeavour with good intentions to fix the level between 14 and 19, if the Secretary of State has the power to make the number whatever he wants?
<P>
I will not delay the Committee over the matter, because much more important issues are to follow, but I have one question of which the Minister might wish to take note. I do not object if the answer is not to the front of his mind, because his officials can help him. I presume that the expression ``may by order amend'' is a term of art, and that the order would be perfected by affirmative or negative resolution. Of the two, I prefer affirmative resolution. Can the Minister assure me that the Secretary of State's power to make an order is susceptible to the usual parliamentary processes? If so, it seems most likely that either the affirmative or the negative procedure would be used, although there may be another procedure that does not immediately come to mind. However, I hope that we are not inventing a power that is extraneous to the parliamentary process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Amendments Nos. 107, 108, 126 and 133 lead us into the examination of a raft of amendments to schedule 1. As a result of that examination, the Government have reassessed their position on several issues. That goes back to a point that I made in an earlier debate about the need to listen to arguments, take the representations that have been made and, where necessary, fine-tune the Bill. Amendment No. 126 is a good example, and I shall come to that later.
<P>
Schedule 1 deals with the establishment of the board, as hon. Members have recognised. The board is central to Patten's proposals on accountability. In line with that, the Government's approach is to create a strong, independent and effective board to hold the Chief Constable to account-a board that meets Patten and is subject to appropriate safeguards. An examination of the report will show that Patten and his commissioners recognised that safeguards were required.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Part II of the schedule creates a board under direct rule, which was not envisaged by Patten. Part III creates a board under the devolved administration, with a majority democratically elected element representative of the main parties in Northern Ireland. Patten said that this was essential to achieve ``respect and credibility'' with real power and responsibility. Paragraph 6.11 of the Patten report sets out his reasoning.
<P>
A good number of the amendments that we shall deal with are about safeguards. They must be sensible safeguards. Looking at precedents elsewhere in England, Wales and, indeed, drawing lessons from Northern Ireland, we have to take what have proved to be good safeguards in the past and build on them, remembering all the time that the driving ethos and motive force is the establishment of the new beginning signalled in the Good Friday agreement. Even where we have made Government amendments in response to representations, the door is still open to reasoned arguments.
<P>
As I understand it, there is an acceptance in this group of amendments of what the Government are trying to do, so there is not much point in arguing against amendment No. 107. Against the background of concerns, not least from hon. Members, but also from the Police Authority, about the level of flexibility, there was a need to table amendment No. 133, which provides that the board shall consist of not less than 14 or more than 19 members appointed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
That is why I welcome amendment No. 126, which is designed to achieve the same end. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire gave us a lesson in English. He said that it is his second language. Some would argue that English is the second language for a Glaswegian, too. My point is that we have sought to use four words where he uses six. Perhaps we are more numerate than literate. Bills are not drafted from the point of view of that sort of examination. They are drafted by parliamentary counsel, on whose considerable experience we rely when deciding which words should go into the Bill.
<P>
The move by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is one that I support, and it is in line with the position that is set out for the Police Authority in paragraph (2) of schedule 1 to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1988. On that basis, I hope that it will find acceptance in the form of the Government amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 108 would remove the Secretary of State's power to vary the size of the board by order. The provision applies only to appointments under direct rule, not to later parts of the schedule. It comes from paragraph 2 of schedule 1 to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1988, enabling the Secretary of State by order to amend the numbers. It is already in statute and therefore accepted by Parliament. Section 4 of the Police Act 1996, passed under the previous Conservative Administration, contained a similar provision. It has been a consistent approach to have that power.
<P>
The power is not intended as a sop or comfort to those who do not want to participate. The argument is that the Secretary of State should have flexibility. There may be a need to expand or reduce the number on the board. We must have the possibility to do that in extreme circumstances. An important aspect of all this is to get a Policing Board. We are talking about the direct rule environment to which we never want to return, but we must make provision for it and allow ourselves a measure of flexibility within that, consistent with previous legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister has clearly expressed his reason for having paragraph 3(2), but it is a strange one: it happened before so it must happen again. That does not make sense. We have already agreed to a 14 to 19 membership. Why the Secretary of State should wish to vary that number from time to time is beyond me and most members of the Committee. The Minister has not given us a reason. Let us have one if there is one, but as long as that matter is hidden from us we shall be suspicious of the intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not agree with that analysis. It is not a case of, because it has been done before, it must be done again. [Interruption.] I should not respond to the sedentary comment. It is not what I said to the Committee. I explained that this was examined in two previous pieces of legislation. Going back to find out whether the hon. Gentleman opposed it then is worthy of those who want to do a doctorate in the minutiae of Government legislation, assuming that they are working class and went to Oxford.
<P>
There could always be the possibility of enlarging or reducing the board, for desirable reasons. Insufficient numbers may come forward, not because of absentionists in political parties but for other reasons, which we could spend a long time examining. The measure gives a power that would be used in unique and, one would hope, rare circumstances. We would hope that it would never need to be used at all. The case is made on the basis that I set it out.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that the board should be above politics. In one sense, that should be case, but if we have the devolved structure for the Policing Board, 10 of the 19 would come from political parties. He may disagree with the thrust of Patten-he probably does-but it is a wee bit inconsistent to say that the people representing political parties are somehow above politics but that we should use their political presence for the greater good of the greater number and not play party politics with the issue. If one is drawing from a political source, it is illogical to expect it to be above politics, any more than this Committee can be above politics when we talk about policing. There will be different points of view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I am largely in agreement with the Minister on this. In the event, as Patten predicts, hopes and wishes, that policing becomes a matter for the Northern Ireland devolved institutions, with whom would the power reside? The power has been attributed in the Bill to the Secretary of State. Would the Minister be so sanguine if the power resided with those who may not have the same interest in law and order and policing as others?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is trying to envisage types of society that may or may not develop in Northern Ireland. The whole thrust of what my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh and I are trying to achieve is to get this new beginning and then to move forward to maintain the momentum. If I understood his question correctly, the hon. Gentleman I asks who would have that power to decide, if there was a transfer of responsibility to the devolved administration. That would apply right through the measure. If, as the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) has argued, there should be an early progression towards the transfer of criminal justice and policing matters to the devolved administration, the real test for Northern Ireland society would be when that can be achieved, as it would be a point at which everyone could judge that it had become a normal society. If it then goes on to a Justice Minister under a devolved administration, while the Bill could be argued as being devolution friendly and anticipatory of many of the changes, there would clearly need to be new legislation to define certain matters. This may be one of those issues that would be defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Just let me finish the point. The responsibility should lie somewhere. It could not go to the board itself It could not rest with the Chief Constable but must lie with someone who has political accountability. In the case of this Parliament, that would be the Secretary of State, and in a devolved administration it would be the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the Minister for his answer. I agree with him that the test of the maturity of the new devolved institution will be when it can take over responsibility for policing. The question remains. So many powers, including this one, are vested in the Secretary of State. They are quite unlimited powers in many ways. If we transfer them to the devolved situation, is the Minister satisfied that it is adequate? Let me put the question another way. If he were writing a Bill on the control of policing for the Northern Ireland Assembly, would he include so many powers for the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We are getting into a wider debate here about whether the assumption on which that argument is based will stand up to examination. The tripartite structure has established a board with unique and wide-ranging powers. They are unique within the United Kingdom and compared with the Republic of Ireland, and probably even in comparison with most developed democratic countries. A powerful body is being set up. People may want it to have more power and we shall examine that as we proceed. There are good reasons for having the tripartite structure.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh then asked me whether, if we were designing the Bill to meet a devolved situation, we would design it in this way, and whether the power that rests with the Secretary of State would rest with a devolved Minister for Justice. It is hard not to come to those similar conclusions. Either there is a Minister for Justice who has effective powers that are used responsibly, or those powers are neutralised and undermined, which would mean that that Ministry would not be fully functioning. If they do not rest with an appropriate Minister who is accountable to the Executive and then to the Assembly, where would the powers rest?
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are not here to argue about that future, desirable though it might be, we are dealing with reality. Most of the Bill could be deemed to be devolution-friendly and could be transferred across easily. However, it has not been designed primarily with that purpose in mind. It should be examined on the basis that, if the powers, which will be tested over of time, are found to be flawed or weak or need to be re-examined and changed, that is something that the UK-based Government would do. If there comes a time at which power is to be transferred to a devolved Administration, any lessons that have been learned may be applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Since this refers specifically to circumstances where there is a suspension of devolved government, I wonder to what extent my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh can take comfort from the fact that this is not really setting a precedent for what happens if devolution succeeds? It is specifically covering that one situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My hon. Friend is right, but I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh touched on wider issues. That is why I covered a wider remit. I did not want to be too narrow and dismissive.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) asked about the order-making power within the legislation. It is a negative resolution procedure under clause 68(4). If the hon. Gentleman wishes to see change, he has the power to seek subsequent amendment to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister is absolutely correct and one wonders why, in effect, this Bill is catering for suspension. My view is that if suspension ever occurred again, it would be totally irrelevant in terms of the political situation there. I am slightly worried because, if the Secretary of State decided on a certain number and, after devolution, a Minister of Justice decided that it should be a different number and then there was a suspension, there would be a problem. The problem is trying to cater for suspension in a Bill of this positive nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I take on board part of what has been said. To be truly futuristic we should never consider looking back in any shape or form. However, we are still in this process. The Bill was being drafted as we moved into the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some people may see it as too negative or even planning for failure, but I can assure the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and the Committee, that that is not why the provision is there. It is there because, if we were to find ourselves in the unfortunate and unwanted set of circumstances which required suspension of the Assembly, we would need to have quick access to powers that would allow us to have a Policing Board. The reality of the legislation is that if the Assembly falls, the devolved Policing Board falls along with it. We must provide cover. If we introduced further primary legislation, there would be an interregnum during which there would be no power to deal with policing matters. It would have to be devolved on the Secretary of State, which would not be desirable because the community would not be involved as widely as we want.
<P>
Having heard my arguments, I hope that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone will not press amendments Nos. 107 and 108, that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will withdraw amendment No. 126, and that the Committee will accept Government amendment No. 133.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> There is always a cultural element in the discussion of legislation, which tends to reflect the mood of the time. If we were debating the Bill in two years, the caution about suspension would not be displayed. The matter has been rehearsed and there may something in it, because it sends out signals in Northern Ireland when there are so many caveats about what happens in the event of suspension.
<P>
The Minister implored me to withdraw amendment No. 126. It is good news that he has been thinking along the same lines concerning the number. Only the language causes me any problems, but he made a valiant defence of poor English.
<P>
One serious point is that, if the minimum number of people on the committee is reduced to 14, there may be consequences for quorums and other figures that are based on the assumption that there will be 19 people on the committee. We shall return to that later, but it is possible that those consequences have been omitted in the amendments. For example, if 12 people are needed to approve an inquiry and the board consists of only 14 people, that is rather more than a two thirds majority.
<P>
I am fundamentally pleased that the range will be 14 to 19 people and, although the Plain English Campaign will never forgive me, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Maginnis rose-</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 126 having been withdrawn, the hon. Gentleman can ask for a vote on amendments Nos. 107 and 108, but the debate is over. We have debated amendments Nos. 107 and 108 with amendment No. 126, which has been withdrawn, and if the hon. Gentleman wants a vote on his amendments, he should tell me now. Otherwise, the Government amendment will be moved formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I wanted to catch your eye-but perhaps I did not-before the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire withdrew his amendment because I wanted to encourage the Minister to develop his argument. However, I accept that the debate on the amendments is over. I may return to the issue in amendment No. 108 on Report, but I have no desire to press it to a vote now.

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 36, line 34, after `(a)', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Members of Parliament who represent Northern Ireland constituencies;
<P>
(b)'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 110, in page 36, line 38, leave out sub-paragraph (6).
<P>
No. 63, in page 40, line 3, leave out sub-paragraph (4).
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 134 and 135.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to encourage the Government to include Northern Ireland Members of Parliament in the list of bodies and individuals whom they would consult on membership during a suspension of devolved government. It appears that, as long as policing is not devolved in Northern Ireland, not only should district councils and other such bodies as the Secretary of State considers appropriate be consulted, but so should those who were elected by the people of Northern Ireland to represent them at Westminster.
<P>
I can see no reason why the amendment should not be accepted. It is linked with amendment Nos. 110 and 63, in which my party has a particular interest. Amendment No. 110 relates to sub-paragraph (6), which concerns the appointment of members to the board in circumstances where the Secretary of State is excused consultation. We must remember that this part of the schedule deals with a point at which devolved government in Northern Ireland is suspended. At such a time, there would be huge sensitivity among elected representatives from both traditions, and it would be unwise completely to ignore-as sub-paragraph (6) intends-the opinions of those elected in Northern Ireland. That is not a time at which one should seek to abandon the consultation process.
<P>
Amendment No. 63, which my party has tabled jointly with the SDLP-I hope that this will not be a unique occasion-also deals with a time when government is devolved. Again, enabling the Secretary of State to abandon the consultation process on a matter that is of huge concern to the vast majority of society and-perhaps for different reasons-to peripheral elements within one or other tradition, is a strange way in which to reassure the people of Northern Ireland. It is clear from their amendments Nos. 134 and 135 that the Government realise that they are wrong about what is happening. Then why is it happening? I shall not repeat the answer to my own question that I have already given.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I believe that the Government are trying to give the Secretary of State the sort of manipulative power that will do nothing to reassure society in Northern Ireland. It that really what the Government want? I listened with considerable interest to what the Minister said about those amendments, but when we come to deal with issues pertaining to policing in Northern Ireland, it will be fundamentally wrong if we leave the consultation process to something covert that takes place behind one's hand.
<P>
That is the way in which Northern Ireland has been governed for the past 28 years. It is a question of who whispers loudest behind their hand and the extent to which that whisper carries a threat or intimidation. Hence, normal society has lost out. Those who have been able to employ disaster and violence appear to have been listened to by the Government-not always willingly, I concede-and the Government have tended to capitulate. Here consultation should be overt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I have two points. The first is about normal society, and specifically in relation to amendment No. 109. I think that I am right in saying that in England, Wales and Scotland Members of Parliament are not usually consulted on this matter. Would we want Northern Ireland to do something different?
<P>
Secondly, would I be correct in thinking that ``Members of Parliament'' could include Members of Parliament who had chosen not to take their seat?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I shall deal with the first and more serious point about what happens in Great Britain. It has had a different system of government: different strata have been in place and it has a different method of dealing with policing in the area covered by each constabulary from the method used in Northern Ireland. I am not trying to create a comparison or to have the same type of system; that is not possible. If he carries the argument to its logical conclusion, the hon. Gentleman will hugely embarrass the Minister, who will not be able to show consistency between many things that happen in Northern Ireland, and for which he has responsibility, what happens in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
It is time that the hon. Gentleman realised that Northern Ireland Members of Parliament have carried a far greater burden than he has ever carried over the past 28 years. Because of the missing strata of government, we have had to be councillor, Assembly Member and Member of Parliament to our constituents.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North is an extremely diligent Member, but we shall have to maintain the role that we played when the Assembly was suspended. Members of Parliament should overtly be consulted-that way, people would know what was happening-and those who work quietly behind the scenes should justify themselves in public. That is why we tabled the amendment, although I accept that it raises questions about whether there would be consultation with Mr. Adams, Mr. McGuinness and the other 16 Members. That obviously depends on the relevant circumstances and whether the IRA had returned to violence.
<P>
The Government will have to decide what is morally and ethically the proper thing to do in that situation. Overt consultation with the two gentlemen whom I mentioned is preferable to some of the consultations that have occurred down the years-
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> An important point is involved in this context, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North. Amendment No. 109 clearly refers to Sinn Fein's two Members of Parliament. Paragraph 3(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State shall consult.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would compel the Secretary of State to consult the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams) and his parliamentary colleague.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Yes. The hon. Gentleman will agree that the amendment refers to those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who represent Northern Ireland constituencies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It refers not to those who were elected as Members of constituencies, but to those who represent them. If rules are applicable, I shall abide by the tenets that were laid down by Madam Speaker, who has already ruled on this matter.
<P>
I have made it clear that I should rather have government up front and honestly-Governments should do what they have to do-than covert government, which happened previously, when tawdry little deals were made with Sinn Fein-IRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> The hon. Gentleman's remarks return us to a phrase that he used earlier-we all hope that the two hon. Members will fully enter into proper democratic behaviour. He asked what would happen if the use of violence was resumed. The amendment's wording might still force us to consult those hon. Members, even if violence was reverted to and it was decided that it was improper for Sinn Fein to be involved. I do not think that Madam Speaker's ruling affects the fact that they would be deemed in law to be Members of Parliament who represent Northern Ireland constituencies. I am trying to be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am grateful for that assistance. If the Government agree with that point of view, there will be an opportunity on Report for them to find a form of words that they consider to be more appropriate. I see that the Minister is looking very stern. I am not sure whether he has fully taken on board the implication of his hon. Friend's suggestion. However, if he would consider doing so, we would be delighted if he tabled that small amendment on Report, and I would be happy to hear his reassurance when he responds.
<P>
I shall briefly return to amendment No. 63, which will involve less difficulty because it is believed that the circumstances will be more normal in terms of amendment No. 110. In other words, there will be devolved government in Northern Ireland and one hopes that that would mean that people would pursue a peaceful and non-violent approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Malins. I look forward to working with you and seeking your guidance, as often seems to be necessary in these matters.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 seeks to rectify the situation in which the Government must consult the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and district councils on all appointments during devolution, except for the first appointments post-restoration. Post restoration-that almost sounds like a school of painters. I have no egotistical purpose in this. Patten required the provision. It was a good, sensible suggestion in his report that the independent members of the policing board should be appointed by the Secretary of State in consultation with the First and Deputy First Minister. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the Bill implements what Patten explicitly recommends.
<P>
However, the difficulty is that paragraph 8(4) of schedule 1 relieves the Secretary of State of any obligation to consult the First and Deputy First Minister or district councils over the first appointments following the restoration of devolution. It would be a remarkable omission if the Secretary of State did not have to consult anyone, post-restoration, about appointments to a board of this nature, with the remarkable powers and responsibilities that it is to have. The amendment seeks to rectify that omission, and is akin to amendments Nos. 110 and 111. As devolution has just been restored, the Secretary of State does not have to consult anyone on the appointment of the independent members of the board. I recognise the Secretary of State's supreme wisdom, his insights into Northern Irish life, and the way in which his judgments are made, but even he is not so omnipotent that he would not have to consult anyone. However, that is what the Bill allows.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman see this as a kind of restoration of the divine right of kings, as in the time of Charles I? That certainly did not work, and had rather unfortunate consequences.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I would have thought that the line
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>put not your trust in princes
<P>
</UL></FONT>is more apposite.
<P>
The criticism of the omission was made by not only my colleagues, but Northern Ireland's Equality Commission. It therefore merits careful consideration. The commission recognised and acknowledged the importance of consultation with the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and others in bringing balanced representation to the appointments. I object not because of my involvement as Deputy First Minister, but because appointments of this scope and nature are to be made without any consultation whatever. I admit that I believe that that was not the intention when the Bill was drafted. Those who were giving the political direction and those who were drafting it were caught in the slipstream between the suspension and post-restoration periods. The omission should now be put right.
<P>
I recognise that consultation with the district councils would be a time-consuming factor, and wonder how it would take place. Perhaps the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who tabled amendment No. 110, could provide some enlightenment. The Secretary of State has given himself a power in relation to an Order in Council to deal with flags, and has given himself the task of consulting with the Assembly in certain circumstances. Perhaps that would be the precedent for the way in which he is to consult district councils. As someone who spent 16 years on a district council, I am sure that we are all looking forward to funding out what form the consultation might take.
<P>
Regardless of the length of time that it would take, and its onerous nature for such a busy man, amendment No. 63 would require the same kind of consultation. There are two key points. First, it would bring it into accord with Patten. Secondly, it would take away the remarkable situation whereby appointments of this nature can be made without any consultation in a post-restoration period. I therefore look forward to what the Minister has to say about the Government's amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In alluding to amendment No. 110, the hon. Gentleman accorded to me the responsibility of the Minister by asking me how I thought that consultation with the district councils would take place. In fact, I suspect that my views are similar to his own. I think that it would be a long and laborious process, but, as it is the Government's proposal, I shall not quarrel with it in a pedantic way. Amendment No. 109 was about consultation with Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but, according to the amendment paper, I share amendment No. 110 with him. For that reason I asked whether he had figured out a way in which the Secretary of State would carry out consultation with district councils. However, it was an unfair question and it should be left to the Minister to tell us how it will be done.
<P>
I look forward to the Minister's reply. I shall reserve judgment, and wait with not a little interest, until I have heard what he says about the consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I support amendment No. 109, which says that Members of Parliament from Northern Ireland should be consulted when there is direct rule and no devolved government in Northern Ireland. I appreciate that England and Wales do not have direct rule and are never likely to, so it is not satisfactory to compare them. Once the devolved Assembly collapses in Northern Ireland, we will go back to direct rule. In that situation it would seem proper that the 18 Members of Parliament from the Province should be consulted, together with district councils and such other bodies as the Minister considers appropriate.
<P>
The question has been raised whether the two elected Sinn Fein Members who have refused to take the oath and their seats would be consulted. If they are Members of Parliament, they will have to be consulted, because we cannot allow two people who have been elected to this Parliament but do not take their seats to affect the rights of those who have come to the House, taken the oath and acted for their constituents. I therefore support the proposal that Members of Parliament should be included in the consultation process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman supports the amendment that bears his name. There is a crucial point here about consultation. Does he believe that any Member of Parliament-for example, the right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor)-had consultations with the Secretary of State about the Bill at any point before the last Unionist council meeting?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I am not privy to any negotiations that take place with my right hon. Friend the Member for Strangford or any Government Member. As the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh knows, on many occasions he does not speak for me, so I cannot speak for him.
<P>
The other two amendments dealing with the consultation propose that when the first appointment of members takes place, both after devolved government and on the establishment of devolved government, consultation should take place. We believe that consultation should take place. I realise that if we have devolved government and it suddenly collapses, as it most likely will, we immediately go back to direct rule. In that situation the members from the Assembly will depart, so the number on the board will be less than the minimum. In order not to stop meetings of the board taking place, it would be necessary to have quick reappointments. That may create a difficulty with local councils. The Minister should consider the matter more closely and, if it is not possible to consult district councils, the Bill could place a statutory obligation on him to consult Members of Parliament and other appropriate bodies. He would consult the two Sinn Fein Members, anyway, and I do not doubt that he would include the Irish Government in the list of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other bodies as he considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Amendments Nos. 110 and 63 raise an important issue, and I support both.
<P>
Amendment No. 109 also raises an important point. Part II deals with membership during suspension of devolved government. It is right that there should be a statutory requirement on the Secretary of State to consult, before making appointments to the board. It is right that district councils should be consulted and that the Secretary of State should be required to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other bodies as he considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the circumstances, it seems wholly appropriate that the Secretary of State should also consult Northern Ireland Members of Parliament. It is desirable that that should be in the Bill. If it is decided that district councils should be mentioned explicitly, I can see no reason why Members of Parliament should not.
<P>
It is legitimate to expect that the experience that Members of Parliament have could be of benefit to the Secretary of State at a sensitive time in political developments in the Province. I do not understand why there should be a statutory requirement to consult district councils, but not Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, in a sense, most laws are drafted on the assumption that Members of Parliament are integral to the process? It is not usual to make it explicit. That said, I do not disagree with the general drift of the amendment, but I am interested to hear whether the lawyers consider that it is usual for Members of Parliament to pass laws that require that Members of Parliament be consulted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I dare say that it is highly unusual, but we are discussing exceptional circumstances, in which devolved government has come to an end. The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North objected about the Secretary of State's having to discuss appointments with two Sinn Fein Members in current circumstances. I would point out, flippantly, that the previous Government consulted with Sinn Fein for the best part of seven years. I do not see why that should not be the case again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Does not the statutory obligation to consult, under certain circumstances that might cause devolved government to break down, concern the hon. Gentleman slightly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> That would not worry me especially. I do not interpret paragraph 4(a) as meaning that the Secretary of State is obliged to consult every district council. The Bill merely states that there must be consultation with district councils, not all or every council. Geographical considerations will be a factor in appointments to the board and the Secretary of State may wish to consult councils in a particular part of the Province. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on that, but I do not see a requirement in the Bill for the Secretary of State to consult all district councils. Therefore, I am not saying that the wording of amendment No. 109 would necessarily require the Secretary of State to consult all Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I intervene with caution. I am not a lawyer, but surely the Secretary of State's decision would be liable to judicial review if someone could claim that, in consulting with some but not others, he had demonstrated partiality.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Bearing it in mind that, during times of devolved government, at least, the board will contain political representatives, it is understandable that the Secretary of State would want to be selective at both Member of Parliament and district council level. For example, if it were felt that there should be more places on the board for members of the party of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, there would be no need to consult the Unionists. Amendment No. 109 would not therefore require the Secretary of State to consult all Members of Parliament.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman has a detailed knowledge of the north of Ireland and its political composition. Given his line of thought, can he say which councils the Secretary of State would not consult in this round of partial consultation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I am merely stating that if in certain circumstances, the Secretary of State were to look for a geographical balance of board members, he would not necessarily be required to consult all district councils. There could be flexibility in practice and, as I understand it, according to the terms of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> No lawyer can resist a legalistic point, and although lawyers can be wrong, to my mind the wording in amendment No. 109 and the Bill is clear. The Members of Parliament who would be consulted under the amendment are those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who represent Northern Ireland constituencies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore clear that the Secretary of State would be obliged to consult only those hon. Members. The Bill establishes a clear obligation to consult district ``councils'', in the plural. If there were no intention to consult all district councils, the Bill would say so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I note and respect what the hon. Gentleman has said, but it does not alter my support for amendment No. 109. If the amendment referred to all Members of Parliament, I would object to it.
<P>
I have exhausted amendment No. 109, but on amendment No. 63, I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. I support it for precisely the reasons that he eloquently gave.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone pointed out, amendment No. 109 would place a requirement on the Secretary of State to consult Members of Parliament. We have had a useful exchange on how that provision would apply, and I shall return to it in a moment.
<P>
In respect of our previous discussion, the Bill will also allow for consultation with district councils and ``such other bodies'' as the Secretary of State ``considers appropriate''. That is consistent with the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, and paragraph 2(4) of schedule 1 to the 1998 Act is mirrored in paragraph 3(4) of schedule 1 to the Bill.
<P>
The Government will consult district councils by writing to them seeking nominations. Nominees will then enter the pool for consideration for appointment. The procedure is not mind-shatteringly complex. It is simple, and consistent with the principle of seeking as wide a representation of nominations as can be achieved in Northern Ireland. It is given added effect because district councils will have enhanced powers in the Bill, so any argument against consultation with district councils relating to this part of the Bill is inconsistent with the way in which they will be given enhanced powers in later provisions. Under the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, we would advertise the posts widely and openly. That is part of the process through which we make appointments not only to this board but to all public bodies covered by the guidance and the rules set down by Parliament in relation to such bodies.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone mentioned Sinn Fein in his argument, but that would not necessarily be the only party to adopt the approach of having Members of Parliament who may not wish to engage with the board. It could be any party. A member of his own party might even decide that they wanted nothing to do with this new entity, but would be obliged, according to the hon. Gentleman's proposal, to become involved in this process of consultation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman knows the way in which the Northern Ireland Office and its Ministers work. We are very inclusive in the way in which we contact a Member of Parliament before any substantial change; there is usually a long checklist of people to be consulted. However, that does not apply to public appointments, because that process already has transparency written into it. There is not a strong enough argument to justify the hon. Gentleman's argument in amendment No. 109. The argument that Members of Parliament wish to change the Bill so that they could be consulted could attract criticism elsewhere.
<P>
Amendment No. 110 would require the Secretary of State to engage in formal consultation before appointing the board, when the Assembly is in its suspended mode. We said in earlier debates that we hoped that those circumstances would never arise. I shall explain the purpose of sub-paragraph (6), which the amendment seeks to delete. The provision would apply in circumstances in which the Assembly was suspended, and would allow the Secretary of State swiftly to appoint 19 independent members to replace the 10 political members appointed from the Assembly and the 9 independent members, all of whom would cease to hold office by virtue of paragraph 2(3) of the schedule.
<P>
I outlined in an earlier debate the way in which that process would operate. The Secretary of State would want to re-appoint the nine former independents immediately, and ideally another 10 as soon as possible to avoid a period with no Policing Board, or one with a nine-person board. Nine of the 19 members would have gone through the full examination process, under devolved government, so there could be no reasonable argument against a Secretary of State appointing those nine people to the Policing Board, assuming that they wanted to take on the responsibility. Sub-paragraph (6) would enable the Secretary of State to achieve that without the need formally to consult the district councils or other bodies, because they would have been part of the earlier consultation process. I believe that the measure is proportionate, and on that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw amendment No. 110 as well.
<P>
It might be appropriate to consider amendment No. 63-I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh for moving it-with Government amendments Nos. 134 and 135. The purpose of paragraph 8(4), which the amendment would remove, is not widely understood. It would apply when devolution occurred and the Government needed to create a new board that was made up not of 19 independents but of 10 elected members and nine independents. Clearly, the 10 members take care of themselves they will be appointed from the devolved administration, under the d'Hondt principle but the Secretary of State will need to appoint nine others in that situation.
<P>
Under the Bill's provisions, all members of a board cease to hold office on devolution, again by virtue of paragraph 2(3) of the schedule. For speed, the Secretary of State will appoint nine from the existing membership, who will have been appointed under the full procedure. He would want to make those appointments quickly, so that there would be no period during which there were no independents on the board. Paragraph 8(4) would enable him to do so without consulting the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, councils and other bodies.
<P>
We have examined this matter and taken on board the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister should be consulted and Government amendments Nos. 134 and 135 would give effect to that. In that situation, a wider process of consultation with district councils and others would take too long. I hope that my hon. Friend accepts that the Government amendments embody his aims and that he will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That exposition leaves me bamboozled. The Minister said that the Bill contains a provision that allows one to get rid of people whom one is not really getting of-it appears that one will complicate the Bill's drafting in an effort to contradict oneself. The Assembly would be suspended if that happened. My hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone and I disagree about that to an extent. I hope that the Assembly will survive. It is a pity, in a way, that my hon. Friend is a Methodist lay preacher. If not, I would willing to have a flutter on the side, although it would of course be time limited-I cannot speak for the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh.
<P>
I should return to serious matters. The Minister asked us to accept a con-the provisions do not need to be in the Bill. The idea that everything will fall, and that within minutes the Secretary of State could reappoint nine of the 19 Members appears to verge on the dishonest. I do not mean to personalise that-I refer to the effect of the machinery on people. To be blunt, that brings the Bill into disrepute. If, in the event of a suspension, 10 Members of the Assembly who are on the Policing Board were removed, so be it. We should consider leaving the nine independent members.
<P>
We have no difficulty with amendment No. 63, but we have difficulty with amendment No. 110 because it would enable the Secretary of State, with no consultation, to appoint 10 other people in lieu of the 10 political members.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was challenged by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh to explain how consultation would take place with 26 district councils. It would take place in the same way as it has taken place again and again during the past 28 years. If someone writes to a district council and asks for an opinion, a nomination or whatever, that happens fairly speedily. There is no reason for consultation not to take place. I say that with some scepticism and slightly tongue-in-cheek because, having been a district councillor in Northern Ireland from 1981 to 1993, I remember the numerous occasions on which we were consulted, but no one ever listened. Over the years, we have learned how to ensure that the Government listen, but whether they hear remains to be seen.
<P>
There is no good reason why I should not press amendment No. 109 because the argument for it stands by itself and need not be reiterated. Nor is there any reason for not pressing amendment No. 110, but if the Minister wants to return to the matter and restructure the Bill so that we do not suffer the con trick, I shall not press it. However, if he will not, I shall have an obligation to show that it is inconsistent with open government and with what he says are the Government's intentions.
<P>
My intention is to press amendment No. 109 to a vote and I await the Minister's response on amendment No. 110.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I must confess that I share the hon. Gentleman's bamboozlement. I look forward to seeing the report of our proceedings so that we can read it and see whether we fully understand the issue. There is something worrying at the heart of the Bill. It is not just the merits or demerits of amendments Nos. 109, 110 or 63. There is paranoia throughout the Bill about suspension, pre-suspension and post-restoration. This is only our second sitting, but we have come up against that paranoia in almost every phrase. How can legislation properly be framed for a new, uncertain dispensation-which was always going to be rocky-if it effectively staggers between pre-suspension and post-restoration, not to mention the period of designation? Where is the paranoia coming from? Perhaps I and the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone have been affected by it. This will crop up again when we reach the next group of amendments, in terms not of whom the Secretary of State appoints or consults, but of the numbers involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> The hon. Gentleman has at least one great advantage over me. In his compassionate and human way, he understands the politics of Northern Ireland very deeply, while I do not. On his point about paranoia-to use his word-would his advice to Committee members be that the provisions for suspension and restoration have a demoralising effect on the body politic in Northern Ireland, in that they enhance insecurity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> If we were not the people that we are, that might be so. We shall not allow the Committee's debates to demoralise the people of the north of Ireland.
<P>
Unless there is some unity of purpose in the Bill, we will stagger between paranoia and uncertainty. The point has already been made about numbers on the Policing Board. The figure may be 9, fewer than 19, 14, or whatever the Secretary of State decides, depending on the way in which the political wind is blowing. What will be the effect of not knowing that when we move further on and have to decide on the quorum for the board? I suggest that part of the problem is that we cannot understand the Government's mind on this. One minute they are looking to the future, then they are thinking in terms of suspension, shortly after that of pre-suspension, and some time later of post-restoration. The Bill has to cope with all those eventualities.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that the object of the provisions is to ensure that a collapse of the institutions does not lead to blunt direct rule? We should try to maintain as much devolution of power as possible under these difficult circumstances. If my hon. Friend does not share that object, why did not he propose the complete deletion of part II of schedule 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I wish that life were that simple. If the political institutions are suspended again or collapse, we can forget about the Bill and amend the whole thing, because the Bill will become irrelevant. Direct rule is a blunt instrument, however many palliatives we give it, but no one should imagine that we can cater for that eventuality by making the Bill apply in unnatural circumstances and keeping elements of it that could be reintroduced at a later stage. If that is what it has all been designed for, the Bill and our discussions will become irrelevant.
<P>
We are seeing three things here. First, we are seeing a lack of vision in the Bill, of what the future will be. Secondly, we are seeing a lack of imagination about the way in which we deal with the unimaginable-the unimaginable is the divided people of Northern Ireland deciding in a responsible way how they will govern and police themselves. Thirdly, we are seeing a failure to grasp the opportunity for creativity in policing as in everything else, because we live in a period of remarkable change in which we can change things creatively.
<P>
We are seeing a failure of vision and a failure to recognise that the future will be different. As long as we do that, we will straddle suspension, pre-suspension, post-suspension, post-restoration or whatever it may be. No set of legislators in the world could cope with that mixture of eventualities. That is where the difficulty lies. It will not be catered for by amendment No. 109 in the name of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, by amendments Nos. 110 and 63 in my name or by the two Government amendments. I think that the two Government amendments are all right. I must be honest: I would have to read the Hansard report to be sure about that.
<P>
I ask the Minister with nothing but sincerity if he will elaborate on the matter again. Is he saying ``Yes, the Secretary of State will consult the First and Deputy First Minister''? Is he saying ``Yes, the Secretary of State will consult district councils''? I do not know whether he has said that, but, if he has, let us hear. If he is saying that the amendments take into account the circumstances of a new dispensation in policing, could we be told that as well, or will it be a set of insurance policies going back into the past on which we will never be able to base proper legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am sorry that I have not helped the Committee, but I shall try to deal with the matter.
<P>
We must hold up our hands and say that we are trying to deal with a number of eventualities. We discussed that earlier in the Bill and I said that some of those eventualities are wholly undesirable. Nobody would wish to see the restoration or the return of direct rule, because in one sense that would be an indication of failure-not by the Government, but by those to whom responsibility has passed to make the new vision of the new Northern Ireland work. However, the Government must take account of realities, and the realities of the not too distant past were that the devolved administration had to be suspended, and then restored. Therefore, we agree on that reality.
<P>
I do not accept the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh that we lack vision. The core of the Bill, perhaps with the exception of provisions that deal with the mechanics and technicalities of possible eventualities, deals with Patten's vision and takes on board the thrust of his recommendations. Of course, we will consider that in more detail, but I do not take the view that the Bill lacks vision. The Government share that vision and want to drive it forward in everything that we do. Everything that we have done has been about seeking to implement and push forward the Good Friday agreement. We have not always had a line of warm friends beside us and have sometimes had to take very difficult decisions in order to create a better society and to ensure that it can become even better in future.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill does not lack of vision, commitment or determination, but we are discussing a provision that deals with practicalities of the whole process. No matter from which direction we come, whether from a direct rule environment to a devolved environment or the reverse, a new Policing Board has to be established. In both instances, people will have been appointed in the independent category through a number of mechanisms that will allow the widest possible consideration of their quality.
<P>
On the precise question asked by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, and in response to amendment No. 63, I must say that we have taken on board an approach that I would have hoped that he would have found acceptable. If we were to move from direct rule to devolution-assuming that that became an eventuality-there would be consultation with the First and Deputy First Ministers and not with the district councils. If we were moving in a different direction, but in a normal environment and as part of a normal process, there would be full consultation. Whatever type of policing board is in place, the Government have to ensure that it as widely representative of the community as possible. Nine people will be drawn to serve as independents, but we hope that there will be a wider pool. As we move from nine to 19 or some other number, during the transition from a situation of unsatisfactory devolution to direct rule, we hope to have the luxury of a larger pool of people to draw upon, from whom the original nine will already have been drawn. I am sorry if that is not clear or if it has been categorised as lacking vision, but Governments must be practical as well as having the vision thing. That is the purpose of legislation: to deal with the eventualities. Indeed, that is why amendment No. 110 cannot be accepted and why we have taken on board the thrust of amendment No. 63 in Government amendments Nos. 134 and 135.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone wants to be written into the Bill so that people will consult him and everybody else who falls into the specialist category of being a Member of Parliament. That is his choice, but if he understands the Bill, which I am sure that he has considered in great detail, he will know that wide consultation will occur in the normal environment. Many people will be consulted and Members of Parliament are not precluded from making nominations at any time. Nothing stops them from doing so; in fact, they are usually the quickest to the phone to speak to Ministers and the quickest to put something on paper, although it usually a complaint. Such an exchange is healthy and beneficial, but to include it in the Bill would be a step too far and would be disproportionate. That is why I ask the Committee not to support amendment No. 109.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I remember that when the Minister discovered that he was wrong during consideration of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill in 1998 and found that he could not do anything about it, he became defensive and tried to suggest that others had ulterior motives. As far as the amendments are concerned, there is no ulterior motive. He says that I want to write myself into the Bill because I belong to a special group of people who are Members of Parliament. Where is the difference between writing into the Bill that special group, to which I belong, and that other special group that is made up of many district councils, and the group or groups that are not even identified under the terms of paragraph 3(4). The Minister's address, which was intended as a serious point, contained little consistency or logic.
<P>
The Minister may satisfy the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh on amendment No. 63, and to some extent, but only to some extent, he satisfies me. However, the Minister does not satisfy me with the argument that the Secretary of State will, in the event of the restoration of devolved government, consult with the First and Deputy First Ministers, but it is impossible for him, in event of the reverse process occurring, to consult with those people-as I explained to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North-who will carry the added burden of any breakdown in devolved government. The Minister's remarks have no logic.
<P>
I am surprised that the Minister cannot be a little bit more open-handed in the way in which he treats the different traditions in the Bill. Amendment No. 110 is the reciprocal of amendment No. 63. I want to make it clear now that what I say is no reflection on the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh. For the Minister to accept amendment No. 63, but to reject amendment No. 110 is to tell me in Committee that a prejudice operates. That prejudice requires him to make concessions for one tradition that he cannot make for another. That is the logic of it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Is it not the case that amendments Nos. 110 and 63 had the support of both traditions? Therefore, it is wrong to suggest that there is an attempt to discriminate, which I am certain is not the Government's intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. It is my fault for not having made the point as clearly as I should.
<P>
With amendment No. 63, we are discussing a situation in which there is a responsibility-sharing devolved arrangement, which is what I want to see. Then we all benefit from what the Minister has said. However, in the most unfortunate event that the devolved arrangement broke down, then it is my desire and that of the tradition that I represent that, as we move back to direct rule, there is no doubt as to what that means. However, there is doubt if the Minister tells me that elected Members of Parliament cannot enjoy the reciprocal consideration given to elected Members of the devolved Assembly. Surely I do not have to spell out the point more clearly. My desire is not to highlight traditional suspicions and sensitivities, but I am afraid that the Minister, by his refusal to consider sympathetically amendment No. 110, has been guilty of suggesting that there is a difference. I must note that difference with great regret.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I noted that the Minister said that a reason for his thinking that consultation with Members of Parliament should not be included was that they were, by definition, consulted on all legislation. Far be it for me ever to seek compromises, but might there not be a compromise on the matter? Could consultation not be included in the title deeds to cater for the requirement of hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, given that he feels strongly about the issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> And I thought that the hon. Gentleman understood what it was to be bamboozled. The matter is for the Minister. The one helpful aspect of the Minister's remarks is perhaps that he talked about automatic consultation with Members of Parliament. Is there not automatic consultation between the Secretary of State and the First and Deputy First Ministers with regard to policing in the context of devolution in Northern Ireland? Of course there is. That is why the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh underpins my point. If the First and Deputy First Ministers are to be included, Members of Parliament should be, too. The logic of the contributions of the Minister and of the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh sustained my point on amendment No. 110.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The amendment deals with the disqualification of board members. The schedule sets out a number of disqualifications, including if a person is a member of the police support staff or a member of the police force. We believe that a member's background should be considered before he is appointed to the office. Amendment No. 111 sets forth criteria that should be considered before someone becomes a member. If someone has been convicted of a terrorist offence, imprisoned, given a suspended sentence, made bankrupt or previously expelled or excluded from the board, he should not be appointed to it. Those are reasonable qualifications that a man should have. The amendment is sensible.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 concerns expulsion. The Bill states that-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may remove a person from office as a member or as chairman or vice chairman of the Board if satisfied<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that certain conditions are met. We believe that ``may'' is not strong enough. If, during his term of office, a person is convicted of a criminal offence, is made bankrupt, has made it clear that he is not committed to non-violence, has failed to comply with the terms of his appointment or is otherwise unable or unfit to discharge his functions, we believe that his removal should be mandatory and that the Secretary of State should act as soon as possible.
<P>
Amendment No. 113 would leave out the words-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or as chairman or vice-chairman.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) allows the Secretary of State to remove a person from office as a member, or as chairman or vice-chairman, if he has defaulted on his terms of reference-in other words, that member has been convicted or made bankrupt and so on. We see no reason for the chairman or vice-chairman to be mentioned in the Bill, because a chairman or vice-chairman who was convicted of a criminal offence could be removed from that office but remain a member. We believe that he should be removed not only from the office of chairman or vice-chairman but that he should lose his membership.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 would amend sub-paragraph (5)(a), which states that the member, chairman or vice-chairman has been convicted of a criminal offence. We believe that that could catch someone convicted of a motoring offence or a minor criminal offence. We therefore seek to make that provision less severe. It refers to anyone-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>convicted in Northern Ireland or elsewhere of any offence and has had passed on him a sentence of imprisonment (whether suspended or not).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a more satisfactory provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 120 is another ``may'' and ``shall'' amendment. It is another provision under which the Secretary of State should act. Amendment No. 121 is similar to amendment No. 114 dealing with convictions for criminal offences.
<P>
The amendments are entirely positive. They would improve the Bill and ensure that no convicted terrorist could become a member but that no one could be excluded for a minor offence.

<P>

<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I notice the difference between what is proposed in the amendment and existing traditional measures. Someone who becomes bankrupt can be disqualified. The implication of the provision to disqualify someone who has been bankrupt would be that someone could be disqualified for life even if they had been bankrupt and discharged many years previously. Would that be the hon. Gentleman's intention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is referring to amendment No. 111, which has been tabled to allow consistency with the rest of the Bill, as has been said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that much of what we have attempted to achieve through the amendments would give consistency between what happens to the policing boards and to the district policing partnerships and the conditions attached to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> My hon. Friend has clarified the situation and I commend the amendments to the Committee.

Sitting suspended.

</P>
<P>
On resuming-
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 159, 160 and 161. They reflect the reasoned amendment that the Conservative party tabled on Second Reading. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bracknell (Mr. MacKay) made clear in that debate, the Conservative party believes that it cannot be right for members of political parties who are linked to paramilitary organisations that have failed even to begin decommissioning their illegal weapons to be allowed to sit on the police board.
<P>
Under the Bill, the board will consist of 19 members of whom 10 will be political member, drawn using the d'Hondt mechanism from the political parties represented in the Northern Ireland Executive. Two of those members will therefore be members of Sinn Fein. While we welcome the re-formation of the Executive and accept that Sinn Fein is entitled by its democratic mandate to two seats in that Executive, we do not believe that the time is right for its representatives to sit in judgment on the police or be part of a board that is supposed to hold the Chief Constable to account. We concede-and happily so-that the people of Northern Ireland voted in the referendum to accept Sinn Fein in the Executive. They did not, however, vote to endorse the Patten proposals for Sinn Fein to sit on the policing board, especially without any decommissioning.
<P>
As the Government have repeated on many occasions-the Minister will correct me if I am mistaken-Sinn Fein and the IRA remain inextricably linked, being two sides of the same coin. So far they have failed to meet any of their obligations under the Good Friday agreement to begin decommissioning arms, although that was supposed to have been completed by 22 May.
<P>
Despite the fact that the IRA promised in May to begin a process that would lead to its arms being put completely and verifiably beyond use, that process has not yet begun. The confidence building measure-or CBM, as it is sometimes called-of opening arms dumps for independent inspection has not yet taken place, in spite of the IRA's promise that it would happen within weeks. The IRA has not even re-appointed its go-between with the de Chastelain commission on decommissioning, whom it withdrew in February. If the Minister has any information to the contrary, we shall be pleased to hear it.
<P>
The IRA retains a huge arsenal. It retains a massive capacity to cause terror and mayhem. Its structure remains intact. The political party that represents it-Sinn Fein-remains completely opposed to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. In those circumstances, it is surely perverse to admit Sinn Fein, or any other party that is linked to a paramilitary organisation that has not decommissioned, to the police board. Membership of that board could give the political representatives of a paramilitary organisation a platform to engage in political agitation against the police. That would be bad enough, but it is unthinkable that membership of the board would give access to security sensitive information. I hope that that helps to explain our difference in attitude to membership of the Executive on the one hand and of the Policing Board on the other.
<P>
The devolved Executive deals with matters such as health, education, roads and the environment, all of which are serious issues. However, there is a world of difference between Sinn Fein Ministers dealing with those issues and their representatives being allowed access to security sensitive information and involvement in the most sensitive aspects of policing when the organisation to which they are linked remains fully armed.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although we can countenance Sinn Fein membership of the Executive for a limited period before the IRA has begun decommissioning, we cannot countenance its membership of the Policing Board until decommissioning has at least begun.

<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North may want to make the same point. The hon. Gentleman mentioned access to information that may be highly confidential or sensitive. Is that not exactly what the safeguards in the Bill relate to? Indeed, the Bill has been criticised for giving the Secretary of State too much power in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He raises an entirely proper qualification to the drift of my remarks, and, if he will permit me, I propose to wait until the Minister replies, to find out to what extent the Minister can reassure me. I do not approach any of the issues with a closed mind, and I know that you, Mr. Malins, would not want me to. I hope that for the moment I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> On a different point, I find it slightly puzzling that one of the effects of the way in which the hon. Gentleman voted on amendment No. 109 would have been that, in the event of-let us hope that it never happens-a breakdown in the ceasefire, Sinn Fein MPs would be consulted on the membership of the Policing Board, although he objects to the possibility of their being involved in the Policing Board if the ceasefire holds. That seems slightly inconsistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I have seldom been accused of consistency, and in my experience, Northern Ireland matters are not susceptible to consistency. They are generally approached with the wise words that a sense of pragmatism is best to have at hand.
<P>
I am approaching the conclusion of my remarks. I was about to commend our amendment to the Committee on the basis that it would make it clear that no representative of a paramilitary organisation could sit on the board until that organisation had begun to decommission its arms in a manner verified by the independent commission under General de Chastelain.
<P>
The amendment would not exclude Sinn Fein or any other party for all time, but the means of lifting the exclusion would be in such parties' own hands in the sense that they could begin establishing their commitment to peace and democracy, showing their commitment to the rule of law, and decommissioning their illegally held arms and explosives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> I shall speak briefly to amendments Nos. 141 and 142, and will explain the details later. We suggest that people who commit offences while serving on the board should be excluded, which is a far cry from what many of the other amendments are designed to do.
<P>
Questions were asked on Second Reading about the extent to which people should be disqualified or excluded from participating in the operations of the police service. Now is the time to take those questions forward. The argument for many of the amendments is clear. The hon. Member for Solihull said that decommissioning should be a consideration, and implied that he believes that people do not have sufficient confidence in the activities of the republican paramilitaries to permit certain individuals, from Sinn Fein, for example, to be involved.
<P>
I apologise to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone for my unavoidable absence when he moved the amendment. It is clear from the amendments that there are those who feel that former terrorists and those convicted of terrorist offences should not be involved. That leads me to two thoughts, both of them on a strategic theme, one on a religious or moral one. First, when will there be sufficient confidence to permit those people to be involved with decommissioning or deactivation? That is a judgment call. Each of us has to make a decision about when we are sufficiently confident to allow them to be involved, in a formal sense, in the policing of Northern Ireland.
<P>
We on the Liberal Democrat Benches are confident; we feel that we have seen enough to make an act of faith. There are others in this Room who have made their position clear-for which we respect them-and feel that there has not been enough movement at this stage. We all agree that we would like the former paramilitaries to decommission completely and that there should not be such unusually large amounts of illegally held weapons in Northern Ireland. In our judgment, enough has happened to make us confident that the Bill should not exclude people for what they have done in the past. History will prove whether that is a good or a bad call.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that I share his aspirations; there is no doubt about that. However, I would be interested to know what he knows that I do not in terms of tangible evidence that the people we are discussing have totally moved away from violence. If I were given one illustration of something tangible, I would understand his point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> I suggest that the hon. Gentleman's knowledge and detailed experience far exceeds mine. I share with him information that the entire Committee has, which includes the statement made by the IRA in May-directly, not through Sinn Fein-with regard to its intention not to obstruct the peace process. It also includes the visible maintenance of a significant ceasefire, which has lasted a long time. That information includes, too, the willingness on the part of republicans to go well beyond what they have said in the past in terms of positive engagement in the process. Circumstantial evidence tells us that the peace is cemented. The good faith of the more moderate individuals in the Republican movement is shown to be cemented by the re-establishment of the Assembly and the fact that they are positively participating in it.
<P>
However, I underline the point made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone that individuals must make the call for themselves. I am not saying that he is wrong in the call that he makes, because to do so would imply that I can see into the future. However, at this point I am sufficiently confident to take the risk-it is a risk of believing that the IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries mean what they say. Furthermore, I make the assumption that, if the peace persists, it will be more difficult for the hardliners in those groups to convince their colleagues to return to the violence of the past. I underline that it is a judgment call-there are no certainties in this kind of politics. In fact, there are no certainties in politics at all. However, in my view, there is sufficient confidence to move forward. That is not a subject on which the hon. Gentleman and I are likely to agree, so we will have to agree to differ. However, I hope that, whether or not he agrees with my judgment, he recognises that it is a legitimate point of view.
<P>
The second point, about who should be disqualified from holding office on the basis of former convictions, is even more crucial to me, and many of the amendments relate directly to it. Some Protestants and some Catholics in Northern Ireland disagree about much, but one thing that they agree about is the existence of God. We must assume that the religious conviction that has caused so much conflict is genuinely and sincerely held, and we must remember all the teaching about forgiveness. We also have to recognise that many of the amendments do not allow for the possible redemption and reformation of individuals in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I do not make those points in a trite way. I was hesitant to make them, but I felt the need to do so because no one else had made them in the House this year. At the nub of what I am saying is the idea that we have to look into our hearts and ask to what extent we believe that people can reform. To what extent do we believe that the disqualification of individuals by the amendments would be unfair because they had genuinely renounced violence? They might genuinely be in a position to play a regenerative rather than passive role in the running of the police in many communities where the police had not had the public's faith.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I recognise my temerity in trespassing on matters of religion, because I am a sinful man and no theologian. As I understand Christian teaching, forgiveness is important but the preface to it is contrition. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> Of course I accept that point, which the hon. Gentleman is right to make. We have a system in this country in which people pay the price for their crimes-it is called going to prison. If we follow through the logic of our penal system, one is presumably judged to have paid the price for one's misdemeanour when one leaves prison. The situation is complicated by the early release of prisoners and so forth. We could get into a rather involved argument on that, and perhaps it will be necessary to do so. Strategically speaking, my judgment is that contrition and prison go together. In this country, we either have to accept that those things go together, at least in large part, even in the special case of Northern Ireland, or we throw into question the entire basis of how we mete out justice.
<P>
I am aware that the points are rather heavy and profound, but they are genuine. I came to think about them only as I considered the amendment. Some people may disagree with what I have said; if so, I shall be interested to hear the logic of their arguments. They may even be able to convince me of their opinions, but I think that unlikely. If they disagree with me, they have to go on to a rather more practical and pragmatic argument. I always think that such arguments are weaker than arguments of principle.
<P>
Those who take a different view on my religious argument, perhaps because of their own religious convictions, should consider a further point. On Second Reading, I asked the hon. Member for Solihull whether he could think of a single person who would be excluded but who could nevertheless play a useful part in the policing of Northern Ireland. In fairness to him, he said that he did not have an encyclopaedic memory and could not at the time think of such a person.
<P>
I see the matter differently. I can think of people, although there is no point in listing their names at length now, who were in trouble with the police but have unquestionably assisted with the progress of implementing the Good Friday agreement. More to the point, they have helped to secure the peace at times when there has been enormous strain, especially in republican communities. I would go further. I think that those people are probably in a fairly strong position to help communities and victims of self-imposed vigilante law enforcement agencies and paramilitary beatings. As thought leaders, such people could help the sort of reform that the Bill is meant to create in Northern Ireland. Once again, that is a matter of judgment, and we all have to consider our experience of people in Northern Ireland. I hope that the Committee agrees that it would be a retrograde step to impose limitations that would disqualify those people from being involved.
<P>
By leaving out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>until the date of the dissolution of the Assembly next,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
amendment No. 124 would disqualify such people from the board not for one or two years, but for ever. I come back not only to the pragmatic point, but to the point of principle. How can we really say that a person can never reform? I should like to think that we all have met people who have reformed; we might even have reformed ourselves to undertake better activities.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment Nos. 141 and 142 would disqualify individuals who commit such offences while serving on the board. That may seem obvious action to take, but, technically, this not stated explicitly in the Bill. As drafted, the Bill could probably exclude such people. The amendments would give those people who have been committed of a scheduled offence a chance to participate, but they would not give them carte blanche to return to their old ways.
<P>
The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee commented on the over-strict eligibility criteria for police officers, and Patten noted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>young people alienated from the police are more likely than others to have had minor run-ins with the police.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Patten commission recommended that, first, people should not be automatically disqualified for relatively minor criminal offences, particularly if a number of years had passed without further transgression. Secondly, it said that the disqualification criteria should be brought in line with other criteria in the United Kingdom and, thirdly, that there must be no pre-disposition to exclude candidates from republican backgrounds. If those criteria are applied to the new policing recruitment arrangements, surely they should apply to the new Policing Board.
<P>
That is why we are proposing that the sanctions should apply to those serving on the board who, if they commit such offences, would be unequivocally unqualified to continue such a role. However, we should adopt a more positive attitude and have faith in those who committed past crimes but who have shown every sign of reforming, The amendment would not give carte blanche to put every Tom, Dick and Harry on to the Policing Board. Eligibility criteria must still be met and decisions be made about who should serve on the board.
<P>
About 15,000 people-and perhaps more-would be excluded from the board if such disqualification criteria were applied at a time when we are trying to build confidence on both sides. I acknowledge that my comments may sit uncomfortably with some members of the Committee, but surely we owe it to ourselves to look at the principle points that are so often lost in our rather heated exchanges. I hope that members of the Committee may consider such matters in a moral and a pragmatic context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull referred to amendments Nos. 159 and 160. I shall comment on them in the light of what I regard as an extraordinary, imaginative and fanciful interpretation of the statement of 6 May as described by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. It must be acknowledged that, under the Belfast agreement, there was no link between prisoner release and decommissioning or between participation in the Executive and decommissioning. My party was accused of cherry-picking when we looked at the Belfast agreement in its entirety and found some parts more favourable than others. I never had problems with that cherry-picking, because I did not accept the agreement and campaigned against it. We now have a third link between membership of the Policing Board and decommissioning, which I strongly support on principled grounds.
<P>
One of the most obscene features of the last x years has been the retreat, compromise and fudge on the issue of decommissioning. Once upon a time, the Government said that all terrorist weapons must be decommissioned before talks could commence. Then, only some of the weapons had to be decommissioned. The ground subsequently shifted, and weapons had to be decommissioned during talks. Then came the next shift-only some of the weapons had to be decommissioned during talks. So it went on. We reached the point at which decommissioning had to take place by May 2000, and, then, only some decommissioning by May 2000. Now, there is none.
<P>
As I read the entrails and the tea leaves, the Provisionals have no intention whatever of decommissioning. It is therefore time to make a stand. In many respects it is too late, but better late than never. Amendments Nos. 159 and 160 contain the clear statement of a link between decommissioning and membership of the Policing Board. That leads naturally to the Ulster Unionist party amendment-amendment No. 111-with which, broadly speaking, amendments Nos. 114 and 121 can be considered, as they touch on the same themes.
<P>
I strongly support sub-paragraph (7), which establishes the principle of disqualification. It states that some people would be inappropriate to be members of the Policing Board. That includes the ombudsman, members of the police support staff, serving officers, and members of district policing partnerships. My argument is that that list of disqualified people is deficient; it should be much longer. Amendment No. 111 addresses that, and expresses the right way to proceed. I would make one concession. The amendment is slightly clumsily worded in one key respect-with regard to bankrupts. Bankruptcy should apply during service rather than be historic. The amendment should have accurately reflected the wording in the Bill in paragraph 4(5)(b).
<P>
It would therefore be inappropriate to press the amendment to a Division, as the precise wording is faulty, but the intention, aspiration, purpose and effect are wholly laudable.
<P>
In reply to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, I can certainly say that I have no objections to repentant sinners or-to use another analogy to poachers who turn gamekeepers. They can play an important and responsible role in society. However, I would argue that the Policing Board is not the place for them. I do not believe that the authority, weight and respect that the board must carry and attract if it is to be a success would be furthered by the presence on it of either former ``ordinary'' criminals or people with terrorist convictions-especially the latter.
<P>
It is reasonable to say that any former terrorist is sometimes open to blackmail and is likely, in some circumstances, to return to serving an old master. Those are the pragmatic arguments; the absolute argument is that it is intolerable that people who may have played a role in the murdering of police officers in their past will have a role within the police service on the board. I assert with some confidence that neither the police nor the public would have confidence in a board that contained ex ``ordinary'' criminals and, especially, people with terrorist convictions.
<P>
The lack of confidence in the new structures that the Bill is creating is the last thing that is required, because those structures must attract, hold and maintain widespread confidence. The presence on the board of ex-terrorists in particular would drastically undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of the new police service and public confidence in it. Their presence on the board would bestow legitimacy on criminal and terrorist activity that is simply not deserved. I have sometimes argued that there are core values that underpin civilised society. They include the absolute rule of law, a system of justice free from political intervention and genuinely accountable democratic structures. My opposition to the Belfast agreement has to a great extent been based on the fact that all those factors are, in my judgment, undermined by it. To have ex-criminals and former terrorists on the Policing Board would be an intolerable development and would greatly undermine confidence in the new police service.
<P>
Finally, I refer to the ``shall'' rather than ``may'' amendments Nos. 112 and 120. Seasoned participants in Standing Committees are all too familiar with the ground covered by that wording, and I suspect that I could draft the reply that the Minister will shortly make on the issue. Governments always argue that they want Secretaries of State to have a degree of flexibility and that trust should be given in their sound judgment. Opposition Members tend not to regard such matters in the same way.
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to move on the issue, although I should be delighted if he did. He knows that the issues are of such sensitivity and importance that there should be no grey areas. We require the absolute and certain knowledge that the Secretary of State will act in a certain way and the only way in which we can be sure of that fact is to have such a provision in the Bill. If a person is convicted of a criminal offence, he is no longer fit to discharge his functions as a member of the board. It should be mandatory for the Secretary of State to remove that person from the board. I support the amendments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull spoke. Furthermore, although the wording may be slightly wrong, I support the principle and intent of the Ulster Unionist amendment No. 111, and urge the Minister-without much hope that I shall succeed-to accept that ``shall'' should replace ``may''.

<P>

<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> I can concur with one point made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will deal with the matter in his usual calm and discreet way, and not give an inch on the amendment. The whole scene, in terms of criminal offences and the board, is almost littered with safeguards, to which the hon. Member for Solihull responded. Indeed, the Government have been criticised in some quarters for the safeguards being too stiff. When we specifically discuss them, I am sure that Opposition Members will not oppose them. The safeguards are helpful and, by and large, necessary.
<P>
When it comes to excluding members of Sinn Fein or anyone else from membership of the board, we shall fail in the act of exclusion. The whole process is one of inclusion, not exclusion. Almost from the moment that people signed up to the Belfast agreement, they have tended to go back on the spirit of it. We have signed up to a new beginning, and the paramount factor with regard to the board is the democratic mandate. We cannot tell an Assembly that nominates according to its own processes that someone can or cannot be a member of the board, especially when other parties in Northern Ireland have signed up to go back to the Assembly and, indeed, are serving in the Administration of Northern Ireland with Sinn Fein, For goodness sake, if a person can be a Minister of Education or a social security Minister in Northern Ireland, yet cannot, by way of a democratic mandate, be a member of a Policing Board and part of a gross minority on that authority anyway, the board will not work. The spirit of Opposition Members is disappointing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull said that he will listen to my right hon. Friend the Minister when safeguards are discussed. I am sorry that my former party supports such an amendment. It is profoundly unhelpful. By some miracle, if the amendment were accepted, it would have a grievous effect on the process that we want to succeed, as well as on devolution. I am surprised that the major parties cannot achieve greater unity and drive through a peace process that was, after all, begun by my former party. I know that there are differences in the Conservative party-indeed, in my time, I was party to those differences. That is why I feel comfortable sitting on this side of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, if someone were to emerge from paramilitary organisations, be they loyalist or republican, of the stature of Nelson Mandela, it would be foolish to preclude that person from playing an active part in the governance of Northern Ireland, including the police force?
<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his admirable intervention. Although we cannot claim as yet, certainly on the paramilitary side, that there is a person of the stature of Nelson Mandela, I am confident in saying the amendment would ban elements that have played a considerable part in persuading the IRA not only to create, but to maintain the two ceasefires. I am grateful that I have been given an opportunity to make that point.
<P>
I dare say that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North will deal with the Bill's safeguards when it comes to convictions. However, I shall point out that, as a safeguard on the Policing Board, the Chief Constable can block sensitive or confidential information. If necessary, he can bring the Secretary of State on to his side to block it as well. In addition, no one is saying that the board will be riddled with terrorists. The way in which we are talking about it, people would think that the whole IRA was to line up to be on it. There will be a maximum of a few representatives of Sinn Fein on the board, possibly two from the Assembly. They will be a contained minority, and may not be former paramilitaries anyway.
<P>
The issue is about inclusivity. There are safeguards, and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will resist the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I shall be brief; I think that I shall have to be, because my voice is rapidly disappearing, probably as a result of excessive proximity to my four-year-old son over the past few days. He seems to be suffering from a similar complaint. Alternatively, I suppose that it may be a result of excessive proximity to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, who seems to have a similar problem, but I would not want to suggest that.
<P>
I confess that it is difficult, perhaps because of the shortness of time in which we had to table the amendments, to make the different possibilities open to the Committee clear in the amendments. I start with a basic point that I made on Second Reading that has always troubled me. I accept that it is no reason not to try, but it is unfortunate that we are considering the Bill when there has been no decommissioning. If ever there were a central plank to reassure the community that a corner had been turned, making acceptable what had previously been unacceptable, it would be that. The Patten report envisaged that decommissioning would be taking place. One of the reasons why the response to it was so hostile in many respects was the strength of the feeling that its proposals came when nothing much seemed to have changed on that central issue.
<P>
On the question of the board's membership, I accept the clear distinction between political and independent appointed members. We may not like it, but if it appears that the page has been turned, acceptance of the principle that elected representatives with an unsavoury past could participate in the board, by being elected by virtue of the d'Hondt formula, should be lived with although it makes people uncomfortable.
<P>
Nevertheless, there is the problem of whether decommissioning will have started. I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Malins, if I speak briefly to amendment No. 158, which has not been selected. It was designed to tackle the problem as part of the package, although in retrospect I think that it may not have been as felicitously drafted as it should have been. Its object was to try to ensure that political members, although welcome, would be welcome only as and when the process was under way. We all wait and hope that it will start quickly.
<P>
Once that has happened, I shall have no objection to there being political members on the board whose pasts include criminal offences. To take up the point made by the hon. Member for Leominster, one has to assume that they may be in the Nelson Mandela category, which would be a clear sign and reassurance to others that the eschewing of violence was the intention. At the moment, however, we do not have that.
<P>
We now come to the appointed members. I am bound to say that I feel much less comfortable with the position being presented. I accept that a time may come when it would be acceptable to allow political appointed members by the Secretary of State with pasts such as are referred to in the amendments. However, considering the issues of good governance, I doubt whether that time has yet arrived. I would prefer our amendments to be accepted and, with the passage of time, the Bill to be amended to reflect changed circumstances.
<P>
Ultimately, Governments are responsible for good governance, and the Secretary of State will make appointments on the basis of confidence in the people involved Especially in the absence of decommissioning, it is a little difficult to understand how the Secretary of State could have such confidence in someone with a terrorist past-who are the only people covered-in the absence of substantial change. I do not want to introduce a series of amendments designed merely to create more tension. My anxiety, for which we have good reason, is that, unless such safeguards are provided, the Bill will get off to a bad start, especially if it comes into force without decommissioning having started.
<P>
I look forward to hearing from the Minister whether he believes that the Government could properly take away and explore any aspects. Several distinct amendments are involved, and the group should not necessarily be considered as a whole. On the issue of appointments made by the Secretary of State, I find it difficult to envisage how, in the current climate, the Secretary of State could appoint the people whom we are trying to exclude in amendment No. 161.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> I shall concentrate on amendment No. 111 and respond to the points made by the hon. Members for West Tyrone and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. To repeat the point that I made earlier, which I believe that they accepted, in relation to bankruptcy, under proposed sub-paragraph (c)(ii), the amendment would be far more strict in its result than the hon. Gentlemen intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Perhaps I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind and that of the hon. Member for Basingstoke at rest. Having examined the amendment, a mistake has been made in the drafting. The amendment was intended to relate to a non-discharged bankrupt, rather than someone who has been bankrupt. I accept that an error has been made in the drafting, which may set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> It is extremely reasonable of the hon. Gentleman to have reconsidered the amendment in those terms. On that basis, I ask the hon. Members to consider the wording of sub-paragraph c(i). I do not necessarily recognise the status of the hon. Member for West Tyrone who has been referred to by his hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone as a Methodist lay preacher. Neither would I want to follow the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire down the line of theological argument because we should be focusing on legal argument.
<P>
The Committee has been discussing extremes with the hon. Member for Basingstoke talking about terrorist murderers and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) mentioning a Nobel peace prize winner. I would rather look at totally different category of people, a more ordinary category.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment is based on paragraphs 4(5) and 9(1), which say that the Secretary of State may remove somebody with a criminal conviction from the board. However, they do make allowances for the fact that there might be circumstances where it would be inappropriate to do so. It is not difficult to consider what those circumstances might be. The paragraphs apply to a far wider range of convictions than is registered in the amendment. They apply to any criminal conviction. The amendment applies only to criminal convictions that could have resulted in a prison sentence or a suspended prison sentence. What should happen when somebody was convicted of an offence and given a prison sentence or a suspended prison sentence-possibly nothing to do with terrorism-when they were a juvenile? Years later they have perhaps shown-I do not use this in a theological way-all the contrition that the hon. Member for Solihull would demand. What would happen if the amendment was passed? The amendment does not say ``may'', it states that ``A person is disqualified''? Is that the intention, or is it the intention to allow something to be taken into consideration, but not necessarily regarded as an absolute disqualification? Against that background, I urge the withdrawal of the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Pound </B>(Ealing, North): It is a warm June evening in London. It is dangerous to concentrate more on the mechanisms of the mother of all parliaments and the system of legislation within this building than the realities of society and life in the Province. Some of the fine constitutional theory may echo and resonant within this building, but, with respect, it will count for little in parts of the six counties.
<P>
An assumption has been made that there exists in the six counties a group of people who have been untouched by the troubles and who have been waiting to take part in the process, whether on the boards, the commissions or the partnerships. There is an assumption that those people have managed somehow to keep quiet for 30 years, but were all the time ready to step forward with clean hands, with no past, no record and no involvement in the troubles. In reality, those people do not exist. That is the cruel, bitter reality-the painful reality.
<P>
We have talked about people like Mandela and Menachem Begin. Menachem Begin would have been hung if the British Army had caught him in the late 1940s. He was a self-confessed member of a group, the Stern gang, who murdered British soldiers in the King David hotel. When the war is over-and I repeat the words of Gerry Adams, ``The war is over''-we have two choices. Either we say, no, the war is not over, and we go back to blood and battle, or we take that terrible, agonisingly painful leap of faith and move forward. The right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) started this process, for which I give him credit, but he was unable to sustain the necessary momentum. He set in place the building bricks and blocks, but could not build the edifice because the momentum was lacking. We must have momentum, because if we do not, we will have regression.
<P>
I believe in redemption, but I might be a little more pragmatic than some hon. Members. It is a central tenet of my faith, but I have also spent a fair bit of time in practical, street-level politics. What sort of person would eschew violence and join one of the boards, commissions or partnerships if he or she did not have a commitment to peace? If such people were still wedded to violence, they would stay where they were. I accept that some people on both sides of this agonising and draining conflict in Northern Ireland are in it for the most venal, vicious and bloodthirsty reasons, and that some of them are nothing but gangsters. I cannot deny that, but I contend that the majority of people who are involved in what we tritely refer to as terrorism would never have been involved in any criminal act if they had lived in any other society than the one in which they were born. Society in the Six Counties, certainly since the late 1960s, has been such as to make normal life and existence a theoretical concept rather than a reality or something that resembles life as we know it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The hon. Gentleman should remember that we are discussing a population of 1.5 million, the vast majority of whom have never committed any offence or been imprisoned. Only a small minority of these people have been to prison and have committed terrible offences. As they have committed those offences, surely it is only natural for them to be excluded from the board?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his remark, but I respectfully suggest that it makes my point for me. One of the many admirable things about society in Northern Ireland is that it is a law-abiding, good and Christian society with a strong sense of community. That is precisely my point. What is it that takes men and women from this society and makes them do the things that have been described tonight and which fill many of us with horror? Let us leave aside the small group who are verging on the psychopathic. If the majority of these people were driven not by a sense of injustice or by a need to defend themselves, they were motivated by a recognition that they lived in a society that was unsustainable in its terms of power and strength. At the risk of bathos, I point out that the reason why they became involved is generally comparable to the circumstances of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
<P>
I referred to Cathal Crumley, now Lord Mayor of Derry, who was convicted of membership of the Irish Republican Army, for which I think he served a sentence of four years. Can we not see the example that is provided by someone who has what we refer to in the demotic of west London as street cred and who has come away from that world and out into the other world, which has a future? The example that that man will show on the streets of the Bogside cannot be bought. No amount of speeches in this building, gestures or legislation can ever convince the potential teenage terrorist that there is a future in the institutions of legality if he or she has a role model who is pointing in the other direction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made a series of good points. He may be aware of people who are prevented from obtaining jobs by spent offences. I have been visited by constituents who are prevented from getting a job 15 or 20 years after they have committed their offences, because the nature of the job means that they must declare their offence, even though it is spent. The Secretary of State has said that he would object to former paramilitaries serving in the police. Where should the line be drawn between allowing the participation of previously convicted terrorists and preventing that from happening?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> The hon. Gentleman brings to the table an extensive and possibly expensive legal education, which I cannot begin to match. I suggest that my earlier point about the reasons-the mens rea-why the crime was committed was the key issue We are not considering a sexual offences register of paedophiles but people who did extraordinary things in extraordinary circumstances. Despite what the hon. Gentleman says, we are not discussing people who took a career decision to rob or who followed a crude emotion to commit crime. That would be different. I say for the second time that, in the majority of cases, the people who participated in the troubles committed crimes because they felt that they were active in a response to the troubles and that that was the only way open to them. There was no democratic mechanism to right what they and most reasonable people saw as a wrong.
<P>
As I have said before, I mean absolutely no disrespect to right hon. and hon. Members representing seats in Northern Ireland. God knows I am aware of how easy it is for me from a west London perspective to urge you to enter a legislative system with people who have been enemies.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he must not urge the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I apologise, Mr. Malins. Emotions have run understandably high on the issue. One of the strongest emotions that I feel is the need to apologise to members of the Committee representing constituencies in the north of Ireland because it is easy for me to make suggestions. It is perhaps necessary for those of us who can maintain a little objectivity in the matter to highlight the only way forward. Were we to follow amendments Nos. 159 and 160, we would be guaranteed to have Major part 2. There would be a road block and an end to the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. McWalter:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that getting nationalists of all political persuasions on to the policing boards would be a considerable achievement and would mark a radical change in policing in Northern Ireland? Nothing could more secure the prospects of getting an inclusive policing system than the Bill achieving that effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> One of the most important things that we must do is make exactly that point. That is why we will refer repeatedly to that question, which was raised on Second Reading, in the long hours and nights that lie ahead of us in Committee. We must address the concerns of the Catholic hierarchy, of the SDLP and of the many other groups that represent 48 per cent. of the population in the north of Ireland and that are unable to give a commitment.
<P>
I do not wish to continue except to say something that I thought that I would never say. I would like to endorse wholeheartedly the comments of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, who is unfortunately in deep conversation with the Government Whip. I hope that he will accept in absentia my support for his comments. I voice my opposition to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In the comparatively short time that I have known the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound), I have never doubted his integrity or sincerity and I do not do so now. However, I sometimes feel when I listen to him that his enthusiasm, emotion and justifiable partisanship overcome his patently good common sense. He has supported his argument at an early stage on the almost throwaway phrase that Gerry Adams told us that the war was over. I am afraid that Mr. Adams has never told us that and neither has the mayor of Londonderry. Many people are gasping for progress in Northern Ireland. They want to see evidence that takes us beyond political considerations and towards the organisation and conduct of society in Northern Ireland. As the hon. Gentleman would probably suggest, the matter is not exclusively a political one.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talks about people who would not have been led astray were it not for this, that or the other. He asks why they have been led astray, and the answer is that they were brought up on a diet of late 19th century nationalism that is out of date in the late 20th and early 21st century. That is the greater part of the reason why they became involved in terrorism. A tribal hatred inculcated their whole being, and prompted people from both traditions to murder each other and innocent civilians. We must remember that it is not just soldiers and policemen who have been killed. Many ordinary innocent civilians from both traditions have been gunned down or blown to pieces by terrorists. Those ordinary innocent people, to whom my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone alluded, form the greater part of the 1.7 million people in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ealing, North should ask himself why my four children grew up to be normal. They grew up with me as a father. I was a member of the Ulster Special Constabulary, which is better known as the B-men, and the Ulster Defence Regiment. I became involved in Unionist politics at the comparatively late age of 43, but I was always a convinced Unionist. Against that background, why did my four children grow up to be normal? Why did the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh turn out to be deputy leader of the SDLP and a Member of Parliament, rather than a terrorist-a member of Sinn Fein? The reality is that people had a choice, and the majority knew what choice they were making. It is against that background that we must make realistic judgments.
<P>
It is not a question of lacking forgiveness. If one lacked forgiveness, one Oke would not sit on district councils, assemblies and elsewhere with these people. It is a question of expectation. One must ask oneself, ``Is it not possible that someone who has been attached throughout his life to conspiracy, violence and overthrowing the institutions of law and order has not lost that desire?'' It would not matter if only one such person were among the 19 who make up the Policing Board-one out of 19 could spell disaster for Northern Ireland and what all the other good people there are trying to achieve.
<P>
We made a mistake with the drafting of amendment No. 111, but we shall return to that later. When we consider proposed new paragraph (c)(i) in the amendment, we should ask whether those parts of society that represent different political aspirations from mine can propose people who do not have a record of murder and mayhem. It is inconceivable that, in setting up a policing board in Great Britain, one would make a specific accommodation to enable one to recruit a godfather of the drugs trade, or of any other mafia or criminal activity.

<P>

<B>Mr. Oùpik:</B> That would be to presume that drug dealing is indistinguishable from the political violence in which some of the individuals that we are discussing have engaged. Does the hon. Gentleman draw any distinction between the kinds of violence that scheduled offence criminals in Northern Ireland have committed and those in the example that he has just given for the mainland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made his point and I accept it for what it is worth.
<P>
The greater number of people in society, whatever their political aspirations, abide by the rule of law. There are enough of them in Northern Ireland to fulfil the requirement for 19 individuals on the Policing Board a thousand times over. I do not believe that we have to bring lawbreakers on to the board. I do make the distinction, for the benefit of those who draw a meaningless comparison with Nelson Mandela. I do not repudiate the theory behind what they say, but in practice we have not had that movement forward for which the majority have created accommodation.
<P>
Entry to the Assembly, which some of us were against in some cases, is not a free ticket that will take its Members anywhere. It is not an all-embracing round-the-world trip enabling Members to sit on any authority or any board, just because they have a ticket that takes them into the Assembly. The Assembly is a staging post for transition, for metamorphosis, and for moving people from violence into a democratic process.
<P>
The Assembly has a huge amount to achieve before one can begin to take those people and put them on a policing board. They must prove beyond any doubt that their interfacing with policing is for genuine purposes and for the good of society, and not to further a political ambition by whatever means. I am aware that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh is concerned that I may go on for some time-he has a good right to be concerned, because, on this matter, I could go on for some considerable time. However, I am aware of the pressures on his time, and if he would like me to sit down, perhaps I could beg your indulgence, Mr. Malins, and ask to be called again later.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know that the rules are fluid and that Chairmen are permitted to call Committee members who catch their eye, and they may speak without limit, so long as their remarks are within order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> With that firm assurance, Mr. Malins, I shall sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his magnanimous decision to allow me a few moments to speak-I shall be brief.
<P>
I have listened to the speeches of hon. Members from both sides. No logic can be applied that could resolve the arguments for or against the proposal. Logic and the usual slide rules and measures can be used to construct a fine argument one might even convince oneself-but they are not adequate because Northern Ireland is in a remarkable position.
<P>
This is probably-I stress that word-the last Standing Committee that will consider legislation that will directly affect Northern Ireland. Perhaps that shows us where we stand. The hon. Member for West Tyrone should not misinterpret that-he appears to be gathering himself together in an effort to do so. Institutional decisions and the Bill's provisions will, I hope, soon become the preserve of Northern Ireland institutions, as should many other matters. We are at a remarkable crossroads.
<P>
One could, perhaps, assess the proposal in moral terms. Various definitions of morality could be applied one could be the good guy and say, ```Forgiveness is mine,' saith the Lord.'' I am not given to religious matters. Alternatively, one could say that justice must run its full course. Both views are right, of course, in their own way, but neither of them is adequate. Morality could be measured by the good practices of a society that has not had similar experiences to those of Northern Ireland. I cannot imagine such things happening in the leafy suburbs of Beckenham or Dublin. I understand why it happened in the north of Ireland.
<P>
I want to pose one or two questions for myself and for other Committee members Sometimes, it appears that we, the people who live in the north of Ireland, came from Mars or somewhere else and decided to be unruly for 80-odd years. Have any decisions that were taken in the House had an effect on what happened in Northern Ireland?
<P>
Has Unionism-I mean corporate Unionism-ever, by commission or omission, had effect on what happened in the north of Ireland? Did the position of what is now known as the Republic of Ireland in the 1920s have an effect on what happened in the north of Ireland?
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If we say that none of those things apply, we must be living in a strange world. If we say that we are all collectively and corporately-responsible for what happened, to a greater or lesser extent, then the moral issue starts to recede. The political righteousness-a genuine political righteousness-does not stand up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> The hon. Gentleman forgot to mention the SDLP.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman would get to that. I shall reserve a few minutes, before I finish, for that important point. That topic seems to consume the hon. Gentleman; he has an interest in it that I find difficult to understand.
<P>
We are all responsible for what happened. We are not absolved just because a different generation made the decisions or had direct responsibility. We are all guilty in some way for what has happened-not just Unionism, nationalism, republicanism or loyalism, but to that body of 1.5 million people that lives in that little bit of the island. Had the decision in 1921 or 1922 been different, would it all have happened? It might have; it might not.
<P>
When I am tempted to make moral judgments about anything, especially in this context, I say clearly to myself, ``There, but for the grace of God, might go I''. There, but for the grace of God, might have gone anyone, during that trauma. In particular, that applies to young people, especially those who did not have many of the great advantages in life, who were corralled into unemployment or into environmentally deprived areas and put into a disadvantaged education system. And we wonder why they do not have the same admiration for our way of life as others.
<P>
I come from the republican background. I know it, inside and out. I know it through my family and community; I know it within myself. Had I been at a vulnerable age, when the current phase began in 1968-69, where might I have gone? The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone paid me a compliment. He said that I was normal-like to think that I am, although I will not swear to it-but I cannot put my hand on my heart and say where I might have gone. Young people in the nationalist community had no escape hatches. They could not join the B Specials, the police or what became the UDR. They did, remarkably, join the British Army-in great numbers; it was the only source of employment open to them. That is an interesting case study.
<P>
When we make moral judgments or value judgments of the type that people inevitably make, we should all remember that, if we are to change where we live, there are risks attached to it and difficult questions to be answered. It is the net result that will count.
<P>
We have heard much talk about those with convictions. Let me pose a value judgment. A young guy of 16 gets involved, gets a prison sentence, goes off to prison, serves his time and comes out with the tattoos and the mythology of prison, but there is another guy who has never had a conviction in his life, who has spent the past 30 years planning for all those young people to be in prison and organising the racketeering and gangsterism that exist. Which of them am I most worried about-the guy with the tattoos on his arm or the fellow with no convictions? My mind is made up on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not want to repeat what the hon. Member has said, but he makes a good point. The reality is that the system being put in place is likely to sift out the fellow without the convictions. If the fellow with the convictions has made enough friends politically, he will get through the system. That is part of the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> That is true up to a point, but the people of Northern Ireland are no fools, whatever else they may be. They will know exactly what is going on around them.
<P>
We also know the risks involved in this and any other system that will solve the problem. But if we follow a course that does not draw a line in the sand, what is the logic of any of the other decisions that we have made? What is the logic of the Good Friday agreement? What is the logic of the institutions that were part of it? What is the logic of this debate today? What is the logic of the north-south arrangements? What is the logic of the British-Irish Council? What is the logic of the Joint Ministerial Council? They all stem from the same central philosophy: if we are ever to solve this problem, we must seize it at its roots and move from there. Roots will go in all directions, but the plant will not last unless we take those risks.
<P>
I understand perfectly how people feel about this. I understand the genuineness of their feelings. I understand especially the position of Unionists. Yeats once wrote
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Too long a sacrifice
Can make a stone of the heart.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That applies to everybody; it applies across the board. However, ultimately, the brave people, the courageous people, the patriots, if one wants to use that word-it is a terrible word-will be the people in the north of Ireland who can make this leap of faith into that beginning. Their imagination and courage will outlast the macho elements of paramilitarism and the so-called patriots. That is what will see them down, not emergency legislation or anything else.
<P>
That, I believe, is what is at stake here; that, I believe, is what has underlined the basic tenets of Patten's recommendations; and that, I believe, is what we should be looking at and developing, instead of allowing excuses to be made.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Tyrone has again shown his consuming interest in the small political party to which I belong. I am glad of that: I think that it is a compliment. He made a point last week in relation to this issue. I said to him then, ``Test us. Get this right, and I and my party will show that we want policing probably more than anybody else. We want to defend it, we want to support it, we want to join it and we want it to make it a way of life in our community for the first time. Put us to the test. Don't leave excuses for anybody.''
<P>
There are those who are looking for excuses, and will be looking for excuses. Hon Members know some of them. At least our small political party comes to the Committee, tables its amendments and tries to convince people about them, puts its case, goes on to the Floor of the House and makes its point. It is a great luxury to walk into the Palace of Westminster, hold a press conference and leave. That is not how this problem will be solved. I do not want to leave any luxury on this issue for anybody, be they Unionist, nationalist, republican or loyalist. I want to put everybody to the test, and this is the acid test. I believe that we can make this acid test work if we screw our courage to the sticking-place and make it work.
