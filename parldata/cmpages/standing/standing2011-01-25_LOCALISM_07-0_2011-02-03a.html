Member for Greenwich and Woolwich raised the pertinent issue of
charging being restricted to the territorial sea of the United Kingdom
or otherwise. I have written to him today, and I have ensured that
copies of the letter are available on the table. My letter confirms the
prescience of the observation of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor
View; the measure is designed to reflect provisions in the Fire and
Rescue Services Act 2004, so that the regimes are the same. It will
cover not only the channel tunnel, but oil rigs and structures such as
lighthouses that might be just beyond the territorial limit but could
be reached by coastguard or other boats, if they required the
assistance of the fire
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000029">&#160;</a>

                           </span> It is a pleasure
to be back in Committee Room 12 for a second day, for the seventh
sitting of this Committee. The Law Society has expressed concern about
whether “closed mind” is the right term to use in
subsection (1)(b). The Law Society feels that the benefit of
the clause could be eroded if an individual expresses a view on
development and is later perceived to have had a closed mind. That
would make an individual susceptible to challenge, and I do not think
any of us want councillors to be challenged on such issues. Will the
Minister consider tabling an amendment to correct that wording, if it
is
problematic?<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000035">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have listened to the hon. Lady, and I will take
the point on board, but we do not believe that the wording is
problematic. Lawyers are like economists: if there are enough of them
in a room, there will be a number of varying opinions. However, I do of
course take the view of the Law Society seriously, and we will consider
it. I get the sense from the hon. Lady’s observation that the
objective of the clause is accepted by Members on both sides of the
room, and given that, I hope that the clause may stand part as it is.
If there is a difficulty,  I will happily speak to the Law

definition of “relevant authority”. My constituency has a
unitary council, and subsection (4) mentions a “county borough

                           </strong> The provision mirrors the standard terminology.
Although we have defined unitary councils, if we look at other
enactments, we see that unitary councils are frequently referred to in
legislation as district or other councils. That does not create any
problems, as I understand it. I assure my hon. Friend that the clause
covers all authorities, including unitary authorities, which have the
functions of borough or county councils. She

                           </div>can rest assured that the rule will apply to unitary councils as much as
to any other councils, not least because my interest in the subject was
prompted by the difficulties my wife had when she was a member of a
unitary authority and found that she was constrained when raising
issues on behalf of her
constituents.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000040">&#160;</a>

like a clear analysis, and it also seems clear that many instances of
misconduct will now probably go without remedy. Taking the instance
that I gave earlier of the councillor in my constituency, he was
re-elected after a three-year ban from public life, because there was
enough support for his party for that to happen. Within no time, there
were further complaints and another case of misconduct, this time
against a policewoman. So the ballot box is no guaranteed remedy for
the public against
misconduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000058">&#160;</a>

evidence that I have seen is that councils use codes of conduct to
address points of debate, not conduct. In a case recently in my unitary

any real point of conduct, but on a point of debate. The whole case
cost something in the order of £25,000, which is a colossal
waste of public money. I very much welcome the clause, which will

have just heard? The inference of the hon. Gentleman’s comments
is that it does not matter if there are breaches of standards, or if
councillors behave in an inappropriate way, and that that should simply
be left for the council to decide. The amendment aims to ensure that
there is a code in every local authority area. The danger here is the
pendulum. We know perfectly well that before the creation of the
Standards Board there were many cases and complaints about thoroughly
unsatisfactory standards of conduct in local government, involving
criminal activity in some cases, with police intervention being
necessary in certain instances. In other cases, there was bullying and
utterly inappropriate conduct and behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000063">&#160;</a>

criticisms that have been made, the advent of the Standards Board and
the standards regime has helped to improve standards in local
government. I understand the view that the majority of Conservative
Members have expressed, which is that the Standards Board was unduly
prescriptive, and that a less centralised regime is necessary. I do not
understand, and I certainly do not support, any suggestion that a
recognised code of standards should not exist in every local authority.
The argument that that should be left to local discretion opens the
door to precisely the kinds of problems and abuse that existed in the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000064">&#160;</a>

the Government believe that enacting this legislation with that
permissive power for local authorities to decide whether they want

deluding themselves. That will be a green light to certain authorities
and public representatives. We are talking about a minority, and I do
not want to overstate the case, but unfortunately people transgress and
behave inappropriately in public life, in organisations including local
government. If they believe that they can do what they like and get
away with it, and that no pressure will be put on them—possibly
because they come from a majority party in a local authority and
believe that their leader and chief whip will cover up any allegations
of misconduct against them—we are opening the door to a
thoroughly dangerous and unsatisfactory situation that many of us
thought we had eradicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000065">&#160;</a>

cannot take that lightly or see it simply as a matter of localism and
devolution. Certain principles should be upheld in public life at all
levels, and it is our responsibility as a Parliament to ensure that the

consistent course. In general, as I have said, I do not like
“musts” for local authorities, except for a “must
disclose.” I would much prefer there to be a
“may,” which could also be a “may not.” A
“may” is appropriate in the basic rules for how an
authority operates. The Opposition’s argument is inconsistent
when it comes to clause 16(5); what is the value in saying that an
authority must have a code of conduct, but may or may not publicise it?
If it must have a code, surely it must publicise it. Later on, there
will be other “may” and “must” discussions
to be had. The duty to disclose what the authority is doing is
imperative to protect the electors and to ensure that the council is
being run in an appropriate
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000067">&#160;</a>

Although it is small, changing “may” to
“must” in relation to the adoption of a voluntary code of
conduct makes a large difference to the establishment of a benchmark
standard across the country. We have made great strides forward in
conduct and codes, and it would be unwise to row back from that. I hear
the arguments of the hon. Member for Bradford East, and they are well
put, in that if one moves from “must” to
“may”, one should at least ensure transparency and ensure
a “must” in terms of publicising where one is, because
that will encourage local authorities to adopt voluntary codes of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000068">&#160;</a>

whether there is a code. The code gives everybody a clear standard on
what they should be doing. In my role as leader of a council, it would
have been helpful to have a code, because it would have been something
that everybody could refer to, that was transparent and open and that

issue that the amendment raises is what the legal statutory obligation
on a local authority should be when it comes to monitoring and
responding to breaches of good behaviour by its members. I remind the
Committee that there is, for example, no statutory requirement on a
local authority to have a code of conduct for its employees; as a
matter of course, however, all local authorities do. Good practice is,
in fact, universal on that point, but there is no statutory guidance
framework. The Government therefore believe that if a local authority
wants to adopt its own code of conduct, it should be free to do so. It
is almost inconceivable that authorities will not adopt one, as has
been found in the case of a policy for
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000071">&#160;</a>

indeed, bullying by councillors of anybody who is in a situation of

their position as an employee. The employer—the council or the
police service, for instance—has a legal duty to provide
employees with a safe system of work. Allowing a situation to arise
where an employee is subject to bullying or harassment would be a
breach of that

there is an alternative route of redress—in this case through
employment legislation—there is absolutely no need for a code.
If you take that argument the whole way, there is no need for any code
of standards whatever, because acting unlawfully would result in the
possibility of criminal conviction. So a councillor who defrauds his
authority does not need a code on standards of probity, because there
is an alternative criminal route for remedy against him. That argument
seems completely absurd. We are talking about
standards—standards in public life and in local government. If
the Minister is seriously suggesting that other remedies are available
and that there is no need for any statement of standards, he is arguing
a case that very few members of the public would think was in the least
bit credible.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000080">&#160;</a>

made it clear that I think that local authorities will, as a matter of
course, have a code. I remind him that nearly all local authorities had
a code before it was a mandatory, statutory requirement, so I do not
want him to erect a false argument and try to jam it down my throat.

missed the political nature of the councillor’s role, as opposed
to the employee’s role, which is governed by the usual codes of
conduct that are part of an employment contract and the disciplinary

me point out to him what I think will appear on the record: he said
that there should be an objective external body. The amendment is about
whether an authority should have a code itself, not whether there

of the amendment, but perhaps when he spoke about an external body he
deployed an argument that took him beyond where he intended to go. The
point I want to make clearly to the Committee is that we trust local
government to manage its own affairs. We trust it, as the Labour
Government did, to manage its affairs in relation to employees, and we
trust it on the management of the behaviour of councillors.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000087">&#160;</a>

pick up on a couple of points made by other hon. Members. I look
forward with real anticipation to the contributions of my hon. Friend
the Member for Bradford East to the debate, and I hope that there will
be an occasion when one side or the other gets something right. We will
see what we can do about that. His point about “may” and
“must” in clause 16, in which an authority that has a
code may publicise it, is interesting, and I will certainly consider it
at some point. I think he has described himself as a localist
fundamentalist, so I hope that he agrees that on this occasion, and on
the amendment, the Government have got it right.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Worsley and Eccles South raised a point about the impact
assessment. The Bill is large and complex and, of course, impacts arise
from many of the provisions. We have gone to considerable lengths to
ensure that the impact assessments are substantial and thorough and,
more to the point, that the interaction between different provisions is
taken
properly<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000089">&#160;</a>

long time ago, but with a large, complex Bill, we ought to aim for
thoroughness rather than speed in the impact
assessments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000090">&#160;</a>

have looked at the impact assessments and a number of them are full of
empty tables; where there are supposed to be figures, there are none.
They look like a rushed job, put out on Monday even though they were
not finished. It is an insult to the Committee to put out 30 documents
on the eve of a sitting, when we should have had time to prepare. As I
will keep saying, there was no reason to rush the Bill out and into
Committee before it was ready. We hardly had any time between Second
Reading and Committee; we could have been given a few weeks. If the
impact assessments were not ready, it would have been a courtesy to
give Committee members more

                           </strong> It occurs to me that the clause seems to cover the

members and are covered by the same provisions. I could speak on
another point for a minute or two while the scribblers confirm that. My
clear understanding is that elected mayors, legally speaking, are
members of the authority and are therefore fully covered.

That is an important distinction, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Stalybridge and Hyde was right to draw. We must not blur codes of
conduct as they apply to staff—important as they are—with
codes of conduct for political leaders. MPs have a code of conduct,
which I am sure most of us believe is very important given everything
that has happened recently. In addition, we take an oath, and the code
of conduct links to that. I thank my right hon. and hon. Friends for
supporting the argument that we are making for the amendment, which is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I say to the
hon. Member for Bradford East, who seemed torn between opinions on the
matter, that we must think about local people and the staff of a local
authority that has bullying and abusive councillors. In my
constituency, I had a bullying and abusive councillor, and the ballot
box was not a remedy. He was re-elected, got back into the same
position and had to be banned from public life again for another
period. The provision is not too much to ask for; it is a small
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister is so sure that every local authority will continue to have a
code of conduct, why not allow this small amendment? I am particularly
thinking about those people whose experiences of bullying and
misconduct

			Column number: 291<a class="bkMark" name="Column291">&#160;</a>
                           </div>make up 30% of the cases. We have supported all the other measures in
the section of the Bill relating to standards, but we feel that there
absolutely must be a code of
conduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, the Minister is rather naive if he thinks that the remedies
he has talked about, particularly for local authority staff, against a
council’s political leadership are realistic. There is a very
unequal power relationship in that regard, which is why people in
public and political life have to adhere to higher standards. In
councils across the country, more than 100,000 people are waiting to
hear whether they still have a job and whether they will keep their job
over the coming months and years. That situation will carry on this
year and next year.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000098">&#160;</a>

doing away with 1,500 jobs and Manchester is having to cut 2,000 jobs.
Will those people who are waiting to hear about their jobs really bring
remedies against the people who will decide whether they keep their
jobs? That is a very unequal relationship and local authority staff
need the protection of knowing that there is a proper code of
conduct.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000099">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have two questions about the clause. As I said
earlier, the current standards regime is being replaced by either
criminal offences for serious misconduct —for example,
abusing a councillor’s position for personal gain—or
complaints to the local government ombudsman. It seems obvious,
following the debate that we have just had, that the local government
ombudsman will take the brunt of the cases that would have been
referred to the standards system. What is the Department for
Communities and Local Government’s estimate of the increase in
work, and what resources are expected to stem from that
change?<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
Mayor of London has commented that, under the Bill, standards, duties
and powers will be a matter solely for the London assembly. The Mayor
feels that such a regime should be shaped by the Mayor as well as the
assembly, because the Mayor will be subject to the
regime. The question of how such things cover mayors is important, so
do the Government propose to amend the Bill so that the Mayor of London
and  the assembly will be jointly responsible for shaping the
regime?<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000131">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will do my best to respond to the hon.
Lady’s questions, but if she wants further information, I may
have to come back to the Committee with it. First, I reassure the
Committee that, as we discussed in the previous debate, mayors are
covered by the Bill—they are not excluded. However, there is a
specific point in relation to London as to who has the ownership, or
guardianship, of the code. That will be in the hands of the London
assembly, which may not give the Mayor what he wants in terms of
participation in the code. Representations have been made on the
matter, which we will consider and come back to in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the local government ombudsman, the hon. Lady may want to take time to
look at the impact assessment, which assesses the additional costs that
will be transferred from the system that we are abolishing to the new
arrangements. Once she has looked at that, I will be happy to respond,
either in writing or in Committee, to any further queries that she
might
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000133">&#160;</a>

that, as is the case with many of the organisations being discontinued,
the abolition of the Standards Board will be expensive this year. Will
the Minister write to me—and copy in the Committee—with
this year’s costs of getting rid of the board, and with the
estimated increase for the local government
ombudsman?<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000134">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In the debate on the last clause, the Minister
set out his view that it was unnecessary to require local authorities
to have a code of conduct because they would all choose to have one in
any case. I hope that that is the case, but of course we are left with
the question of what happens if they do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
we come to this clause, however, the Government appear to adopt a
different logic. They are not saying that it is up to local authorities
to decide whether they have arrangements that require a declaration of
interests. Instead, the Secretary of State may determine through an
order whether particular interests should be declared. That is
inconsistent with the view adopted in the previous clause, and I hope
that Ministers will explain why, having said clearly that they trust
local authorities to develop their own codes, they do not trust them to
have procedures for declaring interests, and why the Secretary of State
has to intervene in this
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000166">&#160;</a>

I also ask whether the regulations are being drafted? If so, what will
they provide, what particular obligations will be imposed, and when we
can expect to see a copy of the draft? Again, a clause gives
regulation-making powers to the Secretary of State without any
indication to the Committee as to what his intentions may be in respect
of the requirements that will be imposed on local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000167">&#160;</a>

less of a need for such an amendment because, clearly, the Government
envisage a situation in which they will impose an obligation on local

will make this point—until the next time. By consensus, we will
agree that we are not normal people; we are political activists and
campaigners. I guess the view of my party is that the
“mays” are acceptable because all of us would make short
shrift of any local

                        <p class="tabbed">However, that
is not the case for the average member of the
public. I believe that the control on, and justification for, the
“mays”—which may of course be “may
nots”—is that people will be aware of what the authority
has decided to do. All the “mays” will require a clear
statement by an authority, under its duty to disclose, that states,
“This is what this authority has decided to do for its code of
conduct and its register of interests.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
“must” is because the authority must make that
information publicly available, and it will be for the public to
decide—with or without political campaigners—whether they
believe that the authority is operating
appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000174">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was not going to speak, but the hon. Gentleman
has raised a point about consistency. In our assessment, the reason for
having a “must” for the code of conduct and making it
compulsory is that there is no remedy. When I spoke earlier, I
mentioned the assessment of the Committee on Standards in Public Life.
There is a remedy for serious misconduct for personal gain, because
that would rightly be a criminal offence. There is a remedy where
people think that they have been personally disadvantaged by something
that a councillor has done, as that will go to the local government
ombudsman.<a class="bkMark" name="11020322000175">&#160;</a>

example from my political experience where somebody was re-elected
after serving a three-year ban. A commitment is often to a party rather
than an individual, and sometimes people who should not be re-elected
are re-elected. That is the reason. We agree. We support the tightening
of the legislation and the criminal offences for things such as a
failure to declare a financial interest or an attempt to make financial
gain. I hope that that helps the hon.
