Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): I had
finished my remarks on this subject when we broke, but the
Solicitor-General indicated that he wanted to intervene. Perhaps it
would not be fair to deprive him of that opportunity, so if he wants to
intervene&#151;you will notice that I am speaking very slowly, Mr.
Illsley&#151;I shall happily remain on my feet, notionally, to take
the intervention that I promised to take. I am a great believer in at
least trying to keep one&#146;s
promises.</div><a name="0607194000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000749"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> I am grateful to the
hon. Gentleman for remembering his promise. He always responds with
courtesy, but I think the moment has
passed.</div><a name="0607194000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607194000750"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): The
Solicitor-General might feel that the moment has passed, but I asked
over a dozen questions earlier, and my hon. Friends the Members for
Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones), for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) and for
North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) all made pertinent remarks in
their speeches. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will do us the courtesy
of
responding.</div><a name="0607194000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000751"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman was
so discourteous in his comments and spoke at such length that I was not
quite sure what he was asking at any particular point. His contribution
was more about wasting time than about asking pointed questions. During
the debate, I tried to respond to particular, more pointed, issues that
were raised by his Back-Bench colleagues. I hope that I did respond to
them.</div> <a name="0607194000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that there is much more that I can say about the comments made in the
other place by my noble Friend the Attorney-General on the
circumstances in which the takeover panel might cease to exist, because
that is, as he then described, merely a fall-back position in case
something goes wrong, but it is not anticipated that anything
will.</div><a name="0607194000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The takeover
panel is quite relaxed about&#151;indeed supportive of&#151;the
broad thrust of our proposals and has made that position clear on all
occasions. The hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column779" />Column number: 780</div>Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) was candid in accepting that the
panel broadly supports the proposals. I suspect that, with a few
exceptions, he and the official Opposition also broadly support them,
and that they wanted to waste some time this morning. Well, they have
wasted it; I do not see why I should waste any more of the
Committee&#146;s
time.</div><a name="0607194000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000752"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Frankly, I find that response dismissive and
rather upsetting. I might have made points at length, but that is not
necessarily the case for those of my hon. Friends who spoke after me.
The Solicitor-General might not think that our points are valid, but
they certainly merit a better response than he just gave. Simply saying
that they were covered by the Attorney-General in the other place is
not an impressive response. Now that I have put that on the record,
there is not much more I can
say.</div><a name="0607194000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000753"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My comments on this clause also apply to clause
644 on further provisions about rules. The explanatory notes
say:</div><a name="0607194000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Panel
is given the power to make rules in relation to takeover regulation.
The rule-making power is broadly drawn to ensure that the Panel can
continue to make rules on the range of matters presently regulated by
the City Code on Takeovers and
Mergers.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The notes go on
to discuss certain provisions that are included. For
example:</div><a name="0607194000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Panel is placed under an obligation to make rules as required by
specified Articles of the Takeovers
Directive&#148;</div><a name="0607194000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">and is
permitted</div><a name="0607194000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to make rules
on takeover bids... mergers and other transactions affecting the
ownership or control of companies.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607194000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explanatory notes
continue:</div><a name="0607194000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
making rules under this clause, the Panel must do so by a committee of
the Panel, except in the case of rules for fees and charges under
clause 657 which must be made either by a committee of the Panel or by
the Panel
itself.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
panel has, at least in recent history, been fairly good at consultation
on proposed rule changes, but how do we know that that will continue?
Has the Department discussed that with the panel? My hon. Friend the
Member for Clwyd, West made the valid point that there needs to be
consultation on future statutory instruments. Have the Government
considered how those will be tied in with the panel&#146;s
consultations?</div><a name="0607194000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000754"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We are hoping that the panel will
continue broadly to make its own rules, as it does now. The objective
of setting this out in statute is to give the panel broad discretion.
The intention is that, within the terms of the directive and the
legislation, the panel will be empowered to make its own rules. Since
1968, it has laid down the rules in what is now called the City code on
takeovers and mergers. Those rules 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column780" />Column number: 781</div>have been recognised in statute and section 143 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 provides that they are endorsed for the
purposes of powers under the Act. Their importance is overseen by the
panel and has been much respected by the courts.</div>
<a name="0607194000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
that, the code is a body of rules for which, historically, no express
authority has been provided by law. The clause will change that and has
two main objectives. The first is to implement properly the takeovers
directive, which requires that rules on takeover regulation laid down
by the directive are given legal effect. Consequently, clause 643(1)
requires the panel to make rules in respect of the specified provisions
of the directive. The directive applies to takeovers of a company
trading on the regulated market and contains provisions concerning, for
example, protection of minority shareholders and so on.</div>
<a name="0607194000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second objective is that we
wish to ensure that the panel&#146;s rule-making authority over other
areas of corporate activity that it has traditionally regulated
continues. That includes matters outside the scope of the takeovers
directive such as takeovers of public companies whose shares are not
traded on regulated markets and mergers. We wish to preserve a unitary
principle to the panel&#146;s regulatory functions. It would not have
been right to create one set of rules applying to takeovers under the
directive and another applying to other types of corporate controls
transaction, so clause 643 extends a right for the panel to make rules
in areas of activity that are broadly regulated by the takeover code at
present.</div><a name="0607194000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
functions of the rules committee of the takeover panel, which I
understand the panel has decided will continue to be known as the code
committee, are set out in the revised introduction to the takeover code
available on the panel&#146;s website and, in accordance with its
current practice, the panel intends to consult widely on any changes to
its rules.</div><a name="0607194000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department has discussed with the panel how it proposes to go forward
with this. I understand that it will continue, in so far as it possibly
can, broadly to maintain the current regime through engagement with the
City and those over whom it will in due course have some authority if
there is a takeover and through consultation with them to ensure that
the rules achieve broad acceptance in the City and the wider companies
that it
regulates.</div><a name="0607194000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607194000755"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): I have one brief question for the
Solicitor-General. Subsection (2)(c)(i) states
that</div><a name="0607194000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any such bid or
transaction is, or has been, contemplated or
apprehended&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
he give more specific information on what &#147;contemplated&#148;
means? Does it mean, for example, a discussion with board minutes? Will
he give some specifics to help the Committee to understand how
&#147;contemplation&#148; will be created, because clearly boards
often consider matters that might never make it into official
documents? Perhaps he can provide some
clarity.</div>
<a name="0607194000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000756"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Obviously, transactions will be
considered and there might be rumours and tentative indications that
something may happen. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column781" />Column number: 782</div>panel may wish to ensure that the way in which it
will deal with a new set of affairs is well known. It could respond to
those circumstances were they to
arise.</div><a name="0607194000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
646</h4><a name="0607194000007"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Directions</div><a name="0607194000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="0607194000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000757"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause provides for interim directions to be
given to ensure compliance with the rules. Will the Solicitor-General
please explain how it will work in practice? What activity will be
required to issue an interim direction?</div>
<a name="0607194000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000758"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause allows the panel to make
provision in its rules giving directions preventing a person from
breaching the rules in the interim while a matter awaits determination
by the panel, or otherwise, to ensure compliance with the rules. This
is an important facilitative provision, and once the panel has decided
on the effect of a rule in a particular case, it can guarantee its
interpretation by requiring relevant parties to do or not do certain
things in accordance with the ruling. Its regulatory power is necessary
and proportionate.</div>
<a name="0607194000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Persons affected by a decision
of the panel on which a direction is issued will still be able to seek
a review of that decision by the panel&#146;s own appeal processes.
If circumstances arise in which the facts are only temporary, the panel
may wish to deal with those temporary circumstances and ensure that its
views are clear to those who might have to address
them.</div>
<a name="0607194000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607194000759"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): I would be grateful for
some clarity on the interrelationship between the role of the panel and
the criminal sanctions that appear later in the Bill. I am sure we will
debate them in due course. If the panel can interpret and provide
guidance and directions, will that bind a court to, or persuade it of,
a view that it subsequently takes on criminal sanctions arising from a
breach of, for example, the rules and requirements of bid
documentation?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000760"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The courts have always been prepared to
take account of the panel&#146;s views, and they have held those
views in high regard. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there are a small
number of cases in which the courts have been required to intervene.
Normally, when they intervene, they&#151;I was going to say defer to,
but that is the wrong phrase, and the courts should not defer
anyway&#151;place weight on the panel&#146;s
views.</div><a name="0607194000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel has
its procedures and the people who serve on it are highly respected. Its
appeal committee includes the right hon. Sir Andrew Leggatt and the
right hon. Sir Martin Nourse, two former Lords Justice of Appeal. In
the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman raises, once the procedures
of the panel, and perhaps an appeal, have been worked through, the
courts will be able to take account of the panel&#146;s
views.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column782" />Column number: 783</div><a name="0607194000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts will have to consider
the circumstances that arise from the later clause on criminal
sanctions. The panel has its own sanctions, and it will determine
whether it can use them to deal with a situation. If it cannot, it may
be right for the criminal courts to deal with the matter. The hon.
Gentleman asked whether the courts will have regard to the
panel&#146;s views. They will, but they will not be bound by them. It
will be a matter for the court to determine how it deals with those
views, but I am sure that, where they are relevant, regard can be had
to
them.</div><a name="0607194000704"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000761"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have a further point to elucidate my line
of argument. The issue that I am focusing on in relation to clause 646
on directions that may come from the panel is the interrelationship
between this provision and clause 653 on the criminal sanctions for
failure to comply with rules about bid documentation. I heard what the
Solicitor-General said about the court not being bound by an
interpretation that the panel may have in respect of those rules, but I
wonder what consideration has been given to the tracks that might arise
from a particular course of action. Clause 653(7)
states:</div><a name="0607194000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nothing
in this section affects any power of the Panel in relation to the
enforcement of its
rules.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">That gives weight
to what the Solicitor-General said, but I want to be clearer on one
issue.</div><a name="0607194000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If, for example,
bid documentation does not incorporate what it should, that may give
rise to a right for the panel to give directions under clause 646 in
relation to specific circumstances. It then may be open, in relation to
the specifics of the rules, for the prosecuting authority to take a
view on what those rules may mean, and ultimately the court would take
a view on what those rules may mean. What consideration has been given
to the evolving nature of the rules and the requirements of the rules?
Up to now, they have largely been interpreted by the panel in terms of
the advice and guidance that it
offers.</div><a name="0607194000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
the statutory framework that we are creating, I can see that different
channels of approach might be taken by different agencies on certain
issues. The panel might take one view on what the rules may mean, but a
court or a prosecuting authority, separate from the panel, might take a
different view. It would certainly help my understanding of how the
measure is intended to operate to know what consideration the
Government have given to whether those potential conflicts would be
resolved by co-operation between the relevant agencies or whether there
could be circumstances in which the panel takes a view and gives a
direction on an issue and subsequently another agency takes a contrary
view and therefore there are differing views on what the rules may
mean.</div><a name="0607194000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">That may not be a
substantive issue at this point, but I envisage that, as things evolve,
concerns may arise as to how the new statutory basis will work. The
benefit in the system at the moment is the flexibility and, at the same
time, certainty in terms of how the panel operates. Because of the new
statutory regime and the involvement of the criminal sanction, the
rules and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column783" />Column number: 784</div>directions given by the panel may not be final. I am
referring to the subsequent court sanction and the opportunity for
another agency to take a slightly different view of what a rule may
mean.</div><a name="0607194000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000762"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not anticipate that the other
agencies would take a different view. It may be that the
courts&#151;I am not sure whether the courts are included in the
phrase &#147;other agencies&#148; in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question&#151;would take a view. They will obviously have to take
account of all the issues in relation to the law and they will form the
view that they form. That will be a matter for the
courts.</div><a name="0607194000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Crown or
the prosecutors, whoever they are, will, in all circumstances, consider
all the evidence and have to take a view on whether there is sufficient
evidence to justify a prosecution. The standard required is very high.
They will be able to look at any guidance or rules produced by the
panel. The panel will have its view on how those rules might be
interpreted, and no doubt the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious
Fraud Office or whoever it is can take account of the panel&#146;s
views about an appropriate interpretation of the rules. I do not
envisage that the prosecutors would seek to devise an interpretation of
their own about what the panel rules might mean. The question for them
would be the straightforward one for any prosecution: does the evidence
provide a sufficient basis within the terms of the clause&#151;or, in
due course, section of the Act&#151;to enable a prosecution? In other
words, does the evidence stack up? The second question would be whether
it was in the public interest to prosecute. I do not think that the
prosecutors would be looking for a different interpretation.</div>
<a name="0607194000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand, the courts
will look at all the law. They will be entitled to look at the rules
put forward by the panel and whether they are appropriate and proper. I
would not seek to fetter their discretion in any way, and I am sure
that the hon. Gentleman would not try to get me to do
so.</div><a name="0607194000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000763"></a>Mr.

interesting debate on the criminal aspect of the provisions. From what
the Solicitor-General has said, it seems that we are facing a
fundamental change. The fact that the court will have to review the

there will be room for concerns, on which I elaborated at some length
earlier.</div> <a name="0607194000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
question is whether there could be a scenario in which the outcome of a

<a name="0607194000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000767"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is so used to rising
to speak that he has risen to support a Government amendment. I thank
him, but I can do that
myself.</div><a name="0607194000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
452 and 526 are about the disclosure provisions relating to the
takeover panel. I say at the outset that we recognise the difficult
balance to be struck on provisions relating to the disclosure of
confidential information held by regulatory authorities about
businesses and private individuals. We are seeking to get right that
difficult balance between ensuring that that information remains
confidential and ensuring that other agencies and regulators that might
properly receive some of that information are able to do so.</div>
<a name="0607194000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 648 restricts the
takeover panel&#146;s ability to disclose information except through
specific gateways. Government amendment No. 452 is enormously important
in enabling us to do that. The clause was introduced to give effect to
the provisions in article 4 of the takeovers directive. Let us be clear
about what the provisions
say:</div><a name="0607194000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Member
States shall ensure that all persons employed or formerly employed by
their supervisory authorities are bound by professional secrecy. No
information covered by professional secrecy may be divulged to any
person...except under provisions laid down by
law&#148;.</div> <a name="0607194000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The starting point
of the directive is that confidential information should be protected.
That must be right. However, the directive also properly recognises the
need in certain cases for information to be disclosed between
regulators and other persons. If shareholders and others are to be
adequately protected in an increasingly complex financial regulatory
regime, such exchange of information is essential. That is why the
directive permits certain avenues of disclosure in the law. Unless such
avenues exist, the information cannot be disclosed; it is as simple as
that.</div> <a name="0607194000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
substance of the amendments. Amendment No. 452 would reverse an
amendment, made in another place, that would impede the exchange of
information. It relates to provisions that concern the onward
disclosure of confidential information provided to the takeover panel
when that information is subsequently passed to other persons or
bodies. The clause as it now stands would require that any further
onward disclosure of the information be authorised by the takeover
panel. I will try to explain why we do not think that the subsequent
control by the panel, once the information is effectively out of its
hands, is either necessary or appropriate.</div>
<a name="0607194000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two reasons. First, we
do not think that it is right to require the panel, in effect, to
police the onward disclosure by another regulatory body. The panel
would not be in a position to assess the relative merits of, say,
onward disclosure of information by the pensions regulator to the
Director of Public Prosecutions. It simply would not be appropriate for
the takeover panel to do that. The takeover panel might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column785" />Column number: 786</div>not be expected to weigh the respective public
interest benefits of disclosure against the need for proper protection
of confidential information in such a case and
indeed&#151;</div><a name="0607194000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000768"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="0607194000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000769"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman intervenes I
should like to finish this because it may well be relevant.</div>
<a name="0607194000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Withholding such information,
which may well be a crime, may not relate directly to the sort of
issues that concern us in later clauses and may relate to a wider
fraud. In those circumstances, it probably would be improper for that
information to be withheld by the pensions regulator, having had it
disclosed to the regulator by the takeover
panel.</div><a name="0607194000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000770"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is not the problem that if someone gives a
document to the panel and it is in the public domain, the panel can
then hand it to someone else who hands it to someone else and so on?
Does not someone have to take responsibility? Does not the person who
is handing the document over to the panel, normally on a friendly
basis, have the right to know what will happen to that document once it
has been handed
over?</div><a name="0607194000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000771"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> To some extent they do. The information
that is passed to the takeover panel is often commercially quite
sensitive. It is certainly information that many of the companies who
pass it to the takeover panel would want kept confidential unless they
had some level of control over it. I understand the point that the hon.
Gentleman is making. However, where that information is passed to
another regulator it would be passed only through a particular gateway
and to a trusted regulator. It would not be passed into the public
domain. That should not happen and we do not propose that it would
happen.</div> <a name="0607194000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking
to ensure that there is a gateway for information to be passed to
certain agencies. They can carry out regulatory or other prosecuting
functions and would then be responsible for ensuring that, as far as
possible, that information remained confidential. Judgments would have
to be made, for example by the DPP, if certain commercially
confidential information might be disclosed as a result of bringing a
case. That would have to be a judgment that was made, of course, in the
public interest. In each prosecution there are two tests: first, is the
evidence there and does it stack up and, secondly, is it in the public
interest to take this case? Those judgments would have to be made and
it is not really possible for the takeover panel to be in a position to
make those judgments. It is statutorily and otherwise appropriate for
the DPP to make
them.</div><a name="0607194000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000772"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On gateways, if a person were to hand a document
to the takeover panel and the panel passed it on to someone else, would
the panel have to advise the original person that their document had
been passed on to a third
party?</div><a name="0607194000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000773"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Normally if that information had been
passed on to the DPP, the takeover panel would be aware of that.
However, the question then arises whether in all circumstances the
takeover panel 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column786" />Column number: 787</div>must inform the person about whom that information
has been passed. A certain amount of caution needs to be applied here,
although it is a perfectly valid question. If that information related
to a possible prosecution of a company or individual who had disclosed
information to the takeover panel, a judgment would have to be made as
to whether it was appropriate for that person to be informed of the
nature of the information and what would subsequently happen. Such a
decision may have to be taken with great care and after consultation
between the various regulatory
agencies.</div><a name="0607194000705"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0607194000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some cases,
there would not be a problem. The takeover panel might say that it had
to pass the information to a pensions regulator, and the person would
know that the information had been passed on. However, if there were a
substantial investigation into a serious criminal offence, the takeover
panel might have to exercise a degree of circumspection and caution in
its response. It would have to judge, in discussion with others,
whether it was appropriate to pass the information
on.</div><a name="0607194000117"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000774"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Does the Solicitor-General agree that the
legislation is analogous to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and
some of the rules around that? Normally, people would be asked for
their consent before documents were released to third parties. The
Government might consider using that template to give third parties
some assurance.</div><a name="0607194000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
broader point, have the Government assessed whether documents could
fall within the scope of the 2000 Act? Would people be able to write to
the takeover panel with freedom of information requests? Would they be
able to get takeover panel documents by writing to third parties to
which the documents had been passed
on?</div><a name="0607194000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000775"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not think that the analogy with
the FOI legislation is appropriate. This information is intended to be
confidential, not freely disclosed. The clause is not about freedom of
information. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the documents
would be made public through the granting of an FOI request. People can
make requests about many things, but often the FOI legislation will not
require that information be disclosed, as the hon. Lady knows. This is
commercially sensitive information. Exceptions in the FOI Act ensure
that such information can be kept
confidential.</div><a name="0607194000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
itself does not fall under the FOI legislation. I believe that the hon.
Lady is asking whether there would be an obligation to disclose
information that was passed to another agency that is a public
authority in the terms of the FOI Act. I cannot give an absolute
assurance on that, but I can give a fairly strong one. It is difficult
to imagine information that would be passed on in such circumstances.
It would have to go through the various tests in the FOI legislation.
Therefore, people can pass information to the takeover panel with a
strong degree of reassurance that if it ever had to be passed
on&#151;normally, of course, it would not be&#151;it is unlikely
that it would be easy to disclose it publicly under FOI
legislation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000776"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are dealing with restrictions on disclosure
of information provided to the panel. In some ways, the provisions are
more complicated than they look. The extent to which the consent of the
individuals concerned will be required for the panel to disclose
information was debated in the other place, and at one stage Baroness
Noakes and Lord Hodgson both attempted to have the clause deleted. Lord
Hodgson
stated:</div><a name="0607194000635"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It has
been argued to us that this is a very broad statement, and that it
seems to allow the panel to disclose information in any case so long as
it can attribute it to facilitate the carrying out of its functions.
That could be argued to cover almost any disclosure made by the panel
at all in any circumstances. With that in mind I return to the purpose
behind the amendment, which is not to hinder the workings of the panel,
but rather to probe the Government on the drafting in this case. We see
no compelling argument as to why this exclusion is so widely
drafted.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 28

<a name="0607194000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The protections from disclosure

452.</div>
<a name="0607194000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having heard
the Solicitor-General, I am not entirely sure that he is totally on top
of the situation; I think that items can still be teased out. It may be
dealt with on Report, but the nightmare scenario of documents getting
lost in the public system, going from one regulatory agency to the next
without anyone being told, could cause fear among those who have heard
our
debates.</div><a name="0607194000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000777"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is creating fear
stories unnecessarily. We need to make it clear that the further onward
disclosure would in any event remain subject to the same controls on
disclosure that applied to the information when it was in the hands of
the takeover panel. It can be further disclosed only under the same
tightly controlled circumstances, laid down in clause 648, that applied
to the panel.</div>
<a name="0607194000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000778"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the Minister saying that because equivalent
clauses in other legislation apply to other regulatory
authorities?</div>
<a name="0607194000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000779"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am saying that it is passed on
conditionally. For example, we do not want to enable a regulator to
pass such information to the DPP or some other agency. Frankly, I do
not think that the hon. Gentleman would want us to allow that
information to go to such an agency. Confidential information should
remain confidential, but it is also right that the proper regulatory
authorities should be able to do their duty in the proper
way.</div>
<a name="0607194000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000780"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not entirely sure on what basis the
Solicitor-General says that the same restrictions would follow from one
agency to the next. Perhaps he will enlighten me further. I still feel
that it is a broad provision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column788" />Column number: 789</div><a name="0607194000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607194000781"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): The confusion is that the words
that the Government seek to remove seem to be those that they are now
relying upon when saying that conditions can be imposed on further
disclosures. The argument is becoming rather
circular.</div><a name="0607194000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000782"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I agree; indeed, I was thinking that as the
Minister was speaking. I thank the hon. Gentleman for bringing that to
the notice of the
Committee.</div><a name="0607194000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We feel that
it is an important issue. The panel has always worked on the basis of
trust. Now that the framework is to be put into statutory effect, we
should recognise how sensitive is much of the documentation that it
receives and how carefully the panel must consider its
disclosure.</div>
<a name="0607194000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000783"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> In the context of sensitivity, does my hon.
Friend have any thoughts on the interrelationship between clauses 648
and 650 on the panel&#146;s duty to co-operate&#151;particularly,
under clause 650(1)(c), with bodies outside the United Kingdom? Given
that one of the panel&#146;s functions is the duty to co-operate, and
given the provisions of clause 648, would the panel therefore be
obliged to provide information to overseas bodies without
restriction?</div><a name="0607194000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000784"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is very likely. My hon. Friend highlights
another concern. We are assuming that the document going overseas will
be misused. That may or may not be the case, but it broadens the scope
of my point. I thank the hon. Gentleman for making his
point.</div><a name="0607194000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000785"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> We are on an interesting topic because we have
raised the hypothesis of an overseas, regulatory body which makes a
fulfilled request for information and documents from the takeover panel
with which it complies, and those documents then go into another
jurisdiction, under the laws of which they might be able to be accessed
as information. In the internet age, that would mean that they could be
accessed by
everyone.</div><a name="0607194000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000786"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. In times of
the internet, once a document goes out of control, it really does go
out of control and everyone tends to know about
it.</div>
<a name="0607194000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000787"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is important that those types of
fear stories should not be given any credence at all. That was not a
good point. In clause 648, the restrictions both on
employees&#151;those who receive documents within the takeover
panel&#151;and disclosure will continue to
apply.</div><a name="0607194000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">In future, there
are likely to be greater safeguards on confidential information than
there are now. Therefore, people can continue to treat the takeover
panel with the degree of proper respect and confidentiality with which
they currently treat it
now.</div><a name="0607194000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000788"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> It is certainly recognised by the panel that
despite its role becoming enshrined in statute&#151;from a day-to-day
perspective&#151;it still intends to operate in much the same way as
it has in the past. That means working on the basis of trust. However,
for that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column789" />Column number: 790</div>to happen, people will have to have confidence in the confidentiality of
what they hand over to the panel. One bad incident could undermine
years of carefully built-up trust. It would not take
much&#151;</div><a name="0607194000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000789"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Why does the hon. Gentleman think that
there is going to be even one bad incident? There has not been since
1968. Why does he suddenly think there is going to be one now? The risk
of his comments&#151;which are read outside this place&#151;is that
people will think that there are intentions in this legislation that
are not there.</div><a name="0607194000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we maintain confidence in the takeover panel. It is fair
and reasonable for him to put forward his amendment. There is not
anything between us in terms of what we would like to see. The issue is
whether the amendment that he is putting forward is necessary to
achieve it, and I say that it is not, or whether the Government
amendment is necessary to achieve what we would both want to see, and I
believe it
is.</div><a name="0607194000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000790"></a>Mr.

listened to the debate, I believe that the amendment put forward by our
noble Friends in the other place was a correct one. I will be asking
the Committee to oppose amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000791"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon. In spite of the good intentions, there are some potential
dangers fraught in clause 648. I have no doubt that the
Government&#146;s intentions are good. The question is how do they
play out in practice?</div>
<a name="0607194000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Multi-billion pound deals are
increasingly taking place across jurisdictions and borders. Only
recently, in my own area, BAA was taken over by a Spanish company. It
is increasingly likely that documents will be shared between
international regulatory bodies. Therefore, between now and Report
stage, it is incumbent on the Government to look at this matter more
carefully and, if necessary, to take action within the Bill to assure
companies that when they pass information on to the takeover panel that
it is confidential, as intended.</div>
<a name="0607194000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">One reason why the takeover
panel has worked so successfully as a self-regulating independent body
is that its high level of honesty has made it possible to raise
difficult issues with the panel. If people were worried about the
scrutiny that issues might receive outside, or about the possibility
that documents might be passed to third parties and ultimately become
public, they might just hesitate about disclosing them to the panel,
which would not be good.</div>
<a name="0607194000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I raise those concerns mainly
because, like the Solicitor-General, I want to ensure that the takeover

of documents being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column790" />Column number: 791</div>disclosed? That is particularly true given that businesses are getting
closer and that multinationals are co-operating on takeovers, as she
said.</div><a name="0607194000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000793"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Clearly, that is the way the business world is
going. Many of us on the Committee have worked for international
companies, and that is the way of international business
today.</div>
<a name="0607194000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000794"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is important that our comments in
this place, and particularly on issues such as this, are made with
care. In particular, it is important that we maintain confidence in the
panel and that we do not get carried away discussing various
speculative fear stories that might undermine that confidence. I am
therefore happy to accept that we go back to the takeover panel to ask
whether it is content with the position that we have arrived at. My
officials advise me that it is, but given the hon. Lady&#146;s
concerns, I am happy to have a further word with the panel to ascertain
its view on this matter.</div>
<a name="0607194000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000795"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I am encouraged by the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments, because these are important
issues. They are also difficult issues, and I have no intention as an
Opposition Back Bencher of creating fear stories, but it is the
Opposition&#146;s responsibility to raise potential loopholes. It is
far better to raise them now than to find out about them when the
provisions are in law and companies that could be performing well are
being hindered purely because we did not do our scrutiny job
well.</div> <a name="0607194000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important issue, and I am grateful that the Solicitor-General will look
at it in more detail. I have some further comments on schedule 2, but I
shall return to them at the appropriate time.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Schedule
2</h4><a name="0607194000009"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Specified
persons, descriptions of disclosures etc for the purposes of section
648</div><a name="0607194000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Second schedule to the
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column791" />Column number: 792</div><a name="0607194000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000813"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I have a number of points to make about what the
long list in schedule 2 will mean in practice. I apologise for the fact
that my speech will probably not be the most eloquent that I shall give
in the House; it is more a list of queries than anything else.
Nevertheless, if the Solicitor-General can give clarification on the
schedule&#146;s meaning and on the Government&#146;s intention,
that would be helpful in the progress of the Bill towards
Report.</div> <a name="0607194000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 648
provides that change to schedule 2 will be subject to the negative
resolution procedure, so the content of the schedule is important. My
first question concerns part 1 of the schedule, which is entitled
&#147;Specified persons&#148;. The first person mentioned is the
Secretary of State, but it might be worth clarifying exactly which
Secretary of State is meant. Is it any old Secretary of State, or is
it&#151;presumably&#151;the one for the Department which will have
responsibility for the
legislation?</div><a name="0607194000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point was raised in the other place and concerns the sixth category of
specified persons: the commissioners for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue
and Customs. There is potential for a scenario in which the takeover
panel is both gamekeeper and poacher, which would not be desirable, so
we need to be careful that people who interact with the panel in the
course of deals do not feel compromised by the range of parties to whom
the information that they might share might be passed on.</div>
<a name="0607194000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 10th specified person is
&#147;A constable&#148;, which seems slightly ad hoc. I presume
that that is a member of a police force, but the point is worth
clarifying.</div><a name="0607194000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 2 of
the schedule is entitled &#147;Specified descriptions of
disclosures&#148;. It contains a whole range of descriptions that
would merit clarification. For example, the description in paragraph 24
is:</div><a name="0607194000638"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
disclosure for the purpose of enabling or assisting a person appointed
by the Treasury to hold an inquiry into matters relating to financial
services (including an inquiry under section 15 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000)...to exercise his
functions.&#148;</div> <a name="0607194000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful to know just how wide ranging such an inquiry might be, because
the inquiries covered are not purely those under section 15 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act, but potentially others too. How
might such an inquiry relate to the Financial Services Authority, which
presumably would be the key operator in that area?</div>
<a name="0607194000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 29 is about pensions
law. Two pensions reform Bills are likely to come through the House in
the coming months and years, and one of them will concern the money
purchase pension scheme, which might well be provided by external third
parties in the financial services arena. We should be careful that
parties that might end up bidding to provide that scheme do not feel
concerned that if they hand over information to the takeover panel it
will be used by the Government to assess any tendering process under
the MPPS legislation. I assume that any further pension legislation
will be included in the schedule by negative resolution, as is
proposed, but I add a word of caution considering that so much
fundamental pension reform is about to pass through the
House.</div> <a name="0607194000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 31
mentions:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column792" />Column number: 793</div><a name="0607194000639"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A disclosure for the
purpose of enabling or assisting...the central bank of any country
or territory outside the United Kingdom...to exercise its
functions.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems
incredibly broad. Will the Solicitor-General tell us why there should
be a duty to disclose to the central bank of any country or territory
and under what circumstances that might happen? Surely the British
Government wish us to have restrictions in place and some criteria by
which we might assess whether requests for information and documents
are appropriate. In light of our previous discussion we need greater
specificity from the Government on how paragraph 31 will work in
practice.</div><a name="0607194000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 32
covers a disclosure, which I have
mentioned,</div><a name="0607194000640"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the
purpose of enabling or assisting the Commissioners for Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to exercise their
functions.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">That might
strike terror into the hearts of most companies, making them fear that
their dealings with the Revenue will not take place through the gateway
to which they have become accustomed. Similarly paragraph 34, on the
Office of Fair Trading, might cause some concern to companies dealing
with the takeover panel. They might want assurance on the basis on
which documents could be passed to such bodies. Of course we fully
support those organisations in the carrying out of their duties, but
the Bill lacks detail on the basis on which such requests will be made,
the extent to which there will be consultation with parties that
provide documents to the panel and the time that a company will have to
give feedback to the panel before documents are passed
on.</div><a name="0607194000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000814"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am listening with care as the hon.
Lady goes through her list. She should not think that there will always
be a duty to disclose. The schedule instead provides a right to
disclose in certain circumstances, for instance to the central banks,
so that the takeover panel can do so if it wishes. We are considering a
prohibition on the disclosure of confidential information and the
question is whether there should be gateways through which the takeover
panel has a right to disclose
information.</div><a name="0607194000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000815"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I take on board the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s comments. I am seeking a level of certainty and I am
concerned about the uncertainty on how the schedule will work in
practice. If there is to be not a duty but a potential for documents to
be passed between organisations, that may be appropriate, but the Bill
lacks clarity on the conditions under which that can happen and a
reasonableness test to judge whether requests are reasonable or
excessive.</div><a name="0607194000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
38 to 41 are on potential disclosure to the Charity Commission and the
National Lottery Commission. One again wonders under exactly what
circumstances such a disclosure would be necessary and what was in the
Government&#146;s mind when they put together the schedule and
specifically included those bodies rather than
others.</div><a name="0607194000707"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="0607194000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps one of
the more obscure disclosures is provided for in paragraph 45:</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column793" />Column number: 794</div><a name="0607194000641"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A disclosure for the
purpose of enabling or assisting a local weights and measures authority
in England and Wales to exercise its functions under section 230(2) of
the Enterprise Act
2002&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">That makes one
wonder whether a company could be in trouble for submitting details to
the takeover panel in feet and inches rather than using the metric
system. Again, the measure applies a level of detail to the documents,
the parties to whom they may be passed and the reasons for doing so
that is really quite obscure. Reading through the schedule, one is left
wondering exactly why it is so far-ranging and whether it would not
benefit from some tidying up, along with a few more provisions to
provide clarity on how information may be exchanged and according to
what criteria.</div><a name="0607194000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will be pleased to know that I am reaching a
conclusion&#151;I realise that the list has been slightly long.
Paragraph 58 provides for a
disclosure</div><a name="0607194000642"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the
purpose of enabling or assisting an overseas regulatory
authority&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to
be something of a catch-all disclosure, in relation to which I flag up
the concerns that I raised earlier about data protection and freedom of
information requests outside our jurisdiction.</div>
<a name="0607194000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have already talked about
paragraph 70, which
is:</div><a name="0607194000643"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
disclosure in pursuance of any Community
obligation.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the range of what could be captured by such a disclosure request seems
remarkably broad. I am not sure that it is wise to have such a broad
term in the schedule. Finally, from the fundamental to the obscure
again, I finish by asking for clarification on paragraph 69, which
provides for:</div><a name="0607194000644"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
disclosure for the purpose of the provision of a summary or collection
of information framed in such a way as not to enable the identity of
any person to whom the information relates to be
ascertained.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
that there are not enough verbs in that. It is not clear to me exactly
what it means, so some translation of paragraph 69 into common English
would be welcome. In what circumstances would it be used, why and by
whom? It would be helpful to know what on earth paragraph 69 would mean
in practice.</div><a name="0607194000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have run
through a list of questions, as I said I would. Given how important
information is to business today, how vital it is that businesses
understand where information flows are going, to whom information will
be passed on and why, and the fact that trust underpins the takeover
panel&#146;s remarkable success in discharging its duties since its
inception in the late 1960s, the issue is worth considering carefully
and in detail, to ensure that we are not taken down a route of
information usage that was not
intended.</div><a name="0607194000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000816"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The schedule sets out some of the
gateways. The list of the various potential gateways is not exhaustive
and can be varied from time to time if circumstances change, as should
be expected. The powers in relation to clause 630 to add to, delete
from or alter those in the list will ensure that it remains up to date
and relevant.</div> <a name="0607194000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
creating not a range of duties, but a range of rights, so that the
decision rests with the takeover panel in all but one case. Therefore,
what we have proposed is, by and large, an ability for the panel to
make a number of judgments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column794" />Column number: 795</div><a name="0607194000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000817"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> My understanding of the previous clause on which
we voted is that we have struck out the panel&#146;s ability to
authorise such disclosures. I wanted to clarify whether that was
correct.</div>
<a name="0607194000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000818"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That is incorrect. The panel can
authorise disclosures, provided there is an appropriate gateway to
access that disclosure of information. It has to decide that it wishes
to disclose information, and it can then do
so.</div>
<a name="0607194000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000819"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="0607194000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000820"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> In just a moment. Let me deal with the
point first.</div> <a name="0607194000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
might take the view that a particular request is not appropriate, and
therefore decide not to disclose. If there is a view that that is
improper, that might have to be tested in the courts. However, we are
creating an option for the panel, and it will decide whether a request
is appropriate, and will choose whether to disclose
information.</div>
<a name="0607194000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000821"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Does the Solicitor-General believe that the panel
is authorised to put conditions on its release of information,
especially the onward release of information? If that is his view, the
debate that we just had was largely otiose.</div>
<a name="0607194000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000822"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The same conditions shall apply as
those that related to the takeover panel. The takeover panel was
subject to confidentiality restrictions, and it will be incumbent on
those who receive the information to observe the same restrictions,
subject to any obligation that they might have in law to pass that
information to somebody else. For example, the pensions regulator, to
whom I referred earlier, might have an obligation in respect of
information about fraud and therefore to a subsequent gateway, although
it might not be described in those terms in the legislation.</div>
<a name="0607194000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2) states that the
panel must not further disclose information, so the information is
tagged to that effect wherever it goes. That is subject to the caveat
that the body to which it is disclosed might be subject to an
obligation, and that obligation might arise in law. The information is
safeguarded all the way through the process. I hope that everybody
accepts that, with those safeguards, the information is adequately
protected.</div> <a name="0607194000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
points raised by the hon. Member for Putney (Justine
Greening)&#151;</div><a name="0607194000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607194000823"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): Will the
Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="0607194000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000824"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am trying to deal with the point made
by the hon. Member for Putney, so unless it is on that particular
issue&#151;</div><a name="0607194000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000825"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am grateful. The Solicitor-General has referred
to a request for a disclosure. Does he anticipate that, in practice, a
disclosure will invariably be made in response to a request, or can he
foresee circumstances in which the panel may make a disclosure to a
relevant body of its own volition?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column795" />Column number: 796</div><a name="0607194000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000826"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The panel may well be made aware of
circumstances&#151;for example, when an offence has been
committed&#151;in relation to which it takes the view that it has a
moral obligation to disclose further. It might be more than a moral
obligation in certain circumstances, so it could decide to pass
information to another agency of its own volition, but I anticipate
that any disclosure of information is more likely to be the result of a
request. To some extent I am guessing when I say that, in most cases,
it will be possible for the request to be refused on the basis that the
information is confidential. Therefore, if a body asks for information
about a bid or transaction, the panel is likely to say no because the
information is confidential. However, we want to provide the
opportunity&#151;the gateway&#151;to get around the confidentiality
in cases in which the panel takes the view that it is important that
that should happen, or in which it has an obligation to ensure that
that happens. We are being quite restrictive in the various gateways
available.</div>
<a name="0607194000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Putney described a list of potential gateways, and I shall
not go through all of them. I shall deal with one of them at a bit more
length, but I think that she is seeking an assurance. Are we creating
an obligation to disclose information to the organisations&#151;the
answer in most cases will be no&#151;or are we creating a right to do
so if the panel chooses? In that case, whatever safeguards exist on the
takeover panel will continue to exist. That is by and large the
case.</div><a name="0607194000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
raised the issue of weights and measures. It appears a little odd on
the face of it, but weights and measures is the old-fashioned but still
legally correct term for consumer protection departments in local
authorities. They began as people who checked for short weight in
particular products, and as a result, archaic lawyers apparently use
the phrase to refer to local consumer protection departments. Given
that lawyers continue to be archaic for long periods, I am afraid that
the description will
continue.</div><a name="0607194000215"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000828"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Rather than saying that it is likely to
want to do anything, we are saying to the panel that if it feels that
that is appropriate, the gateway will enable it to do so. It is not for
us to speculate on the circumstances. If I did, I would speculate that
the panel might become aware of a particular company&#146;s approach
that ought to be dealt with by a consumer protection department, and
might feel that it was of such importance that it should be passed on.
I do not know. We need to examine what potential gateways the takeover

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000831"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The notes state that article 4.4 of the
directive requires that takeover supervisory authorities and financial
services regulators provide reasonable assistance to other such
authorities within the EEA for the purposes of the directive. Hon.
Friends have highlighted potential concerns over the release of
documentation, which we have just
debated.</div><a name="0607194000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads me to the scope of the duty of co-operation provision. It would
be helpful if the Minister explained the scope of the clause, provided
some practical examples of its use and explained whether he considers
that requests for such assistance are likely to grow as a result of the
Bill or for other
reasons.</div><a name="0607194000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)
seems somewhat bizarre. Why is it necessary? Is it only to show that
co-operation may not include showing information that the panel is
prevented from disclosing? Is that not how it would normally be versed?
I should be interested to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s
views.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000832"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Article 4.4 of the takeovers directive
requires that the takeover supervisory authorities and financial
services regulators provide reasonable assistance to other authorities
within the European economic area for the purposes of the directive. In
implementing the directive, clause 650 is designed to give effect to
that requirement by obliging the panel to co-operate with the overseas
takeover and financial services regulatory
authorities.</div><a name="0607194000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The form
and manner of co-operation will be as the panel considers appropriate
in the light of the circumstances, in particular its power to require
documents and information may be exercised to support such an
authority, and may include sharing information which the panel is not
prevented from disclosing. Essentially, that is the provision in
subsection (2), which says what it means. It
states:</div><a name="0607194000645"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Co-operation
may include...sharing...information that the Panel is not
prevented from
disclosing.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
mirrors similar co-operation obligations imposed on the Financial
Services Authority by section 354 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000. That is an important point.</div>
<a name="0607194000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000833"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Solicitor-General for his
explanation so far. It would be helpful if he would give us a reason
why this measure is needed. What will it be used for in
practice?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column797" />Column number: 798</div><a name="0607194000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000834"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> This is a requirement of the takeovers
directive, and it is a matter for the panel to decide how it is used.
The panel is broadly supportive of the provisions. They give the panel
the ability to make decisions where it thinks they are appropriate. It
is not for us to set out in the Bill the circumstances in which the
panel can do various things. The panel has operated quite successfully
since 1968, and we are enabling it to continue to do so. Broadly, in
these circumstances, we can trust it to make the appropriate
decisions.</div><a name="0607194000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000835"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I should be interested to hear a little more on
what would happen if European co-operation was needed at the moment,
and on how this proposal is likely to improve
matters.</div>
<a name="0607194000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000836"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The panel can co-operate, in so far as
it feels appropriate, with any other appropriate regulatory authority.
The hon. Gentleman knows that it has been a wish not only of the
current Government but of his party when it was in Government back in
1989 that the other European countries should set up similar
authorities. They are obliged to do so under the directive, and they
are setting up such authorities. I understand that it was the wish of
his party&#146;s Government and the Labour Government when they came
into office that a level of greater co-operation should now be possible
between the various bodies that have been set
up.</div>
<a name="0607194000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000837"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise briefly to obtain clarification on a
few items. We note that under clause 650 the panel must take steps to
co-operate with the relevant agencies and bodies that are specified. We
have obviously debated subsection (2) in that regard. It
states:</div><a name="0607194000646"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Co-operation
may include the sharing of information that the Panel is not prevented
from disclosing.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to probe those last words a little more, and I hope that the
Solicitor-General may be able to provide some guidance on
them.</div><a name="0607194000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my
understanding of what clause 648 says about the general authority to
disclose, the panel has the ability to disclose things for</div>
<a name="0607194000647"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the purpose of facilitating the
carrying out by the Panel of any of its
functions&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
&#147;functions&#148; cover the language in clause 650(1)? I am
slightly confused about the circumstances in which the panel may be
prevented from disclosing, because clause 648 would suggest there is no
impediment to its disclosing, given that it would appear to be part of
its functions to co-operate with those agencies. Therefore, clause 648
itself seems to give the panel the permission to disclose. That might
be a misreading in my interpretation of the interaction between the two
clauses. It would be helpful for me to understand the interrelationship
between them and the circumstances in which the panel might be
prevented from disclosing, given that clause 648 would seem to allow it
in any circumstances in which it facilitates carrying out its
duties.</div>
<a name="0607194000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
query relates to article 4.4, which referred to being within the EEA.
Clause 650(1)(c) is much broader in its aspect in not being limited to
the EEA 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column798" />Column number: 799</div>and I should be grateful for clarification of the
Solicitor-General&#146;s thoughts on that point. Perhaps he will say
why the broader ambit was considered appropriate. I suspect that it is
to facilitate good regulation across markets throughout the world. I
can see the sense in broadening it beyond the EEA, given that we have
capital markets in the far east and the United States and sharing
information between those two markets might be appropriate, but some
clarification would be
appreciated.</div><a name="0607194000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Solicitor-General referred to section 354 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, which states that the Financial Services Authority
can</div><a name="0607194000648"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;take such steps as it
considers appropriate to co-operate with other
persons&#148;</div><a name="0607194000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">sharing similar
functions to those of the authority, language that is reflected in
clause 650. Section 354 also states that that should be in relation to
the prevention or detection of financial crime as defined within the
Financial Services and Markets Act, and that the FSA has the ability,
and almost an obligation, to co-operate with criminal
authorities.</div> <a name="0607194000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Solicitor-General may say that in part that may be captured by the
ambit of schedule 2 and the operation of clause 648, I want to confirm
that the phrasing of the proposal will be wide enough to capture
co-operation to prevent financial crime from occurring. I entirely see
the merit in ensuring that agencies work together to crack down on
financial crime, and the thought processes involved in incorporating
that type of language within clause 354 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act but not incorporating a similar type of approach in clause
650, as the Solicitor-General himself indicated that there is a broad
equivalence between the two provisions for the FSA on the one hand and
the panel on the other.</div>
<a name="0607194000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000838"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The process is that the panel is
restricted from disclosing confidential information. However, gateways
are available to it to disclose information in particular
circumstances. It has a general obligation to co-operate with various
other outside and non-UK agencies as it considers appropriate. The most
important words in the clause are in subsection (1), which
states:</div><a name="0607194000649"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Panel must take such steps as it considers appropriate to
co-operate&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">That gives
the panel great discretion and enables it to make whatever decision it
feels is appropriate in particular circumstances. The clause goes wider
than Europe; it applies to regulators outside Europe. Clause 652 simply
makes it clear that as part of the co-operation process, the panel can
disclose information if it considers it appropriate.</div>
<a name="0607194000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under section 354 of the FSMA
the panel is able to disclose information outside the EU, and clause
652 enables a similar level of disclosure. However, financial crime is
not the main part of the panel&#146;s remit, unlike that of the
Financial Services Authority. The provision is thus adapted to the role
of the panel; it does not create obligations in relation to crime
because that is not an obligation on the panel. It uses the format of
section 354 to ensure the existence of a similar provision, with a
similar ability to co-operate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column799" />Column number: 800</div><a name="0607194000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going beyond Europe enables the
panel to take a view about appropriate levels of co-operation with
non-EEA agencies, if it feels that it is right and proper to do
so.</div>
<a name="0607194000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000839"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Briefly, the Solicitor-General&#146;s words
are helpful. He is right to say that the panel does not have a
prescribed role in financial crime in the same way as the FSA, perhaps.
I am sure that in practice the panel would co-operate in such
circumstances as far as it
could.</div><a name="0607194000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a concern
that I would like satisfied: given the information on takeovers that
the panel will have, if an agency concerned with financial crime
contacted the panel, would the latter co-operate, even if that is not
specified in the Bill? In practice, I am sure that it would, but I
would be grateful for any further comments that the Solicitor-General
may
make.</div><a name="0607194000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000840"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not think that I can add anything
except to say that there is a general duty to co-operate, but only as
the panel considers
appropriate.</div><a name="0607194000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000841"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause provides for the proper procedures
for review of and appeal against decisions taken by the panel in
connection with its regulatory functions. Clause 651(1) requires that
rules made by the panel</div>
<a name="0607194000650"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide for a decision of the
Panel to be subject to
review&#148;</div><a name="0607194000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">by a hearings
committee at the request of affected persons specified in the rules.
Clause 651(3) provides for a right of appeal, as provided for in the
rules, to an independent tribunal&#151;the Takeover Appeal
Board&#151;against a decision by the hearings committee. The rules
may make provisions in relation to the hearings committee about
procedural matters, evidence and the powers of the
committee.</div><a name="0607194000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take
a closer look at the Takeover Appeal Board&#146;s rules. It is an

of clarification, if a person has served on the panel committee and

the recruitment of extra people to serve on the committees?</div>
<a name="0607194000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I shall raise the key
issue in the Lords on that point. Lord Hodgson made various points
about the appeal board and the consideration of human rights issues in
its constitution. I discussed that issue with the panel which has since
confirmed in correspondence that the board&#146;s rules are not made
by the panel precisely because of the need to keep the two bodies
separate in order to comply with human rights requirements. The
board&#146;s rules are made by the board itself, under common law
principles. They are summarised in section 8 of the new introduction to
the code, and will be made available on the new website,
www.thetakeoverappealboard.org.uk; I thought that that should go on the
record.</div><a name="0607194000709"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000845"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I just want to add a couple of words to
my last answer. I said that it is not envisaged that members of the

will be a matter for the panel to determine, not us. However, that
seems to be the situation at the
moment.</div><a name="0607194000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000846"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for that further
clarification, which agrees with how I had read the
clause.</div><a name="0607194000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 652,
the panel can issue private or public statements of censure to any
persons who breach the code. The penalties have been remarkably
successful in regulating public company takeover activity, as we
discussed earlier. The loss of reputation that can follow a censure can
be devastating, and it provides a good incentive to play by the rules.
Subsections (2) to (8) were added to provide a consultation mechanism
for any new sanction, including any possible financial penalty. I
certainly agree that any such new sanction should require a policy
statement and a thorough consultation period, but my question is why
the clause is needed at all. I have heard no suggestions&#151;none
from companies or the panel&#151;that the penalties system needs
changing, so why do the Government consider the clause
necessary?</div><a name="0607194000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000847"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If the panel does not want to change
the system, it does not have to, but the clause gives it the authority
to do that if it so wishes. As we have set up the panel on a statutory
basis, it is important that we give it the powers that we think it may
need in future. Any changes will be a matter for the
panel.</div><a name="0607194000275"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000851"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There are two concerns about the clause. First,
the categories of persons who could commit an offence are wider than
the categories of persons deemed responsible for an offer document
under the takeover code. Secondly&#151;this point is dealt with by
amendment No. 527&#151;the Government decided to make any breach of
the rules about bid documents a criminal offence. They say that that is
required in order to implement article 17 of the takeover directive
properly. Admittedly, there was debate about that at various stages in
proceedings in the Lords, but it is still not clear to me that the
panel wants to be responsible for enforcing any breach of the rules
relating to offer documents once the bid has been concluded, although
it might have to, if is made responsible for imposing penalties for a
breach of the rules. Will the Minister give his understanding of the
position?</div><a name="0607194000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions gold-plate the directive somewhat. The persons who might be
liable should be aligned with those who are responsible for offer
documents under the rules. I understand that that is affecting current
practice, in that some law firms are now advising financial advisers
that they should no longer make bids on behalf of the bidding company.
That is having an effect already, because the clause is replicated in
the Takeovers Directive (Interim Implementation) Regulations 2006,
which came into force on 20 May.</div>
<a name="0607194000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a copy of a letter of 22
May to Lord McKenzie of Luton, which was written on behalf of the
London Investment Banking Association&#146;s corporate finance
committee, and which deserves to be put on the record. It states that
LIBA is the principal trade association in the UK for firms active in
the investment banking and securities industry, and that one of its
objectives is to ensure that London remains an attractive location for
the conduct of international investment banking business.</div>
<a name="0607194000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the letter, LIBA states that
its members are concerned about the provision which it says establishes
criminal liability for failing to comply with the regulations setting
the required content of the bid documentation, and notes that the
language in the clause was changed as a result of discussions in Grand
Committee, and that Lord Goldsmith has described the intended effect of
the changes. The letter states that LIBA is concerned that one of the
agreed changes removes a reference to agents and employees of offerors
by maintaining liability for the persons making a bid. The problem is
that it is not clear whether the phrase &#147;the person making the
bid&#148; includes the corporate advisers to an offeror if the
practice has been to announce each offer on behalf of the bidder. That
uncertainty has resulted in some prominent City legal firms advising
banks to cease making offers on behalf of their clients to avoid the
possibility of liability attaching to themselves as the person making
an offer. Manifestly, there is a danger that the settled way of
presenting takeovers in the UK will be disrupted by that
uncertainty.</div> <a name="0607194000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
letter goes on to say that, as mentioned in Grand Committee and
discussions in the Lords, there is no requirement for criminal
sanctions in the takeovers directive. No other EU member is known to be
contemplating criminal sanctions regarding offer documentation and
there has been no pattern of unacceptable offer documentation in the UK
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column803" />Column number: 804</div>requires the creation of criminal sanctions to curb such abuse. The
letter adds that the stated intention of avoiding the cost of
professional advisers for agents and advisers to avoid criminal
liability would also be frustrated by a lack of clarity in the criminal
liability
provisions.</div><a name="0607194000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000852"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It may assist the hon. Gentleman, who
seems to be intent on setting out an argument, if I reassure him that
we do not intend that those who act as agents for bidders such as
merchant banks in the circumstances that he describes should be
criminally liable under the offence provision. We are satisfied that
the scope of the offence will not make such persons criminally
liable.</div><a name="0607194000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000853"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear what the Minister says. On that basis,
will he support our amendment to change the word &#147;bidder&#148;
to &#147;person making the bid&#148;?</div>
<a name="0607194000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000854"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> For the reasons that I have just given,
we are satisfied that the scope of the offence as drafted will not make
such a person a criminal anyway, so there is no need to do
so.</div><a name="0607194000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000855"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b><b class="B"> </b>The long list of London banks, which are
supported by a number of City lawyers, would seem to contradict him.
The fact remains that the clause is gold-plating of the EU directive.
It is not required and, from what I can make out, although the panel
does not object to receiving the powers, it did not particularly ask
for them. As far as I can tell, no companies and no one in the City has
asked for them. Is not this a typical example of Government
overkill?</div><a name="0607194000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000856"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The new bid documentation offence was
subject to extensive discussions in another place. I do not want to go
into the details of those discussions, as there is no point in
repeating all that here. We have given certain reassurances: the test
for any offence is high&#151;a person must know about it or be
reckless&#151;and it applies only in relation to takeovers and those
companies to which the provision will apply, which are limited. For
example, they must be trading on a regulated market.</div>
<a name="0607194000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (6), which amendment
No. 527 would delete, is an integral part of the offence provision. It
lays down the penalty that will apply when the offence is committed: a
fine, which on summary conviction will not exceed the statutory
maximum. Without that provision, the offence would remain in the
legislation, but there would be no sanction for it. It would have no
teeth, and be a nonsense. The offence provisions are a response to the
duty imposed by article 17 of the takeover directive, which is to
ensure that &#147;effective, proportionate and dissuasive&#148;
sanctions are in place to underpin the measures introduced to implement
the directive.</div><a name="0607194000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
carefully considered all the directive&#146;s provisions in the light
of the sanctions obligation imposed by article 17. We took full account
of existing sanctions and legal remedies available elsewhere in company
and financial services regulation legislation. We also closely examined
the sanctions and compensatory powers available to the panel when
persons transgress the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column804" />Column number: 805</div>panel rules. As a result, we identified a specific loophole in our
implementing package; the offence provision in clause 653 is designed
to address it.</div>
<a name="0607194000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provisions relating to bid
documentation are laid down by articles 6.3 and 9.5 of the directive
and they are to be implemented by rules that the panel is obliged to
make under clause 643. The panel will, of course, be able to enforce
those rules through its usual mechanism. Should the panel conclude that
an offer or response document did not meet the requirements of the
rules, it could direct that the matter be put right by the offeror or
the board of the target company. It could apply to the court to enforce
that direction. The panel also has the right of public
censure.</div><a name="0607194000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
all that, we had specific concerns. The first related to serious or
other deliberate mis-statements that came to light only some time after
the bid had been completed. In such cases, remedial action of the kind
that I have described would no longer assist those interested in the
bid. Equally, the kind of information to be included in the bid
documentation does not concern only direct parties to the bid such as
shareholders of the target company; information has to be provided on
matters such as the bidder&#146;s intentions in respect of the future
business of the target company, repercussions on employment and the
location of the company&#146;s place of business. Clearly, such
information is highly important to employees and others who are
affected by the bid but have no contractual rights in respect of
it.</div> <a name="0607194000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently, we
concluded that it was right to provide for a specific offence in
respect of bid documentation. The offence has been refined in the light
of concerns raised in another place about a lack of clarity. An offence
will be committed when the offence or response document in question
does not comply with the rules designated by the takeover panel as
giving effect to article 6.3 or 9.5 of the takeovers
directive.</div> <a name="0607194000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">An offence
would be committed only if the relevant person knew that the document
did not comply, or was reckless as to whether it did and failed to take
all reasonable steps to ensure that it did. That is a very high test,
which will catch only those acting with deliberate intent or in
flagrant contravention of their duties in respect of the bid
documentation. We consider it necessary, proportionate and targeted. I
hope that, on that basis, the amendment will not be
pressed.</div><a name="0607194000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
525 is different and specific in nature and raises an important issue
about the potential liability of the agents. I have made clear our
position on agents: we do not intend to criminalise them. We are aware
that it has long been City practice that merchant banks deliver the
relevant takeover offer documents. In implementing the directive, a key
objective has been to disturb as little as possible the existing system
of takeover regulation in UK and City practice. It is not Government
policy to make agents making bids on behalf of bidders potentially
liable for the offence.</div>
<a name="0607194000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of the arguments
raised, we tabled an amendment on Report in another place to remove
references to agents. We are aware that concerns remain that agents
continue to be caught inadvertently by the offence provision. That
stems from the use of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column805" />Column number: 806</div>phrase &#147;person making the bid&#148;. Might that include agents?
We do not believe so. It must be taken to mean the person who intends
to take over the target company; I say that knowing that the relevant
people will refer to my comments. After all, the agent is not going to
enjoy the contractual rights or be subject to the contractual
obligations of the offeror.</div>
<a name="0607194000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment seeks to put the
issue beyond doubt. However, in doing so, it introduces further
ambiguities. For instance, it raises the question of on whose behalf
the agent might be acting and in what regard. It is a drafting issue,
but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment creates more problems than he
thinks. The scope of the offence set out in the Bill will not make
criminally liable the agents whom he fears might be liable. It is not
our intention that they should be. Therefore we cannot accept his
amendment and we do not think that it is necessary. I hope that he will
feel able to withdraw
it.</div><a name="0607194000710"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000857"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The question asked in the Lords and which LIBA
also asked is whether the clause should be deleted in its entirety. The
clause will impose criminal sanctions on</div>
<a name="0607194000662"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the person making the bid and
where the person making the bid is a body of persons, any director,
officer or member of that body who caused the document to be
published&#148;,</div><a name="0607194000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">if he knew
that it did not comply or he was</div>
<a name="0607194000663"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reckless as to whether it
complied&#148;</div><a name="0607194000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">with the offer
document rules and</div>
<a name="0607194000664"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;failed to take all reasonable
steps to secure that it did comply.&#148;
</div><a name="0607194000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have put together a series of
arguments from a variety of sources.</div>
<a name="0607194000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, it has been said that
there was no general public consultation by the Department of Trade and
Industry or any official body on the proposal to establish a criminal
offence of this nature. Perhaps that is wrong and the Solicitor-General
might like to comment. Secondly, it is considered by many that the
takeover directive does not require that any criminal sanction be
established with respect to bid documentation. Further, it was stated
and not challenged in the House of Lords that four other nations that
have implemented the directive have not established criminal sanctions
with respect to bid
documentation.</div><a name="0607194000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
there has been no series of cases involving misleading or inaccurate
bid documentation that established the need for the criminal sanction.
Indeed, there is a history of approximately 40 years under the takeover
code during which there has not been a generally perceived need for
such sanctions. Fourthly, the proposed criminal offence is very broadly
drawn to include any minor deviation from the requirements set by the
takeover code for bid documentation and the requirements may change by
a decision of the code committee of the takeover panel, which could
effectively redefine the offence.</div>
<a name="0607194000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fifthly, the proposed offence,
which is enacted in the interim regulations, has already resulted in a
decision to change practice by some leading investment banks. They have
decided to cease making bids on behalf of bidders to avoid any
possibility of criminal liability. The Solicitor-General thought that
the provisions did 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column806" />Column number: 807</div>not say that and he mentioned that that point had
been covered by the Lords. All I can say is that organisations such as
LIBA have looked at the Lords debate and at the provisions again with
their lawyers and still feel that there is a significant
problem.</div><a name="0607194000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">The potential
liability will translate into significant cost increases, time delays
and complexities in the bid process, affecting companies and
shareholders alike, as companies are forced to ensure that every part
of the bid document is beyond criticism. Another point that was raised
is that the UK will become less responsive to market forces, which
encourage the healthy restructuring of companies and capital. The UK
will also serve as a model for other EU nations that may also adopt
criminal sanctions, rendering them even less open to the free flow of
capital than they are now when compared with the UK. The last point
made was that criminal sanctions are best reserved for matters for
which civil remedies have been shown to be inadequate. For all those
reasons we still have a
problem.</div><a name="0607194000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000858"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman made quite a good case for
voting against the clause standing part, but I do not think that he has
made a good case for his amendment. He has referred to what happened in
the House of Lords debate, but the assurances given by the
Solicitor-General about the meaning of the particular phrase that he
seeks to amend seemed quite categorical. Is there any part of the
Solicitor-General&#146;s remarks today that he still finds
problematic?</div><a name="0607194000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000859"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General will correct me if I am
wrong, but I think that he based his remarks on what was said in the
House of Lords. Many people have looked at those debates and
fundamentally disagree with that opinion. If the people putting their
names on the offer documents are to have a problem with that, we need
to address that. If it can be addressed by changing a few words, it is
worth doing.</div>
<a name="0607194000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000860"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The point is that if we could clarify the
language, it would be of assistance. Does my hon. Friend agree that,
although the Solicitor-General has made some helpful comments about
interpretation, if so many people have already thought that the person
making the bid would incorporate the corporate finance house, as time
goes on and people interpret the Act, what was said in Committee,
however important in a court, may not be so important in practice?
Therefore, we want to ensure that we clarify the Bill as much as
possible.</div><a name="0607194000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000861"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000883"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> That will be a matter for the panel.
Historically, the takeover panel has had no such revenue-raising powers
and it has been funded through two main sources&#151;document charges
and the levy. In that way, the cost of the regulation of takeovers is
borne jointly by those involved directly in bid activity and
participants more generally involved in the financial markets. The
existing model of financing should be mirrored in the new statutory
regime. It enables the panel to make rules for the payment of fees or
charges to the panel.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000884"></a>Mr.

is an unincorporated body, it is given the right to bring or defend
proceedings in its own name. Clause 661 provides for people who work
for the panel or its secondees to claim a judicial type of immunity.
Has an assessment been made of the extent to which the panel will be
more open to civil claims following the new measures, and will the
Solicitor-General confirm that the taxpayer will not have to pay for
any damages awarded against the
panel?</div><a name="0607194000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000885"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is not anticipated that the taxpayer
will end up funding damages; nor is it envisaged that the panel will be
the subject of extra litigation. The anticipated result&#151;the
hoped for outcome&#151;is that once the panel is set up on a
statutory basis it will continue to operate broadly as it does now. It
is rare for the courts to have to intervene, and we anticipate that it
will continue to be rare. However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column808" />Column number: 809</div>Ministers cannot prejudge how the panel will develop. We hope that it
will not develop in a litigious way, and we see no great reason to

agreements, and limitations on share ownership.</div>
<a name="0607194000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are currently no
restrictions on how UK companies admitted to trading on a regulated
market may structure their share capital and control. However, market
pressure, particularly that brought to bear by institutional investors,
has ensured that few UK listed companies now have differential voting
structures. As permitted under article 12 of the directive, it has been
decided not to apply the provisions of article 11 in all cases but
instead to include in the Bill a provision for companies with voting
shares traded on a regulated market to opt in to its provisions should
they choose to do so.</div>
<a name="0607194000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">This was the subject of some
debate in the other place. Indeed, I discussed the philosophical side
of it this morning, but I do not intend to go over that again.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> A smile crosses the Solicitor-General&#146;s
face. However, I discussed the matter with the panel. It is worth
recording that it set out its position in correspondence. It said that
it would come back, principally in relation to the Grand Committee
debate, on these clauses. That debate was about how the Government
propose implementing article 11 of the takeover directive.</div>
<a name="0607194000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Articles 9 and 11 of the
directive are both concerned with reducing barriers to takeovers.
Article 9 provides a framework for preventing a board from frustrating
a takeover bid. Article 11 provides a framework for preventing
shareholders who hold a minority of the share capital but who have
disproportionately high voting rights from blocking a bid. Article 12
gives member states the option of imposing articles 9 and 11 on all
companies registered within their territories. If the member state
chooses not to impose either of those articles&#151;that is, to opt
out&#151;it must nevertheless, by virtue of article 12(2), give
companies the option, which must be reversible, of choosing to apply
the articles individually.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column809" />Column number: 810</div><a name="0607194000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">Article 9 is consistent with the
fundamental principle underlying the takeover code; accordingly, it was
always the Government&#146;s intention that it should be imposed on
all UK registered companies having shares traded on a regulated market.
The UK has therefore opted in, and article 9 is being implemented under
rule 21(1) of the code, which has been amended to reflect the specific
provisions of the article.</div>
<a name="0607194000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">On article 11, the question
whether certain voting structures should be imposed on companies is a
matter for company law and is not, therefore, a part of the directive
over which the panel has any responsibility. As a result, the panel has
never been involved in any debate with the Government about how the
optional provisions of article 12 would apply to article 11, save to
clarify that it would be concerned if the legislation undermined
irrevocable commitments. The DTI has proposed not imposing article 11,
partly because the shareholding structures concerned are rare in the UK
and partly because it does not wish to restrict companies&#146;
flexibility to construct share structures as they see
fit.</div>
<a name="0607194000711"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="0607194000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having reviewed
the Lords debates on this chapter and taken soundings, we are generally
of the view that the Government have got the implementation of the
directive right. However, we have continued to receive reports, mainly
from City solicitors, that the wording of the clause is confusing and
that it might be helpful if the Government published a more detailed
explanatory note to reflect what has been said, not least in the other
place.</div>

&#147;Oh dear.&#148;] I had to get that one in. An explanatory note
on the clause would be extremely long, and there is actually a good
description of how the clause would work in the DTI consultation
document on the matter. Indeed, I was reading it last night to get my
mind around some of the detail of the opting in and opting out
arrangements in relation to article 11. I shall certainly consider
whether a more detailed explanatory note would be of assistance and
discuss the matter with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Industry

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000891"></a>Mr.

restrictions. We query the use of the phrase</div>
<a name="0607194000667"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;75 per cent. in value of all the
voting shares&#148;</div><a name="0607194000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">in

which refers to</div> <a name="0607194000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;75 per
cent...of the capital carrying voting
rights&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government resisted using the directive&#146;s wording in the other
place, saying that their formulation was consistent with the wording in
the Companies Act 1985. In addition, there was a debate in the Lords
about whether &#147;in value&#148; meant nominal value or market
value. Originally, Lord Goldsmith confirmed that it meant nominal
value, but that was challenged by Lord Hodgson. The Government seem
intent on leaving it to the courts to interpret what is meant by that
phrase, but our point remains: why not simply clarify the issue
now?</div>
<a name="0607194000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000892"></a>David
Howarth:</b><b class="B"> </b>The<b class="B"> </b>clause contains some
obscurities, and I should like the Solicitor-General to elucidate
another one. Subsection (6) refers to compensation for people whose
agreements are broken as a result of the clause, but will it apply to
people who make such agreements after the Bill has come into force? It
could be argued that someone who made such an agreement after the Bill
had come into force did so in the knowledge that the law would allow it
to broken and that they should not, therefore, be allowed the benefit
of the compensation clause. If the Solicitor-General could explain how
the provision will apply to late-coming agreers, I would be
grateful.</div><a name="0607194000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000893"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The directive uses a European style of
phraseology but we have a different way of describing things in English
law. There is a choice between the two, and we have chosen to interpret
the directive using conventional English company law terminology. We
could have copied the text from the directive or used what is called
the elaboration approach, which involves using UK terminology to
achieve exactly the same thing. We believe that we have achieved
exactly the same thing, and that the wording that we used is better
than the phraseology used in the
directive.</div><a name="0607194000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The courts
would have to consider with great care how the UK&#146;s directive
was described. Greater clarity would not be added if an expression that
does not mean much in itself were used. The provision in the Bill would
have to be interpreted against the background of European legislation.
We do not know what the European Court of Justice, for example, would
make of capital carrying voting rights or 75 per cent. of
them.</div><a name="0607194000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000894"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point is that we would avoid exactly that
problem by more closely following the directive. If a case goes to the
European court, the judge would make a decision that would apply to all
countries. Instead, we will have something separate that will stick out
and possibly be questioned at a later
stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000895"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I do not think that we would be better
off taking the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view. Arguably, his approach
might be better before the European court, but it probably would not be
better before a UK court. Our courts are used to the way that things
are described in UK legislation. If we start changing it, they will
want to know why. They would then have to consider other
interpretations of the phraseology in other parts of European
legislation and in other parts of UK legislation in which we have used
European wording, and we would end up back in the somewhat confused
position that the hon. Gentleman seeks to
avoid.</div><a name="0607194000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are better
off elaborating&#151;that is the expression&#151;the directive
wording to bring it in line with UK company law, and to use words with
which the UK courts are familiar. They can then interpret the cases. If
cases ever get to the European Court of Justice, perhaps at that point
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion would apply, but most cases will
be decided in courts in this country. Therefore, it is better that we
use wording that is appropriate to this
country.</div><a name="0607194000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
comments of the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth) are
concerned, the clause provides that agreements entered into between
shareholders of the company on or after 21 April 2004&#151;the date
on which the takeovers directive was adopted&#151;and agreements
entered into between a shareholder and the company before as well as on
or after that date, are invalid in so far as they impose any of the
restrictions set out in subsection

out paragraph
(a).</div><a name="0607194000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is concern
that, as defined, clause 671(2)(a) will mean that convertible shares
that convert into shares carrying voting rights will be caught by the
threshold provisions in clause 668. That was not discussed on Report in
the House of Lords, but was at earlier stages. We have received legal
opinions that say that the point has not been addressed by the
Government&#146;s amendments to, for example, clause 668(8)(b).
Clause 668 now
states:</div><a name="0607194000668"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
reference...to voting shares in the company does not
include...shares that, under the company&#146;s articles of

articles, arise only where specified pecuniary advantages are not
provided).&#148;</div><a name="0607194000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is still
unclear how those provisions tie in with the definition of voting
shares in clause 671. I appreciate that this is technical stuff, but
the Minister might like to reflect on it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000898"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is familiar with the
arguments set out by the Attorney-General during the debate in another
place. We are rehearsing many of those debates here, and given that the
hon. Gentleman is familiar with them, I do not believe that I need to
repeat them. I shall continue to reflect on the issues, but I do not
think that any change in our view is
likely.</div><a name="0607194000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a separate
matter, may I return to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
appeals committee? In correcting myself, I may have over-corrected
myself, in that I was right on the first occasion and when I tried to
give the panel the power to vary, I probably went further than I needed
to. A person who has been a member of the code committee cannot sit on
the appeal board. I hope that that clarifies the matter. When a
belt-and-braces approach is attempted, sometimes the belt and braces do
not work too well and the trousers

Government new clauses on the record this morning and I will not make
the point again. We simply have not had time to consider them and,
along with everyone else who has been consulted on them, we will not do
so in reality until the summer. I think that we are all clear on that,
so there will be a bit of summer reading to be
done.</div><a name="0607194000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
clause 675, which ties in closely to schedule 3, the concept of the
squeeze-out and sell-out is very important to the bidder gaining
complete control of the target and not having residual minority
shareholders. It is also important to minority shareholders being able
to receive value for their shares. The main changes are set out in the
notes:</div>
<a name="0607194000669"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Calculation of
squeeze-out threshold (new section 429(1), (1A), (2A) and ((2B)) -
there is a dual test imposed: in order to require the minority
shareholder&#146;s shares, the bidder must have acquired both 90 per
cent. of the shares to which the offer relates, and 90 per cent. of the
voting rights carried by those shares. Where the offer relates to
shares in different classes, then, in order to acquire the remaining
shares in a class, the bidder must have acquired 90 per cent. of the
shares of that class to which the offer relates, and 90 per cent. of
the voting rights carried by those shares. Currently, in each case only
the first limb of that test
applies&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000712"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div> <a name="0607194000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the
Minister not consider that that new dual test could inhibit the use of
the squeeze-out with the impact that more minority shareholders would
be caught in the target company, possibly against their will? Will the
Solicitor-General explain how this European provision came about and
whether he is considering reviewing how this works in
practice?</div> <a name="0607194000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
concern is more about timing. Section 429(3)(a) states that the
squeeze-out notice cannot be given after the
end</div><a name="0607194000670"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of three months
beginning with the day after the last day on which the offer can be
accepted;&#148;.</div> <a name="0607194000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">That period
seems to be open-ended. The Government suggested in Grand Committee
that that should be clarified by the panel. However, it has recently
been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column814" />Column number: 815</div>pointed out to us that the panel does not appear to
have taken advantage of that opportunity in finalising its new rules,
and therefore that the drafting is still unclear for practitioners. The
position might have changed since I received that advice, so I would be
grateful for the Solicitor-General&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="0607194000417"></a>

Solicitor-General:</b> Modifications are required to bring
existing provisions of the 1985 Act dealing with the problems of
residual shareholders following the successful takeover bid into line
with directive requirements. Clause 675 and schedule 3, which introduce
the amendments to replace those provisions, are important. They are
concerned with squeeze-out and sell-out rights. As the hon. Gentleman
described, they are designed to address the problems of the residual
minority
shareholders.</div><a name="0607194000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause and the schedule have two main purposes in amending part 13A of
the 1985 Act. The first is to bring existing squeeze-out and sell-out
rights into line with articles 15 and 16 of the takeovers directive,
which introduced EU-wide laws on those matters for the first time.
Secondly, we wish to implement a number of company law review
recommendations that relate to those matters.</div>
<a name="0607194000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not set out in any great
detail the points raised by the various provisions. They are important,
but also complex. We think that the dual test to be imposed would
seldom make any difference. In practice, 90 per cent. of capital and 90
per cent. of voting rights will usually mean much the same thing. Only
in those companies that have restructured themselves so that the voting
rights and the shares do not always conjoin is that likely to produce
an issue. The period during which a bid can remain open is a matter for
the panel to consider in amending its own
code.</div><a name="0607194000420"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000904"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That may be relevant to unlisted public
companies because unusual share structures are more likely to exist in
them. People often do not realise that the code applies or they are
less likely to apply it in a way that they might in a larger company in
a listed context. In practice, this may be a tricky area. Such
companies are most likely to have minority shareholders who will not
want to get left
behind.</div><a name="0607194000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000905"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says,
but even in those companies it is likely that if minority shareholders
are concerned about the circumstances they face, they will seek
appropriate legal advice in relation to what rights they might have. In
those circumstances, they will obviously be made aware of the
provisions in the
legislation.</div><a name="0607194000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
want to create a dual squeeze-out regime applying differently to listed
and unlisted companies. It is better to have clear legislation, so that
when lawyers come to advise those who might feel aggrieved in some way,
those people can be given clear advice. There should not be constraints
in terms of the company&#146;s perspective on whether the advice
applies. On that basis, we have taken the view that it is better to
cover both listed and unlisted
companies.</div><a name="0607194000423"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607194000906"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): For ease of reference, I
have not been able to identify from the helpful information that the
Minister for Industry and the Regions sent to us when we received the
new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column815" />Column number: 816</div>clauses whether these proposals contain any change to the 1985 Act
wording. Can the Solicitor-General assist us and say whether the new

wording?</div><a name="0607194000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000907"></a>The

wording to ensure that it fits in with particular clauses, but the aim

be the
same.</div><a name="0607194000425"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000909"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000913"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 17, which deals with private
and public companies. Chapter 1 is about the prohibition of public
offers by private
companies.</div><a name="0607194000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
81 of the Companies Act 1985 prohibits a private company from offering
any shares or debentures to the public, and the meaning of
&#147;offer to the public&#148; is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column816" />Column number: 817</div>set out in section 742A. Clause 531 continues the prohibition in section
81(1) of the 1985 Act on private companies offering their shares or
debentures to the public. The prohibition refers to securities of the
company defined in clause 535 as shares or debentures. It is thought
that as the prohibition applies to offers of shares or debentures in
allotments or in an agreement to allot shares or debentures, the
drafting will catch any warrants, options or convertible debt that may
confer an entitlement on a holder to acquire shares or debentures.
Amendment No. 503 is designed to clarify
that.</div><a name="0607194000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 530(1)(b)
replaces section 81(1)(b) of the 1985
Act.</div><a name="0607194000441"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000914"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b><b class="B">
</b>We are discussing clause 530. The hon. Gentleman said
&#147;clause
531&#148;.</div><a name="0607194000442"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000915"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are debating clause 530(1)(b). Private
companies continue to be prohibited from allotting their securities
with the intention that they are offered to the public by someone else.
This is presumed to be the case if securities are offered to the public
within six months of their allotment or before the company receives the
whole of the consideration due to it in respect of
them.</div><a name="0607194000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explanatory
notes for clause 531
state:</div><a name="0607194000671"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An offer
will not be an offer to the public if it is not calculated to result in
shares or debentures of the company becoming available to anyone other
than those receiving the offer...Nor will an offer be an offer to
the public if the offer is otherwise a private concern of the person
receiving it and the person making
it.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
531(3) is similar to section 58(3) of the 1985 Act, which it replaces.
No change is intended, and the presumption is capable of rebuttal.
However, six months seems a long time for the presumption to remain, so
amendment No. 501 probes whether the period could be changed to three
months to reduce
uncertainty.</div><a name="0607194000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
clause 533, a company does not contravene clause 530 if an offer to the
public is made in good faith as a part of an arrangement under which it
is to re-register as a public company before the securities are
allotted, or if part of the terms of the offer are that it undertakes
to and does re-register in no more than six months from the making of
the offer. The provision will certainly be welcomed by practitioners
and is of practical
benefit.</div><a name="0607194000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again to
probe, I ask whether the period in which the offer can be made could be
extended to 12 months. That is because the announcement of the move to
public status may be made&#151;and probably would be&#151;at the
company&#146;s annual general meeting, say, in contemplation of a
flotation. To have 12 months would mean that the company would have a
clear year before its next AGM, which might be more convenient in terms
of the length of time for which its share issue approval resolutions
were put in place.</div> <a name="0607194000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
Grand Committee, Lord Sharman moved an amendment to subsection (3), the
effect of which was to narrow the scope of the clause. Lord McKenzie
said</div><a name="0607194000672"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subsection
(3)(a) of Clause
525&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607194000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">as it was
then&#151;</div><a name="0607194000673"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ensures that
the prohibition on offering shares or debentures to the public does not
apply if the offer or the agreement to allot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column817" />Column number: 818</div>shares or debentures is done in good faith in pursuance of arrangements
under which the company is to reregister as a public company before the
shares or debentures are allotted. Subsection (3)(b) similarly exempts
offers which include as part of their terms an undertaking by the
company to reregister as a public company within six months of the
offer. This enables a private company intending to go public to make an
offer to the public before it has completed the formalities of
reregistration, without breaching
clause.</div><a name="0607194000674"></a><div class="hs_brev">The exemption
also recognises that despite the good faith intentions of the company,
the reregistration application might fail or the arrangements to
reregister might be derailed. Circumstances can change; for example,
the company might suffer an unexpected downturn in trading, such that
it no longer meets the requirements of Clause
92&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607194000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">as it then
was&#151;</div><a name="0607194000675"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as regards
its net assets. In those cases, we do not consider that the company
should be held at fault under these clauses for the things it has done
in the good faith expectation that it would become a public
company.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 14
March 2006; Vol. 679, c.
GC451.]</div><a name="0607194000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the substance of the measures seems sensible, the question is whether
it is adequate for the company to be exempted. The members of the
company provide authority for share issues, but the directors enter
into agreements to issue shares. Should it not therefore be the
directors, rather than the company, who are protected by the
provisions? Amendments Nos. 504 and 505 would provide for
that.</div>
<a name="0607194000451"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000916"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We consider amendment No. 503 to be unnecessary. We
included an extended definition of securities when we introduced the
Bill in another place which sought to include various indirect ways in
which rights to share or debentures could be conferred. We were
persuaded that that was both dangerous, in that the long, detailed
definition was unlikely to prove useful for as long as commercial
practice develops, and unnecessary, in that the simple prohibition on
offering or allotting share or debentures to the public already catches
indirect ways of achieving the aim, such as by offering options or
warrants.</div><a name="0607194000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 501, we do not think it appropriate to shorten the period to three
months. The six-month period is the same as in section 58 of the 1985
Act. Indeed, the period has been set at six months since the Companies
Act 1928 and seems to be a realistic period for such a rule, in that if
there is an offer to the public in less than that time, the onus will
be on the company to displace any suspicion that it issued the shares
with a view to that particular offer to the public taking
place.</div><a name="0607194000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 504 and 505 refer to the behaviour of directors. We do not believe
that that is appropriate. The purpose of the chapter is to distinguish
private companies from public companies. The prohibition on offering
securities to the public applies to the company. Changing one provision
to refer to the behaviour of the directors rather than that of the
company would simply confuse the operation of the part.</div>
<a name="0607194000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know what amendment No. 502
would do, but we see no need to relax the requirements even further.
The purpose of the chapter is to ensure that public company rules apply
to any company that makes offers to the public. The six-month period
was chosen as it seemed more than a reasonable length of time for a
company to comply with its promises to
re-register.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column818" />Column number: 819</div><a name="0607194000455"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000917"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My point was that in practice resolutions are
often taken in the AGM and then worked through during the year, which
gives the directors the chance to explain to the members what they are
going to be doing during that time. That is why I thought that 12
months would be appropriate. Has the Minister considered
that?</div><a name="0607194000456"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000918"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Our view is that it would be too easy to evade the
requirements in the clauses, which might deny those members of the
public who subscribe to shares the additional protection that public
company status provides. The six months will run from the offer, not
the
AGM.</div><a name="0607194000457"></a>

was raised repeatedly in the Lords and has been mentioned to us again
by many practitioners: is that definition good enough to determine what
is safe for companies to do? I must tell the Minister that the
consensus is still no. I have tabled two alternative provisions in
amendments Nos. 508 and
515.</div><a name="0607194000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have received a
wide variety of representations on that matter, but shall elaborate on
one in particular made by Edward Lukins from Morrison and Foerster. On
27 June in a letter to me he
wrote:</div><a name="0607194000689"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Further
to our telephone conversation, I attach a paper outlining the amendment
which we would like you to propose to the Company Law Reform
Bill.</div> <a name="0607194000690"></a><div class="hs_brev">As I am sure you
are aware, the definition of &#145;offer to the public&#146;
contained in the current Companies Act has merely been carried forward
into the Bill and from a market practice standpoint we regard this as
particularly unhelpful for two reasons,
namely:</div><a name="0607194000691"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the definition
&#145;offer to the public&#146; contained in section 531 serves to
bring forward all the ambiguity that surrounded the same definition in
the Companies Act 1985;</div> <a name="0607194000692"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) we
have a perfectly sensible and explicit definition of exempt offer to
the public set out in section 86 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 which was incorporated into that Act by virtue of
implementation of the Prospectus
Directive.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Edward
Lukins has usefully provided slightly more detailed explanations. As it
is important, I shall address some of the points that he raises. He
says:</div><a name="0607194000693"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many of
the transactions with which we are involved, particularly in Europe,
involve investment grade issuers issuing debt securities to US life
assurance companies and US municipal pension funds. These offers are
always structured so as to fall within exemptions to US securities laws
and generally involve multiple legal entities within a European group
of companies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column821" />Column number: 822</div>issuing notes to overseas investors. This is a substantial market and
enables large amounts of US capital to be accessed by European
companies, and in particular UK companies. On many occasions the
ultimate parent company of the issuing entity will be a public company
but individual subsidiaries may also offer securities. For example, a
German parent and its UK subsidiary might both issue subordinated notes
on a cross-guaranteed cross-collateralised basis. In many cases if a UK
legal entity is involved, it is likely to be a private limited company
as opposed to a public limited company. Also, in many cases we might
approach an investor which is a discretionary manager of multiple
sub-funds, for example MetLife assurance company which manages over 100
sub-funds.</div><a name="0607194000694"></a><div class="hs_brev">Pursuant to
section 86 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the position
is very clear that these transactions do not constitute an offer to the
public by a UK private company; however, the proposed definition of
&#145;offer to the public&#146; set out in clause 531 of the Bill
carries forward a gloss of uncertainty on the position. Clause 531 has
been carried across from the old Companies Act where it is set out in
section 742A. This definition itself is carried forward from the 1948
Act and has long been renowned for its ambiguity and lack of clarity.
We are currently in the position where we have to rely upon opinions of
counsel in order to be able to issue legal opinions supporting the
transactions of the kind described above (which are a requirement of
the programmes under which this kind of debt securities are
issued).</div><a name="0607194000695"></a><div class="hs_brev">It is our
recommendation that this rare opportunity be used to create a single
meaningful definition of &#145;offer to the public&#146; which
gives certainty to both the market and practitioners. There is a long
string of unhelpful decided case law relating to clause 531 and its
predecessors which we believe is fundamentally out of line with the
approach taken to the concept of &#145;offer to the public&#146;
set out in the Prospectus Directive and subsequently incorporated into
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</div>
<a name="0607194000696"></a><div class="hs_brev">We would also point out that as
a result of the implementation of the Prospectus Directive, the UK
Listing Authority have removed the requirement that a company be a
public limited company from its rules to bring them in line with
European jurisdictions which generally do not impose differing
requirements in terms of what constitutes an offer to the public on
private and public companies as a result of the implementation of the
Prospectus Directive. This amendment to the Listing Rules allows
private companies to list specialist debt securities on the Official
List but again the anomalous restriction in clause 531 still puts an
unwanted gloss on the position.</div>
<a name="0607194000697"></a><div class="hs_brev">We would accordingly suggest
that clause 531 is replaced by the definition of &#145;offer to the
public&#146; contained in Article 3(1)(d) of the Prospectus Directive
and the full text of section 86 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000.</div><a name="0607194000698"></a><div class="hs_brev">In summary,
we believe that the effect of clause 531 is to create an unwelcome and
anti-competitive position in English company law. We believe that if
the issue is not corrected it will lead to the UK potentially losing
access to a substantial capital market on the basis that deals will be
structured to circumvent the UK jurisdiction. This could lead to more
companies establishing offshore financing vehicles to issue their debt
securities rather than having them issued direct out of the United
Kingdom. We also believe that the amendments to the Listing Rules,
which were introduced as a result of the implementation of the
Prospectus Directive and which are designed to allow private company
issuers to list specialist debt securities, would also not be used to
their full advantage, hence the London Stock Exchange may lose out to
overseas exchanges as a
result.&#148;</div><a name="0607194000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also have a letter from the managing director of global head of private
placements at RBS, which supports that position. The managing director
of global banking and markets at RBS also supports it. It is important
to note that it is a commonly held view, and I have received many such
representations, but as time is moving on, I shall not read them all
out.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column822" />Column number: 823</div><a name="0607194000715"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30
pm</div><a name="0607194000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far, I have mentioned the response from the big players&#151;people
who see the provision creating uncertainty in the global capital
markets. There is also an important issue for small English companies
that are simply looking to raise money but are not quite at the stage
of wanting to go public. If a director of a small company wants to send
out details of an investment in it, currently the lawyer he will
approach to ask how many people he can send them to will not be able to
advise him as a general rule. One could say that the figure is normally
between 25 and 50, but the lack of certainty will mean that the
director will always&#151;I say this from personal
experience&#151;be worried about, and frustrated at, not knowing
whether his legitimate wish to offer shares to people will or will not
be breaking the law.</div> <a name="0607194000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
simply do not understand the Government&#146;s position on this
issue, and most practitioners do not either. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s further explanation, and I hope it will be
positive.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000923"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b><b class="B"> </b>Amendment No. 506 proposes substituting
&#147;intended&#148; for &#147;calculated&#148;. That was
thoroughly debated in another place, and, as we explained there,
&#147;calculated&#148; is the term in the existing
provision&#151;section 742A of the Companies Act 1985&#151;and it
achieves the effect we want: an objective test of whether the
transaction in question would reasonably be interpreted as leading to
securities ending up in the hands of a wider class of people than the
initial recipients. The amendment would change that, as was explained
in the other place, to a subjective test of what was the intention of
the company. That would be much more difficult to prove and would make
it easier for private companies to get away with circumventing the
prohibition of public
offers.</div><a name="0607194000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three of the
other amendments we are dealing with would, in different ways, change
subsection (4). Our view is that there is
consensus&#151;</div><a name="0607194000716"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.32
pm</div><a name="0607194000485"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Sitting

<a name="0607194000487"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000924"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We clearly talk to different people, but our view
is that there is consensus on the proposition in clause 531. We are not
making any significant change, and the definition has been in place for
decades.</div><a name="0607194000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
507 would delete subsection (4), whereas amendments Nos. 508 and 515
would replace it. The purpose of the clause overall is to allow organic
growth in a company&#146;s shareholder base. Offers can, for example,
be made to a new investor who has been identified as wanting to inject
extra capital into the business and take a stake in it, or the company
can raise new funds by going to its existing members and employees and
their relatives. What is crucial is whether there is a sufficient
connection or relationship between the private company and the people
to whom securities are being offered. This is not about the number of
people. The company may have many hundreds of existing members and
employees, and there is no problem in offering them further
shares.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column823" />Column number: 824</div><a name="0607194000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
508, however, would enable a company to offer shares to up to 99 people
who had no previous connection or relationship with the company.
Furthermore, those 99 people could be investment managers who intend to
put their discretionary customers into the shares. If a company wants
to offer shares and raise money from the general public, it should
reregister as public. It is true that reregistration as a public
company involves the company in additional regulation in terms of
disclosure and of capital maintenance rules, for example. However, that
is precisely because we believe that shareholders and creditors of a
company that wants to access the capital markets in that way require a
different sort of protection from those interested in a private
company, which will generally have a more restricted shareholder
base.</div><a name="0607194000490"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our view, the
current law strikes the right balance and we do not intend to change
this aspect of it. Such an amendment as No. 508 would risk making the
exemptions so wide that they would no longer act as an effective
distinction between private and public companies. If amendment No. 508
would risk blurring the distinction between public and private
companies, amendment No. 515 would make the distinction entirely
meaningless.</div>
<a name="0607194000491"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000925"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 515 is based on provisions in the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Is the Minister
therefore saying that that Act is
meaningless?</div><a name="0607194000492"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000926"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I missed the
question.</div><a name="0607194000493"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000927"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point that I made earlier was that the
figure of 100 was set in statute in the year 2000 as a figure in
relation to which, for other purposes, an offer to the public could be
disregarded. Why is the Minister saying that it is irrelevant when we
come to consider it in this
context?</div><a name="0607194000494"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000928"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I understood that the hon. Gentleman based his
amendment on the 2000 Act, but the purpose of that aspect of the 2000
Act is entirely different from that of this part of company law. The
2000 Act is designed to protect vulnerable investors so that, for
example, offers are permitted without an approved prospectus provided
that the
minimum&#151;</div><a name="0607194000495"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000929"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What is the purpose behind the
offer-to-the-public provisions? Is it not to protect vulnerable
investors?</div><a name="0607194000496"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000930"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="0607194000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions
make perfect sense when the aim is to relieve those who raise funding
of the need to provide consumer-friendly prospectuses when dealing with
professional or experienced investors, but they make no sense in the
context that the hon. Gentleman envisages. They would drive a coach and
horses through the public-private company distinction. The Bill
introduces a number of deregulatory measures for the benefit of private
companies. We do not think that it would work if, at the same time, we
gave private companies the opportunity to raise unlimited sums of money
from an unlimited number of investors who had no previous connection
to, or relationship with, the company.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column824" />Column number: 825</div><a name="0607194000498"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000931"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I listened carefully to the Minister, and
from a practical perspective I respectfully say to her that these
things happen. I am concerned to hear that we seem to be creating two
different routes of offer to the public for a private company, but not
to the public of a public company. That risks creating confusion among
practitioners about what we are saying about offers to the
public.</div><a name="0607194000499"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000932"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> In my view, there is no confusion, and perhaps when
the hon. Gentleman reads <i class="I">Hansard</i> he will think likewise. As he
knows, in the spirit of good will we recognise the importance of the
Bill to the business community and stakeholders more widely, so we are
prepared to offer three days on Report to ensure the widest opportunity
to debate any outstanding matters of concern. If the hon. Gentleman
feels that the <i class="I">Hansard </i>record does not make sense, he can come
back to me on that
point.</div><a name="0607194000500"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000933"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> I am grateful to hear that we will have three days
on Report. It is obviously a shame that we have not debated some
matters that could have been considered if the Committee could have
returned after the summer, but we are grateful to the Minister for
persuading the powers that be who arrange the Government&#146;s
business to give us sufficient time to consider issues on the Floor of
the House, when the House returns after the
recess.</div><a name="0607194000501"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000934"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I, too, hope that that happens, and that we fill
the time with serious debate.</div>
<a name="0607194000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 348 is more modest
in its ambitions: it would add directors to the list of people
connected to the company in subsection (5). Offers to people on that
list will generally not be regarded as &#147;to the public&#148;.
That currently includes existing members and employees and their
relatives, but not directors of the company. Many directors of private
companies are members, employees or both, so in such cases the
directors will already be included in the list of connected persons.
Obviously, if directors happen to be neither members nor employees, it
does not mean that they cannot be offered shares in the company. An
offer by a company to its directors will usually be a private matter
between the director and the company. It is the private concern of
those involved, and so not an offer to the public.</div>
<a name="0607194000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek to preserve the current
law on what is an offer to the public, and not to prevent anything that
is lawful now. It is not our intention to make the provisions more
restrictive or significantly more relaxed than the equivalent
provisions in the Companies Act 1985. We would therefore prefer not to
make even the minor change of adding directors to the list of connected
persons, as their absence from the list should have no practical
consequences.</div><a name="0607194000504"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000935"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thought the Minister was leading up to a
concession on the last amendment, but at the last minute she turned her
harder face to it. First, it is important to put it on the record that
we in the Conservative party are pleased to hear that she has offered
three days on Report. That is the right thing to have
done.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column825" />Column number: 826</div><a name="0607194000505"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000936"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> My hon. Friend is too modest to mention to the
Committee that he has played a significant role in this development. I
am glad that the Government are thinking about the matter magnanimously
and open-mindedly and have agreed with his representations in favour of
a third day on Report. That is very important and those outside the
House who are following our proceedings will be particularly relieved
to hear that news from the Minister this
evening.</div>
<a name="0607194000506"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000937"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, with
which I certainly agree.</div>
<a name="0607194000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 348, as we have
said, we think that the Government have got things wrong. Amendment No.
506, frankly, is not important. The Minister fails to appreciate the
strength of feeling among practitioners on the definition of
&#147;offer to the public&#148;. The fact that something appeared
in the Companies Act 1948 does not mean that it is necessarily
automatically justified in this day and age. The law in other areas,
particularly in relation to the FSMA, has moved on significantly. The
law is behind the times, in relation to both large companies that need
to raise money on capital markets and small private companies that need
to raise funds. We have a significant problem with
that.</div>

far behind with respect to the capital-raising requirements of the big

<a name="0607194000509"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000939"></a>Mr.

of prohibition: order restraining proposed

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000982"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 509, in
pageÂ 257,Â lineÂ 20,Â after
&#145;creditor&#146;, insert &#145;(of more than
&#163;5,000)&#146;.</div><a name="0607194000566"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause enables members, creditors or the Secretary of State to apply to
the court for an order restraining a private company from carrying out
any proposed contravention of the prohibition on offering shares of
ventures to the public. Will the Minister explain why the clause is
needed? If someone is in breach of the law against private companies
making offers to the public, the law can be enforced and surely someone
could go to the court for an injunction in any event&#151;with or
without the clause. Why is it necessary? If it is necessary, is there
not a concern that a competitor or discontented shareholder could use
it vexatiously to inhibit the company?</div>
<a name="0607194000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 509 is a probing
amendment intended to give some security against vexatious requests for
orders. Has the Minister considered that? Put simply, the amendment
says that an application for an order under the clause may be made by a
member or creditor of the company, but that the creditor should not be
of less value than &#163;5,000. Thus the level is set to provide
companies with the confidence that they otherwise would not
have.</div>
<a name="0607194000568"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000983"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The procedure is new, and the reason for the clause
is to provide civil enforcement procedures to back up prohibition on
private companies making public orders. It is a real improvement on
continuing to rely on criminal penalties, as in the 1985 Act. There are
court procedures for claims brought vexatiously, as the hon. Gentleman
undoubtedly knows.</div> <a name="0607194000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a company appears to be about to breach the prohibition, it should be
restrained. Any member or creditor should be able to apply for an
order, and we see no reason why creditors owed less than &#163;5,000
should not be able to apply to the court. There is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column828" />Column number: 829</div>risk of small creditors making frivolous or vexatious applications,
given their risk of having to pay costs. If the application is
justified, the court will make an order preventing the company from
making the offer to the public, which it should not do in any
case.</div><a name="0607194000570"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000984"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have to say that the figure of &#163;5,000
has been included only on a probing basis to make the point that a
level should be set to put people off making vexatious claims. I hear
what the Minister has to say and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0607194000571"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

a decision that in the interests of justice no further action be
taken&#146;.</div><a name="0607194000576"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000987"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I apologise for my error in that amendment No.
510 is incorrectly drafted. My intention is not to delete the whole of
subsection (1).</div><a name="0607194000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause introduces a new civil enforcement procedure for breaches of
clause 530, which is entitled &#147;Prohibition of public offers by
private company&#148;, and replaces the criminal offence imposed by
section 81 of the 1985 Act. Amendment No. 510 is intended to probe
whether it is wise to confuse the clause and section 459 of the 1985
Act. Will section 459 not apply in any event and might not that reduce
the clarity of the
position?</div><a name="0607194000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a court
decides that a company has acted in contravention of clause 530, it
must order the re-registration of the company as a public company,
unless it appears to the court that the company does not meet the
requirements for such re-registration as set out in part 7 and it is
impractical or undesirable to require it to take the steps to do so. If
that is the case, under subsection (3)(b) the court may make an order
for the compulsory winding-up of the
company.</div><a name="0607194000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sounds
all very well in theory, but in practice we could be entering dangerous
territory with these new provisions. The basic problem could be that
the creditors or the shareholders would be hurt first if a company were
wound up, rather than the issuing directors who had actioned the wrong.
More to the point, if a company is wound up, the secured
creditors&#151;normally the bank&#151;will be paid off first. It is
likely that the main losers when shares are issued illegally, to the
extent that there are losers, will be existing shareholders, who will
be paid out last in any insolvency.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column829" />Column number: 830</div><a name="0607194000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such a situation, a court
might say that the company should re-register as a public company, but
it might not have the money to do so. The breach of the offer to the
public may not, for instance, have raised the &#163;12,500 that a
company needs to go public. Public status may be unsuitable for the
company or be bound to hinder its development. In such a case, can we
be clear about the fact that the court may see that there is a breach
but decide in the circumstances to do nothing? Asking that question is
the purpose of amendments Nos. 511 and
512.</div><a name="0607194000581"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000988"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I assume that I do not need to take amendment No.
510, considering it does not stand as it is
read.</div><a name="0607194000582"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000989"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The right hon. Lady must take the amendment as
it is written. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman said he has made a
mistake with it, but she must consider the amendment as it
is.</div><a name="0607194000583"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000990"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I had read the amendment as probing and was going
to take it as such. It considers how the clause relates to sections 459
and 460 of the 1985 Act. If in proceedings brought under those sections
it appears to the court that a company has breached or is proposing to
breach the public offer prohibition, it must make the orders required
under clause 532 or clause 533, as the case may be. That provides
another means of enforcement that, crucially, will not depend on an
application being made specifically under those
clauses.</div><a name="0607194000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">Uniform
implementation will be frustrated if courts do not necessarily make a
restraint order or re-registration order in relation to a petition
brought under sections 459 or 460. However, doing so will be required
following an application under clauses 532 and 533. The requirement
will not restrict the court from making any other order on an action
brought under the old
Act.</div><a name="0607194000585"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take amendment
No. 510 as probing. Amendment No. 511 would remove the option for a
court to make an order for the compulsory winding up of the company.
However, we believe that the addition of the remedial order option, in
response to the debate in another place, has improved and strengthened
the clause. There can be circumstances in which the court will decide
that winding up is the most appropriate action&#151;for example, if
the company was a sham and the public offer was a way of raising money
fraudulently. There might well be criminal proceedings against
individuals involved, but the best thing to do with such a company is
likely to be to wind it
up.</div><a name="0607194000586"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 512
is unnecessary. Subsection (3) states that</div>
<a name="0607194000700"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court may make either or
both&#148;</div><a name="0607194000587"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the two types of
order. It is therefore clear that there is the option to make no order.
There is no need to spell that
out.</div><a name="0607194000588"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000991"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> It does not sound as if the Minister is going to
write to my hon. Friend with an answer, but at this stage it might be
useful to elicit something from her. She, the Solicitor-General and the
Under- 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column830" />Column number: 831</div>Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs have made a number of
undertakings to write to hon. Members with information. The Committee
will finish at 2 pm on Thursday.</div>
<a name="0607194000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister say whether
those undertakings will be delivered on by the time the Committee
finishes? If that is not possible, will they be met by the time the
House rises for the summer recess? We believe that 27
undertakings have been given, of which one has been delivered so
far.</div><a name="0607194000590"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000992"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am sure that that was well in order; I shall take
it as being so. We are responding. I have signed three or four letters,
and my hon. and learned Friends have signed some too. We shall sign the
letters as soon as we get them. They will probably not all be dealt
with by Thursday, but if we have promised to write to Committee members
about an issue, we will do
so.</div><a name="0607194000591"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000993"></a>Mr.

respond.</div><a name="0607194000593"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000995"></a>Mr.

mean that an institution instructed by the company to place the shares
could be ordered to purchase the shares for the institution? Secondly,
could that be used to get the company to repurchase shares that it had

other provisions&#151;for instance, the requirement that the company

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194000999"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The current requirement is that a statutory
declaration be made when a company applies for a trading certificate as
a public company. That will change to a requirement to make a statement
of compliance, which will not need to be witnessed. It will also be
permissible to make the statement in paper or electronic form. The
explanatory notes say that it will be for the registrar&#146;s rules
to specify who may make a statement. As such statements are obviously
important documents, will the Minister confirm who will be able to make
them?</div><a name="0607194000608"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194001000"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> As I read the clause, it will be a matter for the
registrar to set that out in her rules. I imagine that the answer is
therefore that the registrar will undoubtedly consult on the rules and
at that point we shall see, but it is not a matter for us; it is a
matter for the
registrar.</div><a name="0607194000609"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="Column"><a name="Column832" />Column number: 833</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) for the purposes of section 91, the date of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194001003"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Section 118 of the 1985 Act provides for public
companies to have a minimum share capital of &#163;50,000. The clause
implements article 6 of the second company law directive, 77/91/EC,
although the directive provides only for a minimum of 25,000 ecu,
expressed in local currency. Clearly, that minimum is
significantly less than the &#163;50,000 requirement in the
UK.</div><a name="0607194000614"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 513
is probing and it has been tabled for two reasons. First, if the Bill
is deregulatory, why should we not make it easier for companies to go
public, and why is the &#163;50,000 requirement being retained? What
good comes of it? Secondly, we have just been debating the possibility
that a court may force re-registration of a private company that offers
shares to the public. Would that not become more palatable if the
statutory minimum capitalisation figure were
reduced?</div><a name="0607194000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
514 is intended to cater for the new provisions that facilitate
adoption by companies of share capital denoted in a foreign currency.
That process requires a date to be set for the prevailing exchange rate
to be determined, and our suggestion is the one proposed in the
amendment.</div><a name="0607194000616"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194001004"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> On the first question, we have merely taken forward
the company law review&#146;s propositions and conclusions. It
thought, and we saw no reason to disagree, that a minimum share capital
of &#163;50,000 is commensurate with the benefits that flow from plc
status. If the authorised minimum needed to be increased or reduced as
a result of amendments to the second company law directive, the change
could be made by regulations under section 2(2) of the European
Communities Act 1972.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column833" />Column number: 834</div><a name="0607194000617"></a><div class="hs_Para">The subject matter of amendment
No. 514 was considered when the Bill was dealt with in Grand Committee.
Reference was made to the case of re Scandinavian Bank Group plc, in
which Mr. Justice Harman took the view that article 6 seemed to require
EU member states to impose on public companies incorporated within the
EU a minimum share capital in their own currency.</div>
<a name="0607194000618"></a><div class="hs_Para">When there is a redenomination,
people can re-denominate into euros. Therefore, the only aspect of the
amendment with which I have some sympathy is the question whether
people should be able to denominate in the first instance in either
pounds sterling or euros. Both would have to be provided for, and we
shall examine that on Report.</div>
<a name="0607194000619"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194001005"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to
consider that. For the record, that is a practical matter that comes up
quite frequently, particularly when companies account in a currency
other than sterling. It therefore makes sense to have their share
capital denominated in the accounting currency as well. I have seen
absurd situations in which a company has created classes of share to
deal with that, reserving a &#163;50,000 share capital in sterling
merely to comply with this measure. I am gratified and welcome the
right hon. Lady&#146;s
comment.</div><a name="0607194000620"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194001006"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I should make it clear that we are not talking
about all currencies. There can be denomination either in sterling or
in euros. Otherwise, there are problems with exchange rate
definitions.</div><a name="0607194000621"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607194001007"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for her response. The
&#163;50,000 amendment was probing and her comments on different
currencies being used have been helpful. We look forward to seeing what
the Government come up with in due course. On that basis, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
