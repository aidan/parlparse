<H2><center>Standing Committee B</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 15 December 1998</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. George Stevenson in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/003/1999003.htm">Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health </B>(Mr. John Hutton): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, if proceedings on the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Tuesday 12 January at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are extremely fortunate to have two excellent Chairmen to guide us through the Committee stage of the Bill. There is a small possibility that we shall not complete our proceedings on the Bill today. If that is the case, we are ready to continue proceedings into January. As we made clear on Second Reading, the Bill is worth a considerable amount of money to the national health service&#151;we estimate between &#163;120 and &#163;160 million&#151;which will be welcome news to our hard-pressed hospitals. Although we want to ensure that hon. Members are given ample opportunity to consider the Bill in detail, we want it to progress to completion as soon as possible, because the money that it will raise is an additional resource for the national health service and will go directly into the front line. I am sure that, whatever view they took on Second Reading, all members of the Committee will want those new resources to reach our hospitals as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton):</B> I echo the Minister's comments in welcoming you, Mr. Stevenson, and Mr. Gale to the Chair. We look forward to being as constructive as possible in examining the Bill clause by clause. I do not know whether it is the imminent spirit of Christmas or a new-found spirit among this responsible Opposition, but we do not intend to dwell on the sittings motion and prefer to get on with the business in hand. Like the Minister, we look forward to examining the Bill in detail. We know that it is a surreptitious attempt to introduce the sort of charges that the Government always used to rail against when in opposition, and we shall demonstrate that with proper argument during the proceedings.
<P>
<B>Dr. Evan Harris </B>(Oxford, West and Abingdon): This is my first opportunity to address a Committee as NHS spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, and I am delighted to serve on a Committee chaired by you, Mr. Stevenson, and by Mr. Gale. I hope that you will be patient with me if, from time to time, I show my lack of experience.
<P>
I understand that it is usual practice to consider the potential for extra days rather than just the one Tuesday in January that has been indicated. I also understand that there may be an issue relating to business before the whole House because the proposals of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons, which will be discussed tomorrow evening, may affect Thursday sittings. Can the Minister tell us how the decisions made tomorrow night may affect sittings of the Committee, if our proceedings go beyond one more day in January?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Are you, Minister, in a position to respond to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I want to be as constructive and informative as I possibly can, but I am not sure whether I can shed any light on that particular issue at the moment, other than to repeat what I said in moving the sittings motion: that we want the Committee stage to be concluded as soon as possible as far as is compatible with proper scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, if proceedings on the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Tuesday 12 January at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I need to make two or three announcements before we proceed. I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. I am told that copies of it are available in the Room. I also remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments, which is of course reasonable and proper. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments at morning or afternoon sittings.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Payment for hospital treatment of traffic casualties</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, after first `a', insert `direct'.
<P>
This is to seek clarification of what the Minister thinks would be a reasonable charge on insurance companies following road accidents. It was not clear to everyone on Second Reading&#151;I was surprised to hear this raised by people outside the House&#151;that the provisions apply only to third parties injured in road traffic accidents. Under clause 1, it is only third parties who can claim compensation from an insurance company. Most people assume that if they, as drivers, drive into a tree, they will be caught by the provisions. It is important for the Government to clarify that that will not be the case and that only in a proportion of road traffic accidents will insurance companies have to make a payment to the national health service.
<P>
It is therefore important to be clear that the liability of insurance companies to the NHS will be limited only to third parties who suffer injuries as a direct result of road traffic accidents. I can envisage a number of scenarios where that might not be clear. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for South Swindon (Ms Drown) serving on the Committee. She has great experience of the NHS&#151;if not on the clinical side of its work, then certainly on the paper-chasing side because she was the finance director of the trust in my constituency where I worked briefly as a junior doctor. I am pleased to say that we had no run-ins there.
<P>
The hon. Lady will know that defining what treatment stems from an initial action or presentation to hospital is not easily separated from follow-up work that may or may not be related to an incident or condition that brought a person to hospital in the first place. For example, people who witness an accident but who are not involved in the direct impact may suffer as a result, perhaps from cardiac symptoms. The shock of witnessing an accident or being involved in a near miss has been known to precipitate cardiac symptoms and conditions&#151;in the most brutal case, a heart attack. Similarly, people involved in an accident but who have no initial signs of damage may later report whiplash, although one might argue that that is a direct, albeit delayed, result of an accident, or post-traumatic stress. People involved in accidents often report that the biggest effect on their lives was not so much the flesh injury but the psychological effects of the shock of being involved in, or being witness, to it. Without this clarifying amendment it is not clear that only direct results of an accident, such as orthopaedic injuries, will be covered by the Bill.
<P>
The Minister may argue&#151;I hope that he does not object to me pre-empting him&#151;that the charges will cover what is defined later in the clause; that is, when a compensation payment has been made by an insurance company in respect of an injury or death. In other words, if an insurance company agrees that the condition for which a person is being treated is a result of an accident, that should be sufficient evidence for it to be covered by the Bill and for the NHS to be reimbursed by the insurer. Clause 1(1)(b) is then the precipitating factor. However, there will often be more than one pathology. An orthopaedic injury may result directly from the accident, but there may be other symptoms that are not so clearly a direct result of the accident&#151;for example, post-traumatic stress&#151;which may not be easily traceable to the initial impact. If an insurance company pays compensation linked to a flesh-and-bone or orthopaedic injury, but does not recognise other injuries which the claimant attributes to the accident, will the NHS be entitled to bill the insurance company for the cost of treating the latter injuries? That is not clear in the Bill and the amendment would clarify the matter by adding a further qualification requiring the injury to be a ``direct'' result of the accident. That would minimise the payments payable by the insurance company to the NHS. Liberal Democrats do not want the NHS to be deprived of funding, but, as we said on Second Reading, we do not support the principle of levying charges on users indirectly through insurance premiums. The amendment would narrow the criteria and prevent insurance premiums from escalating further than they are doomed to do. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that.
<P>
A third-party victim of a road traffic accident may be seen for follow-up as an out-patient and another condition may become apparent which later requires in-patient treatment. That condition may be due to the road traffic accident, or it may have existed prior to the accident without the victim being aware of it. People, rightly, expect compensation for injuries that deprive them of an income and may claim compensation. A condition may have pre-existed without the patient's knowledge and it may be difficult, with the best will in the world, to clarify whether it was caused by the accident or existed prior to the accident and was merely brought to light by hospital investigations following the accident. If such a condition requires out-patient treatment, there would be a flat-rate charge and no additional liability to the NHS; if in-patient treatment is required, it is not clear whether causation must be proven or whether the Bill relies on a compensation payment specifying a list of ailments and conditions, some of which only later come to light.
<P>
There are thus two problems. First, an insurance company may make a compensation payment ostensibly, but perhaps not explicitly, for an orthopaedic or soft tissue injury and other conditions may present later which are less clearly identified with the road traffic accident. Secondly, a condition may be picked up on arrival at hospital which cannot easily be seen to be a direct result of the accident, but could be. It is important to clarify the matter, because if the Minister cannot say which pathologies are to be picked up by subsection 1(a), Opposition Members will find it hard to understand the figures mentioned on Second Reading, which, I believe, the Minister intends to specify in regulations: &#163;435 a day for an in-patient and &#163;354 a day for an out-patient. The Liberal Democrats hope that those figures were not plucked from a hat. However, given that it is hard to see what conditions the clause will cover, how can the figures be anything other than a guesstimate?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State made it clear that those figures had been derived through clever calculation, which was intended to cover entirely the cost of treating road traffic accident victims who are third parties&#151;although that was not made clear on Second Reading. I cannot believe that adequate data are available specifically on the cost of road traffic accidents for third parties including, for example, out-patients who receive psychological treatment for severe post-traumatic stress, or injuries that may or may not have been related to the accident.
<P>
An insurance company may well specify the conditions for which they are making payment, and the NHS may well issue a bill in accordance with those conditions, but my hon. Friends and I remain less than confident that the figures of &#163;435 for an in-patient and &#163;354 for an out-patient were not plucked from the air. If &#163;435 is indeed the average cost of one night in an orthopaedic in-patient bed&#151;which is one basis on which road traffic accident hospital charges might be costed&#151;the Government clearly do not anticipate asking insurance companies to pay compensation for conditions and treatments other than orthopaedic.
<P>
The Government have defended their proposals in part by saying that they will raise a significant amount of money&#151;between &#163;120 million and &#163;160 million. However, the clause does not specify the directness of the injury for which the NHS might seek payment from insurance companies and the Motor Insurance Bureau. That vagueness does not suggest that the figures were derived with confidence. Will the Minister explain how the figures relate to the cost of in-patient or out-patient treatment resulting from road traffic injury?

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I have listened carefully to the comments of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris). I have a measure of sympathy with what is a simple, sensible tidying-up amendment. In matters such as this, precision is of great importance. At the moment, the clause is insufficiently precise.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman proposes inserting the word, ``direct'' in front of the word, ``result''. Much of the need to do so hangs on the word, ``injury'', the meaning of which the Minister should explain. Does ``injury'' mean physical injury, or will it include the sort of psychological stress and disorder that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon described?
<P>
Since the Bill was drafted, litigation has exploded. It now covers many of the psychological consequences of accidents, whether they are horrible public ones or smaller private ones. If the word ``direct'' is not included in the legislation, the clause will be vague and will allow for the definition of compensation and injury to spill over into many areas that were not intended. The Committee might consider, for instance, the case in today's papers of a policeman who has been awarded compensation&#151;&#163;75,000, I think&#151;for the mental or psychological injury he suffered as a result of attending a horrible road accident. The current drafting of the clause will allow the hospital that treated that policeman to seek to recoup&#151;through the compensation recovery unit&#151; some of the costs of that treatment from the insurance company.
<P>
I do not think that the Minister intends that such a case should be within the scope of the Bill, but its current drafting will allow the CRU to interpret the Bill to include such a case. If the word ``direct'' is not included in the Bill today, the Minister must make a clear statement to allay any doubt in the future. He might argue that ``injury'' clearly means physical injury; it does not. He should consider moving an amendment on Report to make it clear that it means physical injury and not psychological stress, which increasingly forms part of many compensation claims.
<P>
The Minister might also say that the issue is whether there has been a fault in the use of the vehicle; but he is well aware that subsection (9) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is irrelevant whether a compensation payment is made with or without an admission of liability.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I therefore concur with the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that the clause widens the scope of the Bill into areas that were not intended. Liability is irrelevant and therefore does not preclude the kind of treatment that he and I describe. The Bill must make it clear that the injury must be physical or that any injury that earns compensation must result directly&#151;not obliquely&#151;from the accident.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon for the helpful intentions that lay behind his amendment. However, he and the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) have made a mountain out of a molehill. I do not believe that the current wording of the clause is unclear in respect of what types of injuries and what sorts of claims are covered; it is very clear. The amendment would provide no practical benefit; the opposite would be the case. For reasons that I shall spell out in a second, I shall ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if the hon. Gentleman presses it to a vote.
<P>
The effect of the amendment would be to restrict NHS charges to cases where the direct cause of injury or death is the use of a motor vehicle. That could lead to problems in cases of recognised complications. A recognised complication of a fracture in young, otherwise healthy people is pulmonary embolism, as I am sure the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is aware. One of the consequences of the amendment might be to invite the kind of argumentative approach to a certificate of NHS charges that we&#151;and, I am sure, the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members&#151;would want to prevent. We therefore cannot support the amendment.
<P>
The current wording of the clause is clear&#151;NHS charges are payable when the use of a motor vehicle is the cause of death or injury. Both hon. Gentlemen drew attention to cases where people might suffer psychological injury. Those cases are covered by the Bill's wording for the simple reason that all cases in which NHS treatment is received and in which there is a payment of compensation under third-party insurance will be covered. The Bill therefore does not purport to draw a distinction between psychological and physical injury, for very good reasons. Importing the word ``direct'' into the Bill could suggest that some treatments, which are undoubtedly needed as a result of an accident, might not be covered by the scheme for recovering charges, and we do not want to give that impression.
<P>
Earlier I cited an example to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon about young and otherwise healthy adults who face the risk of a pulmonary embolism after a fracture. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would create an unhelpful degree of uncertainty about whether treatment for a pulmonary embolism that arose from a fracture that was caused by the use of a motor vehicle would be covered by the Bill. We do not want to inject such uncertainty into the Bill&#151;we want the system to be clear and concise.
<P>
The amendment would muddy the waters rather than throw helpful light on to the situation.
<P>
I must also make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that if an insurer is genuinely concerned about paying for treatment that is unconnected with an accident, the Bill will create, for the first time, a proper appeals mechanism through which insurers will have an opportunity to argue such matters. I draw his attention to the fact that, although the Association of British Insurers welcomes any attempt to avoid spurious claims, it said that the amendment would not be helpful because disputes would still be likely about the phrase ``direct result'', which the amendment would add to the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised&#151;quite ingeniously, to give him due credit&#151;a point about the proposed tariff regime. The costs on which we based the tariff system derive from average treatment profiles of road traffic accident victims. The figures that we used to calculate the tariffs came from detailed work that was carried out over a lengthy period in the Manchester region by my colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, as part of their road safety work. Our proposals are firmly based on evidence and proper research.
<P>
For the reasons that I have given, I cannot accept the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks, but I must press him for further clarification. I fear that no more than half of one of my questions has so far been answered. I do not doubt that he is capable of answering my questions&#151;they are not especially difficult&#151;and I am sure that a Minister of his undoubted ability can add further to our debate.
<P>
I welcome the remarks of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, but I concur with the Minister's response to one of the hon. Gentleman's points. Clearly, psychological and psychiatric injuries are injuries. That might not be clear to a layperson who reads the Bill, but legally&#151;and certainly clinically&#151;psychiatric or psychological injuries are injuries. The Minister's remarks were helpful, and I am grateful to him for supporting the thrust of my earlier comments.
<P>
The Minister claimed that the amendment makes a mountain out of a molehill, but his choice of words was rather unfortunate. The situation involved is anything other than a small affair, especially in relation to the injuries sustained and to the questionable cases that I raised. It is also no small affair to the insurance industry or to people who insure their cars and who may face rising bills because of the apparently huge potential costs for which they may be liable through their insurance policies. The proposal is much more of a mountain than a molehill to someone on a fixed or low income. I regret that the Minister feels that the Bill's wording is not unclear&#151;it is still unclear to me, as I shall explain.
<P>
The Minister quite reasonably mentioned pulmonary embolism, which follows a leg fracture. That could be conceded to be a direct result of the fracture, and of the immobility and local tissue damage in the leg that is a consequence of the fracture. Clearly, the fractured leg is a direct result of the accident, so I have no problem with the idea that a pulmonary embolus in hospital, or, indeed, later on, could be considered to be a result of a road traffic accident. My problem is with conditions that might not be seen to be a direct result. We have no argument about what is clearly covered; our argument is about what might not be covered.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to suggest to the Minister two other scenarios&#151;now that he is moving more into my field and away from that of the lawyers who draft Bills. Another consequence of a fracture is infection of the wound, especially if it is an open wound. That, again, is sometimes a direct result of the fracture, which, itself, is a direct result of the road traffic accident in this example. However, some infections are not a direct result of the accident. For example, hospital-acquired infections are due not to bacteria that get into the body through the wound at the scene of the accident, which is where one might see common infections of wounds, but to bacteria that are unique to hospitals. Such infections are the result of hospitalisation and sometimes, although not always, the result of unfortunate, although not necessarily negligent, cross-infection in hospitals. That is a common and significant concern because other people may catch those infections, not only to wounds but as is more common, to the lung as a chest infection or pneumonia. That especially affects the elderly and frail.
<P>
Therefore, the Minister must explain why, if pneumonia is caught in hospital by two people, one of whom is in hospital because of a broken leg following a road traffic accident, and the other of whom is there because of a cardiac problem, for only one of them will the NHS be able to claim against car insurance. This is despite the fact that the same agent&#151;that is, the person from whom the pneumonia has been caught&#151;is likely to have infected both of them, and has no relation to the road traffic accident. These are murky areas, which is why I would have preferred the Minister to accept the amendment and recognise that the clause needs to be more tightly worded. This law should not venture into areas relating to consequent problems, which can be much further removed from the direct cause of the injury than the easy example he gave of pulmonary embolism.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if an infection is the result of hospital conditions, many people in a ward or certain part of the hospital will catch that particular infection, so the individual involved in the traffic accident could be easily identified?
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> That may be the point that I am making. I believe that the hon. Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) is saying, in his example, that everyone is getting the infection, which is the consequence of there being a bug in the hospital and not the result of the accident. Therefore, it would then not be possible to claim against insurance for the pneumonia caught by a person in hospital following a road traffic accident. I invite the hon. Gentleman&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore (Hendon)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> &#151;or one of his colleagues, to clarify whether, if five or 10 people on a ward, only one of whom is a road traffic accident victim, catch hospital-acquired pneumonia, it would be possible for the NHS to claim against the insurance company for that pneumonia and the consequent longer stay in hospital, which may be significant&#151;indeed, it is usually that, rather than the simple fracture, which keeps people in hospital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill on this issue because it is a straightforward problem that has tested personal injury litigation for many a year. Insurers have paid out personal injury compensation in the past for such cases. If it turns out that the problem is not directly related, it is dealt with in law as a novus actus interveniens. I can see no reason why the same principle should not apply to recovery under the Bill. The issue is straightforward: if an insurance company pays out personal injury compensation for an accident, it will pay out for medical treatment. I do not understand the difficulty.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman in so far as I can understand his remarks, but my first language is English. Except when it comes to medical terms, when I am prepared&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is important that we understand what hon. Members say. The last Committee that I chaired was full of lawyers and we might have our fair share of doctors on this Committee. We must therefore be a little careful and hon. Members must be helpful. I do, however, understand repetition, which I am sure hon. Members will wish to avoid.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> If the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) is patient, I shall invite him to clarify his point. Despite the amount of Latin that I picked up from my medical training, I tend to stick to words such as pneumonia. I do not attempt to name bacteria, notably because of the embarrassment that that causes me when I refer to the wrong one, but because of the difficulties that it might cause some members of the Committee, although I am sure that that does not include you, Mr. Stevenson. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he clarifies his point in English.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I should be happy to.
<P>
The legal principle is straightforward. If medical consequences naturally flow from the injury&#151;that includes surrounding medical treatment and conditions in the hospital&#151;then it is recoverable in law through the ordinary form of personal injury compensation. The same principle would apply to the Bill. If, however, something breaks the natural chain of causation&#151;for example, hospital negligence through not carrying out proper medical procedures&#151;that would be separately recoverable against the hospital for its negligence. Those simple principles have been applied in common law for many years. The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill. Such issues crop up in the courts every day and are easily resolved through the normal legal process.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification and I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify a matter that is not fully understood outside the Committee. Does he anticipate that when an insurance company makes a payment to a third party for injuries sustained in a road traffic accident, that that settlement, which is in place of legal action&#151;most settlements of road traffic accidents are not taken to court because insurance companies step in to avoid paying money to lawyers&#151;will cover injuries that are specified in the compensation payment? Is it his understanding that charges for treatment that have been incurred by the NHS should specify the same conditions that are listed in the compensation claim? That would solve the problem. Clarification of subsection (2) in respect of what compensation is to be paid to a third party by an insurance company would make me less likely to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon raised the separate issue of negligence. Does the Bill make it clear that it will not be easier for a hospital to attempt to obtain payments for costs incurred for treating the results of negligence, which may be dealt with by another department in the hospital, or will it be automatic that that will not be possible and that the legal process will have to be followed? Extensive charges may be payable because, sadly, many negligence cases lead to intensive care and prolonged stays in hospital. Hospitals will want to know whether that treatment, which is a result of road traffic accidents, is covered by the Bill, despite ongoing claims for negligence made against them.
<P>
Is it right that a hospital that meets the cost of complications that may have arisen from negligence should not be entitled to payment under the scheme, simply because a negligence action is under way that is seen to be the cause of greater in-patient stays and greater costs? I shall be happy to expand on that point if the Minister wishes me to do so.
<P>
In response to my remarks on the tariffs that he plans to set, the Minister has helpfully said that they are based on research. If he cannot give an explanation now, perhaps he could make available through the Library a copy of the research, which demonstrates how those costs were deduced. If the research shows that costs arising from the treatment of pulmonary embolism, or an infection acquired in hospital during the period of recovery from a road accident or of other co-pathologies caused by such an accident have not been factored in, but that only those costs arising from treatments that are almost exclusively orthopaedic have been factored in, we shall have little faith in the scale of charges. Without further clarification of the clause, we would doubt whether the scale of charges is commensurate with those made by hospitals.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call another hon. Member, I should say that, as is often the case, the first amendment has given rise to a number of matters. I am happy to give hon. Members the maximum amount of flexibility in this regard. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon agrees that we have moved on to ground that, in some ways, is covered by amendment No. 2. As we all wish to avoid repetition, I shall listen carefully to speeches made during the debate on that amendment. I shall also take the question of repetition into account during the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine):</B> When the Minister replies to the question about the scope of the research, will he say whether it broke down third-party costs only, or whether all road traffic accidents were included, regardless of the ability to claim third-party costs? Did the research home in on the kind of costs that the Bill will cover, or did it consider road traffic accidents generally? Perhaps he could also address the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon about the inclusion of consequential illnesses in the charging process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond to some of the points that have again been made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who seems to be trying to smooth talk me with his flattery.
<P>
I neither sought to evade any questions arising from the hon. Gentleman's opening remarks, nor to keep information from him&#151;far from it. I made a note that he asked me two questions: about claims, and about how we arrived at the costs. I answered both questions as fully as possible. He again raised the issue of direct injury. The Bill deals with that issue, as did my opening remarks. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) for pointing out to the hon. Gentleman the legal issues that apply in such cases. As I have tried to show, far from resolving the issues it seeks to address, the amendment would be an open invitation to muddy the waters.
<P>
We want the scheme to run smoothly. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Bill provides for an appeals mechanism, through which questions of cause and consequence can be dealt with. As I said, it would not be appropriate for the clause to address such issues.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman again asked about costs and where we obtained the research and information. The document was published in 1995 by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Scotland, the document covers all costs.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> We have 72 hon. Members from Scotland in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I intended no discourtesy to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith). I simply did not know his constituency. I do not want to prolong the debate. We have been round the houses and the hon. Gentleman is reading too much into this part of the Bill. I accept that his motives are helpful, but his amendment would not provide the clarity that he wants. We have established legal procedures and a new appeal mechanism to resolve the issues.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful for you comments, Mr. Stevenson. I shall not reiterate any of the points that I have made&#151;it was never my intention to do so&#151;because we have had a wide-ranging debate.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's reference to the research on which the tariffs are based. The key question is whether that research is valid for the tariffs. Most road accidents involve the first party and only a proportion involve the third party, so the figures may not be accurate, particularly if the pattern of injuries to the third party does not reflect the overall pattern of injuries and, therefore, their overall cost. I shall study the research and perhaps explore the matter further.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On appeals, I would have thought that good legislation does not rely on the standby of an appeals procedure. If complications arise from bad drafting, an appeals procedure may become clogged up. We should not rely on an appeals provision to deal with questions that should be clarified during discussion of the Bill before it is enacted. I may return to the matter when discussing appeals to see whether there is over-reliance on appeals when amendments could be made to the Bill.
<P>
In the light of the Minister's reference to the research on which he based the tariffs, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 5, in page 2, line 19, leave out ``appropriate''.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am pleased to be able to speak to these important amendments, which show that on the Bill's key issues, it is the Liberal Democrats, and not the Conservatives, are providing the scrutiny and opposition.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that there is a mechanism by which to regulate the charges if it is considered wrong for the NHS to charge people, albeit indirectly through their insurance companies, the full whack. The amendments would allow Ministers to fix a proportion of the denoted costs without having to say that their estimates of costs were wrong. A future Government, particularly a Liberal Democrat one, could set the proportion of the charges at zero if the amendment were adopted. No charges would therefore be payable under clause 1 although the Act would stay on the statute book in case something happened that made the imposition of such charges seem to be reasonable. We made it clear earlier that we do not regard that as an acceptable way to fund the NHS. Allowing the Government&#151;and Parliament&#151;to alter through regulations the amount of the charge that is collectable will give flexibility to the legislation. Amendment No. 3 is especially relevant in that regard. The associated bureaucracy, although it is limited and represents an improvement on the previous system, would, unfortunately, have to be covered by a proportion of the charges. The compensation recovery unit will be responsible for that, and patient records will be recorded for third-party road traffic accidents. If the Government merely want to cover the costs of setting up that flawed procedure, they could, if they accepted the amendments, use regulations to fix approximately the proportion of the charges to the cost of running the system. I accept that that would turn the proposal into a pure research exercise, but&#151;notwithstanding the Minister's reference to some 1995 research&#151;I strongly believe that that research should have been done and that the system should be based on better figures than those that have so far come to light.
<P>
Does the Minister consider such flexibility a useful mechanism? Would the Government use it to reduce the level of charges that are payable to the NHS? He might find on reflection that the tariffs that he set were unworkable or unreasonable, and he might not want to make a reduction by cutting the tariff&#151;although we believe that no tariff could be deemed to be correct on the data that is available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The amendment risks turning the Bill into a frightful mess, and it could be to the detriment of those who have to calculate compensation figures with their insurance company. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said that we were not an effective Opposition, but we have covered part of the matter in amendment No. 10, which appears in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms). It calls on the Secretary of State to explain
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the basis of his cost calculations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 2 and those grouped with it would do that in part, but they would make the entire system of calculation messy and possibly inconsistent and inequitable across the national health service. They would also remove the cap on the charges. If only a proportionate charge were involved, in some extreme cases the treatment that is given to a patient could be very expensive. If the figure were set at 10 or 20 per cent., an insurance company's bill would be very high, and it might not have previously contemplated that expense or budgeted for it. The abolition of a cap would remove an important and principled element of the basis on which charges in the Bill will be levied.
<P>
I am perplexed by the latest Liberal Democrat proposal for facing two ways at once. They want to have the proportionate charges set at zero but they want the legislation to remain on the statute book, which takes us into the realms of fantasy and nonsense.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The hon. Gentleman may not understand the fact that constructive opposition means opposing when it is necessary but accepting&#151;in view of the Government's majority and their apparent unwillingness to climb down over the way in which the revenue should be raised&#151;that the proposal may well become law. Our proposal would give us the flexibility later on to reduce the costs. If the Government are persuaded that insurance premiums have risen, our proposal will make it possible for them to be reduced, but it will also ensure that a fixed, and still capped, proportion of charges is payable through the relevant mechanism to the NHS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> If that is the logic of the hon. Gentleman's position, I look forward to him pressing the amendment to a Division. If he does not, we will know that everything that he has just said has not been valid for even 30 minutes.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> My experience of other Committees tells me that an amendment can often be brought back on Report, at which stage it may be honed to a finer point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> As I am sure the hon. Gentleman realises, an amendment that is discussed in great detail in Committee is not normally brought back on Report. I look forward, in a very unholy alliance with the Government, to the two Liberal Democrat Members on the Committee pressing the amendment to a Division, which will demonstrate the absurdity of their party's position.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon mentioned that he might want to set the proportion at zero, 1 per cent.&#151;everything seems to be 1 per cent. in his party&#151;or perhaps just a penny. None the less, there is a cap. The amendment does not allow for a cap, and in the absence of such a cap my earlier comments remain valid. That raises the question of what the charges are at present, and whether a strong argument exists for a fixed or proportional system. Such language raises many parallels, which I am sure will excite the hon. Gentleman. At present, the maximum fixed fees are &#163;295 for out-patient treatment and &#163;2,949 for hospital treatment. Within the existing structure, those fees do not seem too exhorbitant. If people have to have stitches, legs in plaster and other necessary medical attention after a nasty road accident, such fees are not extortionate or unreasonable. But as soon as&#151;or before&#151;the Bill receives Royal Assent, the fees will change by a significant amount. They will not just be increased in line with inflation over the past 10 years; their whole magnitude will alter.
<P>
The Minister must therefore tell the Committee the size and scale of charges to be attached to the Bill once enacted. The House has not been told&#151;I believe that, through a press release, everyone else has been&#151;that his Department's intention is to increase the maximum fee for such treatment to about &#163;10,000. That is not just inflation indexing but a four-fold increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> May I correct one inaccuracy in the hon. Gentleman's remarks? He said that the House had not been informed about the cap. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it quite clear on Second Reading&#151;at column 162&#151;that the cap would be &#163;10,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I stand corrected. I am grateful to the Minister, as he has confirmed my point that there will be an almost immediate four-fold increase in the cap. I think that I am right in saying that the maximum of &#163;10,000 would apply only to one person. If there were three people in a car, the cost would be &#163;30,000, which might lead to one insurance claim paid by one company. We should therefore be under no illusion that the sums to be paid as a result of the clause will be significant. As I said earlier, this represents an attempt by the Government&#151;in contradiction to everything they said before&#151;to charge for national health service treatment.
<P>
However much one might disapprove of the sly way in which the Government seek to levy charges on the national health service, it is better that we know the maximum than that we adopt the open-ended formula of the amendment. The Committee should vote against the amendment, as I know that the Liberal Democrats&#151;true to their word at every turn&#151;will force it to a Division. It would be better to set a clear cap&#151;which I hope to propose to the Committee later in our proceedings&#151;and to ask the Secretary of State to explain the basis of the calculation that led to the figure of &#163;10,000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall deal first with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. He claimed that the procedure in the Bill for recovering the cost of NHS treatment was flawed. It is not&#151;it is a well tested procedure that has applied to benefits recovery for a number of years. The procedure works effectively and it encourages good administration. It is the least bureaucratic option. The system is effective.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I accept what the Minister says. As procedures go, it is efficient. It is better than the dog's breakfast that exists now. My point is that the principle is flawed. I am sorry that I did not make it clear that it is this form of funding the NHS&#151;through indirect charges on users&#151;that is flawed.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We covered that ground comprehensively on Second Reading. The hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon and for Rutland and Melton, both raised the issue again today. No new NHS charges are in the Bill. That is clear. We are not departing from an established procedure. As I explained to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon on Second Reading, Liberal Democrat Members supported the procedure until an unspecified time in the recent past. On no previous occasion did they oppose similar legislation in the House of Commons.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is trying to introduce a regime for proportionality by specifying a fixed proportion of NHS costs that should be recovered. He did not raise a number of matters&#151;he appears not to have understood them. Who will fix the charges? I do not intend to provoke him into making further long speeches on what is a small amendment but, as I shall explain, the amendment is unhelpful. I urge my hon. Friends to reject it if it is pressed to a vote.
<P>
The Bill's intention&#151;the hon. Gentleman seems to have forgotten this&#151;is to allow the NHS to recover the full costs of treatment arising from road accidents. We made that position clear.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister is beginning to contradict himself. He said earlier that the intention is to receive costs for treating victims of third-party accidents, not of all road traffic accidents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not understand me. My remarks throughout the Committee's proceedings will relate to what is specified in the Bill. I took it as read that that would be so.
<P>
The intention behind the Bill is to allow the NHS to recover the costs of NHS treatment of road traffic accident victims who make successful claims for compensation. We made that clear on 2 July 1997. The amendment to recoup only a fixed proportion of the charges would not allow us to fulfil that aim, which is why my hon. Friends will vote against it.
<P>
Insurance companies will not face open-ended liability for charges. I have repeatedly made that clear. As the Secretary of State announced on Second Reading, we intend to set a cap of &#163;10,000 on the amount of charges payable in respect of any one accident victim for accidents occurring after 2 July 1997. The cap will be set in regulations and revised from time to time. The amendment would recover only a proportion of NHS charges. A fixed proportion of actual costs in each case will add to the bureaucracy of the scheme. We vigorously oppose that.
<P>
The tariff of charges prevents hospitals having to work out actual costs. That is one of the benefits of the simple scheme of recovery that we are establishing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> If that is so, could there not be many instances when the cost of treatment is less than the maximum charge? If hospitals will not calculate the exact cost of treatment, how can the Minister be sure that an insurance company will not be overcharged and that the NHS will not make a profit on the treatment of an accident victim?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman is arguing. Does he want to involve NHS trusts in providing arithmetic in response to individual claims for compensation? Perhaps he might like to discuss that with the NHS. The scheme is simple to administer. It will reduce the bureaucracy that his proposals would inevitably generate for the NHS. We believe that it is the job of the NHS to treat patients, not to get involved in administration of the bureaucracy that he is advocating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I put it to him one more time: if there is no calculation of costs, how can he be sure that, if an amount approaching &#163;10,000 or even less is charged, the NHS will not be making a profit on the treatment of an accident victim?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should make it clear that we are talking about a daily rate. We intend&#151;the Chancellor made this clear on 2 July&#151;to put in place a regime that will allow for full recovery of costs. Clearly, if we are to make progress, we must strike a balance between the need to recover costs and the need to keep bureaucracy to a minimum. We believe that the system outlined in the Bill represents the right balance between the need to recover costs, which is an established principle, and the need to minimise bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I want to support the Minister on the narrow point raised by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton. The problem with the fixed rate is not that the NHS might make a profit, even though it may do so notionally, but that there may be perverse incentives, which we shall consider later. It is surprising to hear a Conservative spokesman expressing concern that people may make profits out of illness because that concern is not something that I had previously associated with the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask hon. Members who intervene not to refer to previous contributions or to anticipate contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I shall not respond to the invitation of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, charming though it was.
<P>
My final point on the amendment is that the proposed tariff system has been welcomed by the insurance industry and the national health service. For those obvious and strong reasons, I shall not advise my hon. Friends to accept the amendment, which would detract from the simplicity, and add to the bureaucracy, of the scheme, and take us no further forward in meeting our objective of allowing the NHS to recover costs incurred by third-party claims for insurance from road traffic accident victims.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> May I deal briefly with the point made by the Minister tangentially, that the Liberal Democrats have not previously opposed such charges. I refer him to the answer that I gave on Second Reading: the Labour party did not even presage these extra charges in its manifesto. Therefore, it is not safe for the Minister to rely on past records.
<P>
I want to defend the substance of the amendment. I noted that the Minister did not support the view of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that the amendment is poor because it abolishes the cap. No cap is abolished by the amendment. We believe that the proportion should be fixed by regulation, and that the cap should still apply and should still be fixed by regulation. Therefore, I do not accept most of the Conservative spokesman's criticisms of the amendment because I do not believe that there is a drafting error. If a drafting error had been proved, I should, of course, have been happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I am pleased that, in his later remarks, the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton seemed to support the thrust of the amendments which would introduce flexibility to the amount that can be charged. We consider that the Government's ability to charge 100 per cent. of tariffed, capped costs does not allow sufficient flexibility for reconsideration later on, notwithstanding a subsequent amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, so we intend to press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I hope that my question will not be associated with going in different directions at the same time. I should like a clearer answer on the setting of tariffs in the long term. Research from Manchester covers all road traffic accidents and current treatment regimes. How can we keep track of changes in the treatment of road traffic accident victims, methods of response and the nature of accidents? As cars become safer and driving improves, we hope that the consequences of road traffic accidents and their overall cost will decrease.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I anticipated the hon. Gentleman's comments in amendment No. 10.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we shall come to that amendment in due course.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Hospitals in north-east Scotland are exploring the idea of hotel accommodation for patients who live far from a hospital and need treatment but not overnight nursing care. Would such patients be out-patients or in-patients under the charging mechanism?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I cannot reply in detail to the hon. Gentleman's question, but I will consider it and write to him. I remind him and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that the amendment would introduce a fixed proportion for recovery of the cost of treating road traffic accident victims. I understood that the Liberal Democrats were opposed to any such charging and I am puzzled that they can reconcile recovery of some charges with their opposition to the principle of charging.
<P>
It may be helpful if I respond a little more fully to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. Whether charges are made for out-patient or in-patient treatment will depend on whether the patient has been admitted to hospital.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> In reply to the Minister, it is important to state that it is reasonable for a party that is opposed to a principle to work constructively to amend and improve the Bill. I do not accept his argument that because we oppose the principle, we cannot try, by tabling amendments, to reduce the effect of what may be a large rise in insurance premiums for people on fixed or low incomes as a result of the NHS collecting more charges from insurance companies. Our position is reasonable and consistent. I emphasise that the amendment would not fix the costs; it would fix the proportion, which could be amended by regulation. It would provide a mechanism for a sliding scale to reduce the harsh effects of a possible large increase in insurance premiums. We want to improve the Bill and reduce its effect on people on low or fixed incomes. It has not been shown that there is a drafting error in the amendment&#151;the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton's suggestion was based only on a briefing from the Association of British Insurers, which misunderstood our amendment.

In view of the way in which the clause is drafted I do not see how the MIB will be brought under the remit of the Bill.

Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information Contained in Certificates</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 3, line 32, after `regulations', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``, approved by both Houses of Parliament''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is one of the most important amendments that we shall consider in Committee. It focuses on the major concerns that have been expressed about the regulations contained in clause 3(2), which specifies that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The amount or amounts to be specified are to be those set out, or determined in accordance with, regulations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendment would seek to ensure the approval of those regulations by both Houses of Parliament. Clearly, that would ensure that the detail is scrutinised with maximum expertise.
<P>
In many cases, regulations are relatively trivial and straightforward. However, the regulations in question have been criticised because the specified amounts&#151;and perhaps the specified cap&#151;are wrong. Not only are the amounts too high or too low, but because they may not relate accurately to actual costs, perverse incentives will be introduced.
<P>
I shall return to the perverse incentives that result from the haphazard or reckless fixing of cost through regulations when we debate amendment No. 9. Those incentives relate to the problems associated with treating people at home for injuries that might be treated in hospital. Other perverse incentives may be introduced by the tariff of charges to which the Secretary of State referred on Second Reading. Those charges are &#163;435 a day for the treatment of an in-patient, and &#163;354 a day for any form of out-patient treatment, regardless of the number of appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred incorrectly to the out-patient fee as a daily rate fee. It is a flat, fixed-rate fee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I was making that point in a paraphrased way&#151;the fee is fixed at &#163;354, and is effectively a single rate for one day or for nine days. However, I accept the Minister's point that it is a flat rate, regardless of the number of out-patient appointments. Indeed, a person who is seen by a hospital casualty department, but who is not admitted as an in-patient, will attract the &#163;354 charge if he or she is a third party and if a successful claim is made against the insurance company concerned. Similarly, a person who is seen by a hospital, whether or not he or she is admitted, and who is subsequently seen on a number of occasions by the out-patient debt, will not attract any larger a sum.
<P>
I think that the Committee can see the problems that may arise from the perverse incentive for hospitals to ensure a reduction in the number of out-patient episodes. There will be an incentive to treat patients as in-patients for three, four or five days, rather than to discharge them as soon as possible and rely on subsequent multiple out-patient return visits.
<P>
Hospitals will quickly cotton on to those cases where third parties might be able to make compensation claims. Clearly, such hospitals will realise that greater funding will be obtained by admitting people as in-patients, and that funding will be lost if people are treated as out-patients on multiple occasions.
<P>
It is my view&#151;and I had thought that it was the Government's view&#151;that decisions on the appropriateness of the setting of care, whether in-patient or out-patient, should be purely clinical. Given the problems in the health service, we should not allow the creation of such a direct and obvious incentive for the NHS to treat people not as out-patients but as in-patients who are then discharged completely. Those perverse incentives should not be allowed free rein for obvious reasons.
<P>
Because of the dangers of hospital-acquired infection and the difficulties of recovering and recuperating in a busy hospital, there is a trend in modern medicine, which is based on good clinical practice, towards early discharge with out-patient follow-up. Hospitals are dangerous places to be for patients and&#151;I might even say&#151;for members of staff; they are certainly dangerous places for in-patients because of complication rates. The way in which the tariffs are fixed could cause a reversal of the trend towards out-patient treatment and home care, which I will deal with in a later amendment.
<P>
The Minister should explain how such a perverse incentive will be avoided, how trusts will be monitored to ascertain whether in-patient stays for third-party road traffic accidents increase after the Bill is enacted and whether he is cognisant of the need to revisit the question of the fixed single charge for out-patients in regulations. Bringing those regulations before both Houses of Parliament will enable those Members and peers with relevant expertise to make it clear to the Government how bizarre it is to have a fixed out-patient rate.
<P>
My second worry about the incentive is that I do not believe that purchasers, which the Government have renamed as ``commissioners'', will be indifferent to the financial effects of the Bill. When regulations are made&#151;I fear that they will not be subject to sufficient scrutiny if the amendment is not accepted&#151;purchasers will calculate that hospitals will derive extra money from collecting charges. Indeed, the Government have admitted that the NHS&#151;certainly the main orthopaedic departments or hospitals that treat the casualties of road traffic accidents&#151;will receive extra money, which it is estimated will be between &#163;120 million and &#163;160 million. It will be interesting to see whether, in addition to the study the Minister mentioned earlier, any other data shows that that will be the case.
<P>
Primary care groups or the existing health authorities and fundholders, will cut their contracts for the treatment of victims of road traffic accidents in the knowledge of that extra stream of revenue for trusts. That is normal, sophisticated purchaser practice and hospitals will therefore be driven to ensure that that new stream of revenue is maximised. Purchasers will expect hospitals to behave as businesses&#151;which is what trusts, sadly, must now do&#151;and maximise their income. Clinical directors who are cognisant of their budget will know the financial benefit of retaining as in-patients third parties who are likely to receive a compensation payment from an insurance company. This is especially the case when those in-patients have almost recovered and require minimal nursing, the cost of which is likely to be less than the average of &#163;435 per day. What will prevent clinical directors from prolonging those stays themselves or coming under pressure from hospital managers to do so? Clearly, clinical directors are subject to conflicting demands&#151;they have waiting list initiative patients and other patients to admit to those beds&#151;but in some hospitals they will come under pressure from commissioners to increase other revenue streams so that funding can be switched to other areas.
<P>
Such a perverse incentive will act to keep people in hospital. That is wrong on clinical grounds, and we should not create a climate in which people are asked to make decisions on financial grounds when the question should be about the clinical practice of orthopaedic or other wards, keeping people in hospital appropriately.
<P>
In moving the amendment, I want reassurance from the Minister that he is aware of the problem. It was not clear on Second Reading that the problem that I have specified here was recognised. Will the hon. Gentleman accept the amendment, which would at least allow Parliament as a whole to decide, given the experience of hon. Members of all parties, whether these perverse incentives exist, by applying scrutiny that would not otherwise be available through the usual system of passing regulations in Standing Committee?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I concur with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon although I put a slightly different emphasis on the argument in its support. To me, and to the Conservative party, it endorses a fundamental tenet of democratic accountability&#151;which is that one should not raise money from people without it being approved by Parliament. It is a small example of the old cry, ``no taxation without representation''. It is a simple requirement that the Executive should be held to account by Parliament and that it should not be able to raise money without Parliament's approval. We are already seeing the magnitude of an existing charge being increased almost fourfold, and if this happens again and again and probably, under the Government, again as well, it is only proper that it go before Parliament so that the exact detail can be pointed out.
<P>
There are all too many examples of the Government by-passing Parliament and of the Executive not being responsible to the House of Commons or, indeed, to the House of Lords, and of their feeling that they can by-pass Parliament at every stage for no good reason. Holding the Executive to account by requiring matters such as this to come before the House is an elementary democratic right, which is all that the amendment would give. For example, it would be absolutely inconceivable that a general rise in prescription charges could not be discussed by the House of Commons. In this case, significant amounts can be levied on insurance companies&#151;and, thereby, vicariously, on the people who pay insurance premiums&#151;and the matter risks not coming before the House of Commons. It should.
<P>
As we examine the clause in which regulations will define the amounts, I hope, Mr. Stevenson, that you will consider amendment No. 6 an appropriate one under which I may ask the Minister how the regulations will work. For example, if a compensation claim is awarded to an accident victim and, by virtue of these certificates and the actions of the compensation recovery unit under clause 3, a charge is levied on the insurance company as part of that whole policy settlement, will the charge through the CRU be deducted from the compensation payment awarded to the individual, or will the amount awarded by the court remain intact so that the charge on the insurance company allowing the national health service to recoup its treatment charges be separate from, and in addition to, the award? I should be grateful if the Minister would make his answer absolutely clear, to avoid any legal muddles in future.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I support the amendment. It is important that the Committee recognises, and the Government accept, what I am about to say. In line with all the other constitutional changes that will free up Westminster to scrutinise legislation more closely&#151;it will no longer be a problem for the House to find time to debate Scottish and Welsh legislation, and a certain amount relating to Northern Ireland&#151;the House will have time to scrutinise legislation and regulations more fully. I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept amendment No. 6. His doing so would reassure the public. In the Government's early stages, there was a tendency towards back-door taxation wherever possible, which did not help the public understand fully the nature of costs. The great flaw, which would come out each time regulations were debated, was that, ultimately, the public has to pay those charges. It would therefore make more sense it they were levied on someone's ability to pay rather than on the fact that he or she drives a motor car.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond to the points that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon raised on amendment No. 6 because he wishes to raise later amendments relating to charging and to whether there are perverse incentives in the tariff system that we are establishing. I shall deal with those points when we come to his amendments.
<P>
Let me say two things to reassure the hon. Gentleman about the regime that we are establishing here. Nothing in the Bill will interfere with good, sound clinical practice in the national health service. In reading into the Bill some perverse incentive, the hon. Gentleman, perhaps unwittingly, has attributed some rather base motives to national health service staff.
<P>
In supporting amendment No. 6, the hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Oxford, West and Abingdon have failed to understand parliamentary practice and procedure. The fact that there is a negative resolution procedure for these regulations does not mean, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton tried to imply, that there will be no parliamentary scrutiny of these regulations. There will be. If they are arguing about who is providing the most effective opposition to the Government, here is a test for them. They can pray against these regulations and they will be fully debated in the House of Commons. That is the procedure for negative resolutions. I am surprised that neither hon. Gentleman appeared to understand that simple point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon had a number of complaints about the negative procedure. In advising my hon. Friends to reject his amendment, I simply point out that, in line with all recent NHS legislation, going back to the National Health Service Act 1977, the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, which the hon. Gentleman and his party supported, and the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997, the procedure used for regulations in this context is the negative resolution procedure. That is the established way of dealing with such regulations. We see no reason to depart from that.
<P>
We are not thereby curtailing parliamentary discussions and opportunities to debate. That is not possible. We have no intention of bypassing Parliament, contrary to what the hon. Gentleman said. It is impossible for us to do that. We cannot make law any other way. That is the Government's position. The hon. Gentleman's amendment is not helpful. It is inconsistent with previous NHS legislation. There is no attempt to curtail parliamentary debate and I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I should like to deal with two substantive issues and also to ask for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, about whether I can press the Minister on the other questions that I raised, rather than wait for it to come up under amendment No. 9&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I much prefer that items that can be dealt with more specifically under amendments on the order paper are dealt with in that way.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> If I may explain, amendment No. 9 merely specifies that treatment given at home should be included in the provisions. That creates a perverse incentive not to discharge people to home care. I did not feel, judging by your previous remarks, Mr. Stevenson, that it would be possible for me to make my points about the perverse incentive between in-patient and out-patient care, to which I restricted my remarks very precisely when talking to this amendment, under the relatively specific and different amendment No. 9.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall take the hon. Gentleman's comments, which he was quite right to make, fully into account when we debate clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I take it that I should not press the Minister to respond now to my perverse incentive points which he signalled that he did not want to do. I should be grateful for your help and guidance, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will know that it is not the Chairman's responsibility to tell hon. Members how to make their arguments. All hon. Members are perfectly capable of doing that. I simply offer what guidance I can; I shall take the hon. Gentleman's valid comments fully into account when we come to clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> On that basis, Mr. Stevenson, I feel reassured and I will not therefore press the Minister to respond to the points that I have just made. I also give an undertaking not to repeat them at length in a future debate if it is possible to refer back to my earlier comments. I shall press the amendment to a vote partly for the reasons that I have given and partly because of a point made well by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton. This is a tax, as far as the public will understand it. They will see their motor insurance charges rise on a pretty regressive basis. We therefore believe that the regulations that set the tariff and directly cause that rise in motor insurance costs, which the Government have accepted will rise by between &#163;6 and &#163;9, should come before the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to correct one false impression that he is creating again. We do not accept that a rise in the motor insurance premiums is an inevitable result of the Bill. We have made that very clear. We have estimated the impact on premiums if the whole costs of the sums raised were averaged out and distributed to individual policyholders. We have no reason to assume that that will happen and that is not the Government's view.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> The Minister maintains that that is not the Government's view, but it is the view of most other people, many of whom have supported the principle of the Bill. The Automobile Association feels that there would be a rise as does the Association of British Insurers. Other hon. Members may wish to intervene to provide exact figures.
<P>
As most people feel that a rise is likely, and that they will not be able to distinguish between general market forces and the provisions of the Bill, this measure will be seen as a substitute way of funding the NHS. On the Government's estimates, it will raise between &#163;120 million and &#163;160 million, so it most certainly is. In all previous NHS legislation, there was a commitment that the NHS would be paid for through general taxation. Although this measure may not be a new charge, it is increased charging in the general sense. That is why, uniquely, compared with the regulations relating to the other Acts that the Minister mentioned, we want the setting of the tariffs that will cause the increased charges to be approved by the House overtly and explicitly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Once again, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He referred to the additional income that we are raising as a substitute for income that is currently going into the NHS. There is no income substitution. This is additional money on top of the record increase in NHS spending that the Government are bringing forward.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Whether it is substitution money or extra money, the Minister has effectively conceded the point. If the NHS receives extra funding from a charge, albeit indirect, on users of the NHS, that is a critical departure from or at least a dramatic extension of, existing practice. The public should know about that. The public believe that their taxes pay for the NHS. It is important for politicians, even if they support the principle of the Bill, which we certainly do not, at least to be explicit about the way that funds for the NHS are to be raised. Making the increased charges on users behind closed doors, is not the way an honest debate about the funding of our public services should be carried out. It should be debated in Parliament and subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> It is important to press the amendment because it would give the Minister a chance to explain the philosophy whereby the risk is increased without increasing the premiums. It is a phenomenally new way of insuring people to have an increased burden on the insurance company that does not get transferred to the customer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I have some brief points. It is important to have parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister took some credit for an extra &#163;120 million to &#163;160 million going to the NHS, saying that it is not a new charge and will not cost anyone anything but is a wonderful thing that the Government are doing. In all my political life, I have been looking for a pot of gold that does not cost anything to anyone. If I had the trick that he is trying to carry out today, my political party would have been far more successful than we have been in recent years. Inevitably, if we are realistic, it will cost someone something, although we can argue about the amounts. It is a little rich for him to say that the Government are doing wonderful things for the NHS without telling us where the money is to come from. It will either come in premiums or directly out of the insurance companies, which have shareholders who tend to be widows and orphans, and anyone else who has to invest for their pensions. We ought to be told.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I want to correct some of the Opposition's misunderstandings about the Bill and the Government's intentions. I must tell the two Liberal Democrat members of the Committee, who keep raising the issue, that there is no extension of the charge principle: there are no new NHS charges. To argue otherwise is to perpetuate a deliberate misrepresentation. We have been clear about that all along.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Is the Minister telling the Committee that increasing a charge fourfold is not an extension of charging?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is clearly not an extension of charging. The charging principle regarding insured accidents has been there since the beginning of the national health service. That is clearly the position and I make no apology for mentioning it.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Does the Minister accept that the argument behind the Bill is to collect that money? If it has not been collected in the past, it is not a charge that the public has felt.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister responds, I do not want to reiterate the difficulty that I mentioned earlier about clause stand part, but the amendment is about parliamentary scrutiny, not principles that were elaborated on Second Reading. I hope that members of the Committee will take note of that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, and I do not want to prolong the debate. We are debating amendment No. 6, which is about whether there should be a negative or positive resolution procedure. However, the issue of charging has arisen and I should like to clarify precisely what I am saying about insurance premiums.
<P>
Let me offer the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon two observations offered by the Assocition of British Insurers and Direct Line. The ABI was quoted in the British Medical Journal as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``most companies already take their liability under existing law into account when assessing premiums.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Direct Line was quoted in The Guardian as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``rises would be minimal as most insurers have already factored in potential NHS claims.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let me remind the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that we made our intentions clear nearly two years ago: we wanted to recoup the full costs of NHS treatments in these cases. The insurance industry has had plenty of notification.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, I will not give way. I want to explain amendment No. 6 to the hon. Gentleman. It is about whether a negative or positive resolution procedure is appropriate. I have tried to reassure him that opting for the negative resolution is entirely consistent with all recent NHS legislation, whether under the previous Conservative Government or under this Government. There is no attempt to curtail parliamentary debates. If he prays against the resolutions, there has to be a debate on the Floor of the House. He is entitled to do that and he should exploit the opportunity to the full if he so wishes.
<P>
I should also like to remind the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon that on Second Reading neither he nor any of his hon. Friends raised any question about the tariff and charging mechanism. So I have to tell him, in the spirit of constructive relations, that it is rich of him to try to raise that issue now.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I must respond to the Minister's point about the Second Reading debate&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is difficult, but Chairmen need the co-operation of members of the Committee. I cannot allow another Second Reading debate on the amendment, which is about parliamentary scrutiny. I have allowed some flexibility, which is right and proper, but I hope that hon. Members will not go down that road again.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I accept what you say, Mr. Stevenson, so I will allow the Minister's comments to hang in the air. We want to press the amendment to the vote.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:&#151;

<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 3, line 41, leave out from `circumstances' to end of line 43.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 8, in page 3, line 43, leave out `2nd July 1997' and insert `1st April 1999'.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am pleased to move these amendments, which I have tabled with my hon. Friends the Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. Amendment No. 7 would remove from clause 3 the provision that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the treatment concerned was in respect of injuries resulting from an incident occurring before 2nd July 1997''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 8 would replace ``2nd July 1997'' with ``1st April 1999''. That date would be fairer and more transparent for the insurance industry and for people who insure their cars. The Association of British Insurers has made some comments on the Bill, which, I believe, have been sent to some members of the Committee. The Association states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Insurers are opposed to the application of new laws to their liability under old policies . . . whose price reflected the estimated cost at the time. Although the Bill does not set out the proposed dates on which its provision will come into force&#151;''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure that that bit is correct&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``&#151;it appears that a new regime, including a higher ceiling, will apply from 2 July 1997. This was the date of announcement of the new measures, and was therefore the first day on which insurers could theoretically price their policies to reflect the new level of costs''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The association argues that that is ``not, legally, retrospection''. However, it is clearly impossible for new insurance premiums to be costed or adopted by 2 July 1997, if people who, in good faith, have taken out policies with a much lower liability are to receive reasonable consideration.
<P>
The association continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nevertheless, there will also be a greater cost to insurers arising from claims under policies sold before 2 July 1997, which was not priced into those policies at the time of sale. There will inevitably be a number of claims made at the higher rates, which arise from policies sold before 2 July 1997 at the prevailing price. A deficit may also arise from the fact that premiums may have reflected the very low level of actual recovery made by hospitals under the existing legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The raising of the cap is significant. Hospitals have, until now, had the power to collect money that reaches the capped level. So I do not accept that the association will not increase its premiums. The latest communication that I received from it, dated 11 December 1998, implies that its premiums would rise as a result of greater risk, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine suggested. The association has improved on the comments that it made in the British Medical Journal in August 1997. It has examined tariffs and ceilings that may not have been specified on Second Reading, and recognised that it is at a greater liability. It therefore feels that it should be entitled to charge premiums when such liability occurs, which would be only fair to an industry that does its best to be fair to its customers.
<P>
The letter specifies some additional problems caused to the industry by setting the date of 2 July 1997 and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These additional costs arising from historic''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the letter stresses the point&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``policies will have to be met by insurers. The effect on insurers no longer writing motor business will be particularly profound'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because insurers have no way of supporting the extra liability from payments made as a result of future business. The letter points out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is also very unlikely that these costs can be recouped by any insurers in the current highly competitive market.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Insurers will have to cope with a lottery, not knowing what their liability is likely to be for expensive accidents for which they were liable under earlier claims.
<P>
The ABI letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although they can raise premiums to reflect the new costs'',&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the accent being on the ``new'',&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``since the whole market will be affected in the same way, the same does not apply for historic costs. These will not be borne by all insurers equally, and premiums will therefore reflect only the new risk, which does not include the cost of meeting claims pre-dating premium increases.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome the fact that, having reflected on the issue, the ABI recognises not only that premiums will have to increase, but by extension and, indeed, by definition, that old premiums would not give them sufficient coverage across the industry of extra liabilities arising from charges stemming from 2 July 1997.
<P>
The ABI goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Insurers were unable to price for the proposed increase in charges immediately the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the Bill on 2 July 1997, and will therefore be forced to meet a number of claims for which inadequate premiums have been received. They therefore welcome the proposal that the higher charges should apply from a later date which takes account of the lag in pricing for the new risk.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In an effort to be constructive, I would be more than happy to withdraw amendment No. 8 if the Minister would consider whether 2 July is fairer than a later date. I can understand why he might argue that 1 July 1999 goes too far the other way, and I would be happy to consider earlier dates. It takes three months, analysing available data, for insurance companies to reprice premiums. I do not believe that they were told what the tariffs would be, or what the likely take would be in taking out of factors until some time after 2 July 1997. Unless there are cyclical insurances, of which I am not aware, it would take an average of six months for customers and clients of insurance companies to renew their annual policies and be offered a policy that takes into account the higher liability that insurance companies may face. Therefore something more like nine months after the Chancellor of the Exchequer first announced the plan in July 1997 would be a much fairer way to ensure that the insurance industry did not face a lottery of liability stemming from previously uncovered increased liabilities from accidents that happened well before July 1999.
<P>
The Government will, I hope, suggest that they are trying to be reasonable about the time scale for the industry and for drivers who insure their cars to respond to the changes in legislation.

<P>

<B>Ms Julia Drown </B>(South Swindon): I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has read the explanatory notes, which clearly state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Claims settled after the Bill comes into effect but which relate to accidents which happened before 2 July 1997 will attract NHS charges at a rate set to produce only the maximum chargeable under section 157 of the Road Traffic Act 1988.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An insurance company that considered even a year ago the likelihood of a Labour Government being elected on a manifesto commitment to improve the efficiency of the health service and to give the health service the money that it needs would rightly see that the Government might consider this area and ensure that the charges due would be properly collected. Such an insurance company could, therefore, have already built into its charging mechanism an outcome of the Bill such as the hon Gentleman predicts.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> That an interesting intervention contained a number of fascinating new points. Is the hon. Lady suggesting that insurers should have made provision before July 1997 based on the Labour party manifesto commitment to make the NHS more efficient? If so, it is stretching credulity to believe that insurers could get away with saying that we expect &#163;120 million to &#163;160 million extra to be raised by legislation that is not even presaged in the manifesto. The Government talked of abolishing a charge. Although it is inefficient&#151;and offensive&#151;to collect the personal charge, insurers could not be expected to predict the minds of Ministers as to which charges would be abolished or increased.
<P>
In addition, if one scrutinised the Labour party manifesto as an insurer or a risk assessor&#151;or whatever the term is for people who judge liabilities and set premiums&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> An actuary.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton.
<P>
If actuaries examined the Labour party manifesto, they would see that Labour talked of basing the renewal of the NHS on the original principle of funding from general taxation. Indeed, were we not told before the election that there would be no new charges? Most reasonable people would take that as meaning that another &#163;120 million to &#163;160 million of charges would not be levied indirectly through insurance premiums.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Swindon drew attention to the explanatory notes. Although I did not have time to find the reference, I draw her attention to the fact that the explanatory notes do not form part of the Bill. They have not been endorsed by Parliament. I am not clear about their relevance to specific amendments or whether they are a reassurance. In any event, I am concerned not about accidents that occurred before 2 July 1997&#151;which is what the hon. Member for South Swindon referred to&#151;but about accidents occurring shortly after 2 July 1997 but which were not covered by insurance premiums that were extant at the time of the accidents and compensation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I want to take up the Minister's point and correct the hon. Gentleman's misconception. We are not talking about &#163;120 million to &#163;160 million&#151;the amount predicted by the Department&#151;in the transitional period. The figure would be substantially less&#151;perhaps as much as a third less&#151;if based on the old &#163;303,000 in round figures.
<P>
The Law Commission predicted in 1996 that this measure would be introduced. The then Secretary of State for Health, the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), in response to the Law Commission, said that the idea had to be carefully scrutinised. The concept has been floating around for some time and has been considered by both parties.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I understand from the admirable briefing produced by the House of Commons Library that proposals touching on this matter have been floating around Parliament for decades. It is unreasonable to expect insurers to increase their premiums every time someone raises the idea that charges may be considered. Otherwise, charges would go up and down like a yo-yo, depending on press releases.
<P>
It is perhaps reasonable for the Government to point to 2 July 1997 as a potential basis for introducing charges. It is not, however, appropriate even to suggest earlier dates, as the hon. Member for Hendon invited us to do. My argument, which is supported by all Opposition Members in the Committee and by the Association of British Insurers, whose business it is, argues that 2 July 1997 is too early. I accept that the date proposed in amendment No. 8 may be too late and I urge the Minister to reconsider it when he responds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I agree with most of what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said. One must be cautious about introducing retrospective legislation. Such legislation needs careful scrutiny and its effects must be carefully considered.
<P>
It is extraordinarily arrogant of the Government to say that just because the Prime Minister or Secretary of State has opened his mouth and mentioned a date, it should immediately have the force of law. For the Prime Minister to say ``2 July 1997'' in one of his messianic burblings, and expect to have every insurance company in the land scurrying around adjusting its premiums, as if his burblings had the force of law, is pretty nigh contemptible.
<P>
The purpose of the House is to scrutinise proposed legislation and give it effect only when it has been endorsed by the clear will of Parliament. As the hon. Member for Hendon said, just because the idea has been floated around, the Government think that they are entitled to slap a bill on insurance companies, which are not in a position to work out, actuarially, the exact risk that they face. Certainly, they were not privy to discussions on what will be the prevailing rate of charges. I seek an assurance from the Minister that the fourfold increases in charges will not be retrospective in any way, and will be applied only to any accident that occurs after the Bill has received Royal Assent. I look forward to his assurance that there will be no retrospectivity whatsoever in relation to the much-increased charges.
<P>
I accept that the arbitrary date of 2 July 1997 was mentioned in the Chancellor's statement in the House, but that does not mean that it should have the force of law. The date suggested by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon of 1 April 1999 is much more plausible. Insurance companies cannot be expected to factor that into their premiums because they will not know what liability they face.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman remember that, in 1995, the then Government issued instructions to NHS trusts to ensure that they made arrangements for the collection of such charges? Is he saying that insurance companies were entitled to ignore that instruction issued to the NHS, or should they have assumed that the NHS would do what the then Government expected it to do, but which it obviously failed to do, and which the present Government is ensuring that it does now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> As our reasoned amendment on Second Reading made clear, we do not object to the principle of the Bill but merely to some aspects of it, one of which is the retrospective element. If there is a more efficient system of collecting what is already enshrined in law, well and good. The fact is that the magnitude of the charges and the manner in which they will be collected, and therefore the incidence and burden of the existing set of charges, will fall much more heavily on insurance companies, in a way that they could not have predicted.
<P>
Amendment No. 8, which suggests a date of 1 April 1999 instead of 2 July 1997, is fair. What is more, the proposed date of 2 July 1997 seems to be at odds with another element of the Bill, in which its retrospective application is excluded. The liability of the Motor Insurers Bureau to pay some of the compensation awarded against uninsured drivers will not come into force until the whole scheme comes into force. Will the Minister explain why retrospective application of the Bill is permitted in one case, but not in the other? The suggestion that the members of the Motor Insurers Bureau will not face a retrospective regime, whereas, for other purposes, insurance companies will, is an inconsistency in the Bill. Where does the Bill refer to the regime governing the Motor Insurers Bureau? How will the regime be governed, where will it be published and on what basis of agreement will the bureau continue to cover uninsured drivers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond to some of the matters raised on amendments Nos. 7 and 8 and on the charging regime because this seems to be the most appropriate time to do so.
<P>
I refer first to dates and the reference in the Bill to 2 July 1997. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor made it clear during the debate on his 1997 Budget statement that we would ensure that the NHS recovers the full cost of treating victims of road traffic accidents when there is third-party insurance. The Bill translates that into legislation.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon would have financial consequences and for that and other reasons I cannot recommend their acceptance. If we changed the starting date to April 1999&#151; he referred inadvertently to July 1999&#151;there would be a two-year delay before the Bill took full effect. The average length of time taken to settle personal injury compensation claims is around two years and there would be a significant loss of potential income to the NHS, which we are not prepared to countenance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon also referred to the Association of British Insurers. We understand the association's position, but the starting date for the new tariff regime&#151;2 July&#151;was decided after full consultation with the insurance industry. At a meeting with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 2 March this year, the association agreed that it was reasonable for the new tariff regime to apply from 2 July. As the association, which was fully involved in the preparation for the new tariff regime, agreed to 2 July as an appropriate starting date, and in the light of the Chancellor's announcement during the 1997 Budget statement, we believe that the Bill strikes the right balance. People have had plenty of notice&#151;almost two years&#151;in which to prepare for the new regime.
<P>
I turn to some of the other points raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. We admit that the NHS has not performed well in collecting existing charges and insurers have had the benefit of that ineffective collection system. They have had two years during which to factor in the increases and accepted at an earlier meeting with the Secretary of State the appropriateness of a starting date of 2 July. It is time to ensure that the new arrangements provide the necessary and appropriate revenue stream for the NHS. A two-year delay would not help that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton asked for an assurance that the NHS recoupment will not affect compensation payments to victims of road traffic accidents and I give him that assurance. NHS charges will not be recouped from compensation paid by insurers to victims. The compensation recovery unit will recoup charges direct from insurers.
<P>
The Association of British Insurers said that premiums will rise with risk and that drivers who cause or who may cause accidents are likely to bear the burden of any changes in insurance premiums.
<P>
On the income stream from road traffic accidents, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon thought that there was an incentive in the system that would distort the financial planning of NHS trusts. He thought that they would start to factor in the increases and that they would base their assumptions around the amount recovered. Income streams from road traffic accidents are about two years out of synchronisation&#151;as I said, claims take on average about two years to settle. It would be difficult for purchasers to argue that a set level of income would be achieved.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment's change to the new tariff regime's starting date. We have been very clear about what we plan to do after 2 July. I must point out again to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that the Bill will not apply to accidents that occurred after 2 July but which were settled before the Bill has been enacted.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon accepts my arguments, that he will withdraw his amendment and that he will not jeopardise new income of more than &#163;300 million for the national health service.

<P>

<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I listened with great interest to the Minister. He gave some helpful clarifications of matters that did not appear to be clear on first examination of the Bill. I hope that he can clarify several further points.
<P>
The Minister said that the lag time for the settlement of claims was two years. What data back up that claim? Is the mean, median or mode time involved? That is an important factor in working out whether payments will come in bulk before or after the date. I imagine that he referred to the mean or average time and that there will be as many payments before the date as after it. If that is the proposal's justification, a start date of April 1997 would be logical, because that is two years before April 1999.
<P>
Judging by the comments of the hon. Member for Hendon&#151;who I think was trying to help the Minister&#151;the July 1997 date has little resonance either with the Government's promises of new efficiency or with the fact that the date was presaged in parliamentary debates. There is no reason why, on the basis of the two-year lag, April 1997 should not be chosen. It is important to secure the confidence of users of the health service and of people who insure their cars. The July 1997 date cannot be clearly justified on either basis, and it may therefore lack appropriate support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not seeking to prolong our debate, but the hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that it would be more appropriate if we had a start date for the new tariff regime of April 1997. However, that predates our July announcement, and the general election.
<P>
<B>Dr. Harris:</B> I am glad that the Minister agrees with me. The two-year lag does not appear to justify the July 1997 date. By no mathematics is that date two years before the Bill's enforcement date.
<P>
The Minister, who I hope, will consider new representations from the ABI, has not satisfactorily responded to two basic problems. First, I do not know what agreement he feels that he has reached with the ABI but the latest information, which I believe is available to Labour and Opposition Members, is that it is extremely unhappy about the fact that claims that have not been settled from accidents that date back nearly two years will still be liable for the charge, even though premiums were not set to incur that charge. Secondly, is it not inconsistent&#151;although perhaps it is inevitable&#151;only to abolish the emergency treatment fee from April 1999? The Government used that proposal to attempt to defend the Bill. However, the measures that will gather revenue from insurance premiums&#151;in what we believe is an unfair way&#151;will act retrospectively. Can the Minister justify that? Does he accept that the main justification for the Bill, which is the abolition of the emergency treatment fee, coming as it will only in April 1999, is rather undermined by the delay and mismatch of dates?
<P>
Finally, I return to my concern about the behaviour of purchasers and commissioners. I do not believe that the issue of lag time, to which the Minister responded, is relevant. I do not want to deal with other issues relating to purchaser behaviour at this point. However, the fact that, because of the lag time, purchasers will be unable to cut their contracts with accuracy does not constitute a good defence of the de-funding of the NHS by purchasers. There is a worry that, at best, it will create fluctuations in a market that will continue after the Minister's proposals to reform the NHS are implemented.
<P>
The existence of a lag time will make no difference to the problem, so the Minister cannot use purchasers' behaviour to defend the July 1997 date. Premiums extant at that time do not cover the increased liability that the Minister anticipates. That cannot be fair on those who insure their cars, or on the industry as a whole. I urge the Minister to say that he will look at the issue again.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I was interested in the Minister's argument about the Budget statement. In it, the Chancellor also said that he wanted to review taxation of the oil industry. In the March Budget, the Chancellor said that he intended to increase taxation of the industry in one of two ways, and he put the matter out for consultation. It was not until August that he recognised that the whole thing was a mistake. Despite his Iron Chancellor image, he admitted&#151;albeit during the recess&#151;that he had made a mistake in the first place.
<P>
Just because the Chancellor makes a statement in the Budget, it should not be assumed that it will become de facto law. People should assume instead that they can lobby to get their arguments heard. We were fortunate to win the argument about the North Sea oil industry, and to avoid the destruction of our local economy by the Chancellor. Insurance companies might have followed the oil industry's lead. The date of the Budget statement therefore seems a rather arbitrary trigger point for the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond briefly.
<P>
We have been around the track pretty extensively with regard to this issue. I shall not respond to the question of petroleum taxation, because that is not a matter for the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No, I want to resolve the issue. The hon. Gentleman has asked me to reconsider the 2 July start date, but we are not prepared to do so. The industry has had plenty of time to prepare for the introduction of the new tariff regime, and I invite my hon. Friends to resist the amendment.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
