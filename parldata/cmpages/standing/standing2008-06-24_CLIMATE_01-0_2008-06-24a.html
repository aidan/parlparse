<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000350"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning. Before we begin, I should make one
or two comments and preliminary announcements. I choose to foster an
easygoing exchange of views and I would hate people to get frustrated
with heat, so, it being the summer, members of the Committee may remove
their jackets during Committee meetings. I would ask all members at all
times to ensure that their mobile phones and pagers are turned off, or
at least rigged for silent running during Committee
meetings.</div><a name="0806251000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is both a money resolution and a Ways and Means resolution with the
Bill. Copies are available on the table. I remind members of the
Committee that adequate notice ought to be given about amendments. As a
general rule, my fellow Chairman and I do not intend to call starred
amendments, including any that might be reached during an afternoon
sitting of the
Committee.</div><a name="0806251000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee, as members have been informed several times, has been
selected as a pilot for the use of laptops in the Room. I would like to
make one or two points at this stage about their use. I have never seen
a Committee start so much agog. We have had the room thronged with
people since about 10 minutes to 10, and yet there is not a
proliferation of laptops. I have to say that I am not displeased about
that&#151;you will see that I do not have one, although that is
probably because I am too thick to use one.</div>
<a name="0806251000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">Laptops may be
used only by members of the Committee sitting within the body of the
Committee, the Committee Clerks and, of course, <i class="I">Hansard</i>. Members
should ensure that all laptops have the sound muted&#151;we do not
want signals to be going off across the room. The Chair will not
entertain points of order about the operation of laptops or the
network. Such items must be retained for moments when the Committee is
suspended, if I choose to suspend it. Finally, members are expected to
use laptops responsibly&#151;I should remind the Committee that we
are here to give the legislative proposals line-by-line scrutiny. I
would hope that all hon. Members&#151;we are all honourable Members,
I trust&#151;will use the laptop in that venture, to further scrutiny
and line-by-line
examination.</div><a name="0806251000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will first be asked to consider the programme motion on the
amendment paper. Debate is limited to half an hour. We will then
proceed to a motion to report written evidence, which I hope that we
can take formally. Without more ado, I call the Minister to move the
programme motion.</div>

I beg to

meet&#151;</div><a name="0806251000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

proceedings shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a
conclusion at 7.00 p.m. on Tuesday 8th
July.</div><a name="0806251000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank
you, Mr. Cook. It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship of this important Public Bill Committee considering the
Climate Change Bill. I would like to say how much I am looking forward
to the deliberations of the Committee, after one of the most extensive
consultations on draft legislation and the consultations and scrutiny
in the other
place.</div><a name="0806251000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note your remarks about the use of laptops, Mr. Cook. I am
in the same camp as you on that. I congratulate the hon. Member for
Cheltenham on being the first Member, in the history of this place, to
have a laptop during the proceedings of the House. No doubt press
releases to the Cheltenham papers are on their way out as we
speak.</div><a name="0806251000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
programme motion is before us. I am pleased to report to the Committee
that the usual channels have reached a consensus. There are no knives
in the motion. Across the House, we have a consensus on the objectives
of the Bill&#151;how do we, in the United Kingdom, help to resist
dangerous climate change? The second clause of the programme motion
states that the agreed end date is Tuesday 8 July. That gives us
sufficient time, so I am happy to move the programme
motion.</div><a name="0806251000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000352"></a><b class="B">Gregory
Barker</b> (Bexhill and Battle) (Con): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook, on this important
and ground-breaking legislation. The Opposition will do their best to
assist the Government in producing the best piece of legislation that
we can and to make it fit for the immensely important task of combating
global climate
change.</div><a name="0806251000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is right that there has been a dialogue between the usual
channels, which suggests that the proceedings will be brought to a
close on 8 July. However, I sound a note of caution. We do not yet know
how the debate will progress. Many important amendments are to be
debated and, as the Chairman reminded us, they will be discussed line
by line. There are some crucial points to discuss. Although there is
broad support for the Bill, there are some sharp points of difference
on individual clauses and amendments. The Government propose to delete
or remove some of the substantial clauses that were added by
Conservative peers in the House of Lords. Those additions made it a
much better Bill. We do not want in any way to stifle or cut short
debate of those important issues.</div>
<a name="0806251000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the usual
channels made their informal agreement over the time likely to be
needed for debate, we had not seen the amendments to the Bill. As we
now know that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>the Bill will not be ready to receive Royal Assent before the spill-over
period, I wonder whether the artificial cut-off on 8 July is necessary.
If hon. Members felt that we should continue because there are still
important matters to consider, I for one would not favour an artificial
date to guillotine proceedings.</div>
<a name="0806251000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am mindful
that we need to expedite matters in Committee, but that needs to be
balanced with a proper respect for the views of all Committee members.
We have a number of learned and expert Members on both sides of the
Committee&#151;members of the Environmental Audit Committee, and hon.
Members with a long-term interest in the subject. We have a former
Secretary of State who was a key figure in the early stages of the
Kyoto agreement. I hesitate to agree to an arbitrary cut-off date of 8
July.</div>
<a name="0806251000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000353"></a>The
Chairman:</b> At this point, I should remind hon. Members that
the date of 8 July was set by the House and not by the
Committee.</div><a name="0806251000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000354"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): It is a pleasure to serve again
under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. We will certainly engage
constructively on the Bill over the next fortnight or so. As you know,
we voted against the programme motion in the House because we thought
that two and a half weeks was an absurdly short period in which to
discuss the many substantive issues. Now that the Government have
indicated that they want to reverse most of the defeats in the House of
Lords, we shall have some pretty meaty debates. Therefore, it is
disappointing that we have so little time, but so be it.</div>
<a name="0806251000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned that the Government have not yet tabled their amendments on
single-use carrier bags. If I remember rightly&#151;I am sure my hon.
Friend the Member for Cheltenham will be surfing the net as I speak to
correct me&#151;the idea of a levy on single-use carrier bags was
raised in the Budget several months ago. I am disappointed that the
Committee, which finishes two weeks today, has not even received those
amendments. We had been promised that the amendments would be tabled in
good time for the Committee to consider. I hope the Minister will
ensure that the amendments are tabled expeditiously. These are
important issues and we are keen to get on with debating
them.</div>
<a name="0806251000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000355"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Gummer</b> (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con): I, too, express my
pleasure at working under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. It
would be wrong not to remind the Committee of my principled objections
to the whole programming system. This is a good example of what a
disappointment it is to the House that we have such automatic decisions
to programme matters and have end dates voted for or against by the
majority in the House of Commons.</div>
<a name="0806251000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we have a
Bill on which there is considerable consensus, as is the case with the
Climate Change Bill, it is crucial that we debate it properly, not
because we wish to defeat it or make changes for the sake of it, but
because it is so important to get it right. There are people outside
who dislike the whole concept of climate change, who do not believe in
it and do not accept it. I see that <i class="I">The</i> <i class="I">Observer</i> ran a
poll that showed that the majority of people in Britain still do not
believe that climate change is caused by human intervention, so we have
a real battle there.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="0806251000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Getting the
legislation right is a crucial part of our job. I have been in the
House a long time and in my experience the most dangerous Bills, the
ones that we are most likely to get wrong, are those on which there is
a general agreement in principle and we do not take the time to do the
detailed work from point to point. I took through a number of
agricultural measures where that was the case. Everybody was in favour
of the measure but I could cite points on which we did not spend the
time properly and therefore found that things were unintentionally
wrong. The <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> is ready to explain why we, once again,
failed the nation and I am keen that we should not do that.</div>
<a name="0806251000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without much
hope, although hope springs eternal, I trust that the Government will
recognise, as I know the Ministers do, that if we find that the debate
leads us to want to spend longer on some aspects than we had hoped, it
is always open to the Government to go back to the House and say that
we need more time. I hope they will take it in good spirit that some of
us want to get the Bill right, rather than get through it quickly. I do
not want the Bill to go beyond the spill-over season, but I want to get
it right because we will have to defend it over a long period. It must
last. By its nature, it is a lasting Bill, which is why I am so pleased
that the Government have introduced it. It sets the parameters for a
long period, and getting it right is as important as enacting it at
all.</div><a name="0806251000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000356"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thank hon. Members for their comments. I want to
provide some reassurance. First, subsection (2) is a
resolution of the House and not of the Programming Sub-Committee. It is
the resolution of 9 June, when the House agreed an end date. Secondly,
in response to the point made by the right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal about knives and guillotines, I reassure hon. Members that
there have always been guillotines. The controversy around the
introduction of the programming process related to knives. My
predilection is against putting knives in Public Bill Committees,
because of the point made by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
that we cannot know where the interesting and controversial bits will
be in the
proceedings.</div><a name="0806251000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000357"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Just for accuracy, until 1997 there were no
guillotines unless a Committee went on so long that it had to be
brought back to the House. We used to do these Committees without
guillotines, and when it was a non-controversial Bill, such as this
one, we got our work done significantly better, because nobody felt
that they had to do it in this way. I am very sad that we have decided
on this much less British way of doing things since
1997.</div><a name="0806251000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="0806251000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000358"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> At the time of the review of programming, I was
the Minister with responsibility for House proceedings, when I took the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point very seriously. I researched the
past to see how guillotine motions have been used, and I can tell you,
Mr. Cook, they were nasty, brutish and short. As the right
hon. Gentleman has said, they were debated on the Floor of the House. I
point Members to the evidence, which shows that programming has not led
to less scrutiny of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>Bills. Indeed, the evidence up to 2005&#151;I have not seen the
evidence since then&#151;showed that more line-by-line scrutiny had
taken place.</div>
<a name="0806251000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
assure the right hon. Gentleman that the Under-Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewisham, Deptford and I have open minds on what is a sensible
approach. We do not wish to use the Government&#146;s majority to
push through this measure, not least because there is a strong
consensus on the objectives of this Bill.</div>
<a name="0806251000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another reason for reassurance&#151;this Bill is one of the most
scrutinised Bills in modern history. It has been through draft
pre-legislative scrutiny, which I know that the right hon. Gentleman
supports,
twice.</div><a name="0806251000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Northavon said that we have rejected most of the House
of Lords amendments, but we have accepted a large number of them. If
that were the case, Government members of the Committee would have some
problems, but we will see as we go through the
debate.</div><a name="0806251000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
actual resolution of the Programming Sub-Committee has given us
suggested timings and the order of debate, as agreed by the usual
channels. In my view, having consulted the officials, there is adequate
time, but we shall
see.</div><a name="0806251000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

that.</div><a name="0806251000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 43 and 44 focus not simply on the destination
point&#151;2050&#151; but also on the route map, because, as was
discussed on Second Reading, we cannot simply chug along as we are and
then suddenly cut emissions in 2049, which is clearly not what we want.
My understanding of what the hon. Member for Banbury was driving at is
that we need to give much more attention to the profile of our
emissions over the next 42 years and not obsess solely on the
destination point. Clearly, the more that we save in getting to that
destination, the better it will be. Additionally, the earlier that we
save, the better it will be in terms of the climate change impact of
any given amount of emissions. It is therefore important to discuss the
amendment.</div><a name="0806251000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham and I tabled amendment No. 32
because we anticipated that the Government would want to take away
clause 1. As ever, we wanted to be helpful. We tried to table an
amendment that would give the Government what they want. I understand
the points that the Minister is likely to make about how the UK cannot
change global temperature by acting on its own. We can play our part,
but we cannot achieve a specific outcome on our own. I understand that
saying that the goal of the Bill is to achieve something for the planet
when we are a small percentage of it raises
issues.</div><a name="0806251000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of amendment No. 32 is to ask how we move from what we know
about what the planet has to do to what we know about what the UK has
to do. Amendment No. 32 is our probing attempt to put contraction and
convergence, which are jargon, into the legislation. We want to know
whether the Government accept that aggregate contraction and
convergence on emissions per head should be central to our approach. If
they accept that, when do they think that that should take place? The
obvious point for that to happen, given the focus on 2050, would be
2050. If we had a formula and reporting obligation, as set out in
subsection (4), we would know how the Government have gone from
whatever science tells us about the global target to what the UK target
should
be.</div><a name="0806251000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been suggested that this Bill should not include a purpose clause,
because we do not do that kind of thing in this country. That is
essentially what people have said&#151;to quote the right hon. Member
for Suffolk, Coastal, &#147;It is not
British&#148;.</div><a name="0806251000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister is familiar with the Sustainable Communities
Act 2007, section 1(1) of which states:</div>
<a name="0806251000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principal aim of this Act is to promote the sustainability of local
communities.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the time, which was only last year, the House felt it appropriate to
include a purpose clause, so there is good precedent. Likewise,
legislation in this country over the years has given principal aims to
bodies. For example, the Environment Act 1995 sets
out</div><a name="0806251000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
principal aim of the Agency...in discharging its functions so to
protect or enhance the
environment.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no inherent reason why UK legislation should not have a purpose
clause. The advantage of including a purpose clause in this Bill, which
is how the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>introduced it in the first place, is that without it we will just have a
number. As the legislation stands, that number will be plucked from the
atmosphere before the Climate Change Committee acts. It is not apparent
from the Bill where that number will come from. Although there are
mechanisms to update the number, the processes are not as transparent
as they should be.</div>
<a name="0806251000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
32 addresses how we set the UK contribution to reducing global
emissions. If the science tells us that a certain cut in global
emissions is needed to avoid the temperature rise that will lead to
dangerous climate change, then the UK should not merely achieve the
global average but go further. We give two reasons in the amendment why
it should. &#147;We&#148;&#151;the United States and some other
developed countries&#151;are a big part of the problem, and a lot of
the emissions in the system are from us. It is often stated that
Britain is responsible for only 2 per cent. of emissions, but in a
sense we have moved a lot of our emissions offshore. For example, a UK
consumer who buys a consumer durable produced in the far east creates
emissions elsewhere, so it is clearly an understatement to say we are
only a tiny part of the issue. Not only are we a bigger part of current
emissions than that figure suggests, but we are particularly
responsible for historic emissions. As we caused a disproportionate
part of the problem, we therefore have a responsibility to be a
disproportionate part of the
solution.</div><a name="0806251000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of amendment No. 32 addresses the question whether we can
say to the rest of the world, and particularly to rapidly developing
countries, that we have had the fun, but they cannot have it? It is
clearly morally unacceptable to say that we have had rapid growth and a
high standard of living, but they cannot have those things. I have
promised not to use the word &#147;moral&#148; too frequently over
the next two and a half weeks, but the Bill is about not only science,
but&#151;.</div>

Webb:</b> Or think it either, hopefully.</div>
<a name="0806251000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Seriously,
there is no right answer to British emissions, as the Bill stands. The
Bill includes a general purpose clause and a figure, but it does not
state how the British figure comes from what global science is telling
us, which is the purpose of amendment No. 32. Science will evolve, and
it gives us a figure for the required global cut in emissions. The
British figure has to be higher than that for the reasons that I have
stated, and as the science develops, we want the Government to be
transparent about how the two are linked not least because the British
number may need to change as the science develops. The next element is
setting out how that linkage has been made in a
report.</div><a name="0806251000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole Bill could fail if it does not include a purpose clause stating
what the number in the Bill is designed to achieve. We will obviously
have a substantive discussion about the right number when we discuss
clause 2, so I will not stray into that save to say that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>without a purpose clause, the number could fail to achieve the objective
that we all want for the Bill. We are trying to avoid dangerous climate
change, but we know that the number in clause 2 is at best likely to
fail to achieve the purpose of the Bill. That is why we think we need
to be upfront about where the number comes from and to recognise our
international duties.</div>
<a name="0806251000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Drawing those
threads together, amendments Nos. 43 and 44 focus on the
profile of the emissions, which is entirely right and proper, and I
hope the Minister will have something to say about that. Amendment No.
32 tries to introduce the concept of contraction and convergence and
deal with the Government&#146;s perfectly reasonable points that the
UK is not the world and that putting something in UK legislation about
world targets creates problems. If we were to amend clause 1 to say how
the UK contribution is calculated and linked to the world problem,
however, we would move towards the same objective that the
Minister&#146;s rather more direct approach&#151;removing the
clause altogether&#151;is designed to achieve. I hope that, rather
than removing the clause, we can leave it in and amend
it.</div><a name="0806251000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000366"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I support amendment No. 43 simply because it
clarifies what most of us already understood, which leads me to why I
am particularly keen to discuss clause stand part and why clause 1 is
crucially important. Clause 1 is important for the same reason that the
Government want to get rid of it&#151;we either put Britain&#146;s
responsibilities in the context of the world or we do not understand
what we are talking about. Such responsibilities are inevitable in the
world context. Right from the beginning, we must accept that if the
whole world goes down the route of &#147;After you,
Claude&#148;&#151;if I may use an old-fashioned phrase, which the
hon. Member for Northavon thinks that I am keen on using&#151;we will
continue as we have done since Kyoto, and even before that, by actually
not doing anything at all.</div>
<a name="0806251000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature of
this Bill is in clause 1. The nature of this Bill&#151;this is why
the Government should be congratulated&#151;is to say to the world
that we, at least, are a country that takes the matter seriously and
that we will act in a way that is incumbent not only on the Government
but on the Opposition. It is interesting that the commentators have not
noticed that the Bill has a real effect on the Opposition as well as on
the Government, because it will not be possible for an Opposition of
any kind merely to oppose things that the Government want to do in
order to fulfil the purposes of the Bill without providing a practical
and real alternative. That makes the Bill very valuable: for the next
two years, it will have that effect on this Government and this
Opposition, and when we change round in two years&#146; time, it will
be very important when the situation is the other way round. It is
crucial that we are all caught by the Bill. If that is the case, I want
to be caught by the truth, and clause 1 is an important part of the
truth, which is that we have to commit ourselves to act, whatever
anybody else does. Unless we do, and thereby inspire others to do it as
well, we will not achieve the necessary change sufficiently
quickly.</div><a name="0806251000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot say that I am overwhelmed by amendment No. 32, but some aspects
of it are worth repeating. It refers
to</div><a name="0806251000062"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;historic
levels of emissions of greenhouse gases by the UK.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="0806251000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is an unfortunate fact
that most of the greenhouse gas effects and climate change that we are
experiencing today is the responsibility of European nations, and the
biggest section of that is the responsibility of the British. It takes
such a long time for such effects to work through, so our industrial
revolution in particular is having an effect that we can see today. So
those who say, &#147;Oh, we only cause 2 per cent. of the emissions.
We don&#146;t need to worry. Others should do it first,&#148; are
wrong not only in a moral sense&#151;I am not ashamed of using the
world moral, because there is a lot of morality in this matter, which
is needed in a practical sense&#151;but because we caused the problem
and should therefore clean it
up.</div><a name="0806251000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Historic
levels of emissions created our wealth. We are rich because we have
polluted and therefore we have a responsibility, historically, to pay
the price. Paying the price means that we must recognise that as we led
the world into the industrial revolution, we must now lead the world
into the low-carbon economy. I have absolutely no doubt about that,
which is what we are here for. If I may use another word for which I
shall no doubt be attacked, we have a vocation to do that. There is no
doubt in my mind that that is what we have to do, which is why I appeal
to the Minister not to get rid of clause 1. I do not think that he
really wants to get rid of clause 1&#151;I think that this case
involves the things that civil servants do to Ministers. I was a
Minister in similar circumstances, and I know what civil servants say.
They have a two-word phrase, &#147;Better not, Minister.&#148; They
cannot quite tell you what might go wrong, but &#147;better
not&#148;. Charming though the civil servants no doubt are on this
Bill, Ministers must never let themselves be led astray by
&#147;better not&#148;, because &#147;better not&#148; is a
defence against some untoward
happening.</div><a name="0806251000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have read the clause again and again, and I cannot see anything
untoward. It says clearly that Britain recognises that our actions
should be seen in the light of what the world ought to do, whether the
world does it or not, unless there is a grossly disproportionate
economic cost in doing that. I think that is rubbish. We gain by being
ahead. We will alter the economics by taking forward the green
revolution, as we need to do. I cannot see what the problem is, unless
one still holds the Lawsonite view that that is damaging to the
economy.</div>
<a name="0806251000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposition is the right thing to do, the right thing to do for
Britain, irrespective of what other people do. If that is the case, the
principal aim does not harm us. Instead, it enables us to pin a notice
on the door stating clearly, &#147;Here we stand, this is what we
believe.&#148; And the reason we are doing it, with the first such
Bill in the world, is that we intend to stand here until we are joined
by the rest of the world when it sees that its own future depends upon
doing these things.</div>
<a name="0806251000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
passionate about debating the clause because I do not want the
Government not to live up to their highest aspirations. I have not
always been polite to the Government about a range of things. I cannot
say that I am entirely happy with their performance to date, but on
this issue I do not want them to fall below the standards they have set
themselves. This is the moment for the Government to come up to the
bar. We are doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>something groundbreaking, and we are doing it with the overwhelming
support of the whole House of
Commons.</div><a name="0806251000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000367"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000368"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I said overwhelming. I have no doubt that we could
find five dissenters, and I bet there are one or two people skulking
away in other parts of the House who did not happen to be there at the
time. But the Bill is a remarkable achievement, and the Government must
be given credit for it, as must the Opposition. That means that we must
excel ourselves, and not suddenly draw back with an intake of breath
and listen to the &#147;better nots&#148; of this world.</div>
<a name="0806251000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee of the wonderful London Eye on the other side of the river.
When I gave temporary planning permission for that, every single
official opposed it. I had more visits from the &#147;better
not&#148; brigade than any previous Minister. I said there was no
point in being Secretary of State if I could not occasionally back
something I thought was right. Now the Eye is the most popular memory
of the millennium, and nobody will ever take it down.</div>
<a name="0806251000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
moment for the Minister to do that on a much more important matter. It
is not a moment for &#147;better not&#148;. It is the moment to
say, &#147;Yes, we are going to nail our colours to the mast, nail
that notice to the door, as happened in Wittenberg. Here we
stand&#148;. If the Minister makes the change by the use of his
majority, he will be belittling the Bill from the beginning. That would
be a

Gummer:</b> My hon. Friend is right, but he does not go far
enough. I am never quite sure to whom the phrase &#147;international
community&#148; refers, but the issue is one for the world as a
whole. It applies to everybody. It is inconceivable that we should
start such a mould-breaking Bill by removing the sentences that state
what is in it, when those words say what we are all committed
to.</div>
<a name="0806251000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Government will think again. If I were asked to vote on the clause, how
would I explain to my children, let alone the world, that I do not
think we should be trying to stop the temperature rising by more than
2°C? I have been bringing my children up to believe that for the
past 20 years, when it was unfashionable to say that that is the most
important physical thing we can do in life. How can I say that the UK
should not take these actions because we are afraid that everybody else
might not do it, when for all that time I, the Government, the
Opposition and the Liberal Democrats have been saying that we should?
How can I explain to them that I thought that it was in some way
dangerous? It is not; it cannot be.</div>
<a name="0806251000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Either the
Government have some miraculous understanding that is beyond the usual
understanding of mankind&#151;of course the Minister is one of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>brightest Ministers on the Bench, and perhaps he will be able to tell us
that&#151;or we are back in &#147;better not&#148; land. I say
very seriously to the Minister that when he is taking mould-breaking
steps, he should be careful of the drag effect of those for whom the
world is still as  it was.</div>
<a name="0806251000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are lucky
to be living at a time when thought is changing faster than at any
period since the renaissance. This is an exciting time to be living. We
cannot meet the problems of today through the language or assumptions
of yesterday. The fact that the Government have recognised that by
introducing the Bill is crucial. I do not want them to fall below that
level, even though politically it will be great fun. I shall have
enormous pleasure going round the countryside saying, &#147;This
Government don&#146;t really believe in all this, you know. They were
forced to do it by an amalgamation between the Opposition, Friends of
the Earth and others. Now they have done it, we put in a perfectly
reasonable clause, and the House of Lords has now taken it out.&#148;
The party political temptations, at the beginning of what is supposed
to be a consensus Bill, are enormous.</div>
<a name="0806251000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
consider the Bill with no party political temptations. I want to be
able to say that it is a remarkable, consensual decision. I want to
point that out to people who have not yet come on board. I hope the
Government will not make it difficult for us, and that they will choose
at this late date to accept that the House of Lords was wise. I do not
think the Government will much like the clause to be subject to
ping-pong between the two Houses. They would not enjoy receiving the
Bill back from the Lords, and having to put the clause back, and
conducting the argument on the Floor of the House with unbelieving
young people, in particular, who will find it impossible to
understand.</div>
<a name="0806251000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">No doubt the
Minister will make the best case possible, because he is a remarkably
good Minister. However, in his heart, he knows that he is wrong. That
will make it difficult in all those debates, because in his heart he
knows that most of it is wrong. I hope very much that he will start off
by showing his independence&#151;his version of the great London
Eye&#151;and say, &#147;&#145;Better not&#146; may be your
view, but better do, because it is the better thing to do&#148;.

43 and 44, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Banbury and moved
by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon. They rightly seek to
improve and clarify the wording handed down to us by our noble Friends
in another place.</div>
<a name="0806251000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
32 explicitly spells out that the UK contribution will, in part, be
calculated with reference to data from around the rest of the world,
but it does not pretend that the UK is responsible for it. We
anticipate the Government&#146;s objections to the clause. They will
say that it is unworkable, because it seeks to take responsibility for
wider global emissions. We hope that amendment No. 32 makes it explicit
that that does not have to be the case. If the Government want to
improve the wording, we would be prepared to consider the matter during
the course of the
Committee.</div><a name="0806251000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, many of us argued that the targets on percentage
reductions cannot simply be a matter of scientific debate and argument.
We need to make a moral and political judgment about our fair share of
overall reductions. Therefore, it is very important that amendment No.
32 introduces the concept of historic responsibility and the principle
of contraction and convergence. It would be nice to hear explicitly
from the Minister whether or not the British Government accept the
principle of contraction and convergence and whether such a principle
will be part of the remit given to the Committee on Climate Change when
it works out the appropriate percentage reduction in carbon emissions,
because that principle is relevant to the principal aim of the
clause.</div><a name="0806251000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Oxfam
made the important point in its submission on the amendment that the
concept of cumulative impact is already built into the structure of the
Bill. The whole nature of carbon budgets, as opposed to simple
numerical targets, reflects the importance of calculating cumulative
impact. We are trying to reflect that historic cumulative impact by
keeping the clause in the Bill to make it explicit that we are taking
our share of a global target. The global target of keeping global
temperature to within 2° C of pre-industrial levels is crucial.
I will not try to outdo the eloquence of the right hon. Member for

warming are extreme, and it is possible to argue that we are already
getting a foretaste of possible impacts with food shortages, which are
reflected in global food prices, and flooding, which is besetting
various parts of the world including America and this country&#151;in
the future, it will affect many other areas. We are talking about a
very serious objective. To remove the very clause that sets out the end
goal, as opposed to the technical pathways that we use to get to that
goal, would be a retrograde
step.</div><a name="0806251000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000374"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that when the
Government argue the case for including an 80 per cent. target in the
body of the Bill, it would be much easier if they had pinned their
colours to the 2° C target at the beginning? In that case, it
could properly be said that the matter should be left to the Climate
Change Committee, because the parameters would be clear. If the
Government remove those parameters, there will be concern that they are
not as serious about the issue as they might appear to
be.</div><a name="0806251000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000375"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is exactly right.
Removing from the Bill the final outcome, which we are all aiming for,
certainly makes the 80 per cent. target and other targets seem more
like a matter of tactical and political negotiation, rather than a
focus on what we really want to achieve, which is containing global
warming. It seems strange when we have consensus in the Room and across
the House of Commons as a whole about the objectives to begin by trying
to remove
them.</div><a name="0806251000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
lot of praise has been heaped on the Minister, which I am sure is
richly deserved. I know him of old, from the National Union of
Students, where one of his principal attributes was his mastery of the
grubby arts of political
tactics.</div><a name="0806251000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000376"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000377"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Absolutely, in the Minister&#146;s
case&#151;he is a master tactician. I think that the Government would
be well advised to mount a tactical
retreat.</div><a name="0806251000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000378"></a>David
Maclean:</b> It is a pleasure to serve on the Committee under
your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. It was also a pleasure to hear
the speech by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal,
although one can never match his tremendous oratory. Last Saturday I
opened the Wigton hospital fÃªte, where I managed to acquire
10 volumes, at a cost of &#163;2 for the complete set, of
&#147;Great Speeches from the Beginning of Time to the Present
Day&#148;. I have a feeling that after this Committee there will have
to be an 11th volume dedicated to my right hon.
Friend.</div><a name="0806251000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal
on his work on the London Eye. I hope that I am not revealing any
Cabinet Sub-Committee secrets, but I think that my right hon. Friend
argued 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>passionately that, rather than having a large plastic tent, we should
create a huge new pedestrian boulevard from the National Theatre right
down to Chelsea, including small shops, theatres and a new bridge
across the Thames. That would be a tremendous advance for our
environment, but it is not in the Bill, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="0806251000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot match the eloquence of my right hon. Friend, but I want to add
my little voice to those who are trying to persuade the Government to
let clause 1 stand part of the Bill. I also want to touch briefly on
aspects of amendment No. 32, which is relevant. Reading the Bill, one
might be tempted to think that it is merely a technical measure. We
could get bogged down in the committees, reporting procedures and the
setting and transferring of budgets. Once the Bill is on the statute
book, we might forget why we enacted it. What is the purpose of passing
this important measure? The purpose is not to create reporting
committees or to set up a wonderful Committee on Climate Change to
advise the Government. The purpose, as it says in clause 1, is to try
to do things that contribute to reducing world temperature. The clause
does not put an obligation on the Government to succeed unilaterally in
the United Kingdom in reducing world temperatures by 2° C.
However, it says that the efforts that we make in the Bill, and
everything else we do, should be part of that aim of reducing world
temperature, because that is what it is all
about.</div><a name="0806251000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am fortunate because my technology worked instantly&#151;I do not use
PICT. I plugged in my computer, the 3G card fired up at once and I was
sent a summary of the Stern report, which I shall
quote:</div><a name="0806251000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
no action is taken to reduce emissions, the concentration of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere could reach double its pre-industrial level as
early as 2035, virtually committing us to a global average temperature
rise of over 2°
C.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stern
refers to that crucial figure of 2° C, which was not plucked out
of thin air in another place. We are not arguing for that figure for
any reason other than Stern himself identified it. He goes
on:</div><a name="0806251000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the longer term, there would be more than a 50% chance that the
temperature rise would exceed 5° C. This rise would be very
dangerous indeed; it is equivalent to the change in average
temperatures from the last ice age to today. Such a radical change in
the physical geography of the world must lead to major changes in the
human geography&#151;where people live and how they live their
lives.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government rightly signed up to the Stern review and so have the
Opposition parties. Nicholas Stern continues to advise the Government
in a high role and key capacity. If Nicholas Stern picks out the figure
of 2° C as one of the key yardsticks, symbols or
totems for the amount by which we must try to reduce global
temperatures, I see no harm in putting that figure in the Bill, and my
right hon. Friend is right that that would not totally tie the
Government&#146;s hands.</div>
<a name="0806251000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Possibly,
parliamentary draftsmen have highlighted the issue to the Minister. I
used to find during my days in the Department for the Environment and
the Home Office that parliamentary draftsmen and wonderful civil
servants always worried about things being added to their precious
Bill. Worries came from two quarters: such provisions might force the
Government to do things that they did not want to do, or they might tie
them to doing things that they might wish to do in future. I suggest
that leaving the reference to 2° C in the Bill would not tie the
Government&#146;s hands, force them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>to do things that they do not wish to do or make them solely and
individually responsible for meeting the world reduction of 2°
C.</div><a name="0806251000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned, as suggested by some of the amendments that I have tabled
for later in the Bill, with trying to flag up more overtly some of the
key things that Stern says that we must do if we are to succeed in our
aim. Stern goes on to
say:</div><a name="0806251000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Key
elements of future international frameworks should
include...emissions
trading&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0806251000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">well,
we have a mention of that in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Expanding
and linking the growing number of emissions trading schemes around the
world is a powerful way to promote cost-effective reductions in
emissions and to bring forward action in developing countries: strong
targets in rich countries could drive flows amounting to tens of
billions of dollars each year to support the transition to low-carbon
development
paths.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am content that the Bill addresses that point, and I hope that we can
strengthen it
slightly.</div><a name="0806251000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stern
also
states:</div><a name="0806251000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Technology
co-operation: Informal co-ordination as well as formal agreements can
boost the effectiveness of investments in innovation around the world.
Globally, support for energy R&amp;D should at least double, and
support for the deployment of new low-carbon technologies should
increase up to
five-fold.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
action to reduce deforestation&#151;I find this point absolutely
critical&#151;he
states:</div><a name="0806251000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
loss of natural forests around the world contributes more to global
emissions each year than the transport
sector.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will no doubt be having some intense discussions on the contribution of
transport, shipping and aviation to carbon emissions. If the Chair
agrees with the way in which I have drafted my amendments, hopefully I
will be able to mention deforestation and try to insert provisions in
the Bill on that, because I am disappointed that it is not mentioned
specifically.</div>
<a name="0806251000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another of my
worries is that if we remove clause 1 we will not have a locus to make
stronger arguments about the potential loss of deforestation. I would
find it easier to argue that we should do more to prevent deforestation
around the world if we were to keep in mind that principal aim. I know
that that does not provide an exact legal locus, but it would make
matters easier from the point of view of our
argument.</div>
<a name="0806251000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000379"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I appreciate
that a great deal of the discussion this morning concerns positioning
relating to the Bill, but does the right hon. Gentleman accept that
Bills should be logical in their construction in addition to making
statements about how the world is or should be? In terms of a position
concerning 2° C, I wholeheartedly agree with him as regards the
overall goal that we should all be aiming for on global warming. Does
he agree, however, that if one simply stands by that, it is difficult
to talk subsequently about figures for the emissions of one particular
country because they have not been finally negotiated through
international agreements? If he sticks by his comments this morning,
will he voluntarily abjure any participation in the debate on clause 2,
which is about numbers and percentages? It seems to me that it is
difficult logically to speak authoritatively about both propositions at
the same time, and not reflect on the possibility that there may be a
contradiction between the two.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000380"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I will do a deal with the hon. Gentleman: I will
not speak on clause 2 if he will vote to keep in clause 1. I am not
being facetious. I will leave it to others who are infinitely more
experienced on carbon emissions, trading and targets to argue whether
the target should be 60 per cent. or 80 per cent. I approach this Bill
from the point of view of someone who negotiated at Rio in 2002 for 18
hot, sticky days. I was pleased at the end that we made that start at
the first Earth Summit. Getting an agreement on forests caused me the
most problems and led to the most intense debate. We saw tremendous
potential to make huge changes on world carbon emissions, if we could
prevent
deforestation.</div><a name="0806251000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not the place to get into technical details on that, but that is
where I am coming from. I strongly believe that if we keep clause 1, it
will make it easier for the Government to take action on forests and
other areas, because the principal aim will be doing things to reduce
the world temperature. That is not the sole reason for keeping clause
1, and we will not take the blame if the world temperature does not go
down, but we should
contribute.</div><a name="0806251000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my opinion, other things, such as adaption and emissions trading, are
not mentioned strongly enough in the Bill, and I hope to move
amendments on those points in due course. I plead with the Minister
that it will not destroy the structure of the Bill to leave in that
principle, which would not make the Bill look idiotic and would not tie
his hands in any way. I would love to see the Minister read out the
&#147;if pressed&#148; bits in his notes, which usually include the
most spurious arguments for desperate Ministers. The Minister should
share his worries about the clause with us. I will return to forests
when I move amendments on the subject, but I plead with him to leave
clause 1 in the Bill, because it does no harm and a lot of
good.</div><a name="0806251000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000381"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): It is a privilege to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. May I take this
opportunity to congratulate the Minister for the Environment and the
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the
hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford, on bringing forward the Bill? Given
the generous spirit of the Minister for the Environment, I am sure that
he would wish to pay tribute to my right hon. Friends the Members for
Suffolk, Coastal and for Penrith and The Border for the contributions
they have made, and to recognise that the UK climate change programme
has been going on since 1994. The last Conservative Administration set
the first
targets.</div><a name="0806251000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will restrict my remarks to amendments Nos. 43 and 44 and set out why
we believe that they are necessary. I thank the hon. Member for
Northavon for moving amendment No. 43 as eloquently as he did. I would
like to draw attention not so much to what is in the Bill, as amended
by the upper House, but what the Government have left out. The hon.
Member for Northavon described the amendments as the route map towards
our ultimate destination. The Government have always said&#151;this
has been said internationally&#151;that the objective of avoiding
dangerous climate change is what signatories to the UN framework
convention on climate change, such as the UK, have committed themselves
to do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="0806251000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prime

more than 2 degrees

</i>11 December 2007; Vol. 697, c.
130.]</div><a name="0806251000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

recently in the European Commission&#146;s 2007 communication

beyond&#148;.</div><a name="0806251000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will accept that that was at the heart of the previous
Government&#146;s climate strategy, before being the starting
assumption for the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#146;s
report in 2000. This is not something that has plucked from some minor
policy document pulled off the shelf. It has been central to the
Government&#146;s climate change policy for the entire lifetime of
the Government, so why are Ministers so anxious about it appearing in
their flagship Climate Change Bill? My right hon. Friend the Member for
Penrith and The Border set out in some detail&#151;he quoted from the
Stern review&#151;the consequences of a 2° C rise in
temperatures. The Stern review warns that such a rise could lead to,
among other effects, a 20 to 30 per cent. decrease in water
availability in vulnerable regions such as southern Africa and the
Mediterranean, sharp declines in crop yield in tropical
regions&#151;5 to 10 per cent. in Africa&#151;and a high risk of
extinction for Arctic species. I do not know whether the Minister knows
that the crown princes of three Scandinavian countries&#151;Denmark,
Norway and Sweden, I believe&#151;are at this very moment looking at
what damage is being caused in the Arctic region. I am sure that we
would applaud such
action.</div><a name="0806251000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
a rise of 3° C, we would see 150 million to 550
million more people at risk of hunger, with between 1 billion and 4
billion more people suffering water shortages. Stern finds that some
models predict the collapse of the American rainforest. I am sure my
right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border will return to
this point at a later
stage.</div><a name="0806251000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we moved to a 4° C increase above average, we could see a 30 to
50 per cent. decrease in water availability in southern Africa and the
Mediterranean, African crop yields falling by 15 to 35 per cent., and
entire regions, such as Australia, coming out of food production. Up to
80 million more people in Africa could be exposed to malaria. With a
5° C increase, Stern predicts the end of large glaciers in the
Himalayas, which would affect a quarter of China&#146;s
population.</div><a name="0806251000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000382"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): I,
like other Committee members, have enormous sympathy with the principle
of what the hon. Lady says, but this debate is about not whether we
should be achieving the 2° C, but the extent to which the Bill
and the targets that it sets are dependent on what the UK can achieve
itself and how much is dependent on international negotiation, and thus
driven by our aspirations, but not the Bill&#146;s legal
framework.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="0806251000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000383"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am hoping that, in speaking to the amendments,
the Minster will say why the Government are wriggling on the 2°

target.</div><a name="0806251000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000384"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I have never wriggled on this. The Government are
not wriggling on the 2° C target, but objecting to a clause that
they argue is
meaningless.</div><a name="0806251000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000385"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
intervention, but the Government, through the Prime Minister and all
the preparatory documents, did mention the target on 2° C above
average temperatures. I wonder whether it was irregular to suggest that
the Minister was wriggling, because he is very robust and does not
shift from his
position.</div><a name="0806251000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000386"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Now that the figure is in this clause, does not my
hon. Friend agree that removing it would certainly give grounds for
doubt and that that would be a mistake? Would she also say to the hon.
Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, who interrupted her so
helpfully, that nothing in this clause says that Britain would not be
negotiating, helping, and seeking to get others to come along? It
merely says that we are pinning our colours to the mast, because people
will not come along with us if we do not do this ourselves
first.</div><a name="0806251000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000387"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> It is important that Britain plays its role. As
my right hon. Friend so eloquently says&#151;I paraphrase
him&#151;we want to be in the vanguard of the environmental
revolution, just as Britain was in the vanguard of the industrial
revolution.</div>
<a name="0806251000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
strengthen the Government&#146;s arm, particularly when we come to
negotiations in Copenhagen next year. Following our debate on the
amendments, I hope the Minister will recognise that it is crucial that
we keep the 2° C limit in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000388"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The hon. Lady appears to be suggesting that
there is some dispute or discussion about the 2° C target, as if
having the Bill without that figure would somehow remove a commitment
to the target. It would be great to put in the Bill that we would like
to save polar bears, and to stop plankton from rising to the surface of
the oceans and exuding excessive amounts of methane. Does she accept
that the target is actually about what happens as a result of
international negotiation? If negotiations go a particular way, the
UK&#146;s performance on emissions will be in one category. If they
go another way, that will be in another category. If Barack Obama gets
elected, that will make a difference to those negotiations. Does she
not accept that if one puts something in legislation that does not
do&#151;</div>
<a name="0806251000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000389"></a>The

brief.</div><a name="0806251000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000390"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is very
knowledgeable on these issues. I have tried very carefully to follow
his argument.</div>
<a name="0806251000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was the
Government who pitched this. Their own report&#151;the Stern
review&#151;set the 2° C target. For the purposes of
international negotiations, the 2° C aim has been repeatedly
reaffirmed by the European Union. We want to be part of the European
Union&#146;s emissions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>trading scheme. We want to follow the science. We are asking why the
Government appear to be perhaps not wriggling, but backtracking, from
their original commitment.</div>
<a name="0806251000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that we
are on track to meet our Kyoto targets, but we also know that that is
in large part due to reduction in emissions during the early 1990s as
electricity generation moved from coal to gas. In 1997, the incoming
Government made much of the fact that they committed Britain to a much
tougher target in Kyoto&#151;a 20 per cent. cut in carbon emissions
by 2010. That target soon became downgraded to a domestic aim. I am
sure that the Minister accepts that this could be seen as a subtle
shift in language to help to make the target an aspiration rather than
a promise. With the passing of time, the gap has widened between the
cuts needed to reach the target and the actual emissions. I commend the
graphs in the House of Commons Library document that set out this point
very clearly. Ministers have been forced to admit that the target would
be hard to meet but, strangely, the Government tried to assure people
that they were still committed to the target, but not expecting to meet
it. Now it is widely accepted that this target will be
met.</div><a name="0806251000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us consider another target: the 20 per cent. renewable energy target.
The former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, signed up to that just before
leaving office. After making the commitment, the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform suggested that the target
was hard to meet and that Ministers should explore statistical
interpretations that made it easier to meet. Perhaps if they stopped
changing the names of Departments, this would be easier to
follow.</div><a name="0806251000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a sense, the Bill is the Government&#146;s mea culpa and a sign that
they accept these criticisms. Ministers have often said that industry
is given confidence to invest in solutions if targets are known and set
in law, rather than just being targets in Government policy. That is
why the most important of all climate change targets cannot be left as
just a
policy.</div><a name="0806251000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

Horwood:</b> The hon. Lady has given an elegant reprise of
many of the arguments that we put in the many climate change debates in

Minister&#151;whether she endorses the principle of contraction and
convergence, as set out by the Global Commons
Institute?</div><a name="0806251000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000392"></a>Miss

principle we do. We follow the science. I am clear on that. We want the

Bexhill and Battle will come to that in a moment.</div>
<a name="0806251000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed that amendments Nos. 43 and 44 should be moved from the
Opposition Benches. Ministers have a formidable civil service team and
access to parliamentary counsel to find the best wording to deal with
these concerns. We will happily withdraw the amendments if Ministers
assure us that this is the approach that they will take, and that they
will
revert&#151;</div><a name="0806251000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000393"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Two
degrees</div><a name="0806251000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000394"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Two degrees above. The science is there. It is
all in the Stern report. If the Minister can assure us of that, we
would be happy to withdraw the amendments. Instead, Ministers appear to
have decided 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>to scrap not just the amendments and what is enshrined in them, but the
clause. That leads us to suspect that the objections being raised are
not the real reasons that Ministers oppose the amendments, but a
smokescreen. The real reason may be that the Government are not
committed to a 2° C aim, but are using it as a slogan. I am sure
the Minister would wish to reassure me.</div>
<a name="0806251000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">While no one
believes that the targets in the Bill are tough enough to be compatible
with the 2° C aim, and while the Government continue to battle
with their own Back Benchers to avoid toughening the targets, the only
reassurance we have that the 2° C aim will not be dropped like
the 20 per cent target, or statistically reinterpreted like the
renewables target, is to protect it by including it in the Bill. I
commend amendments Nos. 43 and 44 to the
Committee.</div><a name="0806251000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000395"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair,
Mr. Cook, and it is a pleasure to be debating again with the
Minister, with whom I have done business before on the Sustainable
Communities Act 2007. I know that he is a Minister who is prepared to
listen to the arguments and stand up to the frogs&#146; chorus of
&#147;Better not, Minister&#148; or, in that case, &#147;Not
invented here, Minister,&#148; and I hope he will take the same
robust approach to this important
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
speak as that rare beast in the Westminster jungle, a speaking Whip, to
support clause 1. This morning&#146;s debate is a valuable
opportunity to focus on the purpose of the Bill. To me, this important
Bill has only one core value, which is as a robust framework Bill that
delivers exactly what the market says it needs&#151;a clear and
credible sense of direction in terms of targets and eventually
underlying policy, that will allow the private sector to make the
investment that is needed and that will make the difference. It is not
Government but businesses and their customers&#151;the private
sector&#151;that will make the difference, and they need a clearer,
more robust and more credible framework.</div>
<a name="0806251000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key word
is &#147;credible&#148;. The background to the Bill is a history of
missed targets and a lack of faith and belief out there that the
Government are serious about tackling climate change. Therefore,
arguably, the key value in the Bill is not the targets themselves, but
the process of accountability&#151;the process of keeping the feet of
the Government of the day to the
fire.</div><a name="0806251000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is, to some degree, the start of a journey, a road map, as it has
been described this morning. The destination is important. The
Government seem to be happy for that destination to be framed simply in
the language of unilateral UK reductions of greenhouse gases. As we
have argued from the Liberal Democrat Benches in the Committee, that is
not enough.</div>
<a name="0806251000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
explain why we are reducing emissions. We are not doing it for fun. We
are doing it because we feel an urgent need to control temperature
increases in order to mitigate the risk of dangerous climate
instability. We have a UK target in relation to temperature. The Prime
Minister himself stated it again in a speech to the WWF on 19 November
2007. He said:</div>
<a name="0806251000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
vision has one overriding aim: holding the rise in global average
temperature to no more than 2 degrees
centigrade.&#148;</div>
<a name="0806251000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the existing UK
target. It is embedded in the framework of an EU policy driving towards
exactly the same goal. There are good reasons for that, which have been
powerfully articulated in Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div><a name="0806251000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the
analysis that we have to date from Stern and the IPCC makes it clear
that the risks and costs of growing climate instability rise
substantially above 2° C. That has been adequately brought out
by the Stern report. It is perhaps worth pointing out that Stern also
noted that an increase above 2° C
will</div>
<a name="0806251000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;accelerate
future warming by reducing natural absorption and releasing stores of
carbon dioxide and
methane.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
further we move above 2° C, the higher the risk of tipping
points and of accelerated global warming, which is arguably the real
threat we have to
counter.</div><a name="0806251000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also clear from the Stern report that the costs of dealing with
climate change rise significantly above 2° C.
According to the analysis,</div>
<a name="0806251000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if the
temperature rises from 2° C to 3° C, the mean damage
estimate increases from 0.6 per cent. to 1.4 per cent. of gross world
product; but the &#145;worst case&#146;&#151;the 95th percentile
of the probability distribution&#151;goes from 4 per cent. to 9.1 per
cent.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that the risks and costs fall disproportionately on the poor, we have a
moral duty. I congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon on emphasising
that word, rather to the scorn of Government Members.
&#147;Moral&#148; is exactly the right word to use in this
context.</div>
<a name="0806251000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2°
C target is therefore a line in the sand. It should be our explicit
guiding star. The importance of this debate, rather undermined by
Government Members, is that that target is under threat because of the
global concentrations of carbon dioxide. All the analysis suggests that
it will be hard to keep temperatures below that critical threshold.
This is an extremely important time to restate commitments to that
goal. Surely it is too early to give up on it. That is why it is so
disappointing, not just that the Government are so reticent on the
matter, but that they are going out of their way to remove from the
Bill a clause that makes a link between UK targets and their
overarching goal.</div>
<a name="0806251000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
disappointing because the Government take pride in their leadership on
climate change. To be generous, some of that pride is justified. The
very fact that we are debating the Bill is a symbol of leadership. It
will be scrutinised by Governments across the world who are struggling
with issues such as how to set targets, how to make them meaningful,
how to revise them, and how to build in processes of
accountability.</div><a name="0806251000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000396"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> When those Governments look at the Bill, will they
not also look at the Committee stage, and say, &#147;Why the blazes
are the Government bringing forward the Bill, and then taking out this
very clause?&#148;? Let us not kid ourselves. This is not a private
activity that will not be recognised elsewhere. If they have not
already done so, many non-governmental organisations will make sure
that they notice the change that the Government have
made.</div><a name="0806251000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000397"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> I agree with that intervention. The Government are
in danger of sending the wrong signal, a damaging signal, because, as
members of the Committee have said, as far as we can see, the
Government are committed to the 2° C goal. It is stated EU
policy.</div><a name="0806251000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000398"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> The hon. Gentleman made a very important point a
moment before taking the last intervention. It was about targets and
accountability. Is it not at the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>heart of the argument that one cannot write into UK legislation a
commitment to a target for which one does not have sole responsibility
and sole
accountability?</div><a name="0806251000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000399"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> That is what we are debating. I take a different
view, for reasons that I shall explain. First, there is tremendous
value in having the 2° C target as a guiding star, a general
duty for the legislation. Critically, the UK target must be linked to
something. It cannot just stand as an absolute
number.</div><a name="0806251000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000400"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the basis of
the Stern report was to derive UK domestic targets from a perception
and an analysis of the global stabilisation
targets?</div><a name="0806251000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000401"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> Indeed. That is the key piece that is missing. The
original 2050 target of 50 per cent. was a rather arbitrary number, and
there has been no analysis linking it to any collective international
goal at all. The Bill is an opportunity to make a link between a global
collective goal, and our individual contribution.</div>
<a name="0806251000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as I
can see, the Government&#146;s arguments are about the difficulty of
legislating to control global tensions. We know that, and we know that
there may be underlying concerns about the vulnerability of Ministers
to judicial review. However, it is clear, as Lord Taylor said in the
Lords,
that</div><a name="0806251000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
general duty not intended to provide a test for individual
decisions&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>25
February 2008; Vol. 699, c.
451.]</div><a name="0806251000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">is a
general duty that can be evaluated, that reinforces the direction of
travel at a crucial time, and that puts the targets in some
context.</div>
<a name="0806251000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I close with a
quote from Lord Rooker in Committee. He
stated:</div><a name="0806251000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
UK remains committed to the European Union 2º target, but there
is no simple relationship between that target and the UK&#146;s 2050
target, which is why we oppose the
amendments.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>11
December 2007; Vol. 697, c.
130.]</div><a name="0806251000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
wrong. Of course, there is no simple relationship, but we need to
understand it. We must make it transparent. We need to make that link,
which is why I strongly believe that clause 1 must remain in he
Bill.</div>
<a name="0806251000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806251000402"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I want briefly to
discuss the three amendments in the group. I can see the arguments for
including the original clause, for withdrawing it and for trying to
amend
it.</div><a name="0806251000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not disagree with the general sentiments expressed by all the
Opposition Members who have spoken. However, they have perhaps
undermined and weakened their argument by exaggerating their case by
claiming that the Government have somehow abandoned their sense of the
moral significance of climate change as a political issue, suggesting
that the Government are not interested in the way in which British
efforts relate to international efforts and saying that the Government
no longer support the 2º objective.</div>
<a name="0806251000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The central
point here is that the 2º objective is a statement of the
self-evident. There is no dispute about the importance of 2º in
maintaining the volume of emissions in the atmosphere to less than 450
parts per million. In fact, the 2º objective may not succeed in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>restraining emissions to 450 parts per million as the Stern report and
the intergovernmental panel on climate change have made
clear.</div>
<a name="0806251000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real issue
is not whether we should be reiterating the importance of the 2º
objective and the reason for it, but whether it needs to be in clause 1
of the Bill. There are good reasons for it not to be included in clause
1, because Ministers, including the Prime Minister in a major speech in
November last year, and all the scientific advice from the United
Kingdom, the European Union and through the whole post-Kyoto process
have reiterated the significance of 2º. If a reference to
2º is needed, it should be in the long title of the Bill, which
would be a more appropriate place specifically to refer to keeping
emissions globally within 2º. However, we are not here to amend
the long title,
unfortunately.</div><a name="0806251000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
drafted, clause 1 contains a serious limitation. It
states:</div><a name="0806251000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principal aim... is to ensure that UK emissions of greenhouse
gases do not exceed the level necessary to contribute to limiting the
global average
temperature&#148;.</div><a name="0806251000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
on earth does &#147;contribute&#148; mean? Again, it is absolutely
self-evident that whatever the United Kingdom does is going to
contribute, which prompts the question of what the level of that
contribution should
be.</div><a name="0806251000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000403"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman support amendment No. 44?
It would remove the words around &#147;contribute&#148; and replace
them
with,</div><a name="0806251000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
proportionate share of total global emissions of greenhouse gases
compatible
with&#148;,</div><a name="0806251000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is much
clearer.</div><a name="0806251000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="0806251000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000404"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I will come to amendment No. 44 in a moment,
although my comments about &#147;contribute&#148; apply equally to
&#147;proportionate&#148;, which is why I do not support amendment
No.
44.</div><a name="0806251000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are problems with the wording, because it prompts the question of the
nature of the contribution. The difficulty is that, by maintaining the
clause as it stands, we are confusing the political and ethical purpose
of Government policy with the precise legislative detail designed to
implement that policy. For example, in the Counter-Terrorism Bill,
which was a matter of great controversy just a few days ago, was there
a purpose provision setting out clearly the objectives of 42-day
detention? I would have thought that the objective of extending the
current period of detention to 42 days is obvious. The objective was
not in the Bill, because it was not necessary, absolutely self-evident,
well understood by everyone and reiterated by Ministers on numerous
occasions.</div><a name="0806251000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000405"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument carefully, but what is the precise disadvantage of having the
provision in the Bill? What would happen that should not happen because
it is in the Bill? We would need to know that in order to overcome the
obvious disadvantage of removing the statement from the Bill, which
would give a signal to the rest of the world. What is the precise
disadvantage?</div><a name="0806251000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000406"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The obvious disadvantage of removing the
statement is, as the right hon. Gentleman has said, that the world at
large will not know the significance of the Bill. I think that it was
included in the Bill so that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>could be taken out, which will allow the Opposition parties an
opportunity to campaign. Frankly, if the right hon. Gentleman or his
colleagues wish to come to my constituency and campaign on the issue
that clause 1, with its reference to 2°, has been
taken out of the Bill and that is a major flaw in Government policy, he
is welcome to do so. Most of my Conservative opponents in my
constituency are still in denial about climate change, so it would help
my
cause.</div><a name="0806251000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000407"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> That was a rather flippant answer to a serious
question. What is the precise disadvantage to the Bill of the clause
being there? Leaving aside the party political point scoring, what is
the precise disadvantage to the
Bill?</div><a name="0806251000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000408"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I was coming to that point, had the hon.
Gentleman not intervened. The disadvantage is that the clause prompts
the question of the level and nature of the contribution. The precise
disadvantage would be for a future Government in a future Parliament
with a future climate change (amendment) Bill, when hundreds and
thousands of hours would be spent by hon. and right hon. Members, civil
servants, lawyers, the public at large, the media and non-governmental
organisations in trying to define what &#147;contribute&#148;
means</div><a name="0806251000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000409"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman conceive of circumstances
in which people would not discuss the contribution? How will the clause
make it more likely that we will discuss it? We will always discuss it,
so I find it difficult to see a disadvantage. We will discuss that
whether in this House or elsewhere, but taking out that commitment
would make a clear
statement.</div><a name="0806251000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000410"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> That is not the case, because the provision was
not in the Bill in the first place&#151;it was inserted for the
purpose that I described earlier. The precise disadvantage is that
there is no advantage in making the wording of the legislation less
precise than it needs to
be.</div><a name="0806251000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
clause 1 were to stay in the Bill, amendment No. 43 would be helpful
because it would improve the wording and make it more precise.
Amendment No. 44 would weaken the clause, because it introduces the
issue of &#147;proportionate share&#148;, which prompts the
question of what that
is.</div><a name="0806251000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
similar objection applies to amendment No. 32, which refers to
&#147;historic levels of emissions&#148;. I am not sure whether
there is, has ever been or is ever likely to be exact methodology for
calculating historic levels of emissions. Therefore, there is no point
in referring in legislation to something that cannot be calculated. The
same argument applies
to</div><a name="0806251000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;projected
levels of emissions growth among other
countries.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
on earth does that mean? How many other countries project such levels
and over what period of time? The key objection to amendment No. 32 is
the imprecision of the language and the fact that it introduces
concepts that are subject to vastly different interpretations and, in
many respects, do not have a solid statistical base.</div>
<a name="0806251000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
afternoon, by coincidence, it is Foreign Office questions. A
characteristic of those questions is that hon. and right hon. Members
turn up to ask the Foreign Secretary and his Ministers questions about
what Britain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>is going to do in countries such as Burma, Zimbabwe, Iraq, Iran, Sri
Lanka and Afghanistan in the full knowledge that the
Government&#146;s capacity to influence events in many of those
countries is far less than most of us would wish. The same applies to
this morning&#146;s debate about 2° C and the development of
an international climate change policy. We must recognise that the
Government are limited in their capacity to influence international
events and the trajectory of global emissions over the next 50
years.</div>
<a name="0806251000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our Government
have one key way in which to influence the situation, which is by
putting forward legislation that is precise, workable, and backed up by
policy that is designed to give effect to the objectives described in
the legislation and that provides a model for other countries to
follow. It is far more important that we get a piece of legislation
that is precise and workable, that Parliament supports the policies
that are necessary to implement it, that we achieve the emissions
reductions so that we provide a model for other countries to adopt, if
they choose to do so, and that we engage enthusiastically in
international negotiations to try to persuade other countries to adopt
that model rather than resorting to what can only be described as
gesture politics by trying to make a reference to 2° in clause 1
the be all and end all of the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000411"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I do not for a second doubt the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s commitment to tackling climate change. This
afternoon, he will move an amendment to put an 80 per cent. target in
the Bill. If the Bill is not amended and retains the reference to 60
per cent, we will have a target that does not achieve the goal that he
and I share and we will have no statement of purpose. We will emerge
with a Bill that does not achieve the goal that we share and does not
say what the Bill is for. Surely that cannot be
acceptable.</div><a name="0806251000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000412"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b><b class="B"> </b>We must remember that the phrase
&#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; could include 80 per cent. or
even 95 per cent. I do not think that that is a fundamental
point of importance. The &#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; target
will be revised by the Climate Change Committee when it produces its
report on 1 December. However, when we get to clause 2, I may put a
slightly different
argument.</div><a name="0806251000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
a reference has been made to contraction and convergence. The Liberal
Democrats attempted to challenge the Government on whether they support
the principle of contraction and convergence as the basis for
international negotiations. I support the principle, but not because it
absolutely relies on specifying 2° C, or 450 ppm, as the
ultimate objective; I support it because that is what is happening now.
The consequence of the Kyoto protocol gave targets to annexe 1
countries and not to non-annexe 1 countries. It is the general
objective of even the most recalcitrant countries, such as the United
States and, until quite recently, Australia. So, my response to the
Liberal Democrat challenge on contraction and convergence is that
frankly, there is no alternative. That is what is happening now, and
what will happen over the next 50 years and perhaps beyond.
That does not mean that the precise model of contraction and
convergence put forward by the Global Commons Institute is going to be
followed to the letter&#151;I suspect that it will not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>be&#151;but the general drift to the richer countries contracting
their emissions and the developing countries increasing their
emissions, and therefore securing convergence, will obviously
happen.</div><a name="0806251000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000413"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful speech,
but he has mentioned 450 ppm as an agreed target on two occasions. He
knows that the Government, whom he supports, has a target range for
stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions, which is 450 to 550 ppm.
Will he join me in urging his Government to drop their outlying rider
of 550 ppm, because analysis has shown it to be increasingly
incompatible with the 2°
target?</div><a name="0806251000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000414"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I have not said at any point that 450
parts per million is the target. I referred to the fact that the
scientific advice suggests that above 450 ppm the likelihood of
dangerous climate change increasing is even greater. We need to set the
matter in
context.</div><a name="0806251000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the reasons that I have outlined, there is a solid argument for
withdrawing clause 1, when we come to the Question on clause stand
part, but even though the Opposition have made important points on the
underlying principles, because of the lack of precision in clause 1 and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000415"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Opposition Members have made a number of
important points this morning, but there has also been quite a lot of
mealy-mouthed talk, which augers badly for the progress of the Bill in
Committee on the basis of consensus. I am concerned about the insertion
of the principal aim clause in the other place, because it may have
been designed not so much to emphasise the principal aim as to beat the
Government around the head on the grounds that they are not really
committed to that principal aim because they will not put it in the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said in an earlier intervention, it is possible to put all sorts of
things in such clauses. We could have a whole list of things that we
are committed not to do and on which, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bury, North has said, we have no traction. I really do not want to see
polar bears disappearing from the north pole, but I would not be
prepared to stand in this House and place in legislation that the UK
Government have a duty to ensure that polar bears do not disappear in
the Arctic.</div>
<a name="0806251000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important
question on the overall mechanisms in this Bill, which it is very
important that we get right and which will be the subject of our debate
this afternoon, is what will the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State
or whoever it is be faced with in 2051 when they come before the House
of Commons to say what they have done. Let us say that that person
stands up in the House and says, &#147;Great news! According to our
carbon budgets, we have reduced our emissions by 80 per cent., and
therefore we have succeeded in what this Bill set out to do all those
many years ago.&#148; Somebody else could say, &#147;No, sorry, you
have not actually kept below 2° C, and therefore you have
failed.&#148; One approach involves what we can do as far as the UK
is concerned; the other involves what we might do if many other
countries were to enter the process of making sure that there are
international commitments that enable both reductions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>in emissions to be undertaken in particular countries and an overall
reduction in emissions across the globe as a result of those
commitments. Then the global targets on parts per million and
temperature can be
achieved.</div><a name="0806251000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="0806251000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">That,
of course, depends on crucial upcoming negotiations and discussions.
If, for example, the United States continues on a path of not wishing
to address seriously the sort of emissions that are envisaged by the
Bill, or if other countries do the same, the percentage that the UK
will have to undertake if we are to succeed will be different. However,
if the United States and other countries take a different
path&#151;as I hope that they will&#151;achieving something getting
on for 80 per cent. would represent a move very solidly towards the
idea of keeping the world within a 2° C temperature rise and
restraining the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to around 450
ppm.</div>
<a name="0806251000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">To suggest
that everything hinges on this clause, and that if we do not go for the
clause, we are not serious about all the rest of this, is not just
overblown but, frankly, a little insulting to those people who are
trying to draft legislation that will get those mechanisms right for
this country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North said, the
Bill will demonstrate to several countries that are looking very
seriously at our climate change legislation that devices can be
introduced in legislation that enable a country to play its proper role
in reducing emissions. If we fall at the very first
hurdle&#151;before we have even started looking at how to put this
together&#151;frankly, to paraphrase the right hon. Member for
Suffolk, Coastal, our grandchildren will say &#147;What were they
doing? Why were they not constructing serious legislation on what the
country could properly do as far as carbon emissions are concerned? Why
were they posturing and deciding what should or should not go in
declaratory parts of the Bill at the expense of making the Bill
work?&#148;</div>
<a name="0806251000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
is seriously concerned with making the Bill work. My modest suggestion,
and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North, would be that if
we were to make any changes, we should place the principal aim of the
Bill in the long title. I appreciate that we cannot put all clause 1 in
because the long title has to reflect what is in the Bill. Yet, surely
the whole Bill is for this purpose, and placing something like that in
the long title would mean that those who have made serious comments
this morning about how to ensure that business proceeds properly could
be satisfied about the intentions of the Bill. That would also make
sure that the Bill worked not just to satisfy the ambitions of our
country on addressing climate change, but to ensure that other
countries follow our lead with similar
legislation.</div><a name="0806251000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000416"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> This has been a most instructive and interesting
sitting. I disagree profoundly with the hon. Member for Southampton,
Test because our proceedings augur very well for the debates and
discussions that we will be having in Committee over the next few days.
The debate has been by no means a diversion. Our discussion goes to the
very heart of what we are trying to achieve, and I do not think that
the debate has detracted in any way from the meat of the Bill, or from
the frameworks, mechanisms and committees that it will
establish.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="0806251000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may
respond to the hon. Gentleman directly, his suggestion that the debate
has taken place at the whim of Opposition parties&#151;either
Conservative or Liberal Democrat&#151;was beneath him. He knows that
non-governmental organisations such as Friends of the Earth and
Greenpeace&#151;I am sure that he and, certainly, the Ministers hold
those organisations in esteem&#151;have given vociferous support for
the principal aim. I propose to address my remarks to that aim, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York spoke extremely eloquently
about amendments Nos. 43 and
44.</div><a name="0806251000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the outset of the debate, my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk,
Coastal really set the benchmark for this Bill by making a wonderful
and inspiring speech that I hope his children and many other children
will read. It reflected the ambition that we all have for this Bill and
reminds Members on both sides of the Committee why we came into
politics, why we get out of bed in the morning, why we are proud to be
Members of Parliament, and why we campaign: because there is a higher
purpose. It is very easy to lose that higher purpose in the tit for tat
trading of brickbats across the Committee. My right hon. Friend really
rose above the party political divide, and he reminded us how
profoundly important the Bill is and what we are all
about.</div><a name="0806251000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000417"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> In the spirit of bipartisanship, and given that we
are all highly committed to the overall end, will the hon. Gentleman
recognise that we are discussing not a principal aim, but a process:
the extent to which the Bill give us the right framework? There may be
a disagreement about that, but it does not go to the heart of the
question of the aim. Will he take this opportunity to put on record
that he does not believe that any disagreement about process reflects a
fundamental wavering by the Government or the Minister on achieving a
2° C
reduction?</div><a name="0806251000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000418"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I certainly agree. I am not here to question the
Government&#146;s commitment to 2° C, although at the tail end
of an Administration, it is not this Government who should greatly
concern us, but the commitment of future Governments, whether they are
formed by my party, the Labour party or any other. We are talking about
a process that will run for decades and decades. When people look back
at the measures and technicalities to which the meat of this Bill
addresses itself, it will be important that its overall aim is clear in
their minds. We are beginning our discussions with the first page of
the Bill, and it is important that the aim is there, clearly and
squarely.</div><a name="0806251000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000419"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal made a
very thoughtful and interesting speech, but he threatened that if
clause 1 were withdrawn from the Bill, he would travel around the
country and launch a campaign against the Government for doing
precisely that. I am inclined to invite him to my constituency because
that could be very helpful to my cause&#151;I might issue him with a
personal invitation&#151;but how can the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle reconcile that threat with his assertion that the right hon.
Gentleman was able to rise above the party political
divide?</div><a name="0806251000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000420"></a>Mr.
Gummer</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div><a name="0806251000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000421"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I would love to answer that, but I fear that my
right hon. Friend could answer it even
better.</div><a name="0806251000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am reluctant to allow any kind of
response to an intervention from someone who was not even holding the
Floor.</div><a name="0806251000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000423"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I think that I follow that advice, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="0806251000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that my right hon. Friend was trying&#151;no doubt he will
correct me if I am wrong&#151;to challenge Labour Members, whom I
know in their heart of hearts most emphatically endorse the aim, to
have the courage of their convictions, to be bold and not to listen to
the siren calls of the civil service chiming in from behind
Ministers&#151;</div><a name="0806251000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000424"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. It would now be correct for the right
hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal to intervene. That keeps both the
Committee and the Chairman in
order.</div><a name="0806251000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000425"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I give way&#151;spontaneously&#151;to my right
hon.
Friend.</div><a name="0806251000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000426"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Did my hon. Friend notice that the hon. Member for
Bury, North made a partial comment about what I said? I said that I did
not want the Government to put themselves in a position in which one
would be tempted to behave in such a way. I was trying hard to get the
Government to recognise that the more they enable people to keep the
Bill consensual, the better. Perhaps I have been misinterpreted. If I
was so opaque as to make it possible to believe such a thing, I
apologise. However, if I remember rightly, the hon. Member for Bury,
North was, perfectly reasonably, making the kind of mischief that is
perfectly reasonable across the Floor. I assure my hon. Friend the
Member for Bexhill and Battle that it is my intention to keep the
Government on the straight and
narrow.</div><a name="0806251000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000427"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Indeed. That is what we are all endeavouring to
do.</div><a name="0806251000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, who was the
Minister who represented the UK to great effect at the Rio conference,
drew out a very important point that answers many of the points that
were raised quite validly by Labour Members. This Bill is infinitely
more than the sum of its parts. It is more than just a collection of
technical measures. It is more than a series of sensible measures to
bring to  life committees, reporting mechanisms, budgets and
commitments to report further and to make public appointments. It is so
much more than that.</div>
<a name="0806251000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will be
doing a disservice to the public, to the layman, to students, to
children and to interested parties who have heard so much about the
Climate Change Bill in the press if, when they pick up the Act that the
Bill becomes, they are immediately confronted with quite technical
gobbledegook that is meaningless in the overall battle to keep down the
rise in temperature. Putting a clear aim in the Bill is not just
totemic, but common sense.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div><a name="0806251000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Ruislip-Northwood reminded us of the costs and
catastrophes that would befall the world if we did not keep the rise
below 2° C. He also reminded us of the excellent report by Lord
Stern commissioned by the
Government.</div><a name="0806251000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could not quite follow all the argument outlined by of the hon. Member
for Bury, North because while he clearly set his face against
supporting the clause, he said that he would be in favour of including
its wording in the Bill&#146;s long title. He seemed to accept the
principle but then, because his own side is against the practice, he
did not support such wording in the clause. I am advised&#151;I will
stand corrected if I have wrongly interpreted the advice&#151;that it
is not possible to revise the long title of the Bill, and nor is it
possible for the Committee to insert a preamble into the Bill, although
I believe that the Government could do so. I will come back to that in
my closing remarks. Perhaps a chink of light is being shed on our
proceedings.</div><a name="0806251000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000428"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps I may help from the Chair. The
title can be changed as long as the changed title does not impinge on
the content of the Bill. The title must still reflect the content of
the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000325"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="0806251000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000429"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Indeed, Mr. Cook. The problem that we
would encounter in changing the long title of the Bill is that that
which we sought to put in the long title would not be in the Bill if we
removed it from clause 1. Is that correct, Mr.
Cook?</div><a name="0806251000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000430"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The purpose of holding the title of the Bill
until the closing stages is to ensure that it reflects everything that
has gone before, by
agreement.</div><a name="0806251000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000431"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Indeed. I do not profess to have a monopoly on
wisdom, but it would be difficult to incorporate something into the
long title if there was no mention of it in the Bill. The hon. Member
for Southampton, Test is making wonderful gestures. He would find it
difficult to interpret in the long title something that was not stated
specifically in the text of the Bill.</div>
<a name="0806251000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000432"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The long title reflects what is in the whole
Bill. If the Bill is about climate change and temperature rise, which
is a concomitant of climate change, it is perfectly reasonable for that
to be reflected in the long title, whether or not there is a specific
mention within the Bill of the precise description that is in the long
title, provided that it does not stray outside the subject matter of
the Bill. That was the basis of my
suggestion.</div>
<a name="0806251000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000433"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> That is very interesting, but while the hon.
Gentleman was making his speech I sought informal advice, and I am
given to understand that what he suggests would be difficult to
accomplish. I understand the point that he makes, but technically
speaking, it would be difficult to incorporate that reference into the
long title at the end of the Committee, for the reasons that I
mentioned.</div>
<a name="0806251000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000434"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my hon. Friend at least reassure the Minister
that, were he to give us an assurance that he would seek to do as we
propose, we would be happy for that to replace the
clause?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div><a name="0806251000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000435"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My right hon. Friend has robbed me of my coup de
thÃ(c)&#226;tre at the end of my speech, for which I thank him,
although I had been warned by colleagues about his ability and talent
for so
doing.</div><a name="0806251000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000436"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I am sorry that my remarks earlier were not
entirely clear. I was trying to draw a distinction between the validity
of the reiteration of the objective of securing as a global limit a
2° C temperature increase, and its relevance&#151;whether it
should be in the text of the Bill at this point. My reference to the
long title was not intended to trigger a serious debate as to whether
the long title could be amended. I was certainly not suggesting an
amendment to the long title, but perhaps the Minister would give that
some consideration and report back later.</div>
<a name="0806251000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000437"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> A consensus is starting to emerge, which can only
be a good thing. That is the result of a rather robust conversation
this morning. It is an example of the robust scrutiny that my right
hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal mentioned earlier during
discussion of the programme motion.</div>
<a name="0806251000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
summarise the primary arguments in favour of the clause and our
criticism of the Government&#146;s argument. The Government&#146;s
opposition to this important clause is based on three arguments: that
the principal aim is unworkable and unenforceable, that Britain alone
has no control over keeping global warming under 2° C, and that
the Government have stated in the past that the principal aim is
without precedent. We believe that none of those three
arguments holds up under scrutiny.</div>
<a name="0806251000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we all
understand that the UK cannot be held responsible for all the
world&#146;s emissions, but that is not what the clause says, or what
it aspires to. There is nothing in the principal aim that places an
obligation on the United Kingdom to deliver single-handedly the
ambition to keep global warming under 2° C. We understand that
even if global emissions stopped today, there is no guarantee that we
would not exceed the 2° C target.</div>
<a name="0806251000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principal
aim set out in the Bill does not offer such a guarantee. It states that
the United Kingdom should be committed to doing its fair share to
prevent a dangerous outcome and should show international leadership.
The aspiration to limit the global average temperature increase to not
more than 2º C above pre-industrial levels is not some obscure
aspiration dreamed up by those on the Conservative Front Bench to bait
the Government with, or plucked from the sky. The Prime Minister said
last November:</div>
<a name="0806251000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
vision has one overriding aim; holding the rise in global temperatures
to no more than two degrees
centigrade.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2º threshold is the agreed policy of this country and, in
writing, the stated aim of the entire European Union. If the Government
are truly committed to this &#147;overriding aim&#148;, why are
they so timid and cautious about saying so in a landmark Bill? Why have
they committed to a target with the EU that they will not put in this
unprecedented domestic
legislation?</div><a name="0806251000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Neither
the Minister nor any of his successors should fear being hauled off to
jail should temperature rises exceed 2º. Even if that dangerous
2º scenario is reached, the UK Government would still have
fulfilled the terms 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>of the principal aim as long as they had made emissions cuts which, had
they been replicated across the developed world, might have prevented
such a
rise.</div><a name="0806251000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
of the argument that the principal aim is inappropriate, or
&#147;unprecedented&#148; in UK legislation? Evidence suggests
otherwise, and I thank Friends of the Earth for looking into the matter
so carefully. There is a sizeable list of laws on the statute book
which set out the broad aims of Acts and the purposes of the bodies
that they set up. For example, in the Sustainable Communities Act 2007,
section 1 states:</div>
<a name="0806251000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The principal
aim of this Act is to promote the sustainability of local
communities.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that, I pay handsome tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for
Ruislip-Northwood.</div><a name="0806251000235"></a>

Barker:</b> I hear from the Minister that he was given the
advice, &#147;better not&#148;, but clearly, on that famous Friday
he came to the House having eaten three Shredded Wheat, and his
political convictions got the better of him. I am sad that the Minister
has not had his breakfast this
morning.</div><a name="0806251000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000441"></a>Ms

discussions during the passage of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007
that required the UK Government to promote sustainable communities in
America, Africa, Asia, Australasia and indeed across the world? That is
the point&#151;the Sustainable Communities Act applied to what lies
within the powers of the British
Government.</div><a name="0806251000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000442"></a>Gregory

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000443"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> The hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North has shot her own fox. The difference is this: the
Government&#146;s purpose is to make sure that other nations follow
us. If the Government do not bother to do that, by their own admission
they will be letting down not only this nation, but future generations
throughout the world. It is exactly as the clause
outlines.</div><a name="0806251000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000444"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My right hon. Friend is correct. Surely the Bill,
which was devised and introduced by the Government, is not a timid
piece of domestic legislation. It is legislation of which we can be
rightly proud, I hope, and which will be an example around the world.
It is about asserting international leadership. Surely setting out the
principal aim of a Bill at the start makes that clear.</div>
<a name="0806251000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give another
example. Many Acts give principal aims to public bodies. For example,
the Environment Act 1995
states:</div><a name="0806251000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
shall be the principal aim of the Agency...in discharging its
functions so to protect or enhance the environment,&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div><a name="0806251000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is no more specific
than that. Other broad aims appear in the Food Standards Act 1999, the
Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, the Children&#146;s
Commissioner for Wales Act 2001, the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act
2002 and the Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order
2006.</div>
<a name="0806251000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Beyond the
national precedent, there is international precedent for including a
purpose clause in the Bill. Although the UK was the first in the world
to commit to introducing a Climate Change Bill, progress has not been
as speedy as we would have liked. During the period of procrastination
in bringing the Bill through Parliament, it appears that the Canadian
Parliament may have got there before us. Interestingly, the Climate
Change Accountability Act in Canada includes a purpose clause which was
recently passed by the Canadian House of Commons, and it reads
thus:</div><a name="0806251000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
purpose of this Act is to ensure that Canada contributes fully to the
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a
level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate
system.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
the clause is not without precedent, at home or abroad. It is not a
subtle attempt to legislate for the rest of the world. It does not
place any obligation on the UK to deliver the principal aim
single-handedly, nor does it leave any Minister&#151;particularly any
future Minister&#151;liable, should the global effort
fail.</div><a name="0806251000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth noting that the legislation is called the Climate Change Bill.
It is not the Carbon Emissions Reduction Bill. It is the Climate Change
Bill&#151;the global Climate Change Bill.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000446"></a>Gregory

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000447"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am trying to preserve a fairly free and
easy exchange of opinions here and to that extent, I am happy for
everyone who needs to do so to make an intervention on anyone who is
holding the floor. What I cannot stand&#151;partly because of my
partial deafness&#151;is the amount of chuntering that is going on.
It is unnecessary. It is unparliamentary, so please take my advice and
chunter not.</div>
<a name="0806251000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000448"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Thank you, Mr. Cook. It is worth noting
that the legislation is called the Climate Change Bill, not the Carbon
Emissions Reduction Bill. It has a global leadership purpose and we
should be proud and celebrate that fact. The principal aim clause
anchors what is otherwise just a framework of targets to a central
ambition and purpose that we all share: for Britain to do our part in
the battle against dangerous climate
change.</div><a name="0806251000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principal clause lifts the Bill from simply being a series of technical
and administrative reforms and innovations. It gives the legislation a
clear statement of our national shared intent, our national purpose and
the ambition that I believe all members of the Committee have, in their
heart of hearts, for the Bill. As another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>member said, let us pin our colours to the mast and put at the very
start of the Bill a clause of which we can proud.</div>
<a name="0806251000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had
intended to vote against the Government on this most important clause.
However, I am advised that, although the Committee cannot do so, it is
possible for the Government to insert a preamble to the Bill. I am
advised that it would be difficult to insert an effective form of
wording into the long title. The idea has merit, but technically that
would not be feasible. However, the Government could bring forth a
preamble. I invite the Government to consider that proposition, in the
spirit of consensus and in the spirit in which all members, on both
sides of the Committee, wish to work in scrutinising the Bill. Let us
see whether, between us, we can come up with a form of words, as a
preamble to the Bill, that would be acceptable to all members of the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000449"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Cook,
and for allowing us to have an extremely useful and wide-ranging
debate. I want to use this opportunity not only to answer questions,
but to explain why the Government do not want the clause in the Bill.
Opposition Members are motivated by the fear that the Government are
trying not to commit to 2° C as a target. They are trying to
strengthen that target, and I do not challenge their
motive.</div><a name="0806251000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will try to put the matter in an international context. Within the
United Nations negotiations and talks, the European Union&#151;of
which we are a leading member in those talks&#151;is committed to the
2° C bloc. We are seen by the world as the leaders. There is a
group of countries that does not support 2° C: the Pacific
island states. For them, 2° C is too much, because that means
that they disappear. Other countries are not prepared to commit to a
long-term goal of a 50 per cent. reduction in emissions by 2050, which
is how the 2° C limit is expressed in terms of emissions. The
poorer countries are not prepared to commit to that at this point
because they fear that doing so, without legally binding commitments
from the richer countries, would put too much of a burden on them. So,
there is not a consensus around 2° C from those countries. Some
members of the G8, particularly the United States of America, but also
Russia and Japan, are also not prepared to commit at this point to
2° C. The consequence of that situation is that if we were to
legislate for something outside our control, we would be passing
legislation that, in our view, would be meaningless, thus damaging the
credibility of the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000450"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> My understanding is that the EU will negotiate
en bloc. It will negotiate from a position  of
2°
C.</div><a name="0806251000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000451"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Lady is right. Her argument fails to
understand&#151;I would ask Opposition Members to ask themselves this
question&#151;why the European Union has not legislated for 2°
C. It has not done so because, as in my argument, that would be a
meaningless act. Legislating for a global goal of 2° C, and
whether or not we are committed to that, are separate questions. That
explains both our stance and that of the European
Union.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000452"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I genuinely would be on the Minister&#146;s side
if I thought that that was what the paragraph meant. All the clause
says is that
the</div><a name="0806251000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;principal

objective. I cannot see the &#147;better not&#148; in saying
that.</div><a name="0806251000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000453"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> When I reach the end of my argument, the right
hon. Gentleman will see the logic of my point of view. He is one of the
most experienced Ministers in the history of our country. I think that
I am right in saying that only four other people in history served a
longer period in the UK Cabinet, so he is an extremely experienced
legislator. He knows that when one gets advice that says &#147;better
not&#148;, &#147;resist&#148; or &#147;resist if
pushed&#148;, one has to take a decision. He also knows that the
advice that is given to Ministers from parliamentary counsel and
officials is often to resist on the grounds of legislative incoherence.
The strongest thing for a Minister to do is to put aside party
political objective. It would be easy for me and the Government to say,
&#147;We accept it, and it is our policy.&#148; We are basing all
of our efforts on getting 2° C, so why do I not just put it in
the Bill? The answer to that is rather than saying &#147;better
not&#148;, such a decision would render the Bill
meaningless</div><a name="0806251000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain to the right hon. Gentleman why that is the case. I have not
had a chance to check <i class="I">Hansard</i><i class="I">,</i><i class="I"> </i>but I bet that
during consideration of the Environment Act 1995, there was advice that
said, &#147;Do not accept a purpose clause.&#148; Incidentally, the
clause to which the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle referred was the
primary purpose of the Environment Agency, not the
Bill.</div><a name="0806251000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me explain my argument. I refer the Committee to clause 2 because it
directly relates to this question. It is the other side of the coin of
why the Government do not want clause 1. I beg the Committee&#146;s
indulgence, but I will keep my remarks very brief.</div>
<a name="0806251000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2(1)
does two profoundly important things&#151;let me take the second
first. It considers the target of &#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148;
on the 1990 baseline by 2050. Where does that figure come from? It has
been subject of national debate, and of hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of communications. That figure comes from a royal commission
report that recommended the cut in emissions that would be required in
the United Kingdom as a contribution to the world effort to do the same
thing, assuming that the world signed up to that and that the science
did not change. Since then, the science has changed, which is why the
Government have changed the original royal commission recommendation of
60 per cent. to &#147;at least 60 per
cent.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me answer the question of whether or not the target should be higher.
First, the year 2050 and the figure of 2° C are based on the
royal commission&#146;s recommendation, and that is our policy.
Secondly, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>this is the crucial point, in the first part of subsection (1), the Bill
goes far beyond other legislation&#151;far beyond what the
Sustainable Communities Act 2007 and the Environment Act 1995 did. The
Bill puts a legal duty on the Secretary of State&#151;the
Government&#151;to ensure that they act to achieve the objective of
&#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; cuts in emissions in the UK, or
more depending on what the committee advises. If there were an
additional clause, for example existing clause 1, that rendered it
impossible for the future Secretary of State to act legally because of
the actions of other countries, we would be undermining the ability of
future Governments to implement the Bill. We would also put other
people or organisations, such as local authorities that have duties
under the functions of this Bill, in a position in which they would be
acting illegally and in impossible circumstances. We would take away
the very certainty that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood sought
for businesses and third parties and render impossible the very basis
of cap and trade and the top-down approach of the European Union and
this country, as against the bottom-up pledge and review approach of
other Governments. It would be easy for me to say that I accept the
clause, but I do not, precisely because I am committed to the working
of the Bill.</div>
<a name="0806251000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000454"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is trying to make the case that
there is a fundamental incompatibility between the target of 60 per
cent. in clause 2 and the target of 2° C in clause 1.
He suggests that that introduces some legal uncertainty. In fact, the
target of 60 per cent. is explicitly based on the Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution&#146;s report in 2000, which was itself
explicitly based on the IPCC second assessment report, which was in
turn based on a stabilisation target for the number of degrees of
global warming. There cannot be inconsistency between those two
targets. I do not see where the legal uncertainty he talks about
arises.</div><a name="0806251000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000455"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Let me try to explain more slowly and more
clearly. Clause 2(1) puts a duty on the Secretary of
State</div><a name="0806251000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
ensure that the net UK carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 6
per cent. lower than the 1990
baseline.&#148;</div><a name="0806251000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is within his power, and if he fails to achieve that, he can be
subjected to legal action. Future Governments, of whatever persuasion,
will have to be accountable in that way. However, clause 1 puts a duty
on the Secretary of State to do something&#151;control the
temperature&#151;that is based on the actions of the rest of the
world. That he cannot
do.</div><a name="0806251000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000456"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is introducing inconsistency when
there simply is none. Clause 1 does not oblige a Minister to do
anything outside his power. It simply defines the aim, and the aim is
precisely the same as that explicitly adopted by the Royal Commission
on Environmental Pollution when it came up with a 60 per
cent. target. There cannot be an inconsistency  in
aim.</div><a name="0806251000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806251000457"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is missing the purpose of
legislation. If, in 10 or 20 years, the rest of the world has not acted
in accordance with the demands of the United Nations framework
convention on climate change; if deforestation has not been stopped, as
urged 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>by the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal; and if global
temperatures have increased in such a way that it is not possible for
the target in clause 1 to be
met&#151;</div><a name="0806251000273"></a>

not possibly reach. That would undermine the ability of the Government
of the day to implement the requirement in clause 2 for a 60 per cent.
reduction in emissions. Global temperatures are already at 0.7°
C above pre-industrial revolution levels. If, in 10, 15 or 20 years,
they are 2° C above, and the law requires the Secretary of State
to act in a certain way that is thus not possible, what would the hon.

Horwood:</b> The Minister is making the argument of somebody
sitting in a sinking boat who stops baling out because the other people
baling out do not seem to have made as much effort as he expected.
Clearly, the whole purpose of the Bill is to contribute to a global
effort and that is explicitly what the subsequent
measures&#151;including the 60 per cent. target on carbon
emissions&#151;are designed to achieve. That was what the Minister
said, based on the Royal Commission on Environmental Protection and,
