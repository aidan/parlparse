<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000369"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I believe that Tim Loughton would like to put
the first question.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="10012153000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">174</b><a name="10012153000370"></a><b class="B">Tim
Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I think that
everyone will agree that the standard of sex education in this country,
in whatever environment, leaves a lot to be desired. We had a
headmaster this morning who said that he thinks that everything in
PSHE, including sex education, could be better taught as a
cross-cutting subject in the various other subjects that are already on
the curriculum, rather than making it a statutory curriculum subject.
Do you think that that is right? Why are schools not already teaching
the elements of PSHE? Why would they not want to have good, standard
elements of PSHE, regardless of whether it becomes a curriculum
subject? Surely it is in the interests of all their pupils to be well
versed in the whole healthy living agenda, or whatever you want to call
it?</div><a name="10012153000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> To take your last statement on why should
everyone not do it, I would say that everyone should. Why, then, are
they not? There is a variety of reasons. It may be that its
non-statutory status can be a get-out clause when there are so many
other pressures and priorities on head teachers. However, where they
grasp the importance of a subject, it is hugely appreciated. I heard
one head teacher of a successful secondary school comment recently that
PSHE education enables young people to develop the knowledge and skills
that help them to tackle issues that might otherwise get in the way of
their learning, and I think that that was quite
powerful.</div><a name="10012153000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">175</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000371"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Why should it be done in isolation, rather than
how it is being done now, but
better?</div><a name="10012153000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> Your argument is whether it should be
taught across the curriculum or as a discrete
subject&#151;</div><a name="10012153000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">176</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000372"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> You mentioned the point that that is not the
case perhaps because of all the pressure on the curriculum. We are
adding yet another pressure on the curriculum, and something will have
to give, will it
not?</div><a name="10012153000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> I do not think we are, because most schools
are already delivering some discrete PSHE education. What we are doing
is hopefully encouraging better quality by giving it the status and
ensuring that the teachers who deliver it are well trained and
supported.</div>
<a name="10012153000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
your first point about whether it should be taught across the
curriculum or as a discrete subject, I do not think it is either/or,
but both. There is evidence that where it is only taught across the
curriculum, it can disappear. It is difficult and complex for teachers
always to teach to two sets of learning objectives and ensure that
neither suffers. If you are trying to teach an aspect of relationships
in, for example, an English lesson, through exploring relationships in
some literature, you will be exploring the literature, the approach
through writing and the way that the writer is portraying those
relationships. Moving from that to the point where young people reflect
on their own relationship skills and how they can apply what they have
learnt and develop the skills that they can put into place in
friendships, families, communities and workplaces is a more complex
thing, and often gets missed
out.</div><a name="10012153000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> There is also another issue. If you had
something like maths being taught across curricula, you would have
people who are not experts in maths. What is incredibly important with
PSHE is that we need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>build a body of specialist teachers who are able to deliver on it. We
want all teachers to be able to do the basics, but being able to
deliver a good PSHE lesson is like any other subject&#151;you need to
be trained to do
it.</div><a name="10012153000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">177</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000373"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Could that happen in extended school time rather
than in curriculum time?</div>
<a name="10012153000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> Not everybody is part of extended school. We
are saying that this is core. We are talking about children and young
people having the right to have life skills. We are talking about
parents, professionals, children and young people&#151;we have this
huge consensus that children should have life skills for life as they
are living it now, in preparation for the lives that they lead as young
adults and adults. That is crucial. It would be so easy to lose it in
extended school time, in extra cross-curricular things. If it is
important enough, let&#146;s have it as a core subject, ensuring that
every child in the classroom has the opportunity to learn those
essential life skills.</div>
<a name="10012153000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> May I make two other points? One is
that different schools will adopt different curriculum solutions. If it
is compulsory, it will mean that they have to put it into the mix at
the start. The new secondary curriculum enables secondary schools, at
any rate, to look again at how they are delivering their statutory
obligations. That may still reflect the traditional subject-based
curriculum; however, in a number of cases, particularly in relation to
aspects of the humanities curriculum, it may take a more integrated
approach. There is ample scope for some of the aspects that fall under
the PSHE education umbrella to be delivered in that way.</div>
<a name="10012153000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me to the point that PSHE education is a bit of a portmanteau. You have
a number of separate areas of work that you are expecting children and
young people to engage with, and they do not always sit particularly
naturally together with each other.</div>
<a name="10012153000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
point, which relates much more to our closer concern, is that this
particular area&#151;well-being, and sex and relationships
education&#151;is treading on areas that are still controversial.
Teaching controversial value issues in schools, whenever they arise, is
a complex and demanding task. That is why we are entirely supportive of
better training, better resources, better equipping of
teachers.</div>
<a name="10012153000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our
core concerns, obviously, is religious education. There is an automatic
cross-over in a number of areas in PSHE. For instance, the guidance on
sex and relationships says that you need to be conscious and respectful
of the faith and belief background of your parental communities and
make sure that that is reflected. But that is very difficult, because
you may find yourself as a teacher saying, &#147;But there is a
conflict here. I know what the community wants me to teach, but I know
what I think and what guidance says good PSHE is.&#148; There is a
huge area where staff and governors need support.</div>
<a name="10012153000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> I agree with everything that has been said
so far. It can be built on a notion of entitlement&#151;that is
entitlement to staff for their professional development and an
entitlement for pupils&#151;but we must bear in mind the caveats
about the governors&#146; responsibility for policy and for the
particular character of the school.</div>
<a name="10012153000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another factor if it is to be built formally into the curriculum. That
is the added benefits for parents&#151;the rigour, the statements
made about it, and the rights of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>parents far more overtly to engage in consultation about what is
happening, seeing resources and being advised of what is happening. It
enhances the role of parents, when it&#146;s done well, if it has
that formal place.</div>
<a name="10012153000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> Education is important. It can play
an important role in society at large. We are not against education.
There are many areas where the Government can help our children to
achieve their very best in science, English and maths. If PSHE becomes
compulsory it could put a lot of work on to our teachers. That could
have an effect on our children&#146;s education in other subjects in
the main curriculum, which will develop their quality of life, their
employment and so on. It should be the parents&#146; responsibility
to give the right education at the right time to their
children.</div>
<a name="10012153000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under British
law children are allowed to be taught according to their
parents&#146; wishes. Under article 2 of the first protocol of the
European convention on human rights, education must be given in
accordance with parents&#146; &#147;religious and philosophical
convictions&#148;. Ordinary parents are very naive. They do not have
a clue. They do not have authority. As far as we who live in Tower
Hamlets are concerned, people do not have a way to find out the right
way.</div><a name="10012153000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the Government should empower parents, governors and our
religious scholars to help our innocent young children from the age of
five. Young children from the age of five should not receive the kind
of education that will mislead them, encourage them to explore sexual
activities and even make them immoral. That could be a problem for
society in the future as sexual crime could be enhanced. Community
cohesion could be hampered. We respect religious values and, clearly
major religions say that, outside marriage, relationships are strongly
prohibited. If we have good, nice family circumstances and make our
family life stable, lively, nice and are helped by the Government, I
hope that most of the problems will be
reduced.</div><a name="10012153000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10012153000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">178</b><a name="10012153000374"></a><b class="B">Caroline
Flint</b> (Don Valley) (Lab): During my time as Public Health
Minister, I had the opportunity to meet lots of parents from different
communities and different religious backgrounds and, most of the time,
whoever I was speaking to and whatever their religious background,
their concern as parents about drugs, alcohol and sexual relations was
common. What Oona Stannard said about opportunities to engage parents
was positive.</div>
<a name="10012153000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
the Bill does not provide for the Secretary of State to set attainment
targets or assess PSHE. Given what we all must agree is a rather patchy
delivery on all aspects of the area, do you think that, in making this
a statutory part of the curriculum, there is enough to improve delivery
and outputs? Do you think that it is right that there should not be
attainment targets or
assessments?</div><a name="10012153000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> I freely admit that I am answering on the
basis of my previous experience as an HMI when I saw very good PSHE
education taking place. When that was the case, it was not hampered by
the lack of attainment targets. It was well evidenced in portfolios of
work and other processes that took place to assess young
people&#146;s level of knowledge and understanding, their engagement
and reflection. There is still plenty of scope in the flexibility of
not having attainment targets, and that can be evidenced by thematic
inspections and all sorts of methods that can look into such matters. I
do not see it as a negative.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div><a name="10012153000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> There is a difference between assessment
and testing. Most of us are in favour of more rigorous and more
effective methods of assessing the progress of pupils, and tracking
progress. It is very important that teachers can track the progress of
children so that both teachers and the children themselves know that
they are learning and getting better at this important part of the
curriculum. Lots of work needs to be done on doing that in the most
appropriate way for the subject and in the most helpful way to
children, young people, teachers and their parents. Lots of work is
being done at the moment. Some development work is being carried out by
the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency on the assessing
pupil progress project. Although there are no attainment
targets&#151;there is not an eight-level scale&#151;there are some
end-of-key-stage statements, which help to give a national standard
against which teachers can make judgments. Most of all, however, we are
encouraging teachers and young people to be able to articulate what
they have learnt, so that they can describe progress and achievements
and find good ways of doing
that.</div><a name="10012153000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> There is a stage just before that in which
it is really important to involve children, young people and their
families in what is going to be taught and how it is going to be
taught. So, you then start right from the beginning, as a partnership,
and you have processes, in which the children and young people are
telling you, through a whole range of activities, about what they think
that they are learning, what they think they ought to be learning and
why, and what they have learnt. So, it does start before that, and it
is really important that children, young people and parents should be
involved in working that out in the first place: what is going to be
taught and how it is going to be taught&#151;the how being extremely
important, especially when talking about various aspects of sex
education when you would want to be delivering it in a moral
framework.</div><a name="10012153000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> I would like to say that, again, it
is mainly dependent on the parents. Children are under a lot of
pressure with subject attainment and progress assessment, but they go
through a lot of stages. Young children must have some clear
understanding of society, but their psychological and emotional
development has to be taken into account. If the Government put a lot
of pressure on children when their learning&#151;especially at the
age of five, six or seven&#151;is most likely to be play-based, that
could be reflected in their educational achievement in the wrong way.
They might have to bear or feel too much, too soon. That could happen.
So, the Government should be careful about that, and consider how they
can handle matters in a light way to get good achievement while clearly
addressing the parents&#146; concerns, views, understanding and
religious beliefs. Otherwise educational performance, in some way and
in some part, could be hampered. Thank
you.</div><a name="10012153000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> You have to be really careful how you
frame things. I have been listening to this. We do not have a specific
position, but you do not engage in anything in education, schools or
lessons without having some sense of where you are going with it and
what you want to come out of it for pupils. Sharing that and devising
that with pupils is good practice. You are then ensuring that they are
committed to what they are doing and engaged with it. Clearly, much of
the content that is expected to be delivered through PSHE engages

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">179</b><a name="10012153000375"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): Do you
think that the Bill gives the state too much power to impose its values
on parents, and does not leave sufficient room and respect for the
values that parents themselves may think appropriate for their
children?</div><a name="10012153000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> No, I do not. The Bill provides a list of
topic areas. The principles underpin the topic areas. There is a safety
net within which schools will be expected to work with pupils and their
parents and their community&#151;to work at how they are going to do
that, what methods they are going to use to educate children about that
list of topics, and also how the moral framework will be developed. I
think it is absolutely crucial that a school would want to teach within
the values or the moral framework that they are already using for the
rest of their curriculum, which they have already agreed with parents.
It seems absolutely fundamental. That would be promoting equality,
accepting and working with diversity, and making sure that the
information is accurate, balanced and age appropriate. Those
underpinning values are crucial. They are almost more important than
the list of topics.</div>
<a name="10012153000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">180</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000376"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I assume Mr. Khan probably does not
agree with you.</div>
<a name="10012153000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> We believe the Government are
putting more pressure on the parents. Previously it was down to the
parents, and the parents could withdraw their children up to the age of
19, but now it is reduced to 15 years. But we are all aware the consent
age is 16 years and the children are going to be adult at age 18.
Previously, under UK law and the convention, parents&#146; views,
opinions, consent and their values and identity were preferred. I think
the parents have a right to exercise their duty, because their duty is
to help the children to achieve. They are the future of this country.
They are the good citizens of this country. If you do not give the
parents much room, and tell them, &#147;If your child does something
wrong, or if your child does not go to school, I will prosecute
you&#148;, where is my right? Where is my culture, my identity and my
belief? Everything that is good for society, we can exercise; but if
you do not allow that, obviously, it is trimming away the right of
parents.</div>
<a name="10012153000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">181</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000377"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I agree with you, Mr. Khan. Perhaps I
can turn to Jan. Do you believe that home education acts as a safety
valve for parents who find that the values taught in schools are not
acceptable to them? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>There a lot of other reasons why people would home-educate, but many
people worry that the provisions in the Bill are there to stop the one
area where parents can take their children out and ensure they get the
values that they want them to have. They worry that they are going to
bring in national monitoring&#151;effectively, licensing&#151;of
parents in their own homes teaching their own children, and that this
is a back-door way to state control and state imposition of values, no
matter where you go with your child. I wonder if any of you share that
view, particularly, Jan, as I know that the Church of England Education
Division submission to the Badman report
concluded:</div><a name="10012153000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have seen no evidence to show that the majority of home educated
children do not achieve the five Every Child Matters outcomes, and are
therefore not convinced of the need to change the current system of
monitoring the standard of home
education.&#148;</div><a name="10012153000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> Let us go back to sex and
relationships, which is where you started, and whether the Bill gives
enough protection to parental views. We are content with the way the
Bill is drafted, particularly in the light of the framing principles
against which PSHE ought to be devised in any school, which is to take
account of the appropriate age of the pupils and of their religious and
cultural backgrounds. As I have seen successive drafts of the guidance
on sex and relationships education, I think there has been a very
determined effort to make that real, to enable guidance to be given to
schools, to help them to have precisely that conversation with parents,
to work out together how sex education and other controversial issues
will be dealt with within the school. I think it is the duty of the
state to have some notion of what the entitlement of every child should
be, and that clearly will be enshrined in law and in what schools have
to provide.</div>
<a name="10012153000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you say,
there is recourse if parents do not find that their beliefs and their
way of life are sufficiently reflected within the state-maintained
sector, with all its variety, including a variety of faith-based
schools within that sector. They have recourse to remove their children
and to educate them at home. You have quoted our response to the Badman
report. It is for Government to do what they want to do in relation to
the report that they heard and the view they take on
that.</div>
<a name="10012153000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">182</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000378"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Can I press you on that? The difficulty is that
the Badman report was used as the basis for the monitoring proposals,
which the Church says it opposes. Not only did you not agree with the
report&#146;s conclusions, you felt disappointed by the impression
left by the selective use of your submissions; you actually felt
manipulated. You concluded, as did I, that the Badman report reached
what appeared to be a predetermined outcome. In other words, it did not
properly assess the evidence but decided before it started that it
would conclude in favour of greater state interference and greater
monitoring. Do you have any comment to make on that?</div>
<a name="10012153000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> We were certainly very clear that only
one section of our evidence, which tried to take a broad-based view and
look at a range of issues, was actually quoted. I understand that there
has been a subsequent scrutiny of the review and how the report was put
together, and I am clear that however the Badman conclusions were
reached, it is believed that there was good reason for those
conclusions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div><a name="10012153000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our
perspective, we recognise that parents who home educate are very
alarmed by the level of scrutiny that they feel the report contains.
Although we would not support a heavy-handed regime, there is room for
some more regulation and scrutiny without taking away from
parents&#146; right to educate their children
themselves.</div><a name="10012153000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">183</b><a name="10012153000379"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I would like to
probe whether people think that age 15 is a little late for sex and
relationship education, in terms of pupils potentially missing out on
vital education at the right stage of their development.</div>
<a name="10012153000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> The first thing is that we at TPIA are, to
be frank, not too worried about the right of withdrawal, because so few
children are withdrawn from sex and relationship education. It is a
tiny, tiny percentage. We know from all the evidence and from schools
reporting back to us that even when parents are concerned, generally
speaking, when the parents talk it through with the school and the
school tells them what will be included, most parents turn around and
say, &#147;Oh, brilliant. That&#146;s absolutely fine. I&#146;m
happy about that.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012153000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
over the last few months, I have had three reports from schools that
parents who were concerned about SRE being taught in primary schools
but then said okay have had their child come to them and say, because
they have the right language, that they are in trouble and that
somebody in their family or wider friendship circle is approaching them
in an abusive fashion. The parents have been incredibly pleased that
their children could do that. One mother said to me, &#147;Thank God.
If it had been up to me, I wouldn&#146;t have been able to talk to
him about these things, and my little boy wouldn&#146;t have been
able to tell me what was happening.&#148; In terms of safeguarding,
it is incredibly important that it is
early.</div><a name="10012153000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
come back to your question, it seems to me that keeping the status quo
of up to 19 does not make sense when having sex is legal at 16. It is
incredibly important that there seems to be a consensus on 15, and that
most of the interested parties and stakeholders have said,
&#147;Fine, we&#146;ll go with 15.&#148; To be honest, I am not
particularly concerned about it, because I think that the vast majority
of parents will not withdraw their children. It is a bit of a red
herring for me.</div>
<a name="10012153000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> The possibility of not being able to
withdraw a child after 15 has been a challenge to me. There are
certainly people in my community who would wish it to stay until the
end of schooling. I feel that the role of parents is paramount in all
this. It is parents who educate children, not Governments.</div>
<a name="10012153000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">We live in a
society that, sadly, has surrounded our young people with sexual images
in the media and advertising, and you only need to turn the television
on. I feel sorry for young people because that so often gives them the
impression that it would be unusual not to be sexually active.
Actually, it is the other way round, which is the reality for the
majority of young people who are not sexually active at a young
age.</div>
<a name="10012153000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, my
willingness to proceed with this reduction in age is predicated on
weighing up all the factors, and thinking that if schools have all the
support needed, if teachers have an entitlement to be qualified
adequately to deal with PSHE education, if parents are consulted, and
if all the things are put in place to make that a good 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>area of the curriculum, it should help to be a counter-cultural balance
to the messages that young people are getting, and give them a better
understanding of the reality of life. Hopefully, it will be so good
that when parents come to ask questions or view what is going to be
offered to their young people&#151;bear in mind, I repeat, that it
will be in keeping with the character or nature of the school, and the
governor&#146;s policy&#151;they will say, as they generally do,
&#147;Oh yes. I want my child to be involved in this.&#148; As we
have heard, levels of withdrawal from PSHE education and sex and
relationships education are minuscule.</div>
<a name="10012153000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> Although the amount of withdrawal
is very little, we have had a lot of consultation with local parents
and there is a lack of communication and information. They have not got
clear information about what is happening in a school in that context,
and when. That is one reason why parents have no idea at what time
their children can be withdrawn.</div>
<a name="10012153000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the consultation, there is a significant percentage that says,
&#147;No&#148;. On things being compulsory from age five, what
happens when the children reach puberty in terms of their beliefs and
those of their parents? Parents are the main educators of the children,
and home is the best place for children to learn. We believe that
parents are not given enough strength, power and educational
empowerment to help their children. If we give sufficient support,
problems that we hear about such as pregnancy and so on could be
dramatically reduced. The family structure, a stable family,
relationships, good manners, good morals&#151;those are important
values, and if we do not give that aspect to parents to help their
children, how can we expect the parents to make a
contribution?</div><a name="10012153000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that parents can make a great contribution to their children. I
am a parent and I try my best to find time to spend with them. We had a
big meeting at the Muslim centre. More than 700 people turned up from
different communities and faiths. We said that something should not be
compulsory from the age of 5, but clearly, the schools said no. We
should listen to the voices of parents and to their problems. It is a
social-economic cultural problem that can lead to things such as
pregnancy, abortion and misbehaviour. If we handle this at the grass
roots, it will be reflected and society will be in a better position.
We live in a nice, coherent and venerable society where we should
respect each other and listen to the views of others about what is
appropriate. Five is not the appropriate age for children to start such
things.</div>
<a name="10012153000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been a
governor of a few schools. There were cases of one or two children in
year six experiencing some kind of puberty. We dealt with that
accordingly, in consultation with their parents and the teachers; we
didn&#146;t say very much. So why is this cycle going to be put into
effect? Their mentality will be blocked. There is no consciousness at
that time; they have no power of judgment; anybody can mislead them.
That is the worry of the
parents.</div>
<a name="10012153000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> May I add a rider? I think that we have a
big problem simply because we are using the word &#147;sexual&#148;
and having to deal with that in relation to talking about children of
five years of age. Good sex and relationships education is not about
sexualising children; it is anything but. It is about keeping them
safe, when it is done well. We all have to be very sensitive to this,
and we have to ensure that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>understand the reality of what the education will look like at the
different stages. We must also keep in mind that it is &#147;and
relationships&#148;. If we do it well, we will be helping to keep
children safe, and if done well, it will not undermine the invaluable
work that parents are doing. There shouldn&#146;t be a tension.
Parents should be involved, and have their say.</div>
<a name="10012153000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> What children and young people have been
telling us in numerous surveys for 20 to 30 years is that they
don&#146;t just want the biology. They want the teacher and their
parents to talk to them about feelings and relationships and real-life
scenarios. They say, &#147;When I&#146;m grown up, if somebody does
this, what should I do?&#148; They want to have those sorts of
conversations. As for biology, you can always look that up in a book.
They really want to talk about feelings and relationships.</div>
<a name="10012153000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> I shall be brief. I believe that the Bill
will strengthen the relationship between schools and parents. By
putting it on this footing, it is encouraging schools and parents to
have a dialogue and strengthens the already common practice of
partnerships between schools and parents. A young person in the east
end of London said to me recently that the PSHE education lessons had
helped him to have conversations with his parents about some very
difficult things.</div>
<a name="10012153000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">184</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000380"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I appreciate what everyone has said. One of my
concerns about opting out is that I see relationship education as being
much broader than sexual education. I have always thought that the
seven-year-old should be able to learn what is normal in a family; if
they come from an abnormal family, they will not know. For instance,
there are problems such as domestic violence and all sorts of other
things. Is there a core part to the relationship part of sexual and
relationship education? Would some children miss out if it could not be
picked up in the other sections? I am looking for a safety net for the
children of parents who opt out of some very basic relationship
education.</div>
<a name="10012153000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> I hope that there are other avenues
and other areas of the curriculum in which such matters could be
considered. For Church of England schools especially, collective
worship would be one such place. Reflections on what life is about and
the good life, even for very little children, would include some of
that. It would not be the same; it would not have the curriculum focus.
But you would certainly have a values framework&#151;an aspirational
framework, based on the foundation of the school&#151;that would
offer that picture.</div>
<a name="10012153000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would not
be the same as small-group work, with the opportunity to talk with the
teacher, but at least something is being fed in all the time. It is
about what we think the good life looks like, or what should our
relationships be like with each other. It will not be a place to
address specifics, but you can paint an aspirational picture that helps
children to place it alongside their daily experience and the
experience of their friends and others.</div>
<a name="10012153000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
think that there would be opportunities within certain approaches to
religious education to start exploring what our obligations are to each
other and how we should behave to each other. That clearly happens, and
there have been opportunities for pupil disclosure in those contexts as
well, which then enables a school to look specifically at what might be
happening to particular children.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div><a name="10012153000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> I see core emotional and social skills as an
absolutely fundamental core to PSHE. They would be part of statutory
PSHE. Little children would learn how to listen, be respectful to each
other, play and work collaboratively, assess risk, solve problems and
go get help. I see all those things as the core emotional and social
skills, part of PSHE and therefore not withdrawable-from&#151;I do
not think that that is a word, but you know what I am saying. That
would be absolutely crucial. It seems to me from all the discussions,
especially in the House of Commons on the last reading, that people
were really keen on life skills being taught. I see life skills as
absolutely core to compulsory statutory
PSHE.</div><a name="10012153000086"></a>

Chairman:</b> Mr. Khan, could you be fairly brief?
I would like to move on. Would you like to make a contribution? Then
Caroline Flint would like to ask you a question.</div>
<a name="10012153000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> Thank you. Opportunity is
important. We should respect family relationships, marriage and family
values, which are the building blocks of society and can help make
society, from my point of view, a kind of heaven. If parents&#146;
thinking and beliefs are not reflected in relationship education and
other kinds of education, it should be clarified and the parents should
be given some kind of power, so that if they do not like it, they can
drop it.</div>
<a name="10012153000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
papers says that one lecture is going to use naked pictures of young
boys and girls, labelling and identifying the different parts of the
body. Those are the kinds of resources. If those kinds of resource are
being used and we are saying community cohesion, equal opportunity and
diversity, where are parents&#146; values? Where are parents&#146;
rights? Were children&#146;s understanding, age and sensitivity
considered or not? That is fundamental. We have to be careful about
that. Otherwise, it will be a problem for society later&#151;maybe
not now; maybe by the time we have passed away.</div>
<a name="10012153000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are to decide, our request is to do something in the
interests of society and look into the real facts and figures. There is
not just one thing to solve so that other things will be fine. They are
interrelated, such as social deprivation, housing problems, health
problems and many others. It is true that there is teenage pregnancy
and so on, and we understand that the Government have tried to resolve
it in this way&#151;by giving them a good education in a safe
way&#151;but parents do not feel that. I believe that the Government

Mr. Khan, the Government and Members in this room do respect

<a name="10012153000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid
that the gatekeepers in such communities might orchestrate opposition

a meeting with 700 people. How many of them were women? How many people
there were mothers? They will have their own view. I am afraid that we
may go 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>down the path of yet again having a large silent majority in our

that?</div><a name="10012153000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> Thank you. We are not disrespecting
anyone. If someone has different beliefs and faiths, we should respect
them. That is their right, which they can exercise. If someone
expresses a different opinion, they should be respected; everyone has
that right to exercise. If a pair of parents has a kind of
relationships belief, that is fine; we should respect them. We have no
objection&#151;it is down to them, and their views have to be taken
into account as well. I am not saying that we should disrespect or not
recognise them&#151;that is their duty, which they can do, and it is
up to them. Once the children grow up and become adults, it is down to
them. They can do whatever they like&#151;maybe change their minds or
do something different. It is okay; it is down to them. But there are
parents, and there is a time in which they are responsible, and we have
to give the children some right and proper education and guidance. That
is our concern.</div>

debate such issues, what seems to go out into the public sphere is that
it is all about telling kids to go and have sex. I am hopeful that the
changes will create a much more cohesive discussion of the issue,
rather than the way it has been segmented in different ways with
biology and what have you. I must say, Mr. Khan, that I
respect parents, and as I have said earlier, I hope that it will offer
opportunities for a better discussion of what should be offered within
schools.</div><a name="10012153000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
you accept that an awful lot of parents&#151;I do not want to be too
stereotypical&#151;and fathers find it incredibly difficult to talk
about relationships with their children? Do you also accept that there
are parents who, sadly, are a danger to their own children? Should we
not try to find the sensitive balance, to see it as something not
against parents, but working with them to equip our children with the
best possible protection to make informed choices, which they face on
their own as they grow older and have to make challenging decisions
that may affect the future course of their lives? Do we not have to
find a way to deal with that within our school community, working
alongside families and
communities?</div><a name="10012153000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Thank you. We believe
that the family does not get enough support. Parents need to get more
support, education and empowerment. Otherwise, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>we cannot expect many things out of them, because they are not
professionals or experts in the field. Maybe we need to give some
education, but what kind of education? How much? What resources are
going to be put in place? Who will teach it? How will they teach it?
How will the curriculum be built up? There are many things to deal
with, and if they are not addressed properly, we will have a problem.
You mentioned that some parents are not safe. That could be different,
but it could be dealt with by the professionals, by the state. I think
that there is an agency that can help those who need that kind and
level of support. The questions are how much and in what context, but
we cannot put those things in general, because they are not in that
stage.</div><a name="10012153000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">190</b><a name="10012153000386"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I have
listened very carefully to all the answers to this question. I am clear
about the answer of Gill Frances from the TPIAG. I am clear about
Mr. Khan&#146;s answer. I am clear about Jan
Campbell&#146;s answer on whether the Government are right to reduce
the age to 15 at which parents have the right to withdraw their
children from SRE lessons. Jan Campbell and Gill Frances were in favour
of the measure. I am clear that Mr. Khan is against the
measure. I am not clear about the views of the Catholic Education
Service or, indeed, the Church of
England.</div><a name="10012153000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
63 would change &#147;15&#148; to &#147;16&#148;. Is the Church
of England in favour of that amendment and of putting back the age when
parents have the right to withdraw their children from SRE lessons
until the age of 16? If you were to vote, would you vote in favour of
that amendment or against
it?</div><a name="10012153000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> May I read you the note that I
prepared in advance of the Committee. It
says:</div><a name="10012153000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
logic of our position is that the parental right of withdrawal is
removed, but we recognise that until parents are confident that due
attention will be paid to their own views there may be a need for it to
be retained. We are supportive of the right being terminated when the
child reaches age
15.&#148;</div><a name="10012153000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the matter were to go through General Synod, there would be a very
hearty debate, but the chair of the board of education and ourselves
are confident that, in the end, it would reach that position. It is not
likely to go through General Synod, and in a sense, the board of
education is anticipating what it might
decide.</div><a name="10012153000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I stated in my response, our position is that sex education and sex and
relationships education ought to be an entitlement. If we are
supporting the statutory provision of PSHE, we are supporting the
statutory provision of sex and relationships education, but we
recognise that there is still some way to travel in building parental
confidence in what is actually taught in schools. Mr. Khan
represents one end of that journey. There is quite a long way to
go.</div><a name="10012153000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not make sense to say, &#147;No, you shouldn&#146;t have any
formal education in this area. We will throw you out at 16, legally
entitled to engage in sexual intercourse and all manner of other things
without having prepared you in any way for it.&#148; We do not know
what parents will be doing. We are respectful of their rights and know
that they will be doing something, but the school, as an agent of the
state, has a kind of responsibility to say that you need some
preparation. We were supportive of the compromise position that there
ought to be at least a year when we know that every young person will
have some opportunity to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>prepare themselves for this role. That is leaving aside, as we all know,
what actually happens. Our position is that we are supportive of the
right of withdrawal terminating when the child reaches
15.</div><a name="10012153000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">191</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000387"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Thank you. That is
clear.</div><a name="10012153000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> This is an incredibly difficult question.
If I had the option, I would like to sit on the
fence.</div><a name="10012153000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">192</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000388"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Can you explain the view of the Catholic Education
Service? That is really what I want to
know.</div><a name="10012153000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> Quite. We are holding two things in tension
at the Catholic Education Service. One is that we believe in the right
of parents as the primary educators of their children. We also believe
that the education that parents choose in the type of school that they
choose for their child and the responsibilities that that gives the
governing body in policies and so on is crucial. At that level, we
would prefer that it remained a right to withdraw the child from PSHE
at 16, until parents were completely confident about what was being
provided. But it is a small number who seek to remove their children,
and I am confident that our schools will, as they do now, dialogue so
carefully with parents that their level of confidence is such that they
do not want to withdraw their child. So, in a way, I am saying that we
would like to have our cake and eat it, because we think that having
that right would assuage parents&#146; concerns, but I am also saying
that we do not think they would want to exercise
it.</div><a name="10012153000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, there is my earlier point about the messages that
society is giving to young people&#151;that, at 16, they can legally
be sexually active, married and so on. Bearing that in mind, we come to
the point of thinking that we have to prepare our young people for that
scenario; we have the opportunity in our schools to do it with the
realism of facts, coupled with ensuring that they know what the Church
teaches. So, I would say that, without the right of withdrawal and with
all children remaining, they will have a very good education in
PSHE.</div><a name="10012153000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">193</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000389"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am still not quite clear. I understand that you
believe in exhorting parents to allow their children to attend the
lessons until 16, but we have a clear decision to make. There is no
sitting on the fence, I am afraid, for us. We have to decide whether to
approve this law, removing the right of anyone to withdraw their child,
even if it is only one parent who has worries and who, despite all your
exhortation, still does not want her child to attend those lessons. We
have to decide whether to remove that minority&#146;s right to
withdraw their child from those lessons. So, what way would the
Catholic Education Service advise me to vote on that amendment? Fifteen
or sixteen? I understand your point about how they should attend, the
school should do it well, they should have a dialogue with parents, but
we have a law to make, one way or the other, and I need your advice,
speaking on behalf of the Catholic Education Service, about which way
to vote. If I sit on the fence, 15 will become the
law.</div><a name="10012153000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> Fences are very uncomfortable place to sit,
are they not? At this point in time, I would probably err on saying:
allow the right of withdrawal until 16.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div><a name="10012153000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">194</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000390"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> We have the unenviable reputation for having a
very high rate of teenage pregnancy in this country. Clearly that is
down to a huge number of complex factors. How important is compulsory
sex and relationship education as part of breaking into that
spiral?</div><a name="10012153000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> It is key, and we know that from all the
international evidence, from countries where there is compulsory SRE
and PSHE. In Sweden it has been compulsory since the 1950s. We know
that the Swedes&#146; teenage pregnancy rate is much lower and that
their sexual health is much better than the sexual health of our young
people. SRE is absolutely
crucial.</div><a name="10012153000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to go back to the last question and remind you all that more
than 86 per cent. of parents support SRE. The evidence from across the
world also tells us that good SRE helps young people to delay having
their first sex. Most of us&#151;I assume most of us here&#151;do
not want our young people to have sex early; we want our young people
to have sex when they are old enough to take full responsibility and to
have sex within a safe relationship. It is important to look at the
evidence from across the world and see that, if we do not prepare our
children and young people, they would not have the skills and
knowledge. If they do not have the skills and knowledge, they are more
likely to have sex early, so it is absolutely
crucial.</div><a name="10012153000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> Certainly, having prepared for this by
talking to teachers, senior leaders and young people, the overwhelming
evidence that I got from young people was that PSHE as a whole and SRE
as part of that actually made them feel more responsible. It gave them
facts, it enabled them to think through situations that they might
encounter in the future, before they encountered them, and it gave them
strategies for dealing with situations that might prove challenging and
difficult. That includes situations in which they might feel pressured
in some way to engage in sexual activities, but all sorts of other
risky or potentially risky behaviours. They felt that it gave them a
sense of responsibility and that it would protect them in that way. I
think that that is incredibly important for us to remember.</div>
<a name="10012153000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> That sounds as though that is the
right answer, but we have had sex education, which the vast majority of
parents have not withdrawn their children from, and we still have the
kind of record that we do in terms of early engagement in sexual
behaviour, getting into risky situations and teenage pregnancies, so
there is clearly something else at play there. I do not think it is a
very easy correlation. It certainly would not be easy to say,
&#147;We will not do it any longer, because it is not
working,&#148; but it behoves us to say, &#147;What else is at play
here that is interfering with our very good intentions in trying to
equip young people to engage responsibly in a whole range of things to
do with adult life? Why is what we are doing not
working?&#148;</div><a name="10012153000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> Because not all schools are providing what I
would call quality SRE. They are relying on doing a bit of biology and
science and hoping for the best. They are crossing their fingers and
not actually delivering it as part of PSHE and within the core of life
skills. So young people are learning a few unrelated facts, which they
cannot link to their real lives, and then they cannot use them. I
learnt maths in the same way. I cannot actually use maths now as a
grown up, because I only ever learnt to do sums.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div><a name="10012153000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> I agree with Gill. One of the problems is
that not all young people are experiencing high quality personal,
social and health education. In some schools it is not prioritised
because it is not statutory. By giving statutory status to this
important subject, which keeps children and young people safe, it comes
with packages. It comes with a greater commitment to ensuring that
children are taught by teachers who have had some training. Our
children at the moment are taught by teachers who have no training in
these sensitive areas. This will promote initial teacher education,
which I know is already on the cards. It will encourage teachers to
engage in CPD. It will professionalise the subject, which is really
important. It has been there for a long time, but no one has bitten the
bullet and said that at the moment it is not fair that some children
get this and others do not. We let our children down unless we support
them in this way.</div>
<a name="10012153000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> May I add that I think we do a disservice
to PSHE if we think of it out of the context of the rest of the child
and young person&#146;s experience. Yes, there is a lot of biology
and science to be learnt. Yes, there is a lot about relationships that
needs to be learnt, and the meshing of the two. But you cannot look at
this without also thinking about the values with which the child is
growing up, their development as a whole person, a spiritual person,
and things such as their self-esteem and aspirations. All these things
come into play and make it important and are factors in its success or
otherwise.</div>

Chairman:</b> Mr. Khan, may I ask you to be brief,
because we have four more questions to put to you all?</div>
<a name="10012153000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">M.
Shahanur A. Khan:</b></i> Why the increase? We do not believe
that it is simply due to a lack of education or the quality of
education. Yes, that could contribute in some way, but this is not the
right age to give this to them. The children are young. They can misuse
it. They can malpractise it. Not only that, but we could make worse our
pregnancy rate and other things such as abortions and STIs.</div>
<a name="10012153000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give an
example. Tower Hamlets, where I live, is the poorest and most deprived
borough in the UK, as far as I know. We have one, two or three-bedroom
flats or houses where seven, eight, nine or 10-member families live.
The children aged 17, 18, 19, 20 are adult and have to share one
bedroom. They do not have enough money. Most of them are unemployed.
They do not have support. There are many social, economic and other
factors. How can we expect those children to be good? Their parents
have no privacy. The 18 and 19-year-olds have no privacy. Obviously
they will see that as a dimension. Some of our colleagues see other
things exposed in the media, which the children will pick up
on. We cannot control whether children will be good. We cannot blame
one set of factors for what is happening without looking at other
factors. We have to find and sort out the other important factors that
contribute to pregnancy, and so on. One improvement would be to give
more support to family relationships. That could be one of the ways.
Housing, education and many other things could help, rather than just
looking at one point and saying, &#147;If we do this, the problem
will be solved.&#148; We do not believe that. We need to look at the
wider factors. Thank you.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000392"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Caroline, could you be fairly brief, because we
have three other questioners, and we have only 15 minutes left? Thank
you.</div><a name="10012153000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">196</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000393"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> One of the aspects of delivering sex and
relationships education is that it should be age-appropriate. If you
look at say, a class of 11 or 12-year-olds, their exposure to sex may
vary enormously. Sadly, a number of 11 and 12-year-olds are starting to
engage in what I would call inappropriate sexual relationships, which
may end up with them getting pregnant by the time they are 13. They
could be sitting alongside an 11 or 12-year-old who is not at all
interested in that area. How do we get the delivery right on this? How
do you deal with the children who are more at risk? We can deal with
the factors that make them more at risk to early sexual relationships,
but we do not want to end up with a situation where other 11 and
12-year-olds, who have what I would consider a more normal childhood,
are overburdened with the things that they are not thinking about
yet.</div><a name="10012153000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> The specialist teacher who we are talking
about would know how to teach PSHE using group work, or differentiated
learning, to use the jargon term. It is also important to remember that
one in eight girls have periods from the age 10. That is another
crucial fact to put in. The other thing that needs to back up and
underpin PSHE is pastoral support. In many primary and secondary
schools, you will find that they run small sub-groups or working groups
with children and young people who need extra support. They will pick
up those extra issues during lunch time or through extended school
provision. That, of course, has to be planned, and those children need
to be identified, supported and
helped.</div><a name="10012153000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">197</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000394"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My concern is not that we should not be teaching
sex and relationship education, but its quality and age appropriateness
and the parental veto. We have been obsessed with sex and relationship
education, but that is just one of the seven criteria for PSHE. Just as
it is feared that sex and relationship education is squeezed out of the
curriculum now, is not sex and relationship education in danger of
being squeezed out of the PSHE curriculum, which will now be part of
the bigger curriculum, which will be under even more pressure? Could we
not end up with less sex and relationship education because of all
those other things that people have to try to fit into the curriculum,
competing with everything
else?</div><a name="10012153000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000395"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Jan Campbell, would you like to
start?</div><a name="10012153000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan
Campbell:</b></i> I am happy to have a go. All of the aspects
of personal, social, health and economic education are already in the
curriculum. What the programmes of study have done is bring them
together so that they are more cohesive. There is nothing new there
that is not already in the curriculum, or that schools are not already
tackling. However, by bringing things together in a cohesive way and
giving it statutory status, so that teachers are better trained and
more able to deliver things in a cohesive way, we are less likely to
overburden the curriculum. Certainly, with the secondary curriculum,
the approach that Jan mentioned earlier is that there should be a fresh
look where subjects are brought together. There is no need to have lots
of little boxes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>and tick them off. There is an encouragement that young people should be
exploring concepts&#151;the very big ideas&#151;so that they are
looking at things like healthy lifestyles, managing risk, dealing with
relationships, managing their money and developing their careers. That
would create a better
situation.</div><a name="10012153000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">198</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000396"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is a quality issue. It is not a compulsion
issue. If we had better quality sex relationship education and personal
education now, we need not have such a situation. I am still not
convinced how quality will appear all of a sudden when we have great
platoons of new, wonderfully qualified sex and relationship education
teachers rather than Mrs. Miggins, the geography teacher who
happens to have a free period on a Thursday afternoon and has been
given sex and relationship education to do, as happens haphazardly at
the moment. It is primarily a matter of quality rather than compulsion,
and how we will fit it in, is it
not?</div><a name="10012153000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> Generally speaking, schools do not use their
precious resources to train teachers in non-statutory subjects. That
has been a major issue. A head teacher will prioritise training
teachers to deliver on the statutory curriculum, so we at the TPIAG
have always felt that PSHE needs to be professionalised and brought
together as one subject, not as lots of disparate
subjects.</div><a name="10012153000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">199</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000397"></a>Tim

tend to bring in outside experts&#151;maybe the FPA and
others.</div><a name="10012153000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> That could be the case, but those sorts of
people come into a school and add value to the existing programme. They
do not educate, as such. We cannot just have nice, interesting visitors
coming in. Children and young people like having visitors in, but the
programme of learning has to be managed by teachers to pick up the
assessment and all those things that you are concerned about. You
cannot do that by having a series of visitors
alone.</div><a name="10012153000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000398"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">200</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000399"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> It has been a very interesting session. I want to
ask a specific question about training. Do you think that, with making
the PSHE statutory, there is almost a need for specialist teachers? Or
is it something that requires more training of teachers? I was head of
PSHE in the 1980s. It was regarded as revolutionary. It was a
collection of other teachers who were committed to it, and training was
an issue then. Is that a step too far? Is it a silly suggestion or is
it something that should be considered, alongside all the other
pressures and general training
needs?</div><a name="10012153000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Gill
Frances:</b></i> Competence and confidence comes
with training. Perhaps you were born a good PSHE
co-ordinator. Some people are born that way and that is
great, but the rest of us need training. We need different chunks of
training. Everyone needs a bit; some people need a bit more, and some
people need specialist training. We would never expect any other area
of the curriculum to be taught by a non-specialist. We really would not
expect that, and we cannot expect this to be the same.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div><a name="10012153000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> May I support that with one of my
personal anecdotes. When I started teaching at a secondary school, the
related areas of the curriculum, which were dealt then&#151;not in
such specificity, but with a PHSE element&#151;were delivered through
tutorial time. That meant that whoever was the form tutor did it. So
the quality and pupils&#146; experience was hugely variable. There
was no consistency and no comparability. Some of it was absolutely
dreadful.</div><a name="10012153000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Oona
Stannard:</b></i> There is a particular issue about the
qualifications and experience that primary teachers will need because
they are all likely to be involved in PSHE when it becomes statutory.
At secondary level, as Mr. Coaker implied, there will be a
need for some to be highly specialist leaders of others in this area
and for different degrees of training and specialists. But there is not
a need for an equal level of training for every teacher because some
might already be involved in PSHE. It needs to be much more
discriminatory, and provision needs to be made for
that.</div><a name="10012153000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000400"></a>The

time.</div><a name="10012153000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan

all of this work? We talk very much about the pupil voice. I guess, to
a certain extent, I answer my own question, so I shall leave it there.

Stannard:</b></i> I have no doubt that they are enthusiastic
about PSHE education at all times, except if it is not done well. They
are highly critical if it is not done well, but they want the
opportunities that it offers. On the many occasions when I talk to
young people, they prove to be very reflective, sensible and keen to
have this experience at
school.</div><a name="10012153000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rev.
Jan Ainsworth:</b></i> One of the other occasions when they
are critical is when they feel that they are being fed a line. I say
that out of the Church school context, in which most people think we
are feeding them a line, although we are not. It is about equipping
young people to understand a range of views, being very clear about
what stems from a Christian approach, but also giving a range of views,
so that they can make choices and decisions for themselves. If they
feel someone is telling them what they should think&#151;including
about cigarettes, alcohol and the rest&#151;then there is a certain
distancing going on. So, again it is the skill of the teacher, and
knowing what you are
doing.</div><a name="10012153000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jan

the two sides, to give the good education which can convince our

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">205</b><a name="10012153000412"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): May I ask Sir
Mark Potter a question? In 2008 you dismissed an appeal by Medway
council so that it would not be named as the local authority in case
the identity of the child was revealed. You accepted that the case
raised matters of considerable public interest, and that reporting a
fuller story would enable the public to form their own view. Will the
proposals help the public form a view about the family court
system?</div>
<a name="10012153000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Mark Potter:</b></i> I think that they are an improvement.
There are restrictive provisions in the interests of the child&#146;s
welfare, as opposed to simply reporting everything that goes on. There
are distinctions to be drawn between giving the public an opportunity
to understand fully what goes on and giving them the details of the
evidence. There is a concern with public law proceedings, to which I
think it is right for the press and media to have access. The cases
involve medical and other expert reports on the state, welfare and
feelings of the child.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div><a name="10012153000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you are
simply dealing with the case of a young baby being removed from their
parents, for a number of years until the case has passed from
people&#146;s memory anyway, there may not be enormous concern for
the child&#146;s welfare if proceedings on the case are reported.
However, as soon as you get to the time when a child is old enough to
go to a local school, whatever safeguards are taken about anonymity,
quite a close circle of people in an area will know who the reports are
about, so it becomes very important that the details of the matter are
not reported, and the press do not have access to
them.</div><a name="10012153000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate has somewhat shifted in this case from the original position.
The press were&#151;and the judiciary supported them on
this&#151;concerned that the workings of the courts should be
understood. In particular, in response to the complaints of some
pressure groups, the judiciary was anxious that the press, and the
public via the press, should know what goes on in court proceedings.
Inevitably, when proceedings are entirely private, complaints about
proceedings are likely to come from someone who is dissatisfied with
the outcome and they may seek to publicise them in the press. However,
now that the press have access, can see what goes on, and are certainly
able to write an informed article in general terms about what may have
happened in the proceedings, there is pressure to make details
available, which in any view seems to offend against article 8
principles and the primacy of the welfare of the child set
out in the Children Acts. The debate has moved on. Of course, the press
are concerned, but while they may have access to proceedings, they are
limited in reporting
them.</div><a name="10012153000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Did
you see a preliminary statement that I supplied for the purposes of the
Committee? Regarding that, one of the judiciary&#146;s concerns is
the fact that it is the habit or likelihood of the press to drop in on
the first day and see what the case is about. In so far as they will
report that case, they will do so in terms of what is open. Whether it
is public or private law proceedings, an applicant may open a case
high, as we put it, make a number of often quite important and
unpleasant allegations relating to parties in the case, or make
exaggerated claims about the child. Those will get reported. Then time
passes. Perhaps the judgment is given and publicised in anonymous terms
two or three weeks later. There is no obligation on the press to report
that. It might be that quite a different situation is found to have
existed as a result of what happened, but because we are in a situation
of a first-day attendance, and what is news today has passed tomorrow,
an unfair and difficult position is left&#151;quite apart from the
welfare of the child
concerned.</div><a name="10012153000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000413"></a>The

Sir Mark, but we will make sure that we find it and distribute it to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">206</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000414"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> I shall follow on from that and open it out to
the other witnesses. Clearly, the welfare of any child involved in
family proceedings has to be at the forefront of all our minds when
these decisions are being made. A study of the impact of the most
recent changes to the reporting of family proceedings indicates that,
when court users, court staff and judges who responded to the impact
survey were asked whether, overall, the new media attendance rules have
the potential to make a positive contribution to improving the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>transparency and accountability of the family courts for various people,
such as family justice professionals, parents, the general public and
the media, the only group that did not agree with the statement was the
children. In fact, they strongly disagreed with it more than any other
people. Bearing that it mind, and in the knowledge that initial
indications are that some rules currently going through their early
stages are perhaps not working in the way that we had thought, does
that concern any of you? District Judge Crichton might have something
to say about
that.</div><a name="10012153000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Crichton:</b></i> Yes, I have great concern. I work in the
family proceedings court. It is a magistrates court, therefore the
media have always been allowed to come into the proceedings. They very
rarely come. When they do, they usually ask if they can come rather
than say, &#147;I can be here, as of right.&#148; We try to give
them information before they come into court and, by and large, they
have been very responsible in what they
report.</div><a name="10012153000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
deal with extremely vulnerable children and young people. When they are
in my court themselves, I often have to explain to them very carefully
that there is no risk of anything being reported that could lead to
their being identified. Sometimes, they still say to me, &#147;I
don&#146;t want anybody in this room hearing about my life, who
doesn&#146;t have to be here,&#148; and on those occasions I have
asked the media if they would be good enough to leave. They have always
been good enough to
leave.</div><a name="10012153000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was dealing with a case this morning of a young woman of 15, who
frankly wants to die. She was not in my court this morning, but she has
been in the past and she will be again in the future. She has been
prostituting herself; she has been cutting her wrists; she has been
attempting suicide. We are going through a process in which we are
trying to build her confidence in what social services, the
children&#146;s guardian and everybody are trying to achieve, which
is to enable her to reach a point in her life when, hopefully, she can
make something of
herself.</div><a name="10012153000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the girl had been in my court this morning, and I had said to her that
a member of the media was there, we would have lost her because the
situation is so fragile and delicate. I bring the case back to me each
time because it is important that she should not see a different person
when she comes to court. If she thought that there was a member of the
media in the court room, she would run out of it. If she thought that
someone other than the court staff, the social workers or the lawyers
would see and hear the things contained in the psychiatric reports that
I am reading, we would lose all the ground that we have made with her.
It is that delicate a
situation.</div><a name="10012153000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not just talking about something that happens in my court once every
three months, but something that happens in my court once every three
days. That is the nature of the problems that those young people face,
and when I work on behalf of the voice of the child sub-group of the
Family Justice Council and speak to groups of young people throughout
the country, I hear similar stories. They are appalled at the thought
that some third party from the media might actually be privy to the
very personal stuff that we read in the reports about them and the
assessments. So the answer is yes.</div>
<a name="10012153000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Julia Brophy:</b></i> May I ask whether the Committee has had
the paper that I submitted? [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Yes.&#148;] May I just elaborate on some of the things that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>District Judge Crichton said? One of the things we are doing at the
moment with young people is asking them about the impact of the media
in court and their willingness to talk about the events in their lives.
At the moment, we are midway through this research. It is certainly the
case that there are problems for young people. The minute they are told
the media might be in court, many children will not be willing to talk
further about the problems that Judge Crichton was referring to, so I
think we have got a real dilemma here. On the one hand, the media are
in court, but the problem starts before the media get into court,
because children have to be told that the media will be in court. The
clinician who is undertaking the assessment will have to tell them.
Once that is said, the children then have to make a decision about
whether they are willing to talk any further about the maltreatment in
their lives, about their feelings, about the impact&#151;for example,
in private law&#151;of warring parents on their wishes and feelings,
and&#151;in public law&#151;about physical and sexual abuse and
neglect. The implication from our study at the moment is that many
children will say they would be unwilling to go further in discussion
with clinicians. So I think we have a real tension
here.</div>
<a name="10012153000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">207</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000415"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> So when we talk about greater transparency in the
family courts, should we continue at this stage to concentrate on
better information being provided to the public about what is going on
in the courts, rather than introducing the media into these cases in
the way that the Bill suggests? When answering that question, perhaps
you could consider whether we need any primary legislation in this
area, or whether this process should be achieved through those practice
directions or any other mechanism?</div>
<a name="10012153000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Barbara
Esam:</b></i> The NSPCC takes the view that there are much
better ways to achieve openness and transparency in relation to the
family courts. The risks of the proposed legislation to the welfare of
children are extremely high. That is coming from a number of different
areas. The one that has already been mentioned in relation to children
not being willing to say what has been happening to them, either to
experts or to the court, leaves the court in the very negative position
of potentially making decisions about children&#146;s lives on
insufficient information.</div>
<a name="10012153000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is a risk that, although, with the best will in the world,
everyone will be doing their best to ensure that anonymity is
preserved, from our experience at the NSPCC we know of young witnesses
who have suffered distress. Even though their personal information was
meant to be kept private, in the criminal courts, where they have given
evidence about abuse they have suffered, in an unpalatable number of
cases that information has slipped into the public eye and caused them
incredible distress. It is very difficult to guarantee that there will
not be this patchwork jigsaw putting together enough information to
identify a child or the
family.</div><a name="10012153000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a risk in relation to experts, because experts would be named
if phase 2 were to be implemented. From the NSPCC&#146;s point of
view, we would not say that we do not think experts should be named,
but we would recognise what the Royal College of Paediatrics and the
Royal College of Psychiatrists have said&#151;that there is a problem
with that in that there is already a very small pool of experts
available to deal with these cases, and there is a risk that that pool
of experts will become even smaller if the legislation were to be
implemented.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div><a name="10012153000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth
risk area relates to time and money. The courts are already under
incredible pressure in terms of delays. With additional applications
there would be further delays and that would cost more money and have a
detrimental effect on the welfare of children. Those are the
risks.</div><a name="10012153000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at the goal&#151;openness and transparency&#151;we would say that
that is not the best way to achieve openness and transparency in
relation to the family courts. For one thing, about 50 per cent. of the
material is written material&#151;reports and so on&#151;which the
media will not have access to under the new provisions. Therefore, they
will be making decisions and doing reports based on limited
information. That ties in with what Sir Mark Potter said about making
reports based on limited information because they do not have to attend
the entire trial, or the entire process within the family
court.</div><a name="10012153000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a nutshell, we think that this is the wrong direction and is moving
prior to making a proper evaluation of what has happened so far. It was
only in April that new provisions were implemented and November when
the pilots started in relation to anonymised judgments. We think that
there needs to be a step back from this and a look at other ways to
open up information about the family courts, which we are 100 per cent.
behind, but using anonymised judgments and the open days that some
courts have had. There are other methods to achieve information and
scrutiny that do not allow the media in as the provisions proposed in
clause 40 will. We would really like to see clause 40 out of the
legislation completely.</div>
<a name="10012153000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">208</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000416"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> Bob, why is your profession so uninterested in
what happens in family courts? In my 10 years of practice, I
saw one journalist, who was only in our court because they were in the
wrong courtroom. The evidence that we have since the rules were relaxed
is that after an initial flurry of activity while the matter was still
in the public eye, it almost dropped off the edge of the page. Why does
the journalistic profession show so little interest in the area when it
is clearly of such public
interest?</div><a name="10012153000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> Everything that we have heard so far I
understand, and I share the concerns. Anyone in the media would share
the concerns about anonymity and all the problems that were raised. I
do not think that we come to the same conclusions, obviously; otherwise
I would not be here with something to say about it.</div>
<a name="10012153000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">In answer to
your question, the simple problem with how the courts have been opened
up in a very small way is that it was somewhat rushed, it was not an
opening up of the courts and it has not been done on the basis that the
Secretary of State, Jack Straw, initially wanted it to be done and
where he started from. It is important to go back to where he started
from and where we are starting from.</div>
<a name="10012153000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a very
simple view of justice. The first two principles are very important.
The first is that justice should be fair to all parties, and the second
is that it should be open. I think that that was the intention behind
trying to open up the family courts. Part of the opposition to doing so
leads to what I believe are the bad provisions in the Bill. We welcome
the idea that the provisions are the problem and will not
achieve the aim.</div>

heart of the answer to your question about why there has been very
little interest. It has been impossible to report. We have asked all
our members who have looked into it and tried to go in to report. In
the end, they give up and say, &#147;It&#146;s just impossible.
You&#146;re not able to do anything of any real value to the public.
You don&#146;t know whether you&#146;re going to be stopped in
mid-course. You have to go and ask at every step.&#148; There is a
general, misguided antipathy to the idea of having journalists in
court. It started with the idea that we almost had to be pariahs in
court.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">209</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000417"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> What is it that you want to report? What do you
want to put in the public domain that is so
important?</div><a name="10012153000201"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> What is going on in a court case. I do not
believe that it would ever come down to being routine court cases; it
would be those cases that have become major stories and controversies
because people have been dissatisfied with the outcome or whatever, or
where there has been a problem involving how a child has been dealt
with in the courts. That is what we want to report. It is not a matter
of reporting who they are. Obviously, we understand the importance of
anonymity of young people&#151;it is not even a matter of reporting
all the gruesome details. Even if you were allowed to report them, no
editor would probably want those details to appear in their paper, or
to broadcast them. However, unless you hear the whole detail of the
case, and unless you are able to put those sides of the case, you lose
the point of fairness of a report. So you must have some basic
information in there, which is not available at the
moment.</div><a name="10012153000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Mark Potter:</b></i> I agree entirely with everything that
was said in about the last four sentences. It is indeed only by being
there all the time, seeing the whole shape and knowing what is at the
end that you achieve anything. Again, I think it is
acknowledged&#151;the press say this&#151;that there no longer is
the ordinary court reporter who hangs around: the economics of the
newspaper profession are entirely against it. The press only turn up
when they know in advance that there is a particular reason behind why
they would wish to turn up. I accept entirely that there are
controversial cases where one of the parties feels aggrieved, and it is
entirely right and proper that the press be in there, and they probably
will be. However, the cases to which they want to turn up involve
celebrities or some factor of high local interest in the newsworthiness
of the parties, not in the nature of the process or whether it is
fairly conducted.</div>
<a name="10012153000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I am
interested to hear that all those members are said to have said how
difficult life was for them. In the first week, I had absolutely no
complaints and a good degree of congratulation on how all my
judges&#151;certainly in the High Court, and I have no reason to
think this was not so in the provinces&#151;did not seek to preclude
the press at all. There were several objections to press presence, all
of which were overruled. There were one or two responsible articles in
the first fortnight or so, none of which alleged any degree of
unfairness in the conduct of the proceedings whatsoever, and then all
interest ceased. Of course newspapers have to sell, but the interest is
in the personalities and the allegations, not in the nature of the
process or whether it is fairly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>dealt with, which was the original basis on which such a strong argument
was made for the admission of the press.</div>
<a name="10012153000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, I
am not against it&#151;I am for it, but let us do it on the basis of
an accurate assessment and
position.</div><a name="10012153000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000418"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. We have now found your statement and
circulated it,
incidentally.</div><a name="10012153000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">210</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000419"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The Bill is quite extraordinary, because it
seems to have annoyed everyone. It does not go far enough for the
editors, but it has gone too far for the courts and the
children&#146;s charities. I am still puzzled as to what the
Government are trying to do, and perhaps we could hear some comments
along those lines. I want to ask Mr. Satchwell this
question. You are not in the business of sensationalising things. The
media would not do that, but today we have heard about the Doncaster
affair&#151;not a family court affair&#151;where we have graphic
images from a video of that case, which is exactly what some of the
tabloids are interested in. How can we trust the media to report
fairly, giving a well-rounded and full account of the case, rather than
turning up for the allegations at the beginning, as Sir Mark says,
without saying what happened at the end, which might give a completely
different picture? Why should we be any more assured that you will
report
fairly?</div><a name="10012153000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> The evidence of court reporting shows that
there is little complaint. There are strict rules that people have to
live with in the criminal courts. You have to carry fair, accurate and
contemporaneous reports, and it goes in&#151;it goes on day after
day, right across the media all the time. Of course there will be times
where there will be sensational reporting, but that is usually because
there are sensational issues to be reported. Certainly, in the case of
Doncaster, no part of the media has to sensationalise it&#151;it was
sensational in itself. A lot of those concerns are misguided. I do not
think that there would be a desire to cover every last case. I am sure
that cases involving famous people might be covered, but there will be
those of real public interest in the sense that the issues at stake
affect one family in a particular case. They might also have an effect
on public policy and on other families, which is where the public
interest comes
in.</div><a name="10012153000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
overall view is, in a sense, in answer to one of the points made by
Judge Crichton at the start: let us bear in mind that the courts
already have power to limit what the media can report. They have it in
criminal cases and it will certainly be retained in these cases when,
if any sensational&#151;as you put it&#151;or difficult evidence is
being heard, the media could be asked to leave, and they will leave.
Family courts have not had experience of the media being present, but
the media appear in the criminal courts. The reporters who are there
day in, day out become almost part of the court process. They are known
to the courts, and they work with the courts. They deal with the judges
each day. They talk to judges about how to make sure that they do not
reveal identities and so
on.</div><a name="10012153000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">211</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000420"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> All that would be more credible, perhaps, if the
problem that you were trying to solve was one of poor practice within
the family courts, reflecting criticisms that social workers are too
quick to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>snatch children away or whatever. You have not mentioned that at all. If
your reporting is to be so balanced, which national newspapers have run
articles from commentators saying that there should not be exposure in
the family courts, as opposed to those who are clearly campaigning for
it? I cannot remember having seen
any.</div><a name="10012153000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I do not understand your
point.</div><a name="10012153000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">212</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000421"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am talking about relying on the media for
balance. Some high-profile journalists have waged campaigns in the
national media that they must expose all sorts of things in the family
courts, that they must support that and go further. That is one side of
the
argument.</div><a name="10012153000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other side of the argument concerns some of the cases that we have
heard about here. We have to be very careful because of the influence
on children. It could mean that children do not take part in the
judgments because they are frightened off by the media. They are
fragile people, as Nick Crichton said. I have not seen any newspaper
articles giving that balance. The media are not even giving a balanced
account of the argument, let alone whether they can be trusted to give
a balanced account of the cases that then come to
court.</div><a name="10012153000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I do not accept that. I do not have the
cuttings in front of me, but I have seen such issues
debated.</div><a name="10012153000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">213</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000422"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Can you provide some articles for
us?</div><a name="10012153000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I am sure that we can. I do not think that
that is the point being
made.</div><a name="10012153000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">214</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000423"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b><b class="B"> </b>You made the point about
balance.</div><a name="10012153000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I do not think that the point being made
is that the case that the other people are making has not been
reported. I would be very surprised if that was so. I think that it has
been reported. You started off by saying that our columnists were
saying that the courts should be opened up. That is an opinion piece.
It may be the opinion of the editor. It may be the opinion of the
columnist, and that is quite different from the news reports. There has
been plenty of news reporting of and features on the concerns of
children&#146;s groups, family groups and even of politicians. I have
seen that reported. It does not mean to say that the paper must say
that it agrees with
it.</div><a name="10012153000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">215</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000424"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> In the interests of balance, it would be nice to
see the other side of the
argument.</div><a name="10012153000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> It is factual reporting that is balanced.
I do not see your point about balance of
opinion.</div><a name="10012153000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">216</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000425"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Perhaps I am not making myself clear. Sir Mark
made the clear point that there is a fear that you turn up the first
day, get a headline story and then the full story does not come out.
There is not balanced reporting. That is one point that I put to
you.</div><a name="10012153000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second point is that certain parts of the media are waging a campaign
in order to expose the family courts, for whatever agenda the media
has. I am suspicious that it is not because they want to get a better
quality of people operating in the family courts, where there have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>been genuine criticisms about the quality of social worker reports etc.
You are not even having a balanced debate in the press because
others&#151;some of whom are here&#151;have genuine concerns that
going the way that we are going will actually be counter-productive to
fair justice. I have not seen those sort of articles carried in the
newspapers of the people you
represent.</div><a name="10012153000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I was not really aware that this was all
based on a huge campaign by newspapers to open up the family courts.
There were certainly arguments about opening up the reporting of
certain cases, which became huge controversies, but what happened was
the Government announced that they wanted to do it. Jack Straw said he
wanted to open the family courts to address those cases that
had become major issues. He wanted to open them
up.</div><a name="10012153000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course we welcomed that, because we work on the basis that openness is
good and valuable, and that openness in the legal system is valuable.
That is certainly something that has been proved over the past decade
or so in the criminal courts. We have supported that, but our concern
about the Bill is not opposition to the idea behind it but that will
not achieve what the Secretary of State said he wanted to achieve. What
he said at the outset was that he wanted to open up the courts in the
way that youth courts are open now and yet work perfectly well,
retaining all the safeguards people have raised. I share all of those
views&#151;of course you need those safeguards, and the media are
happy to go along with them. The approach to covering such courts is
not
cavalier.</div><a name="10012153000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Mark Potter:</b></i> Could I make a point arising from that?
It is in fact the case that the Lord Chancellor and those I have spoken
to at the Department have dropped the analogy of the youth courts as a
justification for what is done, because it is recognised that children
who appear in the youth courts appear there by reason of their own
conduct and, under our criminal code, are regarded as having sufficient
criminal responsibility to be
there.</div><a name="10012153000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every
child that we are talking about, whether in private or public
proceedings, is the entirely involuntary subject of a dispute either
between the parents or from alleged improper care by the parents
leading to a wrangle&#151;I should say an application by the local
authority leading to a wrangle&#151;in the courts. That is why these
children deserve to have their privacy protected as a separate matter
under article 8 and to be treated as people in their own right, in
these days when children&#146;s rights are recognised. The analogy is
simply not with the youth courts and has been dropped as a rationale on
which to base the legislation&#151;I do not know about wider
statements, but certainly in conversations between the judiciary and
the
Executive.</div><a name="10012153000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Crichton:</b></i> If I may say so, the point about the
Doncaster case was a good point, but the Doncaster case is
differentiated from care proceedings for exactly that reason&#151;it
is the conduct of those children that brings the matter into the public
forum.</div><a name="10012153000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
elephant in the room, which has not been mentioned even by
Mr. Satchwell, and I am grateful to him, is about the family
court being secret&#151;well, not secret, but we have to be
protective. Protection of the children whose cases come into our courts
is the first, second and third priority in everything that we
do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div><a name="10012153000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
before, the media have always been allowed into the family proceedings
court, because it is a magistrates court. About two years ago&#151;it
may be three&#151;Radio 4 did two very responsible programmes on the
work of my court, one in public law and one in private law. They spent
two whole weeks sitting in the courtroom watching everything that was
going on. At the very end of it, I asked the interviewer, Jenny Cuffe,
whether, if her family had the kind of problems that she had been
observing for the past two weeks, she would really want a media
observer in the courtroom. She had to say, although she was a media
observer herself, &#147;No, I would
not.&#148;</div><a name="10012153000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
me, that is not just the bottom line, but every line. I would not want
to be thought to be saying, therefore, that we should not be open. I
remain unconvinced that allowing the press into the back of the
courtroom is the right way to do it. There have been many suggestions,
which Barbara Esam touched on. We could do open days&#151;we did some
very successful open days in October, in five London family courts. The
public came in, saw mock trials and listened to tape recordings. We
shall develop that, also education in schools, or internet
websites&#151;I do not really understand the internet, but I
understand that there are ways of doing that sort of
thing.</div><a name="10012153000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another problem here, because today&#146;s newspaper is no longer
tomorrow&#146;s fish-and-chip wrapping. The information that goes
into the newspapers goes out on the internet for ever and a day. These
kids, if they are identifiable, know that information about them is not
forgotten about tomorrow but is there for ever. That is a horrendous
thought. Julia Brophy understands that far better than I do, so I hand
over to her.</div>
<a name="10012153000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Julia Brophy:</b></i> If I may, I shall elaborate on that a
little. I want to say two things. We have got to a position of almost
irreconcilable differences in what we can expect of the media. I do not
accept Bob&#146;s position that the media are sensitive to the
intimate and personal details of children. Our interviews with young
people demonstrate that they do not trust the media. We know of some
examples where the media have revealed some very intimate details about
young people&#146;s lives. The information has gone into the local
newspaper; it has been picked up by the national newspapers; and it is
on the internet. Those details, as Nick says, are there for the rest of
that child&#146;s life. They can be downloaded at any time, and they
can be circulated. It is a shadow over children&#146;s lives, when
they have appeared in court through no fault of their own.</div>
<a name="10012153000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
issues that came through with the children that we are talking to was
that they are concerned that people think that they are in court
because of things that are their fault. They are concerned because they
have done nothing wrong in relation to private law. They are concerned
in relation to public law that they are in proceedings not because they
have done something wrong, but because of problems with their parents.
The intimate details of their lives are not only in newspapers but on
the internet. That is a major problem for young people. Almost all
those we have spoken to so far have said that newspapers are a problem,
and they do not trust them. They are nervous about them and do not
think that their identities will be protected, nor their
privacy.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div><a name="10012153000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue is about the newspapers being able to present a balanced picture.
As Sir Mark demonstrated, it is almost irreconcilable because of the
nature of children&#146;s proceedings. Unless the media are simply in
at the end of a case, at the final hearing, and can look at the case in
its entirety, they will not be able to present a balanced picture. The
notion that somehow they will be able to do that or would want to do
that is also questionable.</div>
<a name="10012153000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reflect on
some comments made by one of Bob&#146;s colleagues. Joshua Rosenberg
said at the Family Law Bar Association conference in November, in a
discussion about this very issue, that the headline &#147;The family
court is doing a good job&#148; does not sell newspapers. That
reflects back on some of our interviews with young people, who say,
&#147;We don&#146;t want our personal lives displayed in local
papers or national papers. We are ashamed; we are embarrassed about
some of these issues.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">217</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000426"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Obviously, one way of opening things up or giving
more transparency is the publication of anonymised judgments. I note
that the pilots of those have not been evaluated. However, the Bill is
still proceeding with them. Do you have concerns about the timing?
Should the evaluation be completed first?</div>
<a name="10012153000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Mark Potter:</b></i> The evaluation principle should have
been completed long since. When the Government&#146;s policy solution
of supplying more information first came out, these were discussed.
However, I am afraid that for bureaucratic reasons they have been
delayed. The real purpose of the pilots is to ascertain how much it
costs in terms of judicial resources and time, because it is coupled
with the need for judgments, when published, to be correct. Judges give
oral judgments late in the evening at the end of cases. When the
transcript comes to them for correction, they have not only to see that
the grounds are properly stated as they are. When they see how many ers
and ums they have made and how ungrammatical it may be, the business of
correcting a judgment before it goes out on the website and is sent to
the parties can take probably an hour of the judge&#146;s time, and
more if other matters have to be dealt with. The pilot is largely to do
with the burden on the judiciary and the overall cost. The aim is to
have family cases of any substance dealt with in a written judgment
that is available both to the parties and on the Bailey website, which
is ready to receive them.</div>
<a name="10012153000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
difficulties is the cost. We have to be realistic in these times; no
doubt it is a matter that will affect the Government. The actual cost
of doing this throughout the country and putting it on the website is
substantial in so far as the budget is concerned. I believe that a
figure of &#163;2 million was quoted. But there is no reason to think
that it will not work perfectly well, subject to the demands that it
makes. The time of the judiciary is precious. So whether it gets taken
up once its result is available remains to be seen. In an ideal world,
of course it would be, but it is sensible to wait. It is largely the
solution in the view of many. It certainly was the solution in the view
of the previous Lord Chancellor, until the change of governmental view
comparatively recently.</div>

on family proceedings&#151; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>legal aid in that sphere&#151;and all sorts of things. We would be

Brooke:</b> Just coming back to the previous debate that we
had, I was getting the feeling, Mr. Satchwell, that you were
looking for accountability through the media. I may be wrong on that.
Clearly, there are problems with having accountability through the
media. Is there no way of working together to get the accountability
that is desired&#151;we know of cases where people are very unhappy
with the outcomes&#151;other than taking such risks, as has been
suggested by other witnesses?</div>
<a name="10012153000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> Whether it is accountability or something
else, I see it as an opportunity to enhance public confidence in the
family court system. I believe that the best way to achieve confidence
in any system is to make it as open as possible&#151;not in an
artificial way, but to open it up as much as possible, with the
safeguards that we all agree need to be in place. The public seeing it
operating as much as they possibly can will increase the accountability
and therefore the confidence. That wider confidence point&#151;for
the public to have confidence in the system&#151;is so important. The
accountability issue comes down to certain problems in certain cases
where a problem occurs. One would hope that they are very rare. That is
when you want to hold the system to account. I think that it is equally
important to try to build confidence in the system, and you do that
through openness.</div>

<a name="10012153000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I find that almost an insulting question.
There is no evidence that newspapers in this country do not accept that
there have to be restrictions on court reporting. We accept it totally
in a way that, for instance, they would not accept in the United
States, because of their first amendment to the constitution. But we
have worked well with the youth justice system for 70 years. I cannot
remember the last time that there was a really serious case of a breach
of reporting restrictions. They occur occasionally, usually by mistake.
Journalists and editors work very carefully every day to ensure that
those restrictions are not breached. They understand why they are put
in place.</div>

What should be the price paid, particularly if something goes worldwide

people.</div><a name="10012153000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> That is for the courts to decide, because
it would be contempt of court. I wish that we could get away from that
debate. Part of the problem&#151;you talk about children being afraid
of the media&#151;is that there is huge suspicion that the media are
some great ogre that will come into the courts and try to destroy the
system. I am afraid that I am not prepared to accept that that is the
truth of the matter. What the media want to do, would like to do and
have encouraged the Secretary of State to do is to open up the courts,
so that we can report a part of public life properly. We would do it
responsibly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="10012153000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Bill, this will not be done responsibly, because I do not believe that
it will be done very much at all. It is hardly a step forward. There
are too many restrictions. I believe simply that if you want to achieve
what the Secretary of State wanted to achieve&#151;greater openness,
accountability and confidence&#151;you must find a way to do that.
The Bill does not even say, &#147;Look, this is why we&#146;re
trying to do it&#148;; it just comes up with a lot of ways to stop it
happening. It will not achieve what the Government are trying to
achieve. In fact, it will go backwards in certain areas. It will cause
problems, for instance, with moves that have been made.</div>
<a name="10012153000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
celebrated case called Clayton <i class="I">v. </i>Clayton. The Bill would
reverse that judgment, which was supposed to do something. It will put
you in a position where you might probably reduce the amount of
reporting about cases that deserve to be reported in the public
interest. It talks about banning writing about anything unless you have
been and heard every last sentence in the court. You would not be able
to debate issues. You would find it difficult to debate issues that
should be debated in the public interest.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000437"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> That is the word I was after, thank you.
Disinfectant, but only up to a stage. As I said earlier, problems in
the court occur where there are doubts about the veracity and
competence of certain court officials in some things that they have
prepared. Some people, because they are doing their job badly, might
tend to recommend that care proceedings go a certain way, and that
might be unfair. I think that that is where there is a problem in the
court.</div><a name="10012153000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of what I have heard from you appears to address why we need to do
something about that as the main problem, or why that would solve it.
To take Nick Crichton&#146;s earlier example, he regularly has media
people in his court. If you were given greater powers and you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>were a court reporter in Judge Crichton&#146;s court, and he, knowing
that you had the power to stay there and report on it, came up to you
and said, &#147;We have a 15-year-old girl, and we think that if
there is a media person in my court, she will do a bunk,&#148; would
you be inclined to say, &#147;Fair cop, we won&#146;t report
it.&#148;?</div><a name="10012153000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I do not think that it is a matter of just
asking. The courts will retain their discretionary powers, as I
understand
it.</div><a name="10012153000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000438"></a>Tim

have&#151;</div><a name="10012153000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> No. The discretionary power is there, and
a journalist and a newspaper are not going to go against a
judge&#146;s decision. They do not. They accept the judge&#146;s
decision, even when they disagree with
it.</div><a name="10012153000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">226</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000439"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> So why are you not happy with the situation now?
Judge Crichton is happy for you to go to his court other than in those
exceptional
cases.</div><a name="10012153000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> But we are talking about opening up the
whole system and creating a right to attend court. When we first
started debating this matter with the Ministry of Justice, there seemed
to be a view that the only way journalists should ever be allowed in
court was if they wore a Guantanamo-type jumpsuit, so that everyone
knew they were there&#151;that people must be warned that the media
were
there.</div><a name="10012153000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
find it rather strange and worrying that people want the public to be
warned that the media are there, when the whole point about the media
in our democratic society is that we are supposed to be there as a
safeguard. We are there to be that, and to help people who are in the
unfortunate position of being in
court.</div><a name="10012153000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">227</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000440"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> May I give you a real example from Judge
Crichton&#146;s court? I have sat in his court, and the last time I
was there, I was with a journalist. At the beginning of one of the
cases, Judge Crichton asked all those involved, as he would have to
under the Bill, whether anyone there minded that we had two guests, an
MP and a journalist. The first mum said that she had no problem with
the journalist, but she did not like the idea of an MP being
there.</div>
<a name="10012153000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were there
not to report on the case but because we were concerned to see how the
system worked. This is where I have a problem. I do not believe that we
will achieve a better justice system in the courts as a result of the
Bill, and we need to have a better system, in which people are
confident. I am still not clear how some of the things you want are
going to produce that improvement, because you are not assuring us that
we are going to have proper reporting. Do you agree that what people
will see is not what goes on in the courts, but your report of what
goes in the courts? That will not necessarily be the whole
story.</div><a name="10012153000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> The first day that any wannabe journalist
walks into a training course for journalists, he is handed a little
book, which is now a thick one, as the law gets more complex every day,
called &#147;Essential Law for Journalists&#148;; I was handed that
many years ago, when it was a rather thinner book. The first thing you
learn about the law and about court reporting is that there are
restrictions on you, the biggest of which is that you have to come up
with a fair, accurate and contemporaneous report. That is inside every
journalist&#146;s psyche. The one 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>thing that you have to do, because you get into a lot of trouble if you
do not, is obey the rules of court reporting and produce a fair and
accurate report. I accept the point that sometimes the media do not
stay in the court for every minute, but it does not preclude the fact
that you have to produce a fair, accurate and contemporaneous
report.</div><a name="10012153000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">228</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000441"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Finally, can I ask everyone a question? Given
that there is strong criticism of the measures in the
Bill&#151;either that they do not go far enough, or that they go too
far and are not sensitive enough&#151;that the pilots have only just
started and are still running, and that the publication pilot started
only just over two months ago, would it be fair to say that these
proposals have been hurried? Is it therefore in the best interests of
everyone that the Government should go away, think again and come back
with something that is more workable and defends the interests of
children, while adding the openness that Mr. Satchwell, for
example, has spoken about? Do we have an agreement on that? You could
probably say yes, no or
maybe.</div><a name="10012153000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Several
w</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">itnesses </b></i><i class="I">indicated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">229</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000442"></a>Tim

Satchwell?</div><a name="10012153000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I would like to see the principle taken
forward, that is all. I take the point about the pilots. The rules were
introduced on 27 or 28 April, at a time when we were still discussing
with the Ministry of Justice how they might be
implemented.</div>
<a name="10012153000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">230</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000443"></a>Tim

half-baked?</div><a name="10012153000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob

of the reasons why we are criticised now for not doing a job that some
people think we should.</div>
<a name="10012153000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">231</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000444"></a>Tim

back with something else that suits more
people?</div><a name="10012153000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> Well, that might be a
conclusion.</div><a name="10012153000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000445"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> So we have got to a
yes.</div><a name="10012153000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Mark Potter:</b></i> I would like to see the results of the
pilot, certainly. May I pick out three points where misconception has
crept
in?</div><a name="10012153000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
is in relation to adoption. If adoption proceedings are being taken in
parallel with care proceedings, they are subject to directions I have
given and they become public and open to the press. In private adoption
proceedings which are not contested and do not involve abuse, the
unanimous position of judges and absolutely everyone is that there is
no legitimate reason for the press to be present. So many sensitivities
are involved, largely for parents, as well as the child, and it simply
is not a matter the public deserve to know about, so far as the
intimate details are
concerned.</div><a name="10012153000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there were points when Mr. Satchwell spoke as if the media
did not have access already. That development has taken place. This is
all about the degree of reporting that is permitted after access has
been granted. He was talking about how proceedings should be opened up,
but they have already been opened up to the press&#151;what is being
controlled is the level of reporting.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div><a name="10012153000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, there
is a simple reason for warning people about the presence of the media.
Judges, wherever they are, get on with their proceedings. If the press
are not there, they do not have to concern themselves, even if of their
own motion or on the application of the parties they impose reporting
restrictions. The reason judges have to be told that the press are
there is that from that moment they have to keep actively in their
minds, &#147;Might there be a problem here about
reporting?&#148;</div>
<a name="10012153000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I understand that point, but the position
you need to get to, assuming that opening up the system is the will of
Parliament, is that the family courts should be open unless there are
good reasons for them not to be. The judges still have control over
what is reported&#151;all those discretionary powers&#151;and that
answers Sir Mark&#146;s point. If you assume that the family courts
are always open and that the media are there and able to report, the
kind of point that has been raised can be dealt
with.</div><a name="10012153000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is where this measure is going wrong. It is trying to achieve some kind
of openness, but it is not simplifying matters enough. You read the
terms of the Bill and it seems to be all the reasons why you should not
report, rather than all the reasons why you should
report.</div><a name="10012153000284"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000446"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Judge Crichton, did you want to come in? I think
you are bursting to say
something.</div><a name="10012153000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Crichton:</b></i> May I? And then Julia,
you.</div><a name="10012153000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
points, if I may. I want to avoid saying it as a well-known fact, but
we all know that there are responsible journalists and perhaps less
responsible or even misguided journalists. We are not about warning the
public against the press, as Mr. Satchwell says&#151;I am
sure he is in the first category, of being responsible&#151;
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> but we are about protecting
individuals from those who may be less responsible or misguided. When
we are legislating for this situation, we must, must we not, legislate
against the less responsible, just in
case?</div><a name="10012153000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
then want a moment of flippancy. Could you insert in the Bill a clause
that says that a journalist may not come into court once a case has
started and that, once they are in, the doors will be locked and they
may not leave until the case is finished? That way, they will get a
balanced picture of what is going on, which is what the president has
been saying. We are not going to achieve that, but I think it makes the
point.</div><a name="10012153000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
in answer to Mr. Loughton&#146;s question, yes, I get the
feeling that this is too rushed. It is far too important to rush. The
Children Act 1989 has been in now for 18 years and we have developed
ever-increasing understanding of the problems of these children and
their families and of the need to protect them. To rush a piece of
legislation like this, which might create a risk for those children and
families, is to me completely wrong. We need to await the research.
That is why I jumped in before Dr. Brophy, because she can pick up on
that point.</div>
<a name="10012153000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have before
me a letter from the Association of Lawyers for Children, which was
e-mailed to me just before I left. It makes the point very clearly. It
has been sent to the scrutiny unit; I hope it has been received. The
last three paragraphs are essential. When I was sitting in the taxi on
my way here, it suddenly occurred to me to ask&#151;I don&#146;t
know the answer&#151;are the media allowed into mental health
tribunals? There are similar issues. They deal with very vulnerable
people. Is anybody 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>saying, &#147;We should be reporting what happens there&#148;? The
media are not allowed in doctors&#146; surgeries, while doctors are
speaking to their patients. It is not so
dissimilar.</div>
<a name="10012153000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000447"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I do not think that we know the answer to your
question, but we can certainly try to find out.</div>
<a name="10012153000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Crichton:</b></i> Rhetorical. I&#146;m sorry.</div>
<a name="10012153000292"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Julia Brophy:</b></i> May I add a couple of points? I return
to Mr. Loughton&#146;s proposition and where we are going.
The direction of travel is in the wrong direction and it is too rushed.
Most people accept that. We need to wait and see what the pilots
produce.</div>
<a name="10012153000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also think
that we have no real assessment of how the rules post-April 2009 are
working, certainly from the perspective of children and parents. We
want some monitoring of that to know how it is working before we move
forward with the proposals in the second stage of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012153000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The notion
that courts should be open unless there is a good reason for them not
to be is problematic. Children and young people are also stakeholders
here. If they are going to vote with their feet by saying nothing, the
family justice system is going to be in a pickle. If the judges do not
have the evidence that they need from children, as Barbara said
earlier, they will be making decisions about children&#146;s safety
and future on inadequate evidence.</div>
<a name="10012153000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">You have to
take on board the views of young people. If we have to look at
additional ways of making children feel more confident and that the
courts can protect them, that will slow the system down; we must be
sure when we come to look at this legislation again. We know, for
example, how clinicians want to work with young children. We need to
the issues that they are concerned about. We must have a better
understanding of how the rules are working post-April. At the moment,
we have no idea.</div>
<a name="10012153000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
is too quick, too hasty, with insufficient information. And if
anything, the family justice system is supposed to be an evidence-based
process.</div>
<a name="10012153000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">232</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000448"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> District Judge Crichton made a very good point
about the media not being allowed to report a case if they were not
present at the beginning of the proceedings. That applies to us: if we
are not present at the beginning of a debate or a statement,
Mr. Speaker will not call us. That is reasonable, as we will
not have given the Minister or Opposition spokesman a fair hearing.
Another good point was made about children voting with their feet by
not speaking, when it is important that they should speak.</div>
<a name="10012153000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
beginning of our proceedings, Bob Satchwell&#151;I am not in the
business of beating up journalists, really&#151;you said that
journalists knew the difference between comment and reporting. When I
was very young, which is a long time ago, there was a difference. The
editorial would quite specifically be the comment of the owner or the
editor of that paper. Then there was the reporting, which were factual
reports; and there would be features, which were also
comment.</div>
<a name="10012153000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have moved
away from that. We now have a blurred area, especially in the red tops.
I am not talking about local papers, which maintain the difference. I
rely on my local papers a great deal for factual information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>about what I am doing and what constituents are doing. There is now a
blurring, and it would worry me to have vulnerable people and children
coming before the courts, and in front of journalists who do not see
the difference between reporting and comment. That would worry me,
especially if they have not been in the court for the whole of the
proceedings.</div>
<a name="10012153000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I wish I could reassure you on the
misconceptions about the difference between comment and straight
reporting. I am sure there are occasions and you would probably throw
plenty of examples at me, but I think the point is over-exaggerated. I
go back to the point about responsible and irresponsible reporting. The
point I have continued to make this afternoon is that, whatever may be
true of the media, in the case of court reporting I do not believe
there is a huge distinction. Court reporting in this country is hugely
responsible, I believe.</div>

an instruction of the court, but it gives powers to the Secretary of
State to be able to redefine that definition, which I assume means that
social workers and others directly involved with the child on a
day-to-day basis could fall into that category. Can I ask whether
anyone wants to proffer their definition of a professional witness and
what powers they think the Secretary of State should have to change
that at any further
stage?</div><a name="1001222000001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Mark Potter:</b></i> Simply sitting here without notice of
the question is difficult. I would be very happy to send a note on the
topic. Basically, what we are concerned with, the real
problem&#151;Camilla Cavendish is one of the people to inspire the
campaign; in <i class="I">The Times</i> she said that in conversations with the
Lord Chancellor he wants to deal with these problems&#151;is the
professional witnesses who, by reason of subsequent complaints arising
out of criminal and family cases, have been shown to have had pet
theories of their own or been at fault. So we are looking at people who
charge independent fees for their reports&#151;child psychiatrists,
paediatricians and others of that ilk. It is a difficult dividing line
to draw, but I do not think it is right to include, if that is what you
are trying to get at, the ordinary salaried social workers who are
getting on with the job on behalf of the local council. That is a
distinction that they are trying to observe in the legislation, but I
am afraid I have not thought it about particularly
closely.</div><a name="10012153000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think this is an extraordinary Bill. I was told, again by someone in
the Ministry, that there is an example somewhere else, although they
have not produced it yet, where, in a matter of this kind, legislation
is being laid down about what can or should not be done, particularly
in relation to sensitive personal information. Thus things are in
suspense to see how they work out, and in 18 months&#146;
time, by a resolution of the House, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>relation to which consultation would not be required, the goal posts may
be moved or the definitions altered. The concern must be that what
would be being looked at is the degree to which the press do in fact
attend or are in fact satisfied with what is happening, and if they are
not, the definition will be altered. But one must ask oneself&#151;if
the rationale at this stage when you are passing the legislation is
that sensitive information should be protected&#151;how does it make
it different later, simply because there is an inhibition on reporting?
That is a concern.</div>
<a name="10012153000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">234</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000450"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> So if we were trying to reach a point in the Bill
where we can say, &#147;Yes, but no more at this stage,&#148; and
given the fact that the Bill is effectively divided into two stages,
would you be content with amendments to make it less complex and allow
stage 1, but drop stage 2? Or do you agree with me that we should stick
with the pilot and just drop the
lot?</div><a name="10012153000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> May I just take you back to the point
about the witnesses? I accepted at the outset that we share the
concerns about anonymity and families, and also sensitive medical
family information and so on. We agree about that, but with regard to
the witnesses, in particular, we cannot understand why people should be
anonymous even if there was no risk of identifying the children. I do
not see that. That was part of what I said earlier about assuming that
we can report things unless there is a good reason for not reporting
them. I should like to know the good reasons for not reporting the
names of those witnesses. From the Bill, it looks to us as though we
would have difficulty reporting and naming anyone, even the judge on
occasions. It says&#151;almost in terms&#151;that we cannot reveal
this, that and the other. That is where the difficulty
lies.</div><a name="10012153000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the second point about the two stages, the problem about getting to the
review and then having a second go is that it would be somewhat
pointless. We would not get a huge change in the behaviour of the media
from where they are now, because of all those reasons and how difficult
it would be to report. It would be such a minefield that it would be
easier not to go and report. Therefore, it would not be an effective
experiment.</div>
<a name="10012153000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Crichton:</b></i> I find myself in a difficult situation. I
hesitate to be seen to be arguing with my boss at the far end. I am not
really arguing. I am invited to talk to social workers at training
sessions. I say to them all the time, &#147;Be more professional.
Have more confidence in the opinions that you form. Present yourself
professionally.&#148; So why would I say that they should not be seen
as professional
witnesses?</div><a name="10012153000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, I do not want to see their names printed in public
because we know the predisposition of some members of our society who
do not understand issues. I do not know if you remember the story a few
years ago of a paediatrician who had bricks thrown through her window
and her walls daubed, because the local community thought that she was
a paedophile. We have to take into account those sorts of difficulties
when we think about whose names should go into the public
domain.</div><a name="10012153000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had a father in my court who said, &#147;I&#146;ve got a gun. I got
your address from the internet. I&#146;m going to have you.&#148;
He repeated that to the security staff before he left the building.
That is how some levels of our community operate, and we have to keep
that in mind when we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>legislate. I am very uncomfortable with seeing any of the professional
witnesses&#146; names being available for publication for that
reason. I understand why &#147;Mr. Responsible&#148;,
Bob
Satchwell&#151;</div><a name="10012153000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> Says
who?</div><a name="10012153000312"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Crichton:</b></i><b class="B"> </b><b class="B">&#151;</b>says what he does,
and I respect it. But I come back to my original point: not everyone is
as
responsible.</div><a name="10012153000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">235</b><a name="10012153000451"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): I have a question for
Mr. Satchwell. I ask it as a former journalist. I read the
&#147;Essential Law for Journalists&#148; on a National Council for
the Training of Journalists course, and I worked for 30 years as a
national newspaper journalist. Does he agree that, in the past two or
three decades&#151;I don&#146;t know how far he goes back&#151;it
is a fact that journalistic ethics have gone down? While the vast
majority of journalists, I am sure, are ethical, I am not surprised
that young children are much more suspicious now than they might have
been in the past of journalists holding to ethics. In my day, it was
often the editors who would come down on us like a ton of bricks if we
didn&#146;t stick by the letter of the law, especially in court
reporting. Now they sometimes encourage their own reporters to cut
corners. That is point number
one.</div><a name="10012153000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Point
number two is much more important. It concerns the matter raised by
Judge Crichton and Dr. Brophy about the internet. There was a time
when, if a notorious fact were revealed in an adoption or divorce case,
it would be known at the time but soon forgotten. One can read many
Agatha Christie stories that reveal in the last chapter a yellowing,
forgotten newspaper cutting from 20 years ago showing that one of the
characters is actually the adopted daughter of somebody else. In those
days, people could not retain or access such information. Once
something was a few weeks old, it was
forgotten.</div><a name="10012153000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now,
the internet offers instant recall of all information. It is in the
public domain for ever. That changes the situation of court reporting,
through no fault of journalists. Because news recall is more efficient
now, even without any deterioration in journalistic
ethics&#151;though sadly, I think that there has been one&#151;the
overriding reality is that nobody would have any protection from a fact
once revealed. The danger to somebody&#146;s reputation from a
mistake by a journalist or an accidental revelation is far greater than
ever.</div><a name="10012153000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I am sorry, but I have to disagree with
you about journalistic ethics. It is 40 years this year since I started
being a journalist, and I can only say that there has been a massive
improvement in how some parts of the media that are most criticised
behave. However, let us not go into huge detail about that, although I
would be prepared to do so on some other occasion. The point is that
editors and legal managers of newspapers, particularly national
newspapers, are even more aware these days of the dangers of contempt
and so on and are very
careful.</div><a name="10012153000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
your major point about the internet, it is obviously an issue that goes
beyond this area and applies to every area. What you have to bear in
mind, though, is to keep a sense of perspective. People with malicious
intent who really wanted to find out something about an individual that
happened 20 years ago could always do so by going into the public
library and looking up back copies of the paper.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div><a name="10012153000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">Okay, it is
now easier. That is what we certainly agree on. Of course it is easier.
I do not know what the answer is on that issue any more than on any
other issue. The history point is one of ease of access rather than
total access. Obviously, people who want to stir up trouble or go back
over an individual&#146;s history could have done so in the past;
they can just do it slightly more easily these
days.</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> I am still contemplating the idea of court
reporters in Guantanamo jumpsuits. I might come back to that. If I may,
I will start with Bob Satchwell.</div>
<a name="10012153000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout
probing questions from the Committee, I do not think that you ever set
out clearly what you would report and why you would report it. From the
media&#146;s point of view, it would be useful to know whether you
felt that the professional reporting that you described would be there
for the greater good&#151;not only that it would improve the quality
of decision making in the courts or the local authority, but that the
young people involved would know that other young people would not go
through the same distress as them. You have never really tackled that
side of it. Do you think that that is important, or is there another
reason why you are so enthusiastic about an entirely open
system?</div>
<a name="10012153000321"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> I am sorry if you think that I am being
difficult about it. Part of the reason why I cannot tell you is that we
have not been allowed into family courts, so we do not know precisely
what we can
report.</div><a name="10012153000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012153000453"></a>Bridget

sort.</div><a name="10012153000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> Well of course we know what we can report
in those cases. I am not sure what you are trying to get at. Reporters
will go into court and find out what the story is about in a given
case. I don&#146;t think you will get blanket coverage of all the
courts. It will not be every case. There are likely to be cases that
have some obvious point of public interest or a problem. Those are the
ones that will be reported. It is very difficult to say how they will
be reported, not having had the experience of reporting
them.</div>

<a name="10012153000325"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob

Flint:</b> Do you think that there is a difference in the
media having an interest in reporting a private family situation or
custody situation as opposed to something that involves a public
authority such as a social care case? Is there any reason why the press
should have access to reporting a private custody court case between
two individuals who are divorced?</div>
<a name="10012153000329"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob

case, to give a straight answer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">240</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000457"></a>Caroline

Satchwell:</b></i> Some papers might be interested in that,
but I suggest that the Peter Andre cases are more likely to be out in
the public domain long before they get near a court room. Let&#146;s
not go into the details of how that might happen. Clearly, it is
something where the media will have to follow a learning
curve.</div>
<a name="10012153000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">241</b><b class="B"><a name="10012153000458"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I can almost see a public interest situation
arising, although having listened to the other comments made today I am
quite concerned about it. If a local authority is seeking to remove a
child or to do something similar, I can almost see you asking how to
ensure that justice is done. I could almost understand it if you were
putting forward such an argument, saying what you could bring to that
case. However, I cannot understand it when it is about private
individuals who are seeking a decision to help them to overcome their
differences on the custody of a child.</div>
<a name="10012153000333"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Bob
Satchwell:</b></i> Part of the drive for this change came
from a celebrated case&#151;or a notorious one. It was a family from
East Anglia, I think from Norfolk, which eventually finished with them
going to Ireland to have a baby. They were afraid that their unborn
baby would be taken away by the local authority. It was that kind of
case that caused the drive for change and reform. Clearly, the reasons
why a local authority would want to take children away from parents in
that way, even an unborn child, deserve some public scrutiny. The
public want to understand it.</div>

would agree that the courts have to be accountable, as do local
authorities and others, when making major decisions about individual
lives. Julia, I think that you spoke of some real tension. Is there a
way to relax that tension? Is there anything in part 2 of the Bill that
you think can be developed, or do you think that we should stop where
we are&#151;or are there other things that you would include to make
part 2 better? I am sorry but I have left you only half a minute to
answer.</div><a name="10012153000336"></a>
