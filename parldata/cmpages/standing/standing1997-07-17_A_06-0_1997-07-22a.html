<H4><center>Payments to companies under section 687 of the Taxes Act 1988</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Clause 27 is an anti-avoidance clause. We understand the need in Finance Bills from time to time to take measures to ensure that the intention of Parliament is respected and not circumvented too blatantly or persistently by schemes seeking to undermine that intention. But, a word of caution must be struck. The measures taken against avoidance must be proportionate to the damage that has been caused or is in prospect. It is wrong to pass large and complex chunks of anti-avoidance legislation when the damage to the revenues may be incidental or transitory.
<P>
The clause must itself be clear and unambiguous. It must be focused clearly on the supposed abuse; it must not go unnecessarily wide. That is very important. There is always a temptation for the Revenue authorities or the Government of the day to pass rather sweeping and general anti-avoidance legislation--almost to try to force the intention behind legislation--whereas it is the British legal tradition to be precise. We start from the position that the taxpayer is entitled to keep his or her income or capital until there is clear legislative authority to take that money away from that person. The coercive power of legislation is one that the House, and certainly the Committee, should grant the Executive only on certain carefully defined conditions.
<P>
If we do not respect those anti-avoidance principles, we could end up not only hitting the innocent, but creating a good deal of confusion and ambiguity among compliant taxpayers. A frequently expressed wish of successive Governments is to try to make tax legislation--indeed, the entire tax system--comprehensible so that people can see what taxes they are paying, at what rate, how much and the purposes to which those taxes are to be applied. In a complex, advanced economy, people are entitled to make complex arrangements to secure their income and capital. None of that need be illegal. It is not necessarily avoidance of the scale or type that any Government would wish to undermine.
<P>
The fact that schemes or complex arrangements are in place is itself no evidence of avoidance of the type that the Government would wish to curtail. What worries me about the clause is that it seems to go too wide. I can give an example of a scheme that might be hit which has been in the news recently. Several large companies have perfectly legal avoidance schemes to shelter from taxation some dividend income and shares in capital form. The BP scheme to shelter specific shares from tax for the eventual benefit of directors and chairmen recently caught our eye. In the case of Lord Simon, who is a Labour Minister, the figure of &#163;2 million worth of shares has been mentioned. Would the scheme be affected by the clause? In previous debates, it has been pointed out that, as far as we know, there is nothing wrong with the scheme. However, we are a little surprised by the large sum. Last week, it was observed that BP's work force had not done quite so well.
<P>
During the past five years, the number of BP employees world wide has fallen from 115,000 to 53,000--a reduction of more than half. The United Kingdom work force have also almost halved--they have decreased from 30,000 to a little under 16,000. The employees have not done so well, whereas the Lord Simon has done very well. It is not up to me or the Committee to advise the Government--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the right hon. Gentleman desist from commenting on a specific scheme and, instead, make remarks that pertain more generally to the clause? The specific issue of a particular person's shares is not for the Committee to discuss. We should discuss and debate the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> You took the words out of my mouth, Mrs. Winterton. It is not for the Committee to advise the Labour party on the person it employs to promote employment. I simply observe the paradox that the man has halved his work force. However, I believe that it was in order to give an example and question whether the clause would affect a specific company's scheme.
<P>
If we pass legislation that goes rather wide, collateral damage can occur. We await clarification, but if the BP scheme is affected, poor Lord Simon might be able to sell his shares. He cannot do that under the current terms of the avoidance scheme. If he could sell his shares, he might be in a completely different position, although that would solve the problem of an apparent conflict of interest in his Department. However, mindful of your injunction not to pursue that matter further, Mrs. Winterton, I shall return to examining why the clause appears to go too wide.
<P>
Ever helpful, the notes on clauses refer to the payment of tax credits by investing in UK equities. Therefore, it is clear that we are discussing dividend income, not other sorts of income. That is set out in the summary and elaborated in the detailed notes on the subsections of the clause. The anti-avoidance provisions are to prevent the payment of tax credits under specific arrangements. In that case, why does the clause refer to payments in general, not to dividend income? Proposed new section 687A(1)(a) states that the clause applies when
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``trustees make a payment to a company''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The word, ``payment'' is repeated throughout the clause.
<P>
Payments can mean many things apart from dividend income, so entirely innocent transactions, not entered into for the purpose of avoiding tax or obtaining the payment of tax credits, could, as I have outlined, be affected. Many types of income, under many types of arrangement, are legal and not entered into with the motive of tax reduction. Will the Minister explain why the clause has been widened and why the provision has not been confined to dealing with dividend income, which is clearly dealt with in the summary relating to the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The clause is yet another consequential change resulting from the abolition of tax credits. It is a foreseen consequence of that tax change, as opposed to the unforeseen consequences that we have discussed on other occasions. It is astonishing that one provision can produce so many consequences for the whole gamut of instruments and vehicles employed for savings and investments. It creates an edifice of anti-avoidance legislation that would not have been necessary but for the initial change.
<P>
The law must now be changed as a direct result of the potential for abuse arising from the provision in question. Because the Government abolished the repayment of tax credits on dividends, they have had to prepare a huge array of anti-avoidance provisions; they have created the necessity for clause upon clause to avoid potential loopholes.
<P>
I refer hon. Members to paragraph 12 of the notes on clause 27, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Very few companies, other than charitable companies, currently receive payments from trustees within section 687. So the prime effect of the clause is to prevent future abuse.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was no abuse. The clause is not intended to stop avoidance that has been taking place, but to prevent abuse that might result from the passing of clauses 19 and 20. The Budget is creating a problem and the Government are trying to deal with that.
<P>
In what way is the clause an improvement in the corporation tax regime? We have heard from the Economic Secretary that it is one of the Government's aims to sort out the great problems of the corporate tax system, whereas in fact the problems in that system are being created by the Finance Bill. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) has often made the point that the greater the distance between a tax and an individual taxpayer, the greater the repercussions. The effect ripples down and expands. Abolishing the tax credit repayment for dividends has meant huge repercussions for pension funds, which have resulted in further repercussions for companies that must make pension contributions into those funds. The repercussions for local government are also colossal--money must be found to meet the deficits in pension funds, without there being any way of increasing taxes or spending. There are huge repercussions for authorised unit trusts, for Lloyd's, as we discussed yesterday, for life assurance companies and for friendly societies, and now clause 27 will create such repercussions for discretionary trusts. That is totally unnecessary. None of the relevant clauses would have been required, but for the Government's actions.
<P>
The problem created by clause 27 results from lack of consultation. Why did not the Government take time between the Budget and scrutiny of the measure? As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) pointed out, the provisions go far wider than is necessary because of the haste with which they were drawn up. I refer right hon. and hon. Members to the representation on the clause made by the Institute of Directors, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It goes far wider than necessary and may disrupt existing arrangements which are not motivated by tax avoidance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The question that I and the institute of Directors want to ask the Paymaster General or, indeed, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury is why the provision was not limited to dividend income instead of applying to the gamut of payments by discretionary trusts. The clause is intended to be an anti-avoidance clause to deal with potential abuses arising from the abolition of tax credits on dividends, so why was it not worded to deal solely with dividends? The badly worded clause will create bad legislation. It is a result of too much haste and too little consultation.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> The clause amends the treatment of payments made to companies by trustees. The purpose is to prevent avoidance by companies trying to get round the abolition of payable tax credits under clause 20. From Budget day, certain payments will not be chargeable to corporation tax, nor will companies be able to claim repayment or set-off for the income tax deducted from such payment. This will prevent companies from obtaining via trusts, which is the point of the clause, payment of tax credits to which they would not be entitled if they invested directly in UK equities.
<P>
Opposition Members have raised two or three specific points. I shall deal first with the question regarding Lord Simon. The clause is concerned with companies that may benefit from trusts and not with individuals, whether Lord Simon or anyone else, so the case does not arise. Yet again there may be some confusion in the Opposition's mind between companies and individuals and companies and shareholders. Certainly the clause defines companies and applies to companies.
<P>
If Opposition Members, who for the first time have some specific points, feel strongly on this matter, I should be open to them coming forward with specific cases. It is true that we are dealing here with, by any definition, very few cases. Indeed, the Revenue is not aware of any cases. The Government cannot accept that there can be avoidance if it is not too blatant or too persistent. Those were the words of the right hon. Member for Wells, who said that we must be against avoidance that is too blatant or too persistent. There are no half measures in these matters. We must take a firm stand. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) is right to say that companies could use trusts to avoid the provisions of clause 20, which puts an end to payable tax benefits. No member of the Committee would deny that the possibility exists and, if it does, we must legislate to prevent it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is right; the clause is a preventive measure against such an abuse arising. It does not exist at present and it is, indeed, a consequence of clause 20, which was introduced to stop payable tax benefits. Therefore, there is no way round it. We intend to stick with the clause. We are conscious that there is some pressure from the Opposition on the clause. I therefore say to them openly and in a spirit of willingness that if they can give us the details of specific problems, we shall consider them. To our knowledge, no companies are affected yet, but the opening exists for companies to develop the use of trusts into a potential loophole. We therefore think it better to cut off that loophole at the beginning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is the Paymaster General aware that the industry is highly concerned about the complexity of the British tax code? The previous Government's aim was to start the tax simplification project; the clause, rather than extending that project, creates a plethora of new anti-avoidance laws because of the complex way in which the Government have decided to abolish just the tax repayment element of the tax credit. It seems absurd that in this day and age, the Government are creating a range of anti-avoidance provisions and further complicating our tax system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am pleased to share some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns. Personally, I believe that it is in the interests of all parties--the Inland Revenue, the Government and the taxpayer--for the Government, in so far as they can, to simplify tax matters. That is a bit like the holy grail; no one has found it and and often the more one attempts to do so, the worse it gets. Having been assigned these clauses, I am, on the whole, mildly reassured that there are not as many of them as I had half expected. I hope that when, as in this case, the clause is a preventive measure which will stop something happening in the future, it will commend itself to the Committee. I hope that if it is respected by the industry--I note that the representations from the Institute of Directors and others are muted on the subject--given that it does not create a new body of taxation, and if, in itself, it is a preventive clause, the Committee will accept it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 27 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Arrangements to pass on value of tax credit</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 21, line 23, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(13) On an application by any taxpayer, the Inland Revenue shall provide advice and, if appropriate, pre-transaction clearance for any prospective arrangement under this section.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, this is an anti-avoidance clause. I shall not repeat my general observations about the need for such measures in some cases. The clause must be extremely carefully focused and unambiguous so that it does not hit people who are compliant and have no intention of ordering their affairs to avoid tax as a primary motive or to an extent that might catch the Treasury's eye, ever-vigilant as it is to protect its revenue.
<P>
Clause 28 goes too wide. I refer especially to proposed subsection (6) which imports a motive test into avoidance. That is always a controversial area; it means only that the tax authorities are to judge whether someone enters into an arrangement to avoid tax or not. It is a principle of English law that we do not usually attempt to judge motives, but to gauge effects. We look at the literal clauses and at how the wording affects actual arrangements.
<P>
My problem is compounded because proposed subsection (6) is extremely vague. The clause generally--it is outlined in the summary--seeks to restrict or disallow certain transactions if at least one of the parties entered into them for an unallowable purpose. An ``unallowable purpose'' is broadly one that is not commercial so a shareholder might have to show that receiving shares under an arrangement was for a commercial purpose unless the distributing company was getting rid of some of its shares unconnected with its main activities for a commercial purpose. However, it is possible that the company holding some shares as an investment unconnected with its main operations may decide to distribute them to shareholders. That is not a commercial purpose, therefore the shareholder would have to show that he or she had received such shares for a commercial purpose. That may be difficult to show because most shareholders take only a fleeting or incidental interest in the companies in which they invest. If a shareholder receives shares it would be difficult to show that he has a commercial motive. More than that, the recipient may not even be a shareholder, but a nominee. How can a nominee receive such shares as part of a commercial purpose? I understand the reasoning behind the clause, but it is much too vague and general. I should like the Minister to prove to me that an individual or nominee can, in all the circumstances, be shown to the satisfaction of the tax authorities to have the required commercial purposes. If he has not, he could be said to be entering into an arrangement for an unallowed purpose and be caught by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I share the concerns of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells about the clause. They are best illustrated by the change of wording between the explanatory notes on clauses from the Revenue and the actual wording of the most offensive subsection, the proposed subsection (6). The Revenue's notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The arrangements are only covered by the restriction if at least one of the parties enters into them for an unallowed purpose. Broadly, that means a purpose other than a business or commercial purpose.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not give the full flavour of the proposed subsection (6), which mentions arrangements that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``include a purpose which is not amongst the business or other commercial purposes of that person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The subsection as drafted puts too great an onus on one of the parties engaged in such an arrangement, who is almost being asked to prove a negative. It therefore gives too much power to the Revenue, and, eventually, presumably the courts, to interpret an allowable purpose under the clause.
<P>
Clearly, some classes of people may change their business or commercial purposes and may legitimately want to re-order their affairs, so that some such arrangement which would otherwise be covered by the clause could be regarded as part of a genuine business purpose. But wider classes of people would find it extremely difficult to prove that they have a commercial purpose, and specifically a commercial purpose as covered by the proposed subsection (6)--an existing commercial purpose.
<P>
An obvious group who would be badly hit by the proposal would be nominees, who may have a set of commercial purposes, but not purposes covered by the clause. The same applies to individuals: if the Revenue were minded to play hardball with the clause, it would be possible at least to argue that no individual or no nominee can have a commercial purpose as such, and that therefore any such arrangement would be caught by the clause.
<P>
I phrase my comments in a slightly questioning tone because I am genuinely unsure about how widely the Government wish the clause to be drawn. Is it to be an all-embracing anti-avoidance clause that will catch almost any such arrangement, or is it meant to be properly targeted at those who effectively try to fiddle the system? The drafting does not make clear which way the proposal will fall. Therefore, with perhaps unjustified cynicism, may I say that if allowed to stand as currently phrased, in practice it would be too widely drawn and a number of innocent parties would be caught by the clause for the entirely legitimate arrangement of their tax affairs. I seek reassurance from the Paymaster General that the clause can be interpreted narrowly so that innocent parties will not be caught by the current wording.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 28 is effectively the general anti-avoidance provision regarding the abolition of repayment of tax credits on dividends. Like all general anti-avoidance provisions, it is too widely drawn. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green), I refer to proposed subsection (6), which relates to the sole or main motive for entering into certain transactions. That test is often used in tax legislation, and the motive behind that wording is to detect whether the primary purpose of entering into a commercial activity was to avoid tax, rather than the avoidance of tax being simply a beneficial side-effect of the activity. The provision seeks to outlaw those instances where the sole or main benefit of entering into a transaction is to gain a tax advantage.
<P>
The problem with the clause is that the definition of tax advantage, which we can find in proposed subsection (12), refers to chapter I of part XVII of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which defines tax advantage according to the dreadful provisions of section 709 of that Act. Those sections are anathema to industry and the tax profession because they are the nearest thing in tax legislation to a general anti-avoidance provision. Despite the fact that that provision applies only to interests in securities or shares, it causes huge alarm to companies when they are about to undertake any corporate reconstruction such as acquisition, disposal or merger.
<P>
The provision is so vaguely drawn, as is any general anti-avoidance clause, that companies are forced to seek clearance under sections 703 and 709 whenever they undertake any major transaction in securities. There are 30 days in which the Revenue is required to respond to such a clearance. The measure adds a cumbersome element to any dynamic activity by companies. They have to set out for the Government full details of their transactions and then wait so many days before they receive a response. The whole effort can hamper many worthwhile plans that companies have for expansion, acquisition or merger. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the clause refers for the definition of tax advantage to those cumbersome provisions in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
<P>
I am also alarmed that the Government stated in the Budget statement that they are considering bringing in a general anti-avoidance provision. Here we almost have such a provision regarding tax credit. It would be a disaster if the Government were to take the tempting route of introducing a general anti-avoidance provision. It would give too much power to the Inland Revenue and there would be too much resulting uncertainty in tax affairs. It would be cumbersome and would result in a plethora of litigation in the courts as taxpayers sought to clarify the law. I urge the Government--as, I suspect, will industry generally--not to introduce a general anti-avoidance provision.
<P>
Proposed subsection (6) comes in for severe criticism from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, of which I happen to be a member. Its representation says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subclause 6 is vague and it is very difficult to know what it will exempt.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Given the broad interpretation placed by the courts on the term `arrangement' we feel that a clearance procedure is needed so that taxpayers can know whether they have entered into arrangements for an `allowable purpose'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I therefore support the amendment in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. There should be a clearance procedure for what are clearly general anti-avoidance provisions. All such procedures are cumbersome, but there cannot be a general anti-avoidance procedure without a clearance procedure. The institute of Directors is equally scathing about the clause. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This clause is too widely drawn. Clause 28 could apply to deny tax credit repayments when some tax advantage unrelated to tax credit repayment is a main purpose of the arrangements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause is a general anti-avoidance measure, albeit focused on tax credits. It is cumbersome, unfair and will create enormous uncertainty in the law as people will be unsure whether their particular transaction is caught by the Bill. General anti-avoidance legislation would not have been necessary had the Government not abolished tax credit payments in such a way. Altogether, it complicates and further inconveniences the commercial world. Without a clearance procedure, the provisions are unworkable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> For the convenience of the Committee, perhaps I should take points in reverse order.
<P>
I heard what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said about a general anti-avoidance clause. It would need careful thought--my right hon. Friend the Chancellor referred to the matter in the Budget speech--but representations from the hon. Gentleman, who is closely involved in such matters and has links with various interested bodies, would be welcome.
<P>
It may help the hon. Gentleman and the Committee if I go from proposed subsection (12) to what he called the dreadful general anti-avoidance provisions in the 1988 Act. I hate to tell him that certain Opposition Front-Benchers winced at his denunciation of them. Having carried through various mergers and acquisitions in the private sector, I have sympathy for some of what he said. I know that one has to go through the clearance procedures of the Inland Revenue. All I can tell him--I experienced this before I expected to represent or defend the Inland Revenue from the Government Front Bench--is that the Inland Revenue was anxious to help. I found it a very professional organisation.
<P>
Problems arise when the borderline at which some individuals and companies trade is reached. This is the point of the clause: the Revenue rightly likes to have in place such arrangements as we are discussing to deal with them. I can assure the right hon. Member for Wells and the hon. Members for Ashford and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that innocent parties, particularly individuals, will not be caught by the scheme--we are not seeking to catch people. The hon. Member for Ashford emphasised the point, but the question will arise only if individuals enter into collusive tax avoidance arrangements with others.
<P>
It is no good creating problems that do not exist. Those who carry on normal business correctly--shareholders and others and nominee shareholders in particular, to whom the right hon. Member for Wells referred--have nothing to fear. Only those who enter artificial tax-driven arrangements of the sort that we have clearly defined need worry. Four clear conditions, which are laid down in the clause and to which no Opposition Member paid any attention, must be fulfilled.
<P>
The amendment has all the appearance of reasonableness, but, I regret to tell the Opposition, we shall resist it. The amendment would be a further, unnecessary burden on the Inland Revenue. We are debating the amendment, but is it in order--you, Mrs. Winterton, will rapidly correct me if it is not--to mention one or two matters about the clause, or will we have a clause stand part debate later?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If the Committee is happy, we have had a fairly broad debate thus far and there may be no need for a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Opposition Members will recall that we dealt with precisely the same points in last year's Committee considering the Finance Bill--in paragraph 13 of schedule 9 on loan relationships. Last year, of course, Opposition Members were at the centre rather than bystanders and observers of the controversy. The Institute of Directors and the British Bankers Association were heavily involved. The then Economic Secretary, now succeeded by my hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell), held firm against the recommendations, which were precisely the sort set out in the amendment. Any party seriously wanting a difficult point clarified can contact the Inland Revenue, but an obligation should not be pressed on it as suggested in the amendment.
<P>
We have already been contacted by one tax expert who told us that our proposal is necessary and he was considering a scheme to avoid the problem of dealing with the purposes posed by paragraph 20 in particular, so on those grounds I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That helps to illustrate the Paymaster General's reassuring attitudes. His words in Committee, however, do not have the force of law, and we must consider what may happen to innocent taxpayers in years to come when the Revenue and the courts will consider the wording of the clause rather than the reassurance given.
<P>
We know that anti-avoidance clauses are, in the Paymaster General's words, artificial tax-driven arrangements to deal with the circumstances in which the individuals collude for the purpose of tax avoidance. If we were satisfied that the clause would hit them and only them, there would be no need for the amendment. However, nothing that the Paymaster General said was much help to me or to my hon. Friends in answering the points that we raised.
<P>
Under the clause, the Inland Revenue could say that a scheme should be disallowed on the ground that it was not commercially driven. The luckless taxpayer could say that that was difficult to prove. He could be an individual shareholder whose arrangements were made by tax advisers. He may have no commercial purpose or commercial arrangement with a particular company other than being a shareholder. That is the case when such a person is only a nominee but really just an intermediary. It is difficult to defend a clause that could impose a test on a future taxpayer that it would be almost impossible to pass.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford pointed out that proposed subsection (8) uses the phrase ``tax advantage'' by reference to what he called the infamous section 709(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988--of happy memory. A taxpayer could be ensnared by the refusal of the tax authorities to repay tax credit, yet the arrangement of which he is part has no reference to tax credit repayments. It could be purely incidental--in other words, the arrangement into which he has entered could have nothing to do with gaining tax credit repayments and could have another purpose. Nevertheless, the net could ensnare him. That is exactly what we meant when we introduced the amendment by saying that we all understood that there was a need for focused anti-avoidance measures but not if the net was thrown too wide. It is always to the Government's convenience to throw the net wide, but if it goes too wide it ensnares innocent people.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
For that reason, we shall not vote against the clause and we are not saying that the thinking behind it is invalid. Paticipants in schemes, or people who might be hit in the way that I have described, should, however, be able to test their arrangements with the Inland Revenue before entering into them. A pre-clearance procedure would be only equitable in the circumstances. People would then know that anything that they did innocently and without intending to avoid tax could be cleared in advance by the Inland Revenue. I know that the Inland Revenue is helpful in several respects. I should, however, like it to be written into the Bill that the service that I have described is available to taxpayers. Otherwise, they may be caught as a result of the clause. With that in mind, we shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I shall make a few brief points on the clause, which forms part of the clutch of anti-avoidance measures. We have already debated the principle and the Government's approach to it, so I do not intend to add to what has already been said.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggested, however, the proposals have been put together in an extraordinary way. As a by-product of that, the clause is the first to rehearse the concept of foreign income dividends by saying, in effect, that where a qualifying distribution
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is made on or after 2nd July 1997 but before 6th April 1999 by a company resident in the United Kingdom''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it should be treated as a foreign income dividend for the purpose of this clause. I am not sure how many companies resident in the United Kingdom would be pleased that it was so treated when it clearly was not, or need not necessarily be, a foreign income dividend. That is an instance of the way in which the concepts are put together adds to the complexity.
<P>
I have been trying to carve through the complexity and through the much clearer explanatory notes from the Inland Revenue, and should like to ask the Paymaster General three points. The first arises from the representations made to the Economic Secretary by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds about the importance of the impact of this clutch of changes on the association. It makes the point that there is a growing interest in the use by pension funds of authorised unit trusts as well as unauthorised ones. We are not here to determine the decisions of pension fund trustees. However, I am anxious to elicit from the Paymaster General confirmation that the clause will neutralise the position for that decision. In other words, will the pension funds that invest in unauthorised unit trusts be in the same position as they would be investing in authorised unit trusts during that period? As I understand it, the clause is necessary to prevent them from avoiding the gap before April 1999, when they might otherwise have used unauthorised unit trusts. It would also be fair to say as a rider that those who invest in them will be in substantially the same position as people paying the basic rate from 1999, as they will get credit. Perhaps the Paymaster General could comment on that, although I am mainly concerned that there should be a level playing field for the different types of unit trust.
<P>
There are two other small points. As has already been discussed in Committee--and will probably be discussed again when we reach clause 35--the Government are providing a wind-down regime for charity credits. They are also in the clause providing a special regime for common court investment funds. There is no proposal of which I am aware--unless I have simply overlooked it--for a wind-down procedure for common court investment funds. We would like to know whether they are to be treated on the same basis.
<P>
The final point on which I ask the Paymaster General to comment is the position of overseas investors in relation to this clause. I am not an expert on double tax treaties. I think that the effects of paying the amount as a foreign income dividend is that they do not get any credit. Equally, they may or may not attract an assessment to tax in their country of residence. I am not clear whether the way that that is being done is fair to them in most cases or, conversely, is unfair to the United Kingdom taxpayer in comparison.
<P>
I should have said, to conclude on a point of fact, that when I spoke about the need to equalise the effective de facto treatment between authorised and unauthorised unit trusts, I wanted the Paymaster General to talk about persons. However, I think that we are really considering the position of non-taxpaying persons rather than persons paying tax at the basic rate, because the tax credit would interact, although for all but the higher rate taxpayer the amount would be the same after 1999.
<P>
There is no objection on Conservative Benches to the concept of the clause. I am simply anxious that, as part of our scrutiny of it, the Paymaster General should respond to our points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I can go to the heart of the matter. The hon. Gentleman has raised the central issue, and I am pleased to confirm that the abolition of payable tax credit for pension funds invested in unauthorised unit trusts applies equally to authorised unit trusts. So there is a level playing field.
<P>
I am equally pleased to tell the hon. Gentleman that we are considering the points relating to charities. As he knows, we have agreed to widen the consultation. On the related point, the mere fact that we have given not just the two years total exemption, but a further five years--two years more than has been seen before--gives them a long time to adjust. The run-down regime is still a matter for consultation with them.
<P>
We must make it clear that the compensation for court investment funds is through public expenditure and applies only to charities.
<P>
I am not sure about the relationship of the clause to foreign income dividends, but there is a long debate to come on FIDs, in which I am sure there will be more interest--at least, I hope so--than there has been in the discussions on the three anti-avoidance clauses, the sad necessity for which I think all members of the Committee accept. I commend clause 29 to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Tax credits</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In rather the same vein and at much the same length, I have one or two questions for the Economic Secretary on clause 30.
<P>
She will probably think that my first question is consistent with my interest--I hope that it is not an obsession--with matters typographical, as was seen in my query about the spelling of ``benefited'' in clause 2. I was advised that I could not table an amendment on the matter, because it formed part of the Bill's framework.
<P>
Perhaps the Committee will allow me to indulge myself slightly and so give us a moment of relaxation from heavy tax matters. I want to raise a typo matter, but also two more substantive points. The clause heading, which is in italics and therefore, I believe, technically part of the framework of the Bill, refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Distributions, tax credits etc. in and after 1999-00''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which introduces the different notion of where we are going to be in two years' time. With regard to FIDs, we do not know where we will be, but I shall not anticipate that.
<P>
My point is that on a normal reading of such legislative text, the century to which the second year refers is conventionally given by the first two digits of the first year. As a layman, I would want to read the clause heading as the shortened form of 1999-1900. Some of my hon. Friends might well think that the Labour party is indicating a desire to go from being new Labour back to Keir Hardie's Labour party, which the Economic Secretary mentioned.
<P>
We may be going back to 1900 sooner or later, but we should not be doing so in the Bill. It may sound a trivial point, but it is also a matter of style, which can be seen more extensively in the Red Book. For example, its medium-term economic projections refer to that mysterious year 1999-00 and then to 2000-01.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend referred to this issue as giving us a moment of relaxation, but there is a serious point underlying it.
<P>
The private sector--and, indeed, much of the state sector--is spending hundreds of millions of pounds on computer software programmers to reprogramme their computers to avoid the catastrophe that could occur within the banking and insurance industries, as well as other industries that are driven by computers, such as the airlines. The private sector is spending millions of pounds on remedying the effect of the millennium, and yet in the Bill the Government are setting a bad example to private industry regarding the effect of the millennium on computers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As so often, my hon. Friend anticipates me most perceptively. My first point, which I need not belabour, simply concerned style. Secondly, the Opposition are concerned that the public sector, the Government, the Treasury and the Revenue should not create any difficulty for the private sector in relation to the millenium. We want not only a definition of the year but assurances from the Economic Secretary that there will be a smooth transition and no hitches or difficulties for the taxpayer. Thirdly, would the Economic Secretary explain a little more the Government's thinking about the reversion to a spring Finance Bill and the possibility of a short tax year to catch up and tidy the whole thing up for the future. I would be grateful for any further information that she can share with the Committee on that.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn now to other points in the clause and I hope that the Committee will not feel, particularly after the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, that they are in any sense flippant or unimportant. It is important to get this right and address it in a businesslike way. My second substantive point relates to the impact of the clause, particularly on nil-taxpaying personal taxpayers. They are people who have shares, perhaps as a result of privatisations or, I suspect, more typically, elderly persons who have been left them by their husbands. At present they can claim tax credits against their personal allowances and get the benefit back. Some of these people may be quite poorly off.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has provided us with the example of a widow aged 80 with a state pension and net dividends of &#163;1,600. Those are not great riches, of course, and are not far above the level at which capital withdrawal would take place for income support and other benefits. Under the old arrangements she would have a pension of &#163;3,247, dividends of &#163;1,600 and a tax repayment of &#163;400. Under the new arrangements which will take effect from 5th April 1999, she would not have any repayments at all. Even if she got the 10 per cent. credit back she would still be &#163;222.23 worse off. The institute states that the effect is harsh and likely to encourage such people to dispose of their shares. The Economic Secretary should comment on that.
<P>
My final point concerns overseas holders and is somewhat analogous to the point that I raised with the Paymaster General on the previous clause. The notes on clauses concede that there will still be a category of shareholders who may obtain payments for tax credits. Frankly the reason for this, although it is perhaps not made quite explicit even in the notes explaining the clause, is that under some United Kingdom double tax agreements specific provision is made for tax credits to be paid to shareholders resident in the other country. In other words, if we were to abandon the payable element of the tax credit we would be in breach of those agreements. They would unravel and require renegotiation which might not be in the interests of the United Kingdom or its property holders.
<P>
The Government seek to get out of that by saying that it is a sophisticated variation of the chambermaid's baby argument: only a proportion of the tax credit is normally repayable, which I accept, and the effect of the reduction of the rate of credit is that the amount of tax credit paid will normally be nil or very small, typically only one quarter of 1 per cent. Frankly I am not sufficiently skilled to be able to do the figures for myself. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton may be able to assist me here. I am not sure that that is wholly plausible but if it is really the case it amounts, de facto, to a breach of faith with the double tax agreements. The Government can either say that they are continuing to honour them and repaying the tax credits as they had undertaken to do in their agreement or they can say that they do not amount to a row of beans and it is not worth reclaiming them anyway. They cannot argue both simultaneously.
<P>
Consciously playing both ends against the middle, I am a little uneasy about the extent to which payable credit is still available to overseas shareholders who--we remember the exchanges yesterday--account for about 10 per cent. of the assets and income in the frame for the new regime for payable tax credits. If it is still available to those shareholders, not to make it available to the widow I cited or to others in real difficulty in the UK creates a counterbalancing inequity.
<P>
I should like the Economic Secretary to respond on the more mechanistic points that Opposition Members have made about the millennium date; I am concerned about the withdrawal of payable credits for those with incomes below the personal allowance level, especially where they are unable to go into individual savings accounts, or whatever it may be, to make provision for the future when they are coming towards the end of their days; and I am slightly uneasy about the interplay with the overseas holders. I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary could respond to those points.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> My worries about the clause start a stage further back in principle than those of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), because its philosophical base is unsound. As I understand it, the clause is intended to avoid a distortion in the system whereby those who are exempt from tax can at present receive payment of a tax credit. Therefore, the effective tax rate on profits paid out by a company can be lower than it would be, as the Revenue guidance notes say, if those profits were retained by the company and reinvested. As I have said on previous clauses, there is evidence to contradict the proposition that using the tax system to encourage companies to retain and reinvest their profits benefits those companies and therefore the wider economy.
<P>
As my hon. Friend has said, it is a clause that disadvantages classes of taxpayer, and possibly the bulk of those who will be disadvantaged by this change are the elderly who wish to invest in equities. At the same time the clause does not achieve anything on the other side. The removal of this so-called distortion will not promote the reinvestment and use of research and development by which the Government set such store. We discussed yesterday the City university business school report, whose clear findings are that the companies which are likely to pay out dividends and which will thus be attractive to shareholders who would be attacked by the removal of the tax credit are those most likely to engage in large amounts of research and development. Therefore, the idea that there is a dichotomy between high dividend payments and attraction to shareholders on the one side and reinvestment and use of research and development on the other is false.
<P>
I agree that the proposition is superficially attractive. It is thought that companies must be able to spend their money in one way or another and that therefore, if they are concentrating too much on dividend payments, they cannot be concentrating enough on research and development and reinvestment. But that is not true, as a moment's thought will show. It is likely that successful companies will be those which have a great deal of R and D and a long-term strategy. It is also likely that successful companies which think about the long term will, over time, be those companies which treat their shareholders best and pay dividends.
<P>
This is yet another clause that is driven by false analysis and, in the end, by dogma. As my hon. Friend said, the vast majority of victims of the clause are likely to be elderly shareholders and not, by any stretch of the definition, fat cats. They will be the small investors whom the Government want to attract into equity investment to provide a wider savings base and increase the savings ratio.
<P>
One of the better examples of weasel words appears in the guidance notes to the clause. The notes claim that individuals who are discouraged by the clause from investing in equities will be able to switch to tax-favoured individual savings accounts in 1999. It has already been said on the Floor of the House that those individual savings accounts represent some of the least attractive pigs in pokes ever presented by a Government. They will take over the role of TESSAs and PEPs, probably with less-favoured tax treatment. The Government have been unable to reassure us that individual savings accounts will have the same tax privileges as TESSAs and PEPs.
<P>
Individual savings accounts will also be the repositories of money that is taken out of direct equity investment as a result of the removal of tax credits for which the clause provides. If that is the deal that the Government offer the millions of elderly people who have shares and who benefit from the tax credits that the clause covers, the Economic Secretary will be extremely unpopular, unless the individual savings accounts are much more attractive than the Government have hitherto suggested. I suspect that if they were as attractive as TESSAs and PEPs, the Government would not hesitate to tell us. People will be worse off because of the clause.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry drew attention to a peculiarity: because of double taxation agreements, some people who are resident overseas will benefit from the clause. That is bizarre. I hope that the Economic Secretary can confirm whether elderly residents in this country will not be able to benefit whereas elderly people who are rich enough to live abroad will be able to do so. That is a bizarre distortion of the tax system that the Government cannot seriously intend. Perhaps they have friends who live in Tuscany and who will benefit from the clause when they reach their declining years. It is a shame that the Paymaster General is absent and thus cannot provide his expert insight into that.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that the Paymaster General was reaching his declining years. He is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was careful to say, ``when they reach their declining years''. It is obvious that the Paymaster General is in the full flush of life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise, in case there is any suspicion of discourtesy, to confirm that the official view of Her Majesty's Opposition is that the Paymaster General is in very good shape, at least physically.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that the provision is yet another example of the Budget's consequences--I am sure that they are unintended--that can be encapsulated in the phrase, ``tenderness in Tuscany, blight in Bognor''?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If I could think of a word that assonated with Ashford in the next three seconds, I would add it to the phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Aggravation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Very good. Aggravation in Ashford. I thank my hon. Friend for that poetic intervention.
<P>
One can only assume that some of the measure's effects are inadvertent. I cannot believe that someone deliberately devised a clause to favour overseas residents over people who live in this country. It beggars belief that the effect is intentional. Therefore, yet another clause has been cobbled together in haste; its details have not been worked out properly. To rectify that, it will have to be tackled again in future Finance Bills, or possibly on Report, if the Government do not want to change it now. One can only shake one's head in disbelief at the number of clauses in the Bill, where relatively cursory examination--which is all that the Committee is able to do, given the speed with which the Bill is being rammed through--reveals some glaring loopholes. I hope that the Economic Secretary can reassure us about these matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The speeches of the hon. Members for Daventry and for Ashford confirm that my diligent reading of the notes on clauses has not been in vain, although as a non-tax expert I sometimes found the notes on clauses as impenetrable as the Bill itself.
<P>
The notes on clauses clearly suggest that subsections (5) to (8) of clause 30 will penalise non-taxpayers, and create social injustices. Labour Members may be surprised to learn that. It will mean that non-taxpaying pensioners--possibly on incomes as low as &#163;5,000 for single people and &#163;10,000 for married people--will lose out.
<P>
The issue affects women, who have not paid enough contributions to enjoy a full state pension; they may use the meagre dividends from some inherited shares to top up their income, enabling them to have a decent standard of living. That standard of living will be reduced by the clause. I urge Ministers and Labour Members to consider that before they assent to a clause that would penalise people who are on the breadline. I am sure that is not the intention. I agree with the hon. Member for Ashford that the Bill was cobbled together too quickly, and that this led to mistakes.
<P>
It may be argued that few people will be affected by the changes proposed in subsections (5) to (8). However, there will be major effects for a small number of individuals, who will have a large amount of their small incomes taken away from them on the widow's mite principle. The number of such cases would be low, and Ministers should consider returning to the issue on Report to remove at least part of the clause--I would highlight subsections (5) to (8)--as the costs to the Exchequer would be minimal. I am sure that Treasury officials could confirm that.
<P>
The Government and the draftsmen of clauses 30 to 31 have gone to some trouble to ensure that there is no increase in the tax burden for higher-rate taxpayers, especially with the introduction of new marginal tax rates in clause 31. It is absurd that a party that advocates the cause of those on lower incomes should spend so much time ensuring the protection of the better off in our society. That is the effect of clauses 30 and 31, and I find it worrying, although I am sure that that was not the intention of Ministers.
<P>
The notes on clauses say that there would be distortion in the system if non-taxpayers continued to receive the tax credit; that is nonsense. It is ludicrous to suggest that companies would change their dividend policy and pay our more dividends because a few non-taxpayers were permitted to receive a tax credit. That is not the way to formulate tax policy. The notes on clauses point out that when the tax credit system is phased out, there will be individual savings accounts, and that people will be tax exempt because they will put their shares into such accounts. That statement defies reality. It is ludicrous to argue that the elderly or people on low incomes will listen to the Chancellor's statement next year, or the year after, and decide suddenly to open an individual savings account and move their shares into it either to avoid extra tax or because they are no longer entitled to a tax repayment.
<P>
Anyone familiar with savers knows that their behaviour is characterised by inertia--I suspect that this is particularly so among the group that we are discussing. People do not change bank accounts, mortgages or pension funds regularly. To suggest that individual savings accounts are a defence with which the elderly and those on low incomes will be able to protect themselves is nonsensical, and does not address the real world.
<P>
The real reason the Inland Revenue has not taken due account of those who will be hit by subsections (5) to (8) is to do with administrative ease. It does not want trouble.
<P>
The composite rate of tax is a good parallel. It was rightly ended by the previous Government, under pressure from the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats. The composite rate of tax applied to building society and bank accounts. It was charged at slightly below the basic rate of tax, to take account of charging non-taxpayers non-reclaimable tax on their building society and bank account savings. Overall, therefore, taxpayers were charged a lower amount of tax--the composite rate-on their building society and bank savings. That was absurd, as non-taxpayers were subsidising taxpayers. The previous Government rightly ended that.
<P>
The composite tax was introduced for administrative ease. Inland Revenue officials defended the composite rate for many years, as they did not want administrative problems. In opposition, the Labour party supported the previous Government in getting rid of the composite rate tax, and argued that the state should gladly take on the extra administrative burden to ensure that the extra money went to those on the lowest incomes.
<P>
I urge Ministers to take on the extra administrative complexity required to protect those on low incomes from the clause and to be consistent with their position on composite rate tax before the election.
<P>
I ask all Labour Members to search their consciences. I presume that they stood for the Labour party because they were concerned with social justice. If they accept the clause, they will do a major social injustice.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause exposes the inherent contradiction in the Government's decision to abolish tax credits in respect of repayments while not abolishing the credits available to tax-paying entities or people.
<P>
The Government seem to claim that tax credit payment is a distortion in the system, whereas allowing taxpayers to continue to receive credits--although it is not actually being paid in cash--is not. I do not want either of those elements of the imputation system to be abolished. The Government seem to lack the understanding that re-paying tax credit is merely the symmetrical part of the imputation system which stops the double taxation of companies' profits when entities and people receive dividends.
<P>
It is wrong to claim that there was a distortion in the system and that the tax credits received by pension funds were a subsidy to the pension fund industry--they were and are not. They are a part of the imputation system that avoids the double taxation of companies' profits. Removing the aspect of the system that concerns the repayment of the tax credit will destroy the symmetrical basis of the imputation system. The Government have created a distortion in the imputation system. Pension funds will no longer receive a tax credit; they will be doubly taxed on a company's profits. PEPs will receive a tax credit, but non-taxpaying individuals will not. Basic or higher rate taxpayers will receive a tax credit. Dividends received by UK companies from other UK companies will remain untaxable, so, effectively, those companies will receive a tax credit.
<P>
For overseas investors, the position regarding tax credits is contradictory. They will technically be entitled to a tax credit on dividends received, and, according to paragraph 20 of the explanatory notes to the Bill
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is one specific class of shareholders who will still be able to obtain payment of tax credits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have therefore added another distortion to their own distorted version of the imputation system: they have removed the repayment of tax credits for everyone except the overseas shareholder. Under the Bill, however, overseas shareholders are not entitled to the repayment of the tax credit on a de facto basis.
<P>
Britain's tax agreements are the envy of the world. We have the most double tax agreements, because we are a trading nation. We encourage investment in this country, and we encourage our entrepreneurs to invest abroad. Consequently, UK Governments have negotiated a commendable array of double tax treaties. The City of London is such a successful centre of collective investment vehicles partly because the treaties can be used to encourage investment from overseas.
<P>
All the treaties vary, however. Under the United States treaty, the tax credit entitlement of a US corporate investor who owns more than 10 per cent. of the shares in a UK company is calculated by taking half the tax credit available--at present 20 per cent., which would be halved to 10--minus a 5 per cent. withholding. That withholding is 5 per cent. of the net dividend plus half the tax credit. That amount is repaid to the US shareholder out of the dividends that are paid from the UK.
<P>
That creates an advantageous position for US shareholders in UK companies: instead of having an effective tax rate of 33 per cent., they have an effective tax rate of 28 per cent., assuming that the UK company distributes all its dividends, and that it can use all its ACT against its mainstream corporation tax. Given those conditions, a US investor who has shares in a very profitable UK company will pay a much lower rate of tax in the UK than a UK investor, which encourages overseas investment in the UK.
<P>
The Government are removing that incentive in one fell swoop, as halving the credit from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. means there is almost nothing left of the repayment that the US shareholder was previously entitled to under the US-UK double tax treaty. That is from where the figure of, typically, one quarter of 1 per cent. arises.
<P>
The tax credit repayment that used to be paid to overseas investors in UK companies has been effectively reduced to nil, which is enormously damaging to the UK as a centre of overseas investment. It is ironic that these provisions were headed in the Inland Revenue press release as measures to encourage investment by companies as the opposite is true.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other consequence of the clause is that the Government have, effectively, unilaterally altered the terms of the treaties to which I have referred by a measure that has no other effect. When the treaties were negotiated and we agreed to give other countries advantageous tax credits, we presumably did so because we received something in return from those countries. The Government are now, unilaterally, removing a tax advantage from those countries which we had given them in exchange for something. What will those countries do? Chances are that retaliatory measures will be taken against the United Kingdom.
<P>
The Paymaster General assures us that his Department has had discussions with the US Government and that there will be no retaliatory measures, but that assurance relates only to that specific country and concerns the implementation of US domestic tax law as a retaliatory measure. What will happen at the next renegotiation of the US-UK double tax treaty? What will happen throughout the world when foreign Governments wake up to the fact that the UK Government have unilaterally changed the terms of the double tax treaty?
<P>
It is absurd to make a distinction between tax credits that make the payment of tax on dividends unnecessary and tax credits that give rise to a repayment. That point relates to mortgage interest relief at source and medical health insurance. Mortgage interest relief at source enables the beneficiary to receive an income tax deduction for interest payments on a mortgage, but that deduction is included in the calculation of the mortgage payments; smaller mortgage payments are made. That gives non-taxpayers the advantage of tax relief on mortgage payments.
<P>
The same was true for medical insurance for the over 60s, before it was abolished by the Government. Medical insurance tax relief was included in the premiums to the medical insurance companies. Instead of deducting the relevant amount in a tax return, and thus paying less income tax, the individual paid a smaller premium to the health insurance company than he or she would otherwise pay. Again, that enabled non-taxpayers to benefit from tax relief.
<P>
The same used to apply, before the clauses were introduced, to dividends--a non-taxpayer was able to take advantage of dividends having basic rate tax deducted from them before receipt. The shareholder was thus able to benefit from that provision, in the same was as non-taxpayers could benefit from MIRAS and used to be able to benefit from tax relief for health insurance.
<P>
The Government have now removed that benefit for non-taxpayers, but the benefit is still available to taxpayers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry pointed out, the people who will suffer most are those who live in my constituency of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The provision is a blight on Bognor because 36.6 per cent. of the population of Bognor Regis and Littlehampton are pensioners. Nationally, the proportion of pensioners who are non-taxpayers is two thirds. I am not aware of what proportion of the pensioners in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton are non-taxpayers, but I suspect that it is not all that dissimilar from the national average. How will the Government explain to retired people in my constituency that they have taken away an element of their taxable income? Those people do not constitute the most prosperous section of society.
<P>
There is no logic to removing the tax repayment credits for non-taxpaying individuals. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbition (Mr. Davey) pointed out, it is presumably just administrative lethargy that has led to this measure being in the Bill. The clause is the consequence of a rushed and ill-considered Finance Bill. It was not necessary for the Government, in their first Budget, to introduce these sweeping changes to corporate taxation. All that was necessary was to use this Budget to implement their manifesto promises, to which they should have confined the measures in the Bill.
<P>
Another consequence of the clause is the introduction of an enormous complexity into the taxation of individuals. It is a matter than will arise in clauses 31 and 34--to enable basic rate taxpayers and lower rate taxpayers to continue to receive dividends tax free and higher rate taxpayers subject only to a further 20 per cent. tax. Because clause 30 halves the tax credit to 10 per cent., there will have to be an array of hugely complicated tax legislation. It means a higher rate tax of 32.5 per cent. specifically for schedule F income; it means applying a formula of nine tenths before the tax rate is applied to basic and lower rate taxpayers. It is absurdly complicated and it is particularly bad that the Government should introduce such complexities into the taxation system for individuals at a time when they are opening the cellophane of their self-assessment tax returns and struggling to adapt to the regime. In the second year of self assessment they will have to grasp the huge complexities introduced by the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> My hon. Friend has touched on an interesting point. As a result of the Budget, we are almost back to the situation before the measures introduced by the now Lord Lawson. There are now nine different rates for the main income tax. Does my hon. Friend agree that that will make it impossible for many taxpayers to complete their own tax forms under the self-assessment regime, which means that more professional advice will be required?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. The thrust of tax legislation and tax policy in the past few years has been to simplify the tax regime. One element of that, as my hon. Friend said, was the reduction of the number of tax rates to two-40 per cent. and the basic rate. The Conservative Government introduced a new, lower tax. To introduce this plethora of new tax rates and the special formulae that have to be applied to dividend income--different rates of tax for dividend income and schedule F income--makes it very difficult. I have already had letters from elderly people in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton who are struggling with the self-assessment system. The proposal will make it 10 times more complicated and will require people to spend several hundred pounds employing professional tax advisers. In some ways, I regret the fact that I have given up the profession of tax advising as the Government seem to be creating a bonanza for the tax advisory industry.
<P>
I finish by asking the Treasury Ministers three questions: first, can they explain to retired people and other non-tax paying individuals why they are discriminated against in relation to basic and higher rate taxpayers in the taxation treatment of their dividend income? Secondly, how can they explain the discrimination against overseas investors and the unilateral changes that they have effectively implemented to many double tax agreements? Thirdly, can they explain to the millions of people who are required to fill in their own tax returns why they have added huge complications to the taxation of individuals?

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am not attempting to get involved in one-upmanship with my hon. Friend, but I have an even greater number of pensioners in Worthing in my constituency, who, by and large, are of lesser means. To join in the alliterative jamboree, the proposals will cause worry in Worthing and shortfall in Shoreham.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with the personal implications of the loss of advance corporation tax, especially for the elderly and those who rely on dividend income. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry gave some apposite examples of how that target group will suffer heavily because they do not have other forms of saving on which to draw.
<P>
I declare an interest as the director of a company that runs share portfolios especially for less wealthy clients, who rely on that income and tend not to draw on capital, and for those clients whose portfolios are not necessarily large enough to warrant the charges incurred by having PEP schemes and for whom capital gains tax allowances are not a consideration.
<P>
Worried of Worthing, relying on dividend income, will of course be even more worried by the implications of some proposals that we have been discussing in the past few days. His or her problem will be compounded by the rising inflation levels that we are beginning to detect and by the rising utility costs that my hon. Friends and I have argued will be brought about by the windfall tax--this is a matter concerning people who are not on variable incomes-- which will inevitably be passed on to the consumer. The people concerned are worried. Their problem will also be compounded by increases in council tax. Inevitably, the changes in ACT on pension funds must affect local authorities. That effect could be counteracted only by slashing services--which, of course, would also be to the detriment of Worried of Worthing--or by higher council tax, for which there is no greater allowance for those who are poorer and have to rely on dividend income.
<P>
Of course, Worried of Worthing will suffer if he or she has an endowment mortgage. The shortfall brought about by the ACT changes may result in the endowment mortgage being insufficient to pay off the loan, because of the concomitant problems concerning MIRAS that have been mentioned.
<P>
The problem is a case of heads, I win, tails, you lose. An example of the effect on shareholders--with respect to both income and capital--can be provided by SmithKlein Beecham, one of the largest employers in my constituency, which will suffer greatly because of the under-funding of the company's pension fund. How will that affect my Worried-of-Worthing constituent? The options now open to companies such as Beecham have already been discussed on the Floor of the House. It could maintain the dividend rate at 15.9p, as it was in the previous full year. The shareholder--Worried of Worthing--would take the hit on the loss of ACT. That is a direct link to the reduction of the shareholder's income. However, on the flip side of the coin, Beecam might decide on another course. In a fit of generosity, it might decide that it did not want Worried of Worthing to suffer a shortfall through the reduction in ACT rates. It might therefore make up the equivalent of the tax credits from its own earnings. Beecham would then have to decide how it would top up the shortfall in its pension scheme.
<P>
The implication of what I have described is, as we have heard, that equity finance for companies such as Beecham will be that much more expensive to raise in future. That fact must have an impact on long-term investment and expansion and--certainly in the case of a company such as Beecham--long-term research and development. The latter is an important part of its business. Pharmaceutical companies are long-term product developers. Typically it takes 10 years for a drug to make it from the laboratory to the pharmacy. Such work will be affected because the company will have less money to spend on it.
<P>
All that I have outlined means that shareholder value for worried of Worthing will inevitably be affected. Not only will he or she receive less by way of a dividend, but the investment of SmithKlein Beecham shares will be vulnerable to a downturn in earnings because of the company's need to use its money elsewhere.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Yesterday another reason emerged for Worried of Worthing to be even more worried, if he or she is an investor in investment trusts. That reason involves the concomitant hit on the management charges and the gearing factor that would result in a reduction in income of at least 0.5 per cent. If Worried of Worthing has invested prudently in investment trusts, especially in higher income investment trusts, or in split-level investment trusts, to spread the risk, not only will he or she suffer from the resulting reduction in the ACT credit that will not be reclaimed, but the actual yield from those investment trust shares will be reduced in itself before the tax consideration comes into it.
<P>
Another class of shares--high-yielding shares--will look less attractive as a result. Many companies on higher yields have significantly underperformed on the stock market in recent years. Often companies must offer high yields because their business is unsound. This is especially so with manufacturing businesses if they have been through a tough time. To make their equity sufficiently attractive for further fund-raising exercises--which in some cases have meant the difference between some of them going under, and surviving--they have had to pay out higher dividends. Not only have those shares underperformed in capital terms, now these higher dividends being paid will be less attractive to shareholders, who provide their life blood for their company's future in any case.
<P>
Let us take a long-term look at the capital gain figures. The BZW study--the authoritative study of equities and gilts, which has been going for the past 78 years--has shown that the average real capital gain per year has been only 2.8 per cent. So Labour Members may, after the current post-election, post-Budget international jamboree is over, and we return to more stable, long-term capital gains on shares, wake up to the fact that, income, in proportion to the income that shareholders draw from these shares, is an extremely important factor, especially to Worried of Worthing and Shortfall of Shoreham.
<P>
Tim Melville-Ross, the director-general of the Institute of Directors, in his attack on ACT, stated that the removal of tax credits
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will reduce the attractiveness of saving for a time until such saving is recognised as vital. It is illogical to retain advance corporation tax, the only logic of which is to match tax credits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are creating an enormous anomaly, with the net loser the lower-means Worried of Worthing.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford ably made a number of points. There is enormous misinformation and lack of information--a vast yawning gap about what will take over from 6 April 1999. We have heard about the wonderful potential dinosaur, the individual savings account. We do not know how it will relate to the existing PEPs or TESSAs. We certainly do not know whether it will encompass such things as PEP mortgages--a substantial capital liability that many people have. This is causing great uncertainty.
<P>
As an employer in a company that is a large provider of PEPs, I know that it has taken many years to perfect the computer systems to enable my company and many other PEP-providing companies to provide PEP management that complies with the Financial Services Act 1986 and with the increasing amount of regulation. I know too of the potential fines that are being meted out by the City regulators if things do not go right. That is as it should be; I am not making a case for less regulation in the City at this point. I am saying that the City, and PEP providers--a very large part of City industry and business--need a long time to play, especially to install effective computer systems that will meet the standards which must be complied with. But we are completely in the dark about what type of system we need to perfect for 1999, when the proposal will be enacted.
<P>
Enormous uncertainty affects lower-means shareholders. It is extraordinary. What we have here is another case of robbing Sid to pay for Tony's grand designs. The Worrieds of Worthing--who happen to be of lower means, having been lower paid, but who have a few shares for which they have scrimped and saved over many years--are fair game for the Government. Someone who is lower paid without any savings and perhaps without a job, however, will be a beneficiary of these discriminatory measures.
<P>
There is a serious case for the Government to reassess their plans for what will come into force in 1999. The clause is another example of the Labour party--although it vehemently denies it--feeling uncomfortable with shareholders.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I am in a particularly good mood today, as it is bright and sunny and this is an important day in my life. I shall not say what I really thought of the debate. We got off to an unedifying start when the hon. Member for Daventry displayed his interest in the Bill's topography. As I said last night, I have become concerned about the way in which legislation is drafted; it is often complex and people outside the House of Commons have difficulties in understanding it. However, it is rather rich for the hon. Gentleman--whose party were in Government for 18 years, until three months ago--suddenly to discover that he does not like the style that is consistently used by parliamentary counsel.
<P>
Everyone acknowledges the impact that the millennium will have on the private and public sectors. In opposition, Labour Members were responsible for drawing to the House's attention the need for civil servants and others to take into account the changes that will have to be made because of the millennium.
<P>
Although the contribution of the hon. Member for Daventry was a deviation from the main subject of the clause, it was an interesting pointer to what was to come. It is obvious that Conservative Members are not greatly concerned about the clause. If they were, they would have submitted amendments, but they did not.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also asked whether the tax year will be shifted to coincide with the calendar year. I am sure that he is aware--if he is not, he should be--that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the next Budget will be in the spring of 1998. That should not cause hon. Members to jump to any conclusions about the nature of the financial year; as the hon. Gentleman will be well aware, the current arrangements have existed for quite some time.
<P>
Before I come to some of the more specific points, let me deal with the substance of the clause. Clause 30 is the second part of our changes to the taxation of dividends and other distributions. In case Opposition Members have not been listening and want me to go into the detail of why we are changing tax credits--we have referred to it a dozen times--I am happy to do so. Let me briefly say that the purpose of the measure is to remove a generally recognised distortion in the system. As we discussed earlier, clause 19 prevented pension funds from obtaining payment of tax credits with effect from Budget day. Clause 30 extends the abolition of payable tax credits to all United Kingdom shareholders with effect from 6 April 1999. Any set-off of tax credits will be limited to the tax liability on the dividends.
<P>
I was surprised by some of the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who has reminded us on a number of occasions that he is a technician. I cannot claim to be a technician in these matters; fortunately, a good Scottish education means that I learnt to read English.
<P>
The clause will reduce the rate of tax credit from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. There are technical reasons--which I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows more about than I do--for choosing a 10 per cent. rate of tax credit, rather than simply abolishing tax credits. Those reasons relate to the point that the hon. Gentleman made about United States dividends. If we were to abolish tax credits, we would seriously disadvantage United Kingdom groups with US subsidiaries and some US holders of United Kingdom preference shares.
<P>
The changes in the rates of tax made by clause 31 will not mean that individual taxpayers will have to pay any more tax on their dividends than they do at present. Special transitional arrangements are to be introduced for charities--we shall come to those when we reach clause 35.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Before the Economic Secretary leaves the point, will she confirm that it was I--among others--who raised the impact of the continuing payable tax credits in relation to overseas shareholders? Is she now able to quantify the likely loss of revenue because such credits will continue for those abroad, while it will not be available for those at home?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As a number of points were raised about overseas claimants, I shall answer them when I reach that matter. I am attempting to deal with the points that have been raised as chronologically as possible, so that those who read the report of our deliberations can follow my responses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry talked about the effect on non-taxpaying individuals. He must accept that it would be anomalous to maintain tax credits for some individuals when they are disappearing for everyone else.
<P>
A number of references have been made to individual savings accounts; I shall enlarge upon that matter later. During our initial consultation process prior to publishing a document for wider consultation, we found great interest in the concept of individual savings accounts. That is because there is a long-term problem in our economy: those on low incomes do not make savings contributions in a way that suits the requirements of the savings and investments ratio.
<P>
Successive Governments have tried hard to find vehicles that encourage the low paid to save. It is not just because I am a Scot and have an Irish Catholic or a Calvinistic interest in savings and in prudence. Savings are an important part of the economic mix, and it is important to encourage people--especially those who are on low pay--to save a proportion of their incomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Economic Secretary keeps referring to the fact that the Government are to abolish tax credits for individuals, but tax credits for individuals will remain, and I am very glad about that. The Government will abolish tax credits for non-taxpayers; tax credits will remain for basic rate and higher rate taxpayers.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Tax credits for non-taxpayers is a contradiction in terms. The purpose of tax credits is to provide relief on double taxation. We have already had this argument on a number of occasions and I am not going to be lured down that road again. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Official Report.
<P>
To take up another point raised by the hon. Member for Daventry about the effect on non-residents, if we had maintained the tax credit rate at 20 per cent., that would have entailed continued payment of partial tax credits at a significant level to foreign shareholders in countries with which the United Kingdom has tax treaties that provide for such payment. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton described some such arrangements. That would have been an odd provision, given that we are to abolish tax credits for all United Kingdom shareholders from 1999.
<P>
Halving the rate of the tax credit means that most overseas shareholders will either cease to be able to obtain payment of tax credits from 1999, or will see the amount payable fall to less than 1 per cent. of the dividends--I understand from the Revenue that the figure is likely to be about 0.25 per cent. In making that reduction, we do not want to breach faith with those taxpayers.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Ashford. He returned to a theme that he raised yesterday--that of research and development. I sought to answer the hon. Gentleman earlier but I am not sure whether he was in his place at the time. Certainly, large companies with big distributed profits may also have high expenditure on research and development. I say again what I said yesterday, that that is mainly because such companies operate in a global marketplace and would not be able to retain their competitive advantage were they not prepared to look to the long-term.
<P>
The Government seek through the Bill to allow companies with high potential for growth to finance research and development through retained profits. Because of the tax credit system, many such companies are forced into making a distribution of profits when it is not in their best interests to do so. Financing research and development through retained profits would be more effective and cheaper than raising the money in the marketplace. It would also be easier. Anyone in a small or medium-sized company with high growth and involved in high-risk research and development who has tried to raise venture capital or other forms of capital in that way will tell the hon. Gentleman that it is extremely difficult.
<P>
We seek to create the preconditions for long-term growth and investment in the economy. Companies with the potential for growth that do not have the critical mass that would allow them to raise money freely in the wider market have long had a problem in raising funds for investment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I assure the Economic Secretary that I was in my place when she last explained why the Government are ignoring the research findings of the City university business school.
<P>
It is unrealistic to think that the distribution payments and research and development strategies of what the Economic Secretary described as large, successful companies will be much changed by the Budget. If they are changed, the hon. Lady is going down exactly the wrong road. If those companies are successful, their decisions will be affected by the tax system. It should be a matter of common agreement that investment decisions driven by the tax system are less likely to be good than decisions taken for other reasons.
<P>
The Economic Secretary also mentioned venture capital, but I have seen no evidence in the Budget of any measure that would make it easier to raise venture capital.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Frankly, the hon. Gentleman has argued himself round in a circle. The suggestion that the tax system has absolutely no impact on company investment decisions is rubbish. He said that there was no evidence that the removal of tax credits would boost investment. It is quite clear--it is in the explanatory notes, and has been mentioned on several occasions. If a company has to decide whether or not to distribute profits and faces a choice between a capital gain of &#163;100 and a dividend payment of &#163;100 plus a tax credit of &#163;25, one does not need to be an Einstein to work out what the company is likely to choose. It is to remove that distortion that the Government have decided to act.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to PEPs and the impact of the changes on pensioners. Given our desire to create a better vehicle than PEPs and TESSAs, particularly for the low paid, we have decided that the change will take place in 1999. That will allow people to make transitional arrangements for individual savings accounts. That seems prudent, and I am surprised that anyone should object.
<P>
We are especially anxious to make individual savings accounts attractive to the elderly. That is why we shall be publishing a consultative document to allow everyone involved in both the purchase of individual savings accounts and in their creation to make their contribution to ensure that we have a vehicle that suits the needs of low-paid and elderly people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Can the Economic Secretary confirm that the new individual savings accounts will be as attractive as TESSAs and PEPs?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I can confirm that the savings accounts will certainly be as attractive. It is my long-term ambition to reach an even better position than that for people on low income. We must wait and see, however, how the individual savings accounts are put together. In the spirit of ensuring that such a change will take into account not only the anxieties of ``Worried of Worthing'', but those of ``Worried of Widnes'', we shall consult as widely as possible with a view to creating a new means of saving for the elderly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That will make a change.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that that will make a change. I remind him that my party entered the general election campaign with a manifesto that was the subject of consultation for a considerable period. In implementing the Budget, we shall be honouring our manifesto commitment to change the nature of our economy to ensure that it has the preconditions for stability and growth.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No, I have given way enough to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I shall now move on to the points made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I said that I was in a good mood, but when the hon. Gentleman first spoke, I felt like applauding the fact that he was making a guest appearance in Committee. It was interesting to hear him talking to specific amendments and then hear him attacking officials of the Revenue for their lethargy. Anyone who has taken part in our discussions would consider that there are some to whom we could point the finger of lethargy, but it would certainly not be the officials of the Revenue or, indeed, members of the Committee on both sides of the House of Commons who have contributed to our discussions in each sitting either by their presence or by their interventions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton gave us a lecture about social justice. There are people on both sides of the House who do not need such lectures. Regardless of which political corner they come from, and I include Conservative Members in my remarks, they conduct themselves according to their consciences and on their belief that they can affect materially for the better their constituents and people throughout the country. The hon. Gentleman experienced a rush of blood to the head when he then talked about penalising people on the bread line, but he did not explain properly how the clause would penalise such people. He, too, raised the issue of individual savings accounts.
<P>
The suggestion that we are removing payable tax credits for administrative ease is not true. Pensioners and others will continue to make repayment claims for income tax suffered on interest. There will be virtually no administrative savings. We are getting rid of tax credits because they are a distortion in the system and not the best way in which to ensure long-term growth of the economy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Can the Economic Secretary confirm that pensioners on low incomes whose incomes are now topped up by dividends will be penalised by the measures?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman would have done better to read the clause before he intervened. Its purpose is to implement the removal of tax credits for non-taxpayers by 1999 to allow people to make the appropriate changes in their personal savings portfolios and to allow them to move into the similarly tax-advantaged commodity of individual savings accounts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked whether the tax credits would have an adverse impact on foreign multinationals that are paid dividends by their UK subsidiaries. He is right to say that foreign multinationals can occasionally, under the terms of the double taxation agreement, claim payment for their subsidiaries of tax credits attached to dividends. However, there is no good reason why they should continue to be able to do so to any significant extent once payable tax credits are abolished for all UK shareholders in April 1999--although they will benefit, with other companies, from the 2 per cent. reduction in corporation tax. The hon. Gentleman is arguing that non-resident companies should get tax credits paid when UK resident companies do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am merely arguing that the measure breaches the faith of international agreements that we reached in the past.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have to keep faith with both multinational companies and domestic companies.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised a bizarre point about self-assessment--yet it was the previous Government who introduced self-assessment. The hon. Gentleman made a point about the number of tax rates on individuals and corporations; that issue has been raised many times in Finance Bills. He seems to forget that his Government were in power for the past 18 years and that they were responsible for the complexity of the taxation system.
<P>
I am in awe of the energy of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton); we have heard that he is a director of a trust fund, an employer and a Member of Parliament--would that I had the energy to do all those things. I hope that his constituency is not too worried about the amount of time that the hon. Gentleman has available to devote to his acitivities in the House. He talked about income on shares being important and about the BZW assessment; over the past five years, about three-quarters of the overall yield from UK equities has come from capital appreciation. The loss of income from payable tax credit is far less than the difference in the overall return delivered by a good investment manager--which I am sure the hon. Gentleman was--as compared with a bad one; it is a computation between the worst and the best performance. The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of PEPs and individual savings accounts; I shall not repeat myself on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary on behalf of those non-taxpayers who will undoubtedly lose out because of the withdrawal of that tax credit. However, the savings schemes will to some extent replace their loss of income. Could the hon. Lady confirm that the savings accounts will be available to all taxpayers or is it her intention to make them available only to non-taxpayers?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's attention may have wandered because I have just made it clear that we shall consult on that and shall issue an invitation to the hon. Gentleman, individually or collectively to his party, to be part of that process.
<P>
The purpose of the clause is to move us on to the second part of the proposals contained in the Bill and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I take the assurances of the Economic Secretary about her being in a good mood, for the reasons that she attributes to that. In some respects, her contribution was welcome. We had some clarification of the Government's approach to the ISAs and an assurance that there would be widespread consultation; we welcome that and I am sure that my hon. Friends and I will want to participate in that process. She also assured us, in response to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, that the benefits accruing from TESSAs and PEPs would be broadly reproduced in the new system. Interestingly, she went on to say that she would like to improve those benefits for low-income savers. I understand her motives for that; a few years ago, I interested myself in the history of the trustee savings banks, which originated in Dumfries and Galloway. It is important that all people play a part in saving if they have the income to do so.

Our reservation about the clause is not caused by what the Economic Secretary is trying to do, but with its practical effects, to which I shall return Later. As in the example that I cited, which was supported by my hon. Friends who represent south coast towns with many retired people, the plain fact is that people on low incomes who might be paid one or two dividends on which they have been able to obtain tax repayment cannot now do so.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's response to that--I now understand it more clearly--was that those people can always sell their shares and buy something else. Typically, they could sell their shares in British manufacturing industry and purchase a gilt or something else. That might be a sensible strategy for them to deploy, but it would not necessarily help the investment in British industry that the Government seek to effect.
<P>
Another matter that was explored to some extent by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who has greater expertise, was that of the international investor. Clearly, there will be a problem for the small shareholder of Bognor or Worthing, but it will not be so great for the small shareholder of Tuscany or Taormina; he or she will still benefit from the tax credit.
<P>
We heard an interesting set of equivocations, which I could have expected--indeed, I could have drafted it myself--from the Economic Secretary. She said that we had either to honour our double tax obligations--I am glad that we did so, otherwise the repercussions on British interests would be severe--or we had to renege on them and incur the cost. So we decided to honour them, but we were not going to spend much money on them anyway.
<P>
If I understood the Economic Secretary's arithmetic, given that we are dealing with 0.25 per cent. of the income flow of about &#163;600 million for foreign holders, perhaps &#163;2 million or &#163;3 million only is involved annually. I do not know how that will smite the American revenue authorities or American investors, but I do not think that they will be over pleased about it when they realise that that is what is intended. Even if that represents a technical compliance with the terms of the double tax agreements, I think that it is a substantial breach of their spirit.
<P>
Undoubtedly, the provision of a tax credit--that will not mean what it used to do; it will be scaled down to 10 per cent.--will generate much complexity in the tax system. The clause also departs from an old concept, which goes back to our remarks on the widow. The widow who received a dividend had, of course, been taxed in the hands of the corporation in whose shares she had invested. So further complication has been bolted on as a result of the haste with which the Government have embarked on their policy, which is not part of an overall reform of the corporation tax system, whatever they wish to think.
<P>
However, the most important matter on which we disagree, which is why I think that we should press the Question to a Division, is that the Economic Secretary persists in saying that the tax credit system produces a distortion. For the reasons that I have given, the partial imputation system was intended to eliminate that distortion.
<P>
In seeking to deal with one or two points, especially those relating to pension funds, the Economic Secretary has created collateral damage for many other shareholders, including those who are less well favoured on lower incomes. Although the concept hangs together with a certain dreadful logic, clause 19 includes measures that are highly unpalatable to personal and small shareholders. For all those reasons, we shall oppose clause 30.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 24, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) This section shall not take effect until Her Majesty's Government has published a study of the implications of the section for self-assessment of tax liabilities'.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with reductions in tax rates to compensate for the reductions in the rate of tax credit for ordinary taxpayers that will come into effect in 1999--an issue that we discussed under clause 30. It is necessary to reduce tax rates correspondingly, otherwise the effective rate of tax would increase for taxpayers. Lower or basic rate taxpayers will be charged at the corresponding rate of 10 per cent. and there will be a reduction in the higher rate of income tax for this form of income, which will be 32.5 per cent., so that the same amount of tax is raised. So far, so good. We understand the reasoning behind that.
<P>
The problem is that the measure will introduce considerable additional complexity into the tax system, which should worry us all because we have just introduced self-assessment. Self-assessment involved a huge change in the administration of the tax system. The legislation was introduced under a number of Finance Bills during the previous Parliament. I contributed to some of those, although the burden of the work was carried ably by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), and the measure was supported by the Labour party. I think it was recognised on all sides that self-assessment was desirable.
<P>
People come at the subject from different directions. Some consider that citizens should work out their own tax affairs, that it is the mark of citizenship to participate in such matters and that they should realise the burdens on them as part of a giant educative process. Others, especially those who were more prominent in the Treasury, used to look enviously at the lower costs of collection in other countries--notably America--with self-assessment systems.
<P>
This country's tax system is marked by generally high compliance, which is a tribute to the tax-paying public. However, the cost of collection for each pound raised is comparatively high. Part of the reason for that is that VAT was not given to the Inland Revenue, as, in retrospect, it should have been, but to Customs and Excise. As one who once had the privilege of being responsible for Customs and Excise, I can say that it is a fine organisation, responsible for anti-drug work as well as administering indirect taxes, and it does that work with great integrity and determination. It is none the less true that separating the collection of indirect and direct taxes, probably has, in the long-term, increased the costs of collection.
<P>
All that is water under the bridge, but there remains an obligation on the Government to try to get down the costs of tax administration and collection. Such costs are, as I have said, substantially lower in America, at least in part because of the self-assessment system there. Another reason for lower costs is the comparative simplicity existing in several other tax systems. Those two reasons go hand in hand: if we bring in self-assessment under a complex tax system, we merely transfer costs from the Government to the tax-paying public. It is most important that the process is accompanied by an unremitting drive to simplify. 
<P>
Successive Conservative Chancellors aimed for lower, simpler direct taxes. An important series of reforms was carried through successfully. In retrospect, the old multiple rates of income tax were unbelievably confusing. Hon. Members--particularly those who were engaged professionally in the system--will remember that there were an awful lot of multiple rates which made it very difficult for most taxpayers to work out the true income tax they should pay. By reducing the number of bands and simplifying allowances, we achieved a system capable of the big reform of self-assessment.
<P>
All that is being put into reverse. Clause 31 signals new complexities from 1999. From then, because of the reductions and alterations that I have outlined, a basic rate taxpayer will be taxed at 10 per cent. on schedule F income--dividends and so on--20 per cent. on most, though not all, other investment income and 23 per cent. on earnings or other income. That brings complexity into the system at exactly the wrong time.
<P>
What makes that inexcusable is that it flatly contradicts--yet again--the Government's ``Financial Statement and Budget Report''. At page 24, paragraph 1.68, the report states that the principles of taxation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must keep taxpayers' compliance costs to a minimum''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the next page, the report states that a fair tax system should aim at
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``simplification of the existing tax law, to make it easier to use, so taxpayers understand more clearly their rights and obligations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We agree absolutely with that, but the more one reads the Red Book, the more it appears to be a propagandist document, written in a breathless style, about fairness and a fair and open tax system. Frankly, that is all baloney. The statements that I read just now have not been carried into the Finance Bill before the Committee. The example that I have just given is merely one example. This mattter is serious in that it may get in the way of the proper administration of the self-assessment system, and that will make the system's operation--
