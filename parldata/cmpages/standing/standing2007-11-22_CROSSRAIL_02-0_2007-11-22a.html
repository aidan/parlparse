							<a name="07112318000435">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport
(Mr. Tom Harris):
						</b> As I predicted,
inspiration has descended, and I wonder if I might elucidate and expand
on the points that I was trying to make in response to the hon. Member
for Cities of London and Westminster. It may help if I explain what
clause 10 does. In simple terms, it grants planning permission for two
different categories of work. The scheduled works listed in schedule 1
have to be built within their respective limits of deviation. As long
as other non-scheduled works fall within the scope of the various
environmental assessments accompanying the Bill, they can be built
anywhere within the limit of deviation or the limit of land to be
acquired or used. In addition, safeguarding works to protect buildings
can be constructed outside these limits, but within a specified
distance of the works in relation to which the protection is
provided.</div>
					<a name="07112318000036"><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
Bill plans show both the limit of deviation and the LLAU and together
they are commonly known as the Bill limits, so the geographical extent
of the works and the planning permission granted by the Bill is known.
For example, the main railway and running tunnels are scheduled works,
as are all the new stations to be built in the central section.
Planning permission for those works is therefore granted within their
limits of deviation, but some works are not scheduled works and so get
planning permission only if they have been environmentally assessed.
These include ancillary works such as station alterations within the
LLAU or protective works to buildings outside the Bill limits. The
proposed amendment would remove planning permission for that. I hope
that that clarifies the
position.</div>

						<a name="07112318000436">
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): I have listened carefully to
the Minister. Certainly the last few points clarify his comment about
stations this morning which was of some concern. I am still not clear
why he feels that the amendment is not relevant. It inserts the
phrase:</div>
					<a name="07112318000392"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the development
falls within the limits of deviation for the scheduled
works&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112318000038"><div class="hs_Para">Is he saying that
that is already covered by the clause as it
stands?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000437">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Perhaps the confusion can be explained by the fact
that we are talking about two separate things. The limit of deviation
is, in general, a narrower pathway than the LLAU and will essentially
be where the railway itself must be built. By simply referring to the
&#147;limits of deviation&#148;, the amendment does not take
account of what is currently provided for in the Bill, which is the
limit of land to be acquired or used. Although taking the same path and
direction as the limits of deviation, the LLAU is significantly wider
to accommodate the extra work that has to be done outside the
construction of the railway. I hope that that clarifies
matters.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000438">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I think that something has been lost in the gap
between sittings. One of the things that we have been testing all
morning is the limits outside the limits of deviation for which
acquisition purposes are necessary. I am thinking about this carefully.
I will not press this amendment, but I intend to read the
Minister&#146;s comments very
carefully.</div>

opportunity to offer the hon. Member for Wimbledon&#151;indeed any
member of the Committee who wants them&#151;meetings subsequent to
our proceedings in Committee on some of the more technical aspects of
the Bill that we might not be able to cover extensively. That is not to
say that they cannot be returned to on Report, but it is an open offer
to any member with concerns to sit down with the Crossrail team and
Cross London Rail Links and discuss issues that we may not be able to
resolve in Committee but on which they do not want to press amendments.

Harris:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>This part of the Bill
relates to the process by which the Secretary of State will specify
which local authorities have agreed to become qualifying authorities
under the Bill. A qualifying authority will be a local planning
authority from which the Crossrail-nominated undertaker will seek
various consents, and which has given undertakings to the Secretary of
State on the handling of planning matters under the schedule. That is
aimed to ensure that the process of obtaining consents does not unduly
hinder the construction of
Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112318000055"><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments would require the Secretary of State
to specify not only which local authorities have agreed to be
qualifying authorities but all the bodies and individuals who might be
affected by a specification order. If &#147;relevant bodies or
persons&#148; in amendment No. 33 simply means those who are
statutory consultees, I do not see the point of the amendment, as those
consultees are already specified under part 4 of the
schedule.</div>
					<a name="07112318000056"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also place a potentially large burden on the Secretary
of State and could lead to lengthy argument about whether the list of
affected parties is accurate. Even if such a list could be produced, I
am genuinely unclear about what criteria the hon. Gentleman suggests we
should use to assess relevance. It is unclear what the benefits of the
provision would be, so I invite him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07112318000445">Stephen

						</b> I am, as you might guess, Lady Winterton, not
particularly concerned about whether the amendments might place an
extra burden on the Secretary of State. I am rather more concerned that
the body of people consulted be correct and appropriate. I would have
thought that both in other parts of the Bill and in precedent, there is
a well-defined list of relevant people; surely they are those who are
potentially affected. That definition of relevance should not
necessarily be a problem to the Secretary of State. I have listened to
the Minister&#146;s arguments and I take on board his point that one
of the amendments is already covered. Given, therefore, that some of
those whom I wish to consulted are consultees already, and with his
assurance that the Secretary of State will continue to conduct as wide
a consultation as possible, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

					<a name="07112318000060"><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
dwell too long on my thinking behind this small amendment, as it should
be fairly obvious from the wording. Under the provisions of the
schedule, the nominated undertaker is required to restore any sites
used in relation to the construction of Crossrail. If such an
arrangement is not reached within six months of the completion of
scheduled works, the Government may impose an agreement. Clearly that
process would be benefited if the time period was extended. It is not
unusual in all sorts of building works for agreements to take longer
than six months. Indeed, I am a governor of a school that is now
talking to builders about an agreement and finally signing off some two
years after. On works as large and exceptional as those on Crossrail,
therefore, to impose such a tight deadline of six months would be
inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="07112318000061"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would reflect that and increase the chances of an agreement
being reached by parties involved, as opposed to having one imposed on
them from above. It seems to be especially important that parties be
given sufficient time to plan the future use of the land, if it is
unknown when the construction phase of Crossrail will officially come
to an end. Imposing such a tight time limit is inappropriate. Widening
it would provide flexibility and ensure that a vast number of parties
can come to an agreement without the Government imposing
one.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom

							<a name="07112318000448">Stephen

it would take longer to restore land to its original state. However,
local residents might be more pleased that it is returned to its
original state, even if that takes an extra six months, than if it is
returned to a state that is not fit for purpose, because of having to
comply with a shorter time scale. Given the scale of the Crossrail
construction&#151;it is likely to take about seven years&#151;an
extra six months for restoring land to an agreed level would be a
useful and flexible arrangement for the constructors of Crossrail and
for those from whom they have taken
land.</div>

the period before the restoration scheme is referred to the Secretaries
of State for determination in the absence of agreement between the
nominated undertaker and the local planning authority. That would have
a number of effects: it would delay the final date by which the
contractor could be assured that he would be able to finish on the
construction site, which would extend the duration of contracts, adding
to costs and potentially delaying the progress and completion of
the construction phase of the project; and it would extend the period
in which such work sites could be left unrestored and unused, to the
detriment of the local environment and
economy.</div>

months is a reasonable period to give the local planning authority and

local authorities would desire more time to agree a restoration scheme,
it is equally likely that both they and local communities would object
to work sites remaining unused for longer than necessary. I should add
that the proposal was contained in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act
1996. I cannot support the

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):
I can see what the Minister is getting at. The fear
of Conservative Members, as ably advanced by my hon. Friend the Member
for Wimbledon, is that the provision might put an additional burden to
rush through within the first six months on landowners and local
authorities, which are already very stretched in relation to planning
and other regulatory and enforcement matters. The desirable situation,
which we would hope for, particularly in central London, given the
value of land, would be that remedial work was done on the land within
a few weeks, by agreement between a local authority and the
land&#146;s owner. However, the six-month limit may be passed and, if
that happened, it would be wrong for the power to go effectively
straight into the hands of the Secretary of State. For that reason, we
want an element of protection to allow agreement to be reached between
people on the ground who know what is going on&#151;the local
authority and the landowner&#151;rather than triggering in 180 days
the taking of the decision straight to the Secretary of State. We
thought pragmatically that 12 months would be a more desirable time
limit.</div>
					<a name="07112318000070"><div class="hs_Para">It is in no
one&#146;s interest to have ongoing building
sites&#151;&#151;bomb sites&#151;&#151;in any of our towns and
cities after work has taken place. Equally, one has to appreciate that
this may not be a first priority for landowners, particularly for those
who have seen some of their land out of commission for some years while
work has been going on. It would be undesirable, after a six-month
period, for the Secretary of State to determine how and
when work is undertaken. Obviously, a much better
solution all round would be a sense of agreement. That is why 12
months, in this context, is sensible.</div>
					<a name="07112318000071"><div class="hs_Para">For practical
purposes, we hope that the great majority of such sites will already
have been developed and that there will be no environmental or other
degradation

12 months would be a pragmatic solution that ensures that landowners
who are put to great inconvenience by Crossrail do not find that they
have yet another problem to sort out and do not have to
deal with enforcement action put upon them by a
Secretary of State for waiting just a few days beyond a six-month

to the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster what I said
earlier: the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government

with the nominated undertaker and the local planning authority, and
hence there will indeed be an element of consultation. I respect the
points that he has made, but we all want the easiest solution, and
there is precedent from previous hybrid Bills&#151;precedent that
worked well. I understand the intention of the amendment, but I stick
to my original position, and I do not support the

what the Opposition want from an increase in the available time from
three to 12 months. I am struck by what the Minister just said about
how, after six months, the Secretaries of State for Communities and
Local Government and for Transport will get together and consult. It
might well be that that will take rather longer than if my suggestion
of six months had been adopted in the first place. I am therefore
unpersuaded that a top-down imposition will necessarily be faster than
the proposal in the amendment, so I shall test the will of the

will find one of my excellent amendments both tempting and
irresistible. The amendments in this group would insert identical
wording after the words &#147;Natural England&#148;, so although
tightly drafted they would add flexibility. They do not mean that any
conservation body would be able to wade into a site and say that it
might have an interest.</div>
					<a name="07112318000096"><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds held a reception for Members of
Parliament last week, at which representatives talked about the number
of inland projects that they are working on, and a number of
conservation bodies and the process would benefit if the consultation
process were extended when it came to conservation matters in a
particular area. Natural England is certainly an appropriate body, but
it is not the only one. There are a number of others and, to my mind,
the RSPB is an obvious consultee. I would like to know whether the
Minister might not be persuaded to look at the amendment and accept
that the consultation and, indeed, the conservation process would
benefit from not being restricted to just one
body.</div>

My concern about the restrictions within the clause

certainly to involve local
communities</div>
					<a name="07112318000098"><div class="hs_Para">In my part
of the world, local conservation bodies play a very important role in
conservation at that important local level; I cannot speak with such
confidence for London. The amendment would allow such bodies to be
involved in the process, whereas, as the Bill stands, they are excluded
from it. Knowing the Minister and how fair-minded he is, I am sure that
he would want such local involvement, and I hope that he is able to
tell us that that is the
case.</div>

carefully to the Minister&#146;s reply to see whether it is, in fact,
already covered. I assume that conservation groups have certain rights
to access the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000472">Mr.
Field:
						</b> I very much agree with what my
hon. Friends have said. I believe that there is a small danger in
giving statutory authority only to certain bodies; for example, English
Heritage has statutory authority in relation to a range of different
planning matters for listed buildings. As set out in the schedule,
there is a risk that large national bodies, such as Natural England and
the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England, will
perhaps take the view that they will fight only on a limited number of
grounds, although the risk is probably far less in my constituency,
which, of course, contains many well known historic buildings, than it
might be on other parts of the Crossrail route. I understand that point
of view; such bodies will want to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>make a precedent of two or three sites rather than the deserving cases
that might exist at half a dozen or so sites on the particular
route.</div>
					<a name="07112318000101"><div class="hs_Para">Across
the political divide in Parliament, we all subscribe to the notion of
localism&#151;the idea that local people have a strong case that
should be listened to. That applies particularly in London and the
south-east, which is a very cosmopolitan and globalised part of the
world, and everyone regards London as a big, world city. There is also
a great passion about the villages that make up London; not just the
historical part of central London, but well beyond that. It would be
regrettable if we did not give some regard to those local
bodies.</div>
					<a name="07112318000405"><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07112318000102"><div class="hs_Para">I
fear that if we simply say, &#147;Natural England have authority
here&#148;, it will, perhaps inevitably, take the view that it wants
to fight on a limited number of grounds, for cost reasons, and,
probably more importantly, in order to maximise the case that it is
making without being totally aware of some of the local
considerations.</div>
					<a name="07112318000103"><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the south-east Bayswater residents association has both a
planning and a conservation sub-committee. My constituency is also
strongly affected by these proposals in north Mayfair. There is a
conservation sub-committee of the St. James and Mayfair residents
association, and it will be regrettable if they do not have some input
on the matters that are statutorily protected by the schedule. I hope
that the Minister will consider the
proposals.</div>
					<a name="07112318000104"><div class="hs_Para">I think
that all hon. Members agree that we need to have the input of bodies
that have a passion for conservation at their heart. Because many of
those bodies have input from locally involved individuals, they are on
top of the very specific issues that some of the national bodies that
are protected within schedule 7 will perhaps not fully
appreciate.</div>
					<a name="07112318000105"><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that there is much that different parties disagree about
on this issue. We know what we are trying to achieve. We do not want
this to be a nimby charter or for things to be held up by very small
local bodies delaying matters. However, it would be worth while for
those that have a specific interest in conservation to have their
interests protected in schedule
7.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000473">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The hon. Member for Wimbledon
seems to be using the strategy of trying to make me feel guilty about
my recurrent refusals to accept his amendments. I have to tell him that
that strategy is doomed to failure on this occasion. Similarly, the
hon. Member for Northampton, South seems to be trying to use flattery
to the same end. He will find his efforts achieving similar
success.</div>
					<a name="07112318000107"><div class="hs_Para">I
think that all hon. Members are, once again, on the same side of the
argument, but with a disagreement about how to get there. Amendments
Nos. 35 and 36 would extend the duty of local planning authorities to
consult where a planning request relates to conservation. The Bill
requires authorities to consult Natural England on such matters. The
amendments would extend the duty to include any other conservation
bodies that might have an interest in the site to which the consent
relates. I will say a little about that phraseology later.</div>
					<a name="07112318000108"><div class="hs_Para">Part 4 of the
schedule sets out the bodies that must be consulted by local
authorities and the time scale for doing that and receiving responses.
The bodies specified are those that have statutory duties to consider
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>matters in question. Those bodies have been consulted extensively as the
project has been developed and are represented on a statutory agencies
forum that reports directly to the high-level forum that I chair. We
believe that that is the right approach. It is open to any local
authority to consult and take comments from any body that it feels is
appropriate. However, to extend the duty to consult in part 4 of the
schedule in such an uncertain way could render the consultation
unworkable.</div>

to the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, who warned
against extending the process and holding it up with too many

states,</div>

conservation body that might be expected to have a particular
interest&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112318000112"><div class="hs_Para">Most
hon. Members have served on Committees like this a number of times and
we all know how important it is to be specific in legal terms. I do not
know whether the hon. Gentleman is a lawyer, but he looks far too
decent for that. It seems to me that almost any body, whether or not it
has a constitution and even if it is a very informal coalition of
different people, would be entitled to be consulted statutorily under
the amendment. For instance&#151;I do not think that such a group
exists&#151;&#147;East End Against Crossrail&#148; might be a
very informal coalition of various groupings, some political and some
not, and it would be entitled to be consulted. If it were not, there
will always be the prospect of judicial review. To my mind, that is the
weakness of an amendment that, with all respect, is phrased in a very
ambiguous and open-ended manner. That might be a gift to the lawyers,
for whom I have such a high
regard.</div>
					<a name="07112318000113"><div class="hs_Para">Given

(3).</div>
					<a name="07112318000118"><div class="hs_Para">The clause does
exactly what it says on the tin&#151;to use the vernacular.
Subsection (1) puts a time limit of 10 years on the provisions
for deemed planning permission, which strikes me as quite generous.
Given the exhaustive examination of the Crossrail route that has
already been made by our friends incarcerated here, 10 years ought to
be ample time in which to grant the appropriate permissions to begin
the work. Therefore, what is the point of that time limit if, by virtue
of subsections (2) and (3), the Secretary of State can ignore it? Those
subsections allow the Secretary of State to extend the time limit that
has already been imposed of any period he chooses.</div>
					<a name="07112318000119"><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister enlighten us as to the circumstances in which he anticipates
that it would take more than 10 years from the time that the Bill
receives Royal Assent before the deemed planning permission can result
in development? In 10 years, I would expect the construction of
Crossrail to be well under way. If it is still in its planning stage at
that time, not only will every member of the Committee and Member of
the House be deeply disappointed, but everyone in London will be
also.</div>
					<a name="07112318000120"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000478">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I begin by clarifying for the elimination of all
doubt that I agree with the hon. Gentleman and also expect the
construction of Crossrail to be well under way in 10 years time. I do
not want the Committee to be in any doubt about the Government&#146;s
intention in that regard. Last month, the Prime Minister made an
announcement about Crossrail and said that we expect major works to
start in 2010 and for the first services to be running in 2017. The
Government and the Mayor, as joint sponsors of Crossrail, are confident
that the outlined programme for construction is realistic. On that
basis, we expect all scheduled works to have begun within the 10-year
period provided for in subsection (1).</div>
					<a name="07112318000121"><div class="hs_Para">This is a massive project,
however, and its scale and complexity are such that we believe it is
prudent for Parliament to allow the flexibility that subsections (2)
and (3) provide, so that the project can be completed whatever
perturbations may occur&#151;I guess it is the word
&#147;perturbations&#148; for which the hon. Gentleman wants a
definition. We cannot predict why delays might occur, but I am sure
that hon. Members will join me in hoping that they do not
happen.</div>
					<a name="07112318000122"><div class="hs_Para">Crossrail, as
with any large project, is susceptible to external factors that might
affect the programme. We believe that the flexibility to extend the
period of deemed planning permission is appropriate, and I assure the
Committee that the ability to extend the period of
deemed planning permission that the Bill grants is well precedented. I
shall offer a prize to the first Member who can tell me where that
precedent emerges&#151;the 1996 Act. It should be remembered that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>during the construction of the channel tunnel rail link, an extension of
the 10-year planning permission was not required and we do not expect
it to be required on this occasion.</div>

							<a name="07112318000480">Mr.

						</b> May I once again clarify that we
do not expect an extension to the 10-year period? The clause will allow
the Secretary of State, in certain circumstances, to secure an
extension, but we do not intend or expect to extend the 10-year limit.
The hon. Gentleman is right about planning blight and the other
complications that would arise in those circumstances, which is one
reason why the Government are determined that construction will begin
as planned in 2010. Further, any extension of deemed planning
permission would be moved by an order subject to annulment by either

major delay in Crossrail. We can all speculate about the effects, for
example, of a terrorist attack either in central London or at the
Crossrail construction site. I shall be frank: I do not want to
speculate about it. However, the process that has already taken up 21
months of Select Committee sittings, and the hybrid Bill process has
already been carried over into two separate Parliaments and one general
election, so do we want an amendment that would mean that we might
conceivably&#151;in unusual circumstances&#151;be forced to go

reasons that I have already outlined and the powers were not used. I do
not expect them to be used now. Given the amount of work that has
already gone into this Bill, I hope that the Committee will understand
why the clause, as a safety net, should remain in the

						</b> I understand why the Minister
wants such a belt-and-braces provision. There are, however, great
distinctions between the 1996 Act and the Bill. In reality, the channel
tunnel was a matter of international prestige. For this
Government&#151;for any Administration in this country&#151;to have
gone back on that deal would have been a disaster internationally,
given the project&#146;s importance. The fear that many of my
constituents have is about planning blight, which I addressed with
regard to earlier clauses this morning. By extending in a relatively
unusual if not entirely unprecedented way from five to 10 years the
normal planning limit, the provision raises a question about the
robustness of the Crossrail financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>package. I appreciate that we will not be able to discuss that issue to
any great extent until almost the final clause, but there are great
concerns about a package that was cobbled together in the first week of
October to everyone&#146;s joy, but, we all felt, with an eye to a
general election campaign. I worry that there will be extensive
planning blight if we extend beyond the five years or even the three
years that the Minister mentioned
earlier.</div>

process, or we will have done within a few months, and we would be in
the worst of all worlds if that financial package was not seen to be
robust.</div>
					<a name="07112318000130"><div class="hs_Para">There is
undoubtedly slightly less clement economic weather ahead, and there is
also a sense in which the project is considered one of great
international prestige. We make a big case for the importance of
international trade and the significance of Crossrail well beyond
London and the south-east. Ministers make that case when they are
trying to convince their Scottish and northern English brethren of the
importance of the project, but it is all too easy to see how the rug
might be pulled
away.</div>
					<a name="07112318000131"><div class="hs_Para">Even for a
large-scale construction project such as this, an extension from five
years to 10 is an unusual provision. I worry that it will give rise
ever more to the view that there is get-out option come year 8 or 9,
that suddenly the funding will not be put together and that the project
will be put on the back burner for decades to come. That is the worst
of all scenarios for my constituents and others who are affected,
simply because they will suffer blight. That blight could be present
for many years to come.</div>
					<a name="07112318000132"><div class="hs_Para">Most of my constituents are
concerned about the noise and the disruption. As the Minister knows, on
all occasions I have tried to make the case for the importance of
Crossrail. A number of my constituents in parts of central London would
prefer it if I came out against Crossrail, but I am in
favour&#151;provided that we can get on and get it
done.</div>
					<a name="07112318000133"><div class="hs_Para">At the end of
the process, we will have a tremendous new asset not just for central
London, but for the country as a whole. The worst of all worlds for my
constituents would be to have such blight hanging over their properties
and their lives for many years to come. The Minister&#146;s proposal
to extend from the normal five years to 10 raises many
questions.</div>

						<a name="07112318000484">
							<b class="B">Sir
Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab):
I rise to support the Minister&#146;s view. As we are all well aware,
this is an enormously complex project with innumerable elements. Some
of those elements will be much more straightforward to deliver than
others, and some are rather more fundamental to the project than
others. As those complex elements are brought together to produce the
whole, some might be more difficult to deliver in the time frame than
might seem apparent at the outset.</div>
					<a name="07112318000135"><div class="hs_Para">I share the Minister&#146;s
hope and expectation that the project will be safely delivered within
the 10-year 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>period. I am sure that we all share that hope, but I see the provision
not as a get-out clause, as the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster described it, but as a sensible fall-back position should
there be unexpected difficulties in delivering some elements. We all
hope that it will never need to be used, but it is wise to have
it.</div>
					<a name="07112318000136"><div class="hs_Para">We should remember
that the provision is being included in such a way as to enable
Parliament to continue to scrutinise. Parliamentary approval will be
required for any extension beyond the 10-year period. Given the
complexity of the project, the uncertainty of delivering it all within
the 10-year time frame and the scrutiny that would be necessary should
the power be exercised, we should support the clause as it
stands.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000485">Tom
Brake:
						</b> I rise to echo the concerns that have been
expressed from this side of the Committee. The clause creates a bit of
wriggle room and takes the pressure off. With a project such as this,
we need to keep the pressure on and the momentum going. There is here
the potential to delay matters. If the Government roll out an ID cards
programme and the costs mushroom dramatically beyond those anticipated,
they would have the flexibility to use this measure as a means of
slowing down expenditure on the Crossrail project to pay for those cost
overruns. I need reassurance from the Minister, therefore, that there
is no potential to delay the
project.</div>

declare an interest in that I am a lawyer, which means that I shall
keep very quiet in the Committee, although there is one point on which
I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s clarification. Hon. Members
who have spoken in this portion of our discussions have assumed that
the works in question must be completed in a 10-year period. The
Minister has said that there are many unforeseeable eventualities that
might affect the progress of a particular piece of work. However, it is
also important to bear it in mind that clause 11(1) says that the
development consisting of scheduled work must
begin</div>
					<a name="07112318000397"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not later than the
end of 10 years&#148;.</div>

							<a name="07112318000487">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Before I address the serious concerns mentioned by
the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, I congratulate
the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington on managing to include ID
cards in a Crossrail debate.</div>
					<a name="07112318000142"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Cities of
London and Westminster made his case well in relation to potential
blight. He has raised his concerns on that subject on a number of
occasions, I know. Let me put it this way: Crossrail must happen, and
it will&#151;whether under this scheme or not. It is not an optional
extra for the city of London. It must be built, and most of us accept
that.</div>
					<a name="07112318000143"><div class="hs_Para">In the
extremely hypothetical circumstance of a delay that forced the loss of
the planning permission conferred by the Bill, a future Government
would in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>any case have to repeat the process, start from scratch and go through
the whole hybrid Bill process so as to get to where we are now, and
start building. The hon. Member for Wimbledon is suggesting, I think,
that, if there were a delay in starting construction and if power did
not exist to extend permission, Crossrail would not be built and that
those of his constituents who are in danger of blight could carry on
regardless and would be at no risk of blight in future. That cannot be
the case, because Crossrail has to happen. If it does not happen now, a
future Government will have to build it. In common with all members of
the Committee, I want Crossrail to be built as soon as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07112318000144"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000488">Mr.
Field:
						</b> I shall not draw a direct comparison, but let me
make the observation that at various times there have been proposals
for different tube lines. Anyone who lives in parts of north London
around Muswell Hill or Cranleigh Gardens will have seen maps from the
late 1930s indicating possible extensions of the Northern line that
would have covered those districts. It is perhaps to their own good
that they remained outside the tube
network.</div>
					<a name="07112318000145"><div class="hs_Para">The notion
that Crossrail has to be built is a little wide of the mark. It has
been talked about since as early as 1948, and proposals for it have
existed for a considerable time. Conservative Members are simply
concerned about financial robustness. If the Minister is right that
work will begin in the next three years, that will probably be under
the current Administration, but if they fail in that regard, I do not
see why my constituents or constituents elsewhere in London and the
south-east should suffer potential
blight.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000489">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> All I can do is repeat the assurances that have
been given by the Prime Minister and by others in government on the
Government&#146;s commitment to going ahead with the stated schedule
of works, which we have already made public. We have learned lessons
from the highly successful channel tunnel rail link and applied them to
the Crossrail proposals, not least in handing the task of delivery to
an autonomous delivery agent&#151;Cross London Rail Links
Ltd&#151;that can recruit the people it needs with the right
&#147;megaproject&#148; experience and expertise. I am confident
that the project will come in on time and on budget, and will begin in
2010 as we have said. The project costs include a carefully calculated
contingency reserve and it has been tested in a full quantified risk
analysis.</div>
					<a name="07112318000147"><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want the Committee to receive any impression other than that the
Government are committed to Crossrail construction beginning in 2010.
The measure in the Bill is a standard measure that must be applied to
an infrastructure project of this size. I predict that this measure
will be applied to any future infrastructure project of such a size
when a hybrid Bill is
involved.</div>
					<a name="07112318000148"><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want anyone to glean from the comments that have been made, either by
me or by any other Committee member, that the Government are anything

already outlined. In that context, I hope that the hon. Member for
Wimbledon will withdraw his amendment.</div>

clause 10(1) in respect of maintaining or altering any Crossrail work
from the date specified in the order. That is most likely to be used in
the case of the electrification and signalling work done on sections of
the existing railway network. It will ensure that a single planning
regime covers works in relation to existing track after the Crossrail
construction phase has been completed. In the event of a
disapplication, any such development would be subject to the normal

					<a name="07112318000203"><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 18 and 19 quite rightly
deal with trees, because overhanging trees could delay the scheduled
works, and it is understandable that they might need to be trimmed or
removed so that they no longer obstruct the construction or operation
of Crossrail. Clause 18 allows the owner of a tree to appeal against
any such action and entitles them to receive compensation for loss or
damage. One would be hard-pressed to disagree with the general
provisions. The amendment is not designed to revise that purpose, or
the general principle behind it, but to make the process slightly more
watertight.</div>
					<a name="07112318000204"><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) enables the nominated undertaker to do the work himself, if the
owner of the tree has not undertaken to do so within 28 days of being
served a notice by the nominated undertaker. However, the clause would
benefit if the words of the amendment were appended because there will
undoubtedly be some cases in which the reason for the
landowner&#146;s inaction will be that he has objected to the
proposed works in accordance with subsection (2). It may be that,
within those 28 days, he has served a counter-notice and is therefore
awaiting confirmation by a county court. When the 28-day deadline
expires, he may still be waiting for that response. If that is the
case, it will be prudent for the nominated undertaker to await the
judgment of the county court before starting work on the affected tree.
By making a reference to subsection (3) in subsection (4), we would
ensure that the nominated undertaker would not start chopping off
branches before he was sure that any appeal to the courts has been
properly
processed.</div>

						</b> I can see what the hon. Gentleman is attempting to
achieve with the amendment, but I can tell him that the powers featured
in subsection (4) are not what he assumes them to be. I will
explain.</div>
					<a name="07112318000206"><div class="hs_Para">The clause
deals with the removal or lopping of overhanging trees on adjacent land
that is necessary for the Crossrail works to be constructed or
maintained, and for their safe operation. The nominated undertaker can
give notice and, if there is no objection, can undertake the works
after 28 days, if the owner has not dealt with the trees himself. If a
counter-notice is served within the 28-day period, the notice has no
effect unless confirmed by a county court. That provision is very
similar to that provided under the 1996 Act, which used a procedure for
notices and counter-notices similar to that provided under the
Telecommunications Act 1984. That Act gives the landowner the suitable
protection that he can choose to lop or remove the trees himself, but
if he disputes the need for lopping or removal, he can serve a
counter-notice. In that case, no action can be taken, unless the county
court confirms the
notice.</div>
					<a name="07112318000207"><div class="hs_Para">If the
intention behind the amendment is that the county court should confirm
every notice, whether contested or not, I would argue that it would add
no benefit. If a landowner has done nothing about a notice, it is
highly likely that the county court consideration would be uncontested.
It is unclear, therefore, what such consideration would achieve.
However, it would create extra work, including for the courts, and
might cause delay. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw the amendment.</div>

						</b> Clause 20 will effectively disapply the
provisions of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, which will mean that
appeals are determined by not a magistrates court, but the Secretary of
State, which is concerning. The Government are trying to enact
legislation that allows them, or their nominated undertaker, to create
a great deal of noise&#151;I accept that sometimes that is
unavoidable&#151;in and around London. Under the 1974 Act, the
Government can apply for prior consent for such a level of noise.
Normally, such appeals would be heard by a magistrates court, but now
the Government want to hear those appeals themselves. In legal terms,
they would therefore be the defendant and judge. I invite the Minister
to clarify the situation and explain how he will seek to remedy it. It
is an extremely important
matter.</div>
					<a name="07112318000216"><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
we tackled briefly the possibility of noise due to the extension of
boring and drilling downwards. However, we have only touched on noise.
Clearly, noise blight could be a major result of the construction phase
under the Bill. Whole communities might well be affected during the
construction, and the 1974 Act seems to be more or less the only
protection for a neighbourhood or community. It would seem invidious
for appeals to be determined by the Secretary of State rather than
through the normal channels. How on earth could a local community
protect itself? Is the Minister saying that the Government should be
above the law for the purposes of this Bill, and
therefore&#151;potentially&#151;for the purposes of other

construction would be undertaken. That enabled us to reassure those
petitioners. Although I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is

the Committee that some of the specific problems anticipated by

only about noise, but about other pollution? Noise, vibration and dust
were the major concerns. Indeed, we went through the code that has been
adopted&#151;at considerable length and to a considerable depth. The
hon. Gentleman is right. We should be happy with the conditions built
in to the code and the fact that the undertakers are aware of the need
to act properly in this respect. However, there are sad occasions when
things go wrong and we have seen examples of that in this place over
the past week.</div>
					<a name="07112318000220"><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about whether there is a fall-back position. Many of the
petitioners felt that they had a fall-back position with regard to
magistrates who knew their own locality. That was an important
safeguard for them: if the code and the promises and all that was said
to good effect did not materialise, they could appeal to local
magistrates. Again, the &#147;local&#148; gave them comfort. I am
concerned that we are removing local knowledge from the equation. I
would like the Minister to reassure me and tell me exactly why he feels
that that element should be removed or whether my concerns do not
matter and are of no consequence. If that is so, I am happy; if not, I
will not be happy at

increasingly over-used word, which is perhaps devalued currency, and
say that the clause is precedented in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act

Pollution Act 1974, so that an appeal against a construction noise
notice under section 60 of that Act, or a refusal or conditioning of a
consent to construction arrangements under section 61, is
determined by the Secretary of State instead of by a magistrates
court.</div>

scheme is a linear work of some 100 km in length, passing through the
areas of many petty sessional divisions. Although magistrates courts
are an appropriate forum for the resolution of disputes in relation to
schemes and activities that have discrete local effects, using such
courts as appellate bodies is not likely to secure the co-ordinated and
unified approach to construction activities that is desirable for the
effective management of a project the size of

appeal, as a fall back scenario, to be interpreted from a local

Hammond:
						</b> This debate gives us the chance to have another
little chat about noise. The clause continues in much the same vein as
clause 20, in the sense that it removes any accountability on behalf of
the Secretary of State or the nominated undertaker for excess noise
pollution caused by the Crossrail project. We have just heard the
Minister justify the rationale for the Secretary of State determining
the issue, but towards the end of those remarks, the Minister said that
on clauses 20 and 21, the Secretary of State may appoint an independent
inspector. If that is the precedent of the 1996 Act, the Committee
would be much more reassured if the Minister&#146;s comment was in
the Bill and the issue determined by an independent inspector whom the
Secretary of State nominated. That would release the Secretary of State
from the invidious position of being, potentially, the defendant and
the judge, which would be quite important.</div>
					<a name="07112318000236"><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s argument about separate numbers of magistrates courts
all potentially doing different things is slightly odd, because the
magistrates courts would test whether a noise level was above or below
a level as specified by an Act, and although they might apply sanctions
differently, their findings would be consistent. The Minister&#146;s
argument was therefore difficult to accept.</div>
					<a name="07112318000237"><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will have the chance to reflect on the possibility of an
independent inspector being involved. According to the Environment
Protection Act 1990, if a magistrates court decides that a nuisance is
caused by noise or that such a nuisance is likely to recur, it may
proceed to require the defendant to take appropriate action to abate
that noise, and impose a fine. The clause does not quite make a mockery
of, but it takes away from, that important legislation by making the
perpetrator to the noise, if they are associated with Crossrail, not
responsible under the 1990 Act. Clause 21 states
that</div>
					<a name="07112318000399"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no order shall be
made, and no fine shall be imposed...if the defendant shows

caused by works associated with Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112318000239"><div class="hs_Para">We have said all along in

importance that will require exceptional powers, but to the family

development of Crossrail or by some other construction
project.</div>
					<a name="07112318000240"><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened carefully and I am glad that the Select Committee felt that
there were some reassurances, but I find it striking that that
Committee expended so much effort in the past two years listening to
the concerns of people affected by Crossrail and tried to reassure
them, because the two clauses we are considering will not impose a
penalty if such concerns about noise are brought forward. Will the
Minister again consider carefully the fact that in clauses 20 and 21,
the Secretary of State is put in the potentially invidious position of
being both defendant and judge? That is not good
legislation.</div>

							<a name="07112318000539">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The purpose of clause 21, precedented in
the 1996 Act, is to provide a defence against proceedings brought by an
individual alleging a noise nuisance under section 82 of the 1990 Act.
The defence arises if the nuisance arises in connection with authorised
activity, and where the relevant works are carried out in accordance
with either a notice or a consent given under the Control of Pollution
Act 1974.</div>
					<a name="07112318000242"><div class="hs_Para">Such a
notice or consent already forms a defence in any proceedings for
failure to comply with a noise abatement notice issued by a local
authority under section 80(1)(a) of the 1990 Act. The provision means
that the nominated undertaker will be able to carry out his
works&#151;importantly, works approved by the local
authority&#151;with greater certainty. However, I recognise
Opposition Members&#146; concerns. One requirement of the Crossrail
construction code is that the nominated undertaker must obtain consent
under section 61 of the 1974 Act with respect to the construction works
that it is to carry out under the Bill. In view of that commitment, it
is reasonable that the nominated undertaker should be able to carry out
the works, as approved by the local authority, with the certainty that
the clause will give&#151;namely, that it will not then be subject to
separate proceedings under section 82 of the 1990
Act.</div>

separate proceedings could inhibit or delay necessary construction
works for Crossrail that have previously been approved by the local
authority as representing best practicable means for the minimisation
of noise. There are other safeguards. The first is that, because of the
Crossrail construction code commitments, concerned individuals have the
assurance that their local authority will have scrutinised in detail
the proposed construction methods in each case to check that best
practice is being
followed.</div>
					<a name="07112318000244"><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
individuals potentially affected by noise nuisance arising from the

					<a name="07112318000250"><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides that operators of Crossrail-related railway assets will need
neither a licence nor a licence exemption during the Crossrail
construction period, yet there is the possibility that trains will move
construction material and personnel to sites. The Committee will want
to understand why the additional power is necessary, given that the
Secretary of State already has the power by virtue of the 1993 Act to
grant exemptions to operators from the requirement to have a licence.
It appears that the only difference being created here is the removal
of the obligation from the Secretary of State to consult with the rail
regulator before granting such an exemption. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s clarification of whether that is the intent of the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112318000251"><div class="hs_Para">That is the
general point relating to the motive behind the clause as a whole. My
amendment is slightly more particular. It relates to construction
materials being used in the building of Crossrail. If such materials
and such personnel are to be transported by rail, I see no reason why
the operators of the trains and the related infrastructure&#151;the
railway assets&#151;should be excused from the need to have a licence
validated by the
ORR.</div>
					<a name="07112318000252"><div class="hs_Para">That licensing
regime ensures that certain minimum standards are met in terms of
efficiency, the environment and most particularly, safety. It is a key
regulatory requirement and one that I would be wary of seeing
sidestepped for any railway asset, particularly where construction
workers may be involved. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
reassurance that those powers are
necessary.</div>

					<a name="07112318000254"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 22 deals with the period
between part of the Crossrail network becoming usable and its opening
to fare-paying passengers. During that period, the newly created
network may be operated for construction trains, and test trains will
be run. The clause removes the need to obtain licences from the ORR to
use the network and to run trains in that period. The licensing
provisions of the 1993 Act are appropriate to the commercial operation
of this, as any other railway, but add no value to developmental stages
of a new
railway.</div>
					<a name="07112318000255"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require the licensing of services carrying construction
materials on newly constructed parts of the Crossrail network that have
yet to be brought into commercial operation. However, if the hon.
Gentleman is concerned about trains being used in the construction of
Crossrail and also running on the existing national rail network
without a licence, I can reassure him that the clause does not remove
the requirement for a licence to be obtained in the usual manner in
relation to that
network.</div>
					<a name="07112318000256"><div class="hs_Para">The only
construction trains that will be exempt from licensing for their entire
journey are those contained within the newly constructed parts of the
Crossrail network. There is no possible value in trying to apply a
licensing regime designed for commercial operations to the running of
construction trains within a construction site. I hope that that is
enough information to reassure the hon. Gentleman and persuade him to
withdraw the

certainly extremely useful in confirming that any construction trains
being used on the national rail network will still require a licence.
However, I am still concerned. I understand entirely that the licensing
and regulatory regime that one would use for commercial operation is
not appropriate to a construction operation, but, at the same time, are
we saying that there is no regulatory or licensing regime being placed
on the construction traffic at all? Safety implications
must be addressed. Therefore, how can we be clear

						</b> The Committee will be well
aware of the concerns within the rail freight industry about the
Crossrail project. EWS, the largest commercial rail freight company in
the country, has provided the most vocal representation from the
industry in pronouncing concerns about the implication of the project
for freight transport. Mr. Graham Smith, the
planning director,
said:</div>
					<a name="07112318000265"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst
appreciating the importance of improving passenger traffic in London,
this must not be done at the expense of freight by
rail.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112318000266"><div class="hs_Para">EWS also tendered
a comprehensive submission to the Transport Committee last year, as I
am sure the hon. Member for Leicester, South and my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, South are
aware.</div>
					<a name="07112318000267"><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, I agree with the Transport Committee&#146;s conclusions on
the matters raised by EWS&#151;namely, that we all accept that the
freight industry has been beset by a number of problems, not only in
London, but across the country, that need to be addressed
appropriately. I am sure that almost every member of the Committee is
committed, as I am, to supporting the rail freight industry and to
persuading more freight off the roads and on to the railways. In
particular, Network Rail could and should do more to help freight. We
hope that every effort will be made to ensure that the freight industry
suffers no negative repercussions from
Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112318000268"><div class="hs_Para">I
support the general purpose of the clause&#151;namely, that the ORR
shall exercise its powers in a way that facilitates the effective
operation of Crossrail services. I take the point that freight is not
an issue for the bulk of Crossrail, but at either end of the route
there are implications concerning it. Therefore, I want the freight
industry to be reassured that there will be no negative impact to its
operations. I have tabled the amendment in an attempt to have regard
paid to commercial freight requirements. I hope that the Committee
looks favourably on
it.</div>
					<a name="07112318000269"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 40 is probing. I have already alluded to subsection (1), which
provides that the ORR should carry out its functions in a way that
facilitates the operation of Crossrail services. Subsection (5) allows
the ORR to disregard the provisions of subsection (1), provided that
the Secretary of State agrees. Why does the Minister at one stage want
the ORR to promote and facilitate the operation of Crossrail while, in
subsection (5), allowing it to act in a way that might hinder that?
That seems slightly odd. Will he explain exactly why subsection (5) is
there and what specific circumstances it is supposed to cover? I look
forward to his
response.</div>

							<b class="B">Susan
Kramer</b> (Richmond Park) (LD): I echo the concerns over the
role of freight. The amendment would be a neat way to bring the issue
back into the overall conversation and make it clear that there is a
significant freight issue in the construction and operation of
Crossrail. I say that in part as a
Londoner.</div>
					<a name="07112318000271"><div class="hs_Para">London&#146;s
major aggregate yards require freight to be able to use some of that
track. That would not turn the track into a freight line, but there
needs to be access to part of the Crossrail track&#151;for example,
if the aggregate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>depot at Acton is to be available. With all the construction in London
that is necessary and ongoing, it would be a devastating blow if that
freight access was all but killed before the entire project was
developed.</div>

expressed by the freight industry about the impact of Crossrail
services on line time. There are fears that freight will have
diminished time as a result. We had some very sizeable discussions in
that respect. I need the Minister&#146;s reassurance, because it
seems to me that subsection (5) says that if there is a clash of
interests on line time between Crossrail and freight services, the
Secretary of State can overrule the ORR and say that Crossrail is a
priority and that freight must therefore take another hit. I am not
saying that he will say that, but it could happen because of the
words</div>

Peter Soulsby:
						</b> The hon. Members for Northampton, South and
for Wimbledon have drawn attention to the consideration that the Select
Committee gave to the issue of freight. Some very real concerns were
expressed by the freight industry. We gave them considerable
consideration and to some extent we became expert on rail freight as a
result.</div>
				
					<a name="07112318000410"><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112318000275"><div class="hs_Para">It
was clear from our discussions with the promoters and the
representatives of the freight industry that there are real potentials
for conflict between freight usage on existing lines and the Crossrail
services. At the end of our consideration, we concluded that those were
not matters for which we could provide simple solutions. We were
reassured that the conversations that were clearly taking place could
ultimately lead to a satisfactory solution, but had not done so yet. It
was with that in mind that the Select Committee concluded by
saying:</div>
					<a name="07112318000401"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
look to the Committee in the House of Lords to ensure that Access
Option and any other remaining issues relating to the freight industry
are adequately
evaluated.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112318000276"><div class="hs_Para">That gives a
clear signal to the Committee in the House of Lords to return to
certain issues and that there are potential conflicts between freight
and Crossrail that need to be resolved.</div>
					<a name="07112318000277"><div class="hs_Para">With that in mind and with the
clear steer that I hope the Select Committee gave to our equivalent
Committee in the Lords, I suggest that although it is tempting to seek
to amend the Bill here in Committee and to try to do so in a piecemeal
fashion to accommodate the needs of freight, it would be more sensible
to recognise that the matter will be considered elsewhere. I hope that
the Bill will then come back with the conflicts resolved in a form to
which the Commons can give approval at a later
stage.</div>
					<a name="07112318000278"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000551">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> It will come as no surprise to the hon. Member for
Wimbledon that I cannot support his amendment. I draw his and other
Members&#146; attention to my letter of 7 November, copies of which
are available in the room and in which I explained in some detail why
the railway clauses are needed at this stage to protect the ability to
operate sufficient Crossrail services to secure the public benefits of
the project.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>
					<a name="07112318000279"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would undermine
that. To explain, as I did in my letter, I need to set the amendment in
the context of what the railway clauses are trying to achieve. By way
of background, access to the existing Network Rail network is subject
to the approval of the ORR. In reaching decisions, the ORR weighs a
range of general duties under section 4 of the Railways Act 1993.
Access contracts are then granted for periods of up to 10 years, or
longer in exceptional cases. These contracts then give priority in
bidding for train paths in the national railway timetabling process.
Once granted, access rights can be flexed and motivated under the
network code&#151;for example, to facilitate maintenance of the
railway&#151;but are normally not
rescinded.</div>
					<a name="07112318000280"><div class="hs_Para">The
Crossrail project affects the Network Rail network in the construction
phase because there will be works on the network itself. Crossrail
services will then run on it. The long title of the Bill makes it clear
that Crossrail is a transport system running between Maidenhead and
Heathrow via central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood. Through
services are not an optional extra, but they are key to securing the
public benefits of the Crossrail project. The intention is that Network
Rail will continue to own and operate the railway under ORR&#146;s
regulation and Crossrail services will share capacity with other
operators. This means that the regulation and the role of the ORR are
necessarily central to the delivery of the Crossrail project.</div>
					<a name="07112318000281"><div class="hs_Para">Although the ORR currently has
many but not all of the necessary powers in the Railways Act 1993 to
enable the delivery of Crossrail, there can be no certainty that future
decisions would enable Crossrail to be constructed and operated as
intended. This presents a problem because, in considering the project
in the context of a hybrid Bill, Parliament should be confident that
the relative importance that it and the Government place on Crossrail
services and that has been the basis for promoting the Bill should be
translated into a real train pattern.</div>
					<a name="07112318000282"><div class="hs_Para">Parliament then grants the
necessary outline approvals and powers for the Secretary of State, with
approval of details as necessary left to other bodies. This approach
should apply just as much to access to the railway network as it does
to compulsory purchase and planning approval. There is a real,
practical issue at stake here: &#163;16 billion cannot be spent
without being sure that the necessary construction activity can be
undertaken on the network and that a train service will be allowed to
operate that delivers the public benefits that justify the
investment.</div>
					<a name="07112318000283"><div class="hs_Para">To give
the necessary assurance on the delivery of the service, the Bill
provides that the ORR will have certain duties in relation to Crossrail
that override its existing general duties. However, that will not
affect the ORR&#146;s role on safety and fair charging. The Secretary
of State will play a part in establishing the overriding duty, notably
by specifying the minimum level of Crossrail services. The
specification will take into account the relative importance of
Crossrail services and the interests of other rail users. That builds
on her existing role in which she has a considerable say in the
utilisation of the network because she specifies franchised passenger
services.</div>
					<a name="07112318000284"><div class="hs_Para">The
ORR&#146;s overriding duty and the Secretary of State&#146;s
role&#151;which is hers alone and cannot be devolved to the Greater
London authority or Transport for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>London&#151;are strictly limited to Crossrail purposes. They should
also be regarded not as setting a precedent. A hybrid Bill for a
&#163;16 billion rail project that is dependent on access to the
existing network, if not unique, will, I expect, be very
rare.</div>
					<a name="07112318000285"><div class="hs_Para">These
railway clauses are largely reserve powers. The intention is to use
existing rail industry processes where possible. For example, an
application was made in July to the ORR by the Secretary of State and
Network Rail for approval under the Railways Act 1993 of an access
option that would grant access rights for Crossrail services. The
ORR&#146;s decision is not expected until the new year. It would be
premature to cut back the Bill&#146;s powers before that decision is
known. However, that should be in time for consideration of the Bill in
the other place, at which point those rail powers could be rescinded,
depending on the result of the application for the access
agreement.</div>
					<a name="07112318000286"><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
the detail of the amendments. Clause 23 deals with the interim period
between Royal Assent and Crossrail becoming operational. Its intention
is to ensure that Crossrail passenger services&#151;in effect
services going through the cross-London tunnel&#151;can use the
overground network and be integrated with it. Once operating at the
minimum levels for Crossrail passenger services specified by the
Secretary of State, the clause should ensure that the ORR does not
grant inconsistent access rights that run beyond the start of the
prospective principal Crossrail passenger services or conflict with
them. That is a sensible advance planning measure to reduce the risk of
conflicting access rights being granted that need to be removed once
Crossrail services come into
operation.</div>
					<a name="07112318000287"><div class="hs_Para">The result
of amendment No. 39 would be that while the ORR would receive the
Secretary of State&#146;s specification of the minimum level of
Crossrail services, that would form only the basis of the overriding
duty. The ORR would also have to consider whether commercial freight
requirements have been met. There would be little point in having such
an overriding duty, over and above the application of the ORR&#146;s
general
duties.</div>
					<a name="07112318000288"><div class="hs_Para">Although
a great deal of work has been done on dovetailing Crossrail services
and freight needs, there could ultimately be a conflict. If that arose,
it would have the potential to threaten the Crossrail project. As I
have already said, if a minimum level of Crossrail service is not
accommodated, the public benefits will not be realised that justify the
investment in the project. One cannot start construction simply in the
hope of gaining the necessary access rights at some indeterminate point
in the future. Clause 23(5), which amendment No. 40 would delete, is
needed to provide flexibility for the Secretary of State to consent to
the ORR not applying its overriding duty in relation to Crossrail
services that make use of the
tunnel.</div>
					<a name="07112318000289"><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, although I entirely accept that the needs of freight are
important, they have been given careful consideration at the project
development stage, in the hybrid Bill process and in the current
applications before the ORR. The amendment is a step too far because of
the potential damage to the delivery of the Crossrail project. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing
it.</div>

general provisions across the Bill to ensure that freight is protected,

					<a name="07112318000294"><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister rightly said, the clause deals with the interim period
between Royal Assent and the commencement of passenger services.
Subsection (7) gives the Minister the power to extend the so-called
interim period. The implication of such a move, as I understand it,
will be to lengthen the term during which the ORR&#146;s independence
is restricted by the terms of the clause.</div>
					<a name="07112318000295"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is designed to
put a time limit on the interim period, and hence on the time during
which the ORR is required to favour Crossrail in situations where it
might otherwise not. Once services are operational, should they
continue to have a preferred status at other parts of the network at
the expense of other passenger services?</div>
					<a name="07112318000296"><div class="hs_Para">Access contracts are clearly of
particular importance during the construction of the railway line. The
ORR will be obliged to follow the terms of the Bill and carry out its
duties in a manner so as to facilitate Crossrail services. However,
such an obligation does not need to be duly extended beyond the
completion of the construction phase, and that is why I have proposed
putting a time limit of six months on the so-called interim period.
That seems to be timely and rational.</div>

							<a name="07112318000554">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The amendment would affect the Secretary of
State&#146;s ability to extend the so-called interim period, as the
hon. Gentleman has said. That is the period between Royal Assent and
the first use of Crossrail passenger services. In that period, the ORR
has an overriding duty in the exercise of its access contract functions
to facilitate the operation of the prospective services.</div>
					<a name="07112318000298"><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State might
need to extend that period. For example, the Crossrail services are
expected to be phased in over a year, as was stated when the funding
announcement was made in October. For a new railway service of the
scale of Crossrail, it would be unwise to attempt to introduce
overnight the full 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>service to all destinations. With regard to access planning, it makes
sense for the ORR not to grant access rights that would frustrate the
phasing in of services over that period.</div>
					<a name="07112318000299"><div class="hs_Para">Once the Crossrail service is
fully in operation, it will have been granted the appropriate access
rights and Network Rail and the ORR would not then grant conflicting
access rights. Therefore, even if extended, the interim period has a
finite and useful life because of the protection that the clause
affords. Should the Secretary of State need to extend the interim
period, my expectation is that she would decide to do so within six
months of the commencement of commercial services, as the amendment
proposes. My concern is that an arbitrary deadline of six months would
not account for the unexpected and might be problematic.</div>
					<a name="07112318000300"><div class="hs_Para">There is, however, quite a lot

					<a name="07112318000305"><div class="hs_Para">Following
a number of amendments that I have proposed today, with which I have so
far failed to tempt the Minister, I feel quite strongly about this one
in particular. We have looked a number of times at what many people
might regard as not necessarily being the fullest provisions for proper
consultation. A proper consultation process ought to be incumbent on a
Secretary of State when they are making certain provisions and
orders.</div>
					<a name="07112318000306"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 24
allows the Government to set up minimum operating levels for principal
Crossrail services. Subsection (4) of the clause obliges the Secretary
of State to do so, having consulted Transport for London, passenger
services providers, and anyone else whom he &#147;considers
appropriate&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112318000307"><div class="hs_Para">I
would suggest that we need to include a significant group of people
whom the Minister may well consider appropriate, but who are missing
from the Bill and who ought to be included and place an absolute
obligation on the Secretary of State to consult them. That is the
people who will use the service&#151;the passengers themselves. As
those who will be profoundly affected by the minimum 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>operating levels for Crossrail, it seems obvious that, if service levels
are to be set or altered, passenger groups should be consulted
regardless, and not only if the Secretary of State considers that
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07112318000308"><div class="hs_Para">I
know that there are a number of excellent regional and national
passenger organisations that the Minister will have met in his role as
rail Minister; I certainly have in my role as shadow Minister. They
include Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch, and various groups in the
midlands. Those groups have much to say about the quality and operating
levels of services. It would be a gross oversight not to recognise the
value of the contribution that they make. To ignore them and not to put
an obligation for them to be consulted in the Bill would be a great
mistake.</div>
					<a name="07112318000309"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000557">Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I very much support the
inclusion of passenger groups as has been proposed in the amendment. In
my days on the board of Transport for London, advice from passenger
groups was crucial to understanding how to get the service right. It is
important particularly at a time when we need to ensure that there is
joined-up thinking and that we deliver what is properly integrated and
responsive to passengers&#146; needs. When a sum of about &#163;16
billion is being invested, it seems that not to give those groups the
high-priority profile that would be provided by including them in the
Bill would be to miss an opportunity. The amendment would show that
thinking has changed and that passengers are recognised as part of the
system in a railway that, too long, had the reputation of being an
arrangement that would work beautifully if people never bothered to get
on the trains. That change in thinking that needs to be
incorporated.</div>
					<a name="07112318000310"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000558">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I will preface my remarks by
pointing out, as I will repeat later on, that there is absolutely no
prospect of the Government ignoring passenger groups&#146; views
simply because that obligation is not in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112318000311"><div class="hs_Para">However, the
clause that the amendment seeks to affect is linked to clause 23. It is
an advanced planning measure that enables the Secretary of State, after
consulting, to specify minimum operating levels to establish principal
Crossrail passenger services from a specified date. Those services will
make use, for at least part of their journey, of the new tunnel under
central London. That direction, which must be published, sets the basis
for the Office of Rail Regulation&#146;s overriding duty under clause
23.</div>
					<a name="07112318000312"><div class="hs_Para">Before the
Secretary of State specifies the minimum operating levels, she must
consult Transport for London, the provider of any railway passenger
service likely to be affected by the direction and any such other
persons that she considers appropriate. The Secretary of State must
give due consideration to who, if anyone in addition to those
specified, needs to be consulted. If she did not do so, she would be
open to challenge in the courts. It is likely that rail passenger
groups would be included in the consultation.</div>
					<a name="07112318000313"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wimbledon
has not specified any particular organisation. However, the danger of
the amendment is that other groups may start claiming that they, too,
need to be specified or included in the long list of consultations and
the list could become long and
ill-defined.</div>
					<a name="07112318000314"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is not necessary. The Secretary of State will act as she
considers appropriate, taking account of her general policy and the
Department for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>Transport&#146;s general record in relation to
passenger group consultations. This is not a bad amendment, but it does
not add a great deal to the Bill. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw
it.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I listened carefully to the Minister. Let us
examine his logic. He has just said that we should not include in the
Bill the most important people, because doing so may bring in a load of
other people. If he wanted me to specify passenger groups&#151;if he
would accept my amendment and if they were included&#151;I would be
happy to ask leave to withdraw it and allow him to bring it back as a
Government amendment next week. However, if he is telling me that that
creates too wide an opportunity, why is he including passenger services
providers in the Bill? The Minister cannot have it both ways, but that
is what he is trying to do. He is wriggling, because he does not want
to be tempted into accepting one of my excellent amendments this

							<a name="07112318000581">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> The wording of the amendment means that we might
be about to rehearse the same argument as has just been articulated.
Its purpose is to ensure that appropriate consultation and an
appropriate consultation process are carried out. In the
present context, that should be prior to the adjustment by the Office
of Rail Regulation of the pre-commencement access contracts. Clause
26(4) gives the ORR power to require concerned parties to submit
proposals on how they should amend such access contracts, and the
Opposition welcome that. Giving the parties to agreements the power at
least to contribute to the decision-making process of the regulator
will greatly improve the chances of effective modifications to such
agreements.</div>
					<a name="07112318000344"><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) says that the ORR must consult the Secretary of State as part of
that process. We welcome that too, especially as it puts the ORR under
no particular obligation to abide by the Secretary of State&#146;s
directions. The requirement is one of consultation only. However, the
consultation procedure ends there, and it seems short-sighted to
presume that no one else will be affected at that stage by the changes
to pre-commencement access contracts. The amendment is intended to
ensure that the ORR is open to the concerns of other appropriate and
relevant parties and that it consults them in a relevant and
appropriate
fashion.</div>
					<a name="07112318000345"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000582">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The amendment would require the ORR to invite
representations from parties other than the Secretary of State when it
considered that an access contract needed amending if use of the
railway facility to which the contract related would be affected by the
construction of Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112318000346"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is not strictly
necessary, but I accept that it might have some merit, so I would like
to consider it with officials in the Department. The ORR does not need
authority to consult as widely as it considers appropriate, because
nothing in clause 26 prevents it from doing that already. The ORR would
in practice need to consult at least the parties to the affected access
contracts before it could decide whether and how the contracts needed
amending. Subsection (4) enables the ORR to require the parties to
propose the directions that should be given. The ORR has established
consultation policies and a track record of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>facilitating a very open process on access matters, so the decision on
what is appropriate consultation can be trusted to it. I have explained
my position on the amendment. However, if the hon. Gentleman insists on

against it.</div>

will be happy to withdraw it. The clause also relates to

of principal Crossrail services, as opposed to those that concern the
construction of the Crossrail network itself. It gives the Secretary of
State the power to object to any perceived conflict between the
specified minimum operating levels of Crossrail set by him and any
existing access contracts as identified by the ORR. That is my
understanding, at any rate. That effectively puts more power in the

introduce some accountability into the process.</div>

a requirement to consult being necessary in any case. The ORR is
already likely to be in touch with the parties to access contracts and
to establish what would prejudice the operation of the principal
Crossrail passenger services. The Secretary of State would decide
whether she objects to that contract. If she does object, the ORR would
be in touch with the affected parties anyway and regulations would
provide for the carrying out by the ORR of its functions, which could
involve consulting interested persons. If she does not object, I am not
clear what use the ORR would have for information on whom, if anyone,
she consulted in reaching that decision. At the risk of disappointing

that may affect the operation of the principal Crossrail passenger

effect may still be in existence at the time of Royal Assent, and the
clause enables them to be modified. Clause 33 also deals with the
modification of access contracts. In both cases, where such
modification was required, there would

of, and amending other contracts because of, Crossrail access

						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in clause 28,
page 19, line 2, at end
insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Subsection (4)
applies only where a compensatory arrangement has been reached, which
is enforceable by the Office of Rail
Regulation.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07112318000370"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed to ensure that there is a fair deal for those
potentially or actually adversely affected by the terms of clause 28.
The clause gives the rail regulator the power either to direct a
facility owner to enter into an access contract with a prospective
Crossrail passenger service provider or to amend existing access
contracts that he may have at the request of the would-be service
provider. When doing that, the Office of Rail Regulation is not allowed
to make the parties to the affected contract change the amounts payable
under that contract. That means that a situation could arise whereby a
facility owner is forced to allow a third party far greater access to
his facility than before, but without the commensurate financial
compensation or reward. In other words, it seems that the power granted
under the clause allows the possibility that the facility owner will
give something away and make extra provision, yet receive nothing in
return.</div>
					<a name="07112318000371"><div class="hs_Para">I grant that
subsection (5) gives the ORR the power to review the appropriate access
charges, but the key point is that the financial provisions of the
contract previously agreed to by the parties cannot necessarily change.
When the parties are forced by the ORR to alter the terms of the
contract, it is likely that one of them will suffer financially. For
that loss, there ought to be a compensation process provided for by the
ORR.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>
					<a name="07112318000372"><div class="hs_Para">Elsewhere in
the Bill, compensation is offered to parties adversely affected by
powers granted to the Secretary of State and the rail regulator. For
me, it follows that those who are forced to amend existing access
contracts should also be entitled to the appropriate financial
reimbursement and compensation. That strikes me as a just and
responsible thing to
do.</div>
					<a name="07112318000373"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000594">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Clause 28 deals with two
matters. The matter relevant to the amendment is that the clause
secures the amendment of any remaining conflicting access rights when
they are outside the central tunnel area and are applied for in order
to complement Crossrail passenger services. To explain that further, it
is possible that a prospective Crossrail operator could not reach an
agreement on access rights with a facility owner outside the central
tunnel area. They will therefore ask the ORR to direct proceedings
under section 17 of the Railways Act 1993. When that procedure is
invoked, there may be existing access contracts that conflict with the
principal Crossrail passenger service, in which case the ORR needs the
power to amend
them.</div>
					<a name="07112318000374"><div class="hs_Para">The clause does
not permit amendment to access charges without undertaking an access
charge review under the 1993 Act. That would be the appropriate rail
industry mechanism for ensuring that there is a resetting to the
correct access charge payment between the parties affected by the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07112318000375"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would interfere with the ORR&#146;s ability to amend the
access charges. That would be a perverse result for the holder of
access rights that are being amended as a consequence of Crossrail
contracts. If compensation is appropriate, it can be considered
separately. There does not need to be a power under the Bill to provide
for it. We have given undertakings to the industry during the Select
Committee stage of the Bill that we will, wherever possible, use
industry mechanisms, which have associated compensation arrangements.
That is the preferred solution of the industry. Where we need to adapt
those mechanisms, we will seek to agree suitable compensation
provisions with the ORR. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Member for
Wimbledon enough for him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07112318000595">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I have listened intently to the Minister all
afternoon, but I must have missed something in those remarks. I do not
understand how the amendment would affect the ORR&#146;s powers of
financial compensation. At the moment, the ORR is not allowed to make
the parties to the affected contract change the amount payable under
that contract. As the Minister says, there is a power to review the
appropriate access charges, but I do not understand how the amendment
affects that. I think that it would give more protection to railway
facility owners. From what the Minister says, I am still not clear how
it would diminish that. I would be grateful if he could clarify that
point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112318000596">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> My understanding is that the
effect of the amendment would be to interfere with the ORR&#146;s
ability to conduct an access charge review, where it is necessary as a
consequence of the amendment of access contracts that conflict with the
Crossrail service contracts. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>That is an accepted industry process. Because it introduces an
obligation on the ORR, the amendment interferes with its current
obligations.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I thought that this was going
to be relatively straightforward. Although the amendment may place
another obligation upon the ORR, I cannot understand how it conflicts
with the obligation that is already there. Will the Minister have
another go at trying to reassure me that this is something that
detracts rather than is additional? Looking at the wording of my
amendment, and from my understanding of the clause, notwithstanding his
explanations, that is exactly what the amendment does. It does not
detract, but is
additional.</div>

it is additional, but I do not see the need for it, given that the
industry measures that we are committed to using as part of the process
for resolving those conflicts already exist and our undertaking that
industry processes will be preferred to putting them on the face of the
Bill.</div>
