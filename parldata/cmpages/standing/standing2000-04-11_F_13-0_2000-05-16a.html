<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we commence proceedings, I have two brief announcements to make. Government new clause 7 has been printed on page 1182 of the amendment paper instead of page 1188, and on the selection list amendment No. 255 should be listed under clause 73, not clause 72.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 21, line 21, at end insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Good morning, Mr. Benton, on this beautiful morning. We now come to a new subject, that of the adult learning inspectorate. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Office for Standards in Education will be responsible for all colleges that teach any 16 to 19-year-old students. For post-19 provision there will be a new adult learning inspectorate.
<P>
It is worth noting that later on in the Bill we shall come to the question of how Ofsted and the adult learning inspectorate will work together, and what role will be played by Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools in setting a common inspection framework.
<P>
The amendments relate in the first place to the composition of the adult learning inspectorate. We hope that although some have characterised the adult learning inspectorate as a junior partner in the process that I have described, it still has an important role to play. Will the Minister tell us about the Government's thinking on the composition of the adult learning inspectorate? Implicit in amendment No. 211 is the question why the Government have chosen nine as the number of members on that body. Will that figure enable the adult learning inspectorate to contain a sufficient breadth of experience? There must be a reason for the Minister's choice of that figure.
<P>
We note that the membership and the chairman are to be appointed by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 205 is designed to probe the Minister on the need for members of the adult learning inspectorate to have relevant experience. Subsection (5) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience relevant to the Inspectorate's functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would like to hear more about that. Under the provision, although the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability of having an experienced person, could he none the less, after having due regard, appoint somebody without experience? In what circumstances might that happen?
<P>
We would like to hear from the Minister, therefore, about the composition of the adult learning inspectorate, the number of members and their experience.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> Good morning, Mr. Benton. Given that this is the first amendment to Part III, it may be helpful if I set out the Government's thinking behind the inspection provisions before I deal with amendment No. 211 in detail.
<P>
I believe that the Government have put forward a logical series of proposals, designed to create a rigorous and independent inspection regime. I doubt whether there is anything between us in the Committee on the need for rigour in the inspection process.
<P>
If we are to succeed in raising the quality of post-16 education and training, we need to reform inspection. There are currently too many fragmented methods of inspection. For example, the Training Standards Council and the Further Education Funding Council each separately inspects adult basic skills, and, as we know, Ofsted is also involved. That is three inspectorates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): In the early stages of his remarks, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary passed rather cursorily over an assertion on which I should like to ask him to expand. He said that if we are to improve the standards of education and training post-16—which I believe we can take as a common objective—it is necessary to reform the inspectorates. He is not implying by that, I trust, that the work that has already been done by the FEFC inspectorate and by the Training Standards Council—and indeed by Ofsted in relation to its role—has been wasted. Will he make it absolutely clear to the Committee that they have played a positive role, and will he explain why reshuffling them is likely to produce better results?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The inspectorates have played a significant part in helping to raise standards of education and training in this country, and we pay tribute to their work. That should not be in doubt. However, the Committee is considering a Learning and Skills Bill which will produce a new regime for post-16 education and training, and we feel that reform of the inspectorate follows logically from that.
<P>
I was making the point that at the moment, given where we want to move to, the position is too fragmented. I have given one example. Another is that A-levels and what are now called vocational A-„levels are inspected separately by both Ofsted and FEFC. School sixth forms are inspected by Ofsted, whereas identical provision in further education colleges is inspected by the FEFC. I hope that that adds to my explanation to the hon. Gentleman of why we feel that reform is needed.
<P>
The frequency of inspection also varies. There are no shared assessment arrangements, grading systems, report formats, post-inspection requirements, intervention arrangements or performance indicators. It is no wonder that there are such large and unacceptable variations in performance between providers of post-16 education and training.
<P>
In this part of the Bill, beginning with clause 50, we are trying to create for the first time a coherent approach to post-16 inspection. The Bill creates a new, fully independent adult learning inspectorate to take on inspection of all post-19, non-higher education learning and all government-funded work-based training. It expends the remit of Ofsted to inspect provision for 16 to 19-year-olds undergoing education outside schools. The Bill provides for a common post-„16 inspection framework, and it makes provision for area inspections and for joint inspections where the remit of two inspectorates overlaps, notably in FE colleges.
<P>
The creation of the adult learning inspectorate is therefore an essential part of our reform of post-16 inspection. It will work with Ofsted to create a rigorous and independent method of improving the effectiveness of post-16 education and training.
<P>
We have listened very carefully indeed to the views of providers, and have spent some time explaining our proposals in detail to them. We have made it clear that where ALI—I am afraid the adult learning inspectorate is destined to be known as ALI, and no doubt it will be one of the greatest inspectorates—
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Very good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It was not that good. Where ALI and Ofsted work together on joint inspections there will be a single inspection, producing a single report based on the common inspection framework. Since we have made our intentions clear, the early concerns expressed by some FE colleges, in particular in response to the ``Learning to Succeed'' White Paper, have been shown to be unfounded.
<P>
Having briefly explained the context, I turn to amendment No. 211. I cannot but conclude that it would allow a future Government, confident of securing a majority in both Houses of Parliament, to reduce the number of members to, say, one. The amendment is far too broad. That may not be the hon. Gentleman's intention, but the amendment would give far too much leeway to any future Government with dishonourable intentions. It could certainly allow a future Government to specify an unusual number of members, and there is no need for it. The Government looked carefully at the size of both non-Departmental Government bodies created by the Act. We decided that the LSC should have between 12 and 16 members, as we have debated, and that the ALI should have nine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister explain how, if in the light of experience during the planning and development of the new body it was decided that it would be advantageous to have a wider range of experience, the Government or anybody else would go about increasing the number of members?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As I have said, we have made a judgment that, given the inspectorate's functions, nine seems the right number. It is difficult to argue precisely why nine is better than 10 or eight, but for the LSC, which has wider functions, we feel that 12 to 16 members is right, and for the ALI, nine. That would allow for a range of experience, which could include some members with direct experience of inspections in the sector. Others may have experience of, say, industrial training or community learning, or might have an interest in basic skills. We are certainly not looking for people who have come directly from the post-16 inspection process in every case. From time to time, having someone with experience of inspection in a different area could be useful, should such people present themselves for membership.
<P>
The inspectorate must be knowledgeable and competent in the full range of adult education and work-based training. Nine is the number that we believe is consistent with that requirement and will allow the inspectorate to make informed decisions rapidly. It also reflects the fact that ALI will be a smaller and more specialist body than the LSC. The LSC has a much wider and more complex remit, and that was the thinking behind the relative numbers of the two. I am, therefore, not attracted to an amendment that allows an unlimited number of people to be added to or subtracted from the ALI, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) also argued eloquently for amendment No. 205 and I appreciate his arguments. Nonetheless, there are some awkward aspects to the amendment, which would put a much tighter constraint on the Secretary of State when he was appointing members of the adult learning inspectorate.
<P>
First, I recognise that to ``ensure'' that a person has the relevant experience is a stronger duty than to ``have regard''. But in making appointments to the ALI, the Secretary of State will need some flexibility. It is quite probable that he will want to consider the balance of experience between candidates, as well as their professional calibre. Not every candidate will have the full experience of the inspectorate's functions, of course, and there may need to be a balancing act to ensure that there is the necessary collective competence.
<P>
For those reasons I prefer the existing wording of clause 50(5), which is the form used in statute for many other non-departmental public bodies. ``To have regard'' to the desirability of appointing someone with relevant experience is, in any event, quite a significant duty on the Secretary of State. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Hertsmere will not press amendment No. 205.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, including the wider remarks that he made as a preface to this part of the Bill. We share the objective of a rigorous inspection system and we shall talk later about whether that is likely to be achieved by the Government's proposals.
<P>
I note the comments the Minister made about the existing system, but the simplicity, as he would have it, of what the Government want to do has not been self-evident to those who have considered the Bill, especially clause 68. I note that authorities such as Lord Dearing, who is in a good position to know, have been critical of the complexity and we shall want to debate in some detail the system of inspections, partnerships and frameworks that the Government seek to put in place. I mention that simply by way of preface.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am more satisfied with the Minister's response to amendment No. 205 than amendment No. 211. I did not press amendment No. 205 with any great vigour; the amendment was intended to allow us to explore the question of experience. Although the Minister did not tell us a great deal more about how the Government intend to go about appointing people, I shall not press that.
<P>
I am less happy with the Minister's response to the matters raised by amendment No. 211. He is making heavy weather of this, and some of his remarks about future Governments were erring on the fanciful. No one is suggesting that a future government of any persuasion will sabotage the provisions or use the effect of this amendment to appoint a membership of only one.
<P>
Our purpose is to give a little more flexibility in the light of experience. As yet, the adult learning inspectorate has not come into operation and who knows what conclusions may be drawn once it has. We know that once it begins, the Secretary of State will be unable to alter the number of its members. He has fixed the number at nine. I appreciate that the Government have reached a judgment on this, but it is always possible later on, with the benefit of experience, to reach a different one. If this or any other Government changes their mind, they will be unable to alter the size of the inspectorate's membership.
<P>
I cannot see why the Government are so keen to set the number in stone, especially as the Minister has told us that they chose to have a flexible figure for the Learning and Skills Council. I appreciate that the Minister argued for a larger number on the LSC, but the Government's approach was to be flexible. They could have specified a number from nine to 12 for the adult learning inspectorate, but they have tied themselves to nine. I am mystified and not entirely happy with the Minister's response on this beautiful morning. He has made rather heavy weather of the amendment, but I am not so dissatisfied that I wish to press it to a vote, and I am conscious of the need to make progress. Overall, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am afraid that on this clause my hon. Friend, who could be described as half-persuaded of Hertsmere, is joined by disgruntled of Daventry. We know that it is hot and that the Bill is moving, if not towards a climax, at least steadily on its way to the conclusion of its consideration. We are not seeking to throw a spanner in the works, but the Minister's somewhat studied and peremptory response to these important issues about the inspectorate was rather perfunctory.
<P>
If I speak about this matter now, as the Minister did on the amendment, it is because general considerations need to be out of the way and on the record at an early stage. We can then get on with details that are equally important for different reasons, particularly because they are often germane to the question of how joint inspections will work and the good relationship, between the inspectorates that we seek.
<P>
I am sure that, given good will, any system can be made to work to some extent, and I hope that, if the Government are bent on this structure, it will work. We will not seek to subvert that or to make it more difficult. That is very much the spirit of some of the amendments, either of a probing or an improving nature, that we have tabled for later.
<P>
As the Minister said earlier, the FEFC inspectorate to date has done a very good job. It has not only established recording of performance in further education, but has produced a model for improvement in individual colleges, whether there are concerns on either the education or the Government side, and in various sectors of activity, such as agricultural classification or 16 to 19 provision. That is a good sign. The Training Standards Council is a new creation. I have visited it in the past 12 months in my new capacity as Front-Bench spokesman. This must be the first occasion on which the Government have swallowed one of their own children. They set it up in their time—not that I wish to suggest they should not have done so—and are now subsuming it in a wider activity. I know David Sherlock, and have great respect for what the council has set out to do in the provision of workplace training, which is an area that both sides of the Committee will feel is under-examined.
<P>
I am not trying to attack Ofsted, and I do not imagine that Government Back Benchers will wish to do so. It has done much excellent work. I was reminding myself of the statement of Her Majesty's chief inspector on the six principles underpinning Ofsted's work. Those are entirely unexceptional and important. I should say en passant that Ofsted is having its remit extended at the other end as well—the Care Standards Bill dealing with nursery provision is shortly to be considered—so it already covers a wide field.
<P>
The next general point is that there is a step change at the age of 16, but it is not quite as the Government have expressed it. That is the moment at which compulsory education ends and voluntary participation begins, which is relevant because not only are young people up to the age of 16 entitled to receive education, but they must attend. I do not want to make too much of that, but there is a monopoly relationship, certainly in the state sector. Therefore, the Government have a duty and a remit to ensure inspection and observation. If nothing else, on reaching the age of 16, young people—and their parents, in so far as they influence decisions—may be able to vote with their feet and choose to move between providers if they do not like what is on offer, so there is a consumer element. That has developed with the two inspectorates, and was encapsulated by my noble Friend Baroness Blatch during some thoughtful contributions on the Bill from all sides in the other place. She said that Ofsted was observational and the FEFC was evaluative, giving rise to certain differences in tradition.
<P>
Many of us—I do not think that this is a party political point—feel that the involvement of an FEFC staff member was at all times helpful and constructive. I notice some assent from Labour Members. Because they were dealing with adults or people who were volunteers and nearly adults, the style that they adopted was less directional and more participative.
<P>
There is also a leitmotif going through the clauses setting up the adult learning inspectorate, the extension of Ofsted powers and the framework for joint inspections. According to Lord Dearing—whose experience of this area is second to none and who does not come with a party political handle—the ALI will see itself as subordinate to the chief inspector. That will be a difficult relationship, and as I walked into the Committee I was searching for a suitable analogy. I am not trying to raise the temperature or even tame the Committee, but it seems to me that we may be reinventing by the back door a scenario whereby, in the words of the prayer book, one spouse in this joint framework of inspection will be required to obey the other and the other will say in a mock generous way, ``And with all my worldly goods I thee endow.'' There will be no question of sharing or partnership. I am sure that that is not what the Government want, but when one partner is on top and calling the shots and the other is seen as the subordinate partner, a different dynamism is created in the relationship. We could spin analogies till the cows come home. I do not intend to do that, but there must be some sensitivity in establishing the system.
<P>
As a further, general point, even if the Government are bent on a particular structure, they have not followed the logic of their position. If the needs and aspirations of young people between the ages of 16 and 19 were considered to be qualitatively different from those of older learners or trainees, it would have been possible—although not necessarily very popular, certainly in some quarters—for the Government to say that, subject to the framework—all provision for 16 to 19-year-olds should be the within the remit of Ofsted and the rest should be the responsibility of the adult learning inspectorate. The Government are denying the logic of their own position by—rightly, in my view—providing that the work-based training of young people should be within the remit of the adult learning inspectorate. There is therefore no great principle that the Government can adduce to what they have proposed They certainly owe it to the Committee to explain more clearly what they have in mind.
<P>
Before the Ministers try to smoke me out on this, I repeat what I said at the beginning of my speech: we have to work with whatever structure we will inherit on returning to government. I have a strong predisposition against changing settled arrangements, particularly when they have already been changed dramatically shortly after their creation. We shall have to see how the joint framework works in practice or whether, as I hope, the fears that I have expressed to the Committee do not become reality. If that is the case, I shall be as happy as the Minister.
<P>
However, I would have taken what I hope would have been a rather more evolutionary and—dare I say it—conservative approach. I see the logic of having the further education inspectorate, as it was, and the Training Standards Council together in one organisation; that seems tidy. I see their remit as being, appropriately, the existing remit of those two bodies—including sixth form colleges within the further education sector, if I may used shorthand—not least because such colleges often provide predominantly for 16 to 19-year-olds, but also make significant provision, maybe in the evenings, for adults. In my own tertiary college, which is not a sixth form college, there is not a blurring of the roles but an increasing mixture of the delivery across the various age groups. My approach would have been at least less disturbing of existing arrangements.
<P>
On the subject of independence, which is consistent with HM Chief Inspector's principles, there is a case for separating funding from inspection. I shall not argue the logic of the Minister's position on that: he could have had a separate inspectorate evolving out of the existing arrangements and dealing with adult and post-16 education other than where it was delivered in schools.
<P>
I have two more points for the Minister's consideration. First, there is concern—and rightly—about the relatively low number of inspections of sixth form provision in schools. It does not need an Act of Parliament to change that, but it may need an change of policy emphasis. Secondly, if Ministers are anxious to iron out anomalies, they may wish to consider the model of ESTYN in Wales where the whole provision is covered by a single inspectorate. If we were worried about demarcation disputes, that would be a logical structure, although it is not the one that I have advocated to the Committee.
<P>
In questioning the principles on which the Government are proceeding, I believe the Ministers should spend a little more time explaining to the Committee what they are about and looking at the practical consequences of their actions. Such matters should not be glossed over or accepted as edicts from Government. The Government need to defend their position, as they attempted to do with not wholly satisfactory results in another place, and they need to rest assured that whatever structure is achieved, there is no implication from the Opposition of ill will towards it, because we would like it to work, censorship of individuals or any attempt to rubbish it. We will do our best to encourage it to work. We seek merely to know what the Minister has in mind and for the Committee to have the clearest possible understanding of what is proposed and why Ministers believe that it has a unique virtue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I rise with trepidation in following the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) in so far as he has long, deep and detailed experience of such matters, whereas I readily admit that I speak from my own observations in respect of inspection.
<P>
This may not be the appropriate time to say so, but it seems to me that the platform on which the inspection method is based is somewhat out of date. If we look more closely at what industry has been doing for the last 20 years, it has become much more a question of high-quality self inspection—cell working, exchanging information and quality circles where good practice is exchanged—rather than this imposed-from-somewhere-else type of walk-in inspection which may last a few days or weeks and put everybody under pressure. I recognise from what has been happening with Ofsted that it is not universally popular.
<P>
The old-fashioned inspection procedures—and I do not mean that to be entirely uncomplimentary, but not up to date, not modernised—are simply one more round of inspection in a system that will include the Learning and Skills Council, which will have a duty to ensure value for money and good results; companies that will make major contributions through various channels and that will make up their own minds as to whether they are getting value for money; and, finally, the students and the relationships that they develop with their lecturers.
<P>
Recently, inspection may have had some successes but it has not been an unqualified success. Let me tell the Committee an anecdote about a good friend of mine. Before he went into further education he worked in private industry as a cost accountant. He then qualified as an accountant and took a degree in accountancy law. After that, he gained a teaching certificate and has now worked in further education for 20 years. A couple of years ago, when the training and enterprise councils in their formative years were looking at so-called output funding, they laid down certain rules and regulations in order to be tight and to focus on the quality of the courses. My friend decided that he would have to discuss with his students what they wanted to learn on his accountancy course.
<P>
I may say that for a number of years my friend has achieved some of the best results with his students in the whole of Europe: a 70 per cent. odd pass rate at the highest level year on year is his average, following European conventions in the accounting profession. He was faced with output finding from the TEC, which tended to be very focused about what it wanted. He had to discuss with his students what they wanted to learn, how they wanted to learn it, and he had to write a foolscap sheet of paper about negotiations with the students.
<P>
He decided that he had had enough when his work was to be inspected by a person from the TEC, who turned out not to be an accountant, a teacher, or anyone who knew anything about accountancy law, but a 26-year-old person. It is great to be 26, and one should never knock inexperience because we all learn in time. However, my friend was told that he had not spent enough time negotiating with his students about what they wanted.
<P>
My friend received dozens of thank-you letters from companies and from students year on year. When the opportunity for redundancy came along, he thought he might as well build up his private practice because he had had enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments, which are most helpful to the Committee, and I have a good deal of sympathy with them. Would he not accept also that, although it is extremely important to satisfy the flows of public money in governance to colleges, the FEFC should take an interest in the activities of colleges? At the moment, possibly as a result of the introduction of external audit, concerns are being expressed by governors who are business people and by chief executives of further education colleges that they are being ``done over'' and that the inspections and the requests that are being made of them are not always reasonable and proportionate to the alleged offences or technical problems they may have encountered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I perhaps share some common experiences. I make my comments out of concern for the further education system and all that it means, particularly in places such as the west midlands, which relies wholly on the further education system to pick up the many people who would not otherwise receive any technical education if it were not for our further education colleges. This is not an attack on the Bill, which has many fine features. I merely plead for a much lighter touch than we have been experiencing.
<P>
I will continue with the short narrative about my friend in further education. He built up his private practice, and he is doing very well, dealing mainly with small companies and partnerships, sometimes sole traders. However, the college could not find many people prepared to teach the part of the course that he had covered so well for so many years, so he agreed to go back just to do that.
<P>
So far, so good. This year he anticipates fine results again. However, he is packing it in and will not do any more after the end of the summer for the simple reason that, once again, he is being inspected—``done over'' was the phrase used by the hon. Member for Daventry—by somebody not even fit to lick his boots. That is the top and tail of it. It is so demeaning and degrading to have an inspector come up with feeble reasons why he is not fit to teach in further education. Never mind the results of so many years, never mind the fact that his students are among the best in Europe: he has really not quite got it. If he has not quite got it, he thinks it is perhaps time to pack it in again.
<P>
His services, which are practical and backed up by good qualifications, are subject to what I call the educational bureaucracy's—excuse the unparliamentary language—bugger's muddle, where nobody is coalescing all the different arms of inspection. We could develop—and will in time, I am sure—a straight-line relationship between the Learning and Skills Council and its efforts to co-„ordinate colleges and employers, with students supreme at the top of that little pyramid.
<P>
In the meantime, I ask only that Ministers listen to this unexpert testimony, which is, nevertheless, based on many years of experience. People are fed up with being done over, over-inspected and not trusted. They want to teach their students to the best of their ability. They are looking for guidance, but they want to be involved in peer groups, and not have groups of people imposed on them who are not really up to the job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I do not think that it would be helpful to go over my opening remarks, which detailed why the existing inspection systems, whatever their successes—and I pay tribute to the work of the three inspectorates—are not adequate to deal with the legislation now before the Committee and the new policy strategy that as we are developing. We want to bring greater coherence to the inspection process as I described. We are extending the remit of Ofsted so that it can cover all education for 16 to 18 year olds.
<P>
I talked also about the muddle, using the example of basic skills, three inspectorates are currently operating. That is inappropriate. However, we believe that two inspectorates are necessary because of the particular requirements relating to adult learning and workplace training.
<P>
When we come to the 16 to 18-year-old group it makes sense to have one inspectorate, namely Ofsted, doing the inspection, whether that education is taking place in a school, sixth form, sixth form college or an FE college. That brings greater coherence and enables us to look more rationally at both national and local provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister explain why it is possible to have a single inspectorate in Wales covering all the provision, whereas it is necessary to have two in England? Will he also explain why, if it is necessary to have a single inspectorate in England addressing itself to the education of 16 to 19-year olds, a completely separate inspectorate, which otherwise does not bear on this age group, should be responsible for inspecting their training?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Although we are developing a close interface between the inspection regimes, we recognise that training in the workplace is a different ball game from education in the more conventional academic setting. It requires different expertise and, although I cannot comment on the individual case, the hon. Member for Daventry has talked about the need for relevance and experience among inspectors. We are talking about different things, but we are being coherent, at least in the numbers game, by having two rather than three inspectorates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I must press the Minister on this matter. I realise that he may be at a disadvantage because his Welsh colleague, the Under-Secretary of State, Wales Office, is not here, but why is it possible in the interests of coherence to have a single inspectorate in Wales, but to require two in England? Would it not hypothetically be possible to have a single inspectorate with different panels for bits of the inspection, which can inform each other? Will the Minister explain why there is one set of provisions for one case and a different set for another?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As has been noted already, the Ofsted agenda has been extended and will extend further if the Bill becomes law. Many people would think it was a step too far to have one inspectorate covering everything. Although we want a great deal of interface between the two inspectorates—and there will be—we recognise that work-based training is different from the more conventional academic education in the school sixth form, the sixth form college and so on.
<P>
On Wales, throughout future legislation we may have many debates about why, on occasion, colleagues in Wales or Scotland choose different policy details from those chosen in England. The House has to accept the logic of devolution. If it did not bring difference and diversity, people might ask what was the point. It is for our colleagues in the Welsh Assembly to make such judgments for their country and they have done so; we are responsible for England and we have made our judgments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way yet again. Will he concede, at least for the record, that the Welsh integrated inspectorate pre-dates the act of devolution?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I think that I can concede that point. The hon. Gentleman will have a better memory of that than I do. I do not mean this pejoratively, but we now have to be grown up about our discussions and the logic of devolution. Although it may be an interesting debating point, it would not be very helpful if, every time the Scots or the Welsh make different judgments about precise public administration arrangements, we use it a way of attacking one country or another. It is the logic of devolution that local people, locally elected will make local decisions. It is too warm to do so, but if anything we should celebrate that diversity rather than bemoaning it. Wales is a smaller country than England. It may be that those making that local judgment felt that one inspectorate system was appropriate there. Our judgment, for the larger territory of England, is that two inspectorates are required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I follow what the Minister is saying and I too can applaud diversity. However, I assume that I should not infer from his remarks that if one of the territories of the United Kingdom chose to do something differently, we in the rest of the UK should not be prepared to see whether it was the best way to do it and modify our behaviour in accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Indeed. That is an important point. I often worry that on public policy we are not as good as we should be about learning from international experience. We are not good at that sort of comparative analysis, although we are getting better. I say that to the right hon. Gentleman because, in this early decade or two of the 21st century, we shall be able to draw on comparisons from within the United Kingdom. That will be interesting for Parliament and Governments in the future.
<P>
As with many things, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and I should like to point to the area inspections that are now taking place as an example of good practice and how different regimes are working well together. That suggests that some of the early concerns about how the two inspectorates will work together in practice are misplaced. When members of Committee read the document ``Inspecting Post-16 Education and Training: Informal Consultation on The Common Inspection Framework'' they will be encouraged by the fact that the three existing inspectorates—Ofsted, the inspectorate from FEFC and the Training Standards Council—have produced a useful and thoughtful document that is out for consultation.
<P>
The different inspectorates have different histories—one a very recent one as the hon. Gentleman remarked—and they have different traditions. We are concerned that the new system should build on the best of each. Synergy is the name of the game, especially through the framework. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) talked about self assessment and self evaluation, and hon. Members will see that there is a very useful discussion about self assessment in the document. I myself have never seen self assessment or self evaluation, whether in the workplace, in education or anywhere else, as an alternative to inspection. Some would put that forward as an argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> That is an important point. For many years, our very best world-class companies have forgone inspection in the traditional sense. They work in cells, have quality circles, and ensure that best practice is shared throughout the group. The imposition of some kind of inspection group does not work any longer. People have to be in charge of what they are doing. Self assessment is just a small part of that relatively new process in which inspection is built in and quality is assured—get it right first time, every time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We should not be drawn into a long discussion, and I am not expert enough to do so, about the different situations of a company, large or small, and an education system funded by the taxpayer in which central Government and LEAs have a role to play on behalf of the public and parents. We can learn lessons, but they are rather different cases. My argument would be that we need to get the balance right between external inspection and self assessment.
<P>
I note and, for what it is worth, I very much approve of the statement in this consultation paper from the three inspectorates, which says, among other things:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Inspectors' evaluation of leadership and management [in the education institution], including a provider's quality assurance arrangements, will take into account self-assessment and its outcomes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, modern inspection in education considers, among other things, self assessment within the school or college or whatever it might be, and I look forward to the outcome of that consultation.
<P>
I have dwelt on self assessment, partly because my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East made some interesting points about it, but also to emphasise that the current inspectorates study best practice across the inspection regimes to develop ideas for inspection in the future. That is very helpful.
<P>
I do not believe that we should prolong the discussion on clause stand part for much longer. There will be ample opportunity throughout the rest of this morning and perhaps this afternoon to dwell on particular aspects of the inspection system that we are recommending to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a constructive debate in drawing out some of the issues. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East for what he said about how modern industry sets about training its staff and how it encourages people to drive on to higher quality. To make a general point, one of the most constructive aspects of modern industrial relations is that we have stopped telling people how badly they are doing and started to encourage them to do better.
<P>
As my right. hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) pointed out, in discussing self assessment one has to remember that the Delphic oracle, who had a 900-year track record, never, as far as I know, opined on the importance of inspection regimes, but did advise those who consulted her to know themselves. That is an important part of the job, particularly for adults or persons approaching adult years.
<P>
The Minister reasonably enough said that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. Of course that is right, and we would not wish to signal by anything that we say or do that we wish to destroy that process. We hope that it will be successful. Equally, however—to pick up his analogy—the proof of his sensitivity on some of the points of logic was shown by his wriggling to get off the various hooks on which the logic had impaled him.
<P>
I do not believe that this can be described as a logically defensible structure. As one of my noble Friends said bluntly in another place, it is a dog's breakfast. It is possible that dogs need their breakfast or that they can live with the breakfast they have, but it is not an ideal arrangement, and the Opposition need to register our concern by voting against the clause.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 69, line 8, after `member', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or chairman'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now move to the detailed schedule that makes provision for the adult learning inspectorate. My impression from my general perusal of the schedule, which has a good deal of small print in it, is that these are well conceived and well precedented by previous non-departmental public bodies. The amendments probe two matters and, if I may, I shall say a word about the Government amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 219, unless I have completely misconceived it, takes up the point that I made on other amendments about the chairman's continuation in office. Will the Minister confirm that he will be able to respond to that at a later stage?
<P>
Amendment No. 220 also picks up an apparent anomaly between schedule 6 in relation to the powers of the adult learning inspectorate and clause 18 in relation to the Learning and Skills Council's ability to handle finance. Clause 18 gives the council no power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to borrow money;
<P>
(b) to lend money unless the Secretary of State consents;
<P>
(c) to hold shares in a company, or otherwise become a member of a company, unless the Secretary of State consents.<P>

In the schedule, the provision

<P>
seems to have disappeared in relation to the adult learning inspectorate. Why does that provision apply to the council but not to the ALI?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry for interrupting but I ought to point out that something in the hon. Gentleman's comments tells me that he may be of the opinion that we are discussing all three amendments—we are not. We are simply discussing amendment No. 219. Can I clarify that for the Committee, in case there is any confusion?

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Benton. You are absolutely right. It may make for better order in dealing with the matter if the Minister were to respond to amendment No. 219.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> Good morning, Mr. Benton. I have only two words to say to the hon. Member for Daventry: we agree. I hope, however, that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment because we shall be tabling our own to the same effect in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Of course, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 220, in page 70, line 31, after `company', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or otherwise become a member of a company,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee has already had the benefit of a somewhat premature expression of views. I am not sure that I have much more to add. It simply seems odd that there is a restriction in clause 18 in relation to the council and not in relation to the powers of the inspectorate under schedule 6. Unless there is some good reason for it, I cannot see why that should be so, and I hope that the Minister will clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry. He has drawn our attention to a valuable point and I am pleased to say that we can accept the amendment as it is worded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am extremely grateful.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 183, in page 72, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Financial year of the Inspectorate
<P>
A financial year of the Inspectorate is—
<P>
(a) the period starting with the date on which it is established and ending with the second 31 March following that date;
<P>
(b) each successive period of twelve months.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment defines the adult learning inspectorate's financial year. The first financial year will be more than one year because it will run from when the adult learning inspectorate is established, which we hope will be in the autumn of this year— subject, of course, to the Bill passing through the House—to the end of its first full year of operation, which will be March 2002. That will prevent the newly established adult learning inspectorate from being required to produce two sets of plans in its early months, one for the rest of 2000–01 and one for 2000–„02. The new provision corresponds to clauses 29 and 49, already agreed by the Committee, which define the financial years for the LSC and its equivalent in Wales in the same terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have two points. The first is that I have not had time to check, but I take it that this is on the same time scale as the financial reporting by Ofsted. If the two inspectorates were ever put together or, more immediately, there was a parliamentary debate on the conduct of the inspectorates for a year, it would clearly be sensible for the two years to be aligned ab initio.
<P>
The second point is different—and I do not anticipate circumstances in which this might take place, other than perhaps a Government re jig of the financial year to begin at the calendar year, which is sometimes canvassed. If that were to happen, there might well be general enabling legislation to overtake the financial year-end dates for all Government departments. Minister may want to change the end date in the light of experience. Setting in stone a provision that the date should run to 31 March after the first reporting year is perhaps umnecessarily inflexible, and there might be a case for providing for that to be altered by order. Perhaps the Minister would like to consider that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Of course I am happy to consider anything put forward by the hon. Member for Daventry. I have two comments. On his first point, Ofsted is not a non-departmental public body, and therefore operates in a different way. On his second point, he is talking about something so radical that if it were ever to come to pass, we would be taking a look at all sorts of things, not simply the operation of these bodies. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Schedule 6 as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Inspectorate's remit</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 212, in page 22, line 10, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(da) assistance to employers' organisations and trades unions in connections with their education and training programmes if provided by public funds;'.<P>

<P>
No. 81, in page 22, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) facilities for providing information, advice or guidance about education or training or connected matters secured by the Council under section 12(5) of this Act or by the Secretary of State under section 9 or the Employment and Training Act 1973 for persons over the age of 19.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendments deal with a more substantive issue. May I take them in the reverse order and leave the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) to talk about amendment No. 81, which, as I read it, seems unexceptionable in principle and relates to guidance? This is an important subject, to which we shall be return later in the Bill, and he will deserve a Government response to the points that he will shortly make.
<P>
Amendment No. 213 is a probing amendment. We seek to ask what the remit might be extended to cover, what Ministers have in mind in making the provision, what the nature of regulations might be and whether they would be debatable in the House if they were to be extended. We aim to direct Ministers' minds to the matter.
<P>
Amendment No. 212 relates to a point of substance, but not necessarily of political argument. As I have said, it is my view that the educational, training and other services provided by trade unions are important. Clearly it is unexceptionable if they use their own money, the subscriptions of their members and any charitable funds to which they have access, and that could not properly detain the Committee. I am not seeking to suggest that they do not do a good job, both in their own activities—shop stewards and other representatives should be properly trained, for example, in the conduct of industrial relations, of which I have some experience through a previous Front-Bench responsibility—and in providing access for employees to wider educational and training opportunities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) has mentioned, the Ford employee development plan, which is exemplary. I must declare quickly that I have a Ford plant in my constituency at Daventry—a large parts depot. There is a lot to be said for trade union and employer organisations and, on occasion, for the two sets of organisations working together. There is, for example, a proper interest in bargaining for skills and trying to raise the level of expertise and, one hopes, the level of outcome from industrial relations activities. All that is non-contentious in principle.
<P>
However, the Committee needs to pause for a moment in relation to the trade union learning fund for two reasons. I emphasise again that I do not seek to attack it, but I am concerned about accountability and transparency. A £12 million fund is be expended over four years. The Minister helpfully provided an answer to me recently in response to a written question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The purpose is to support union-led activity on learning in the workplace and in the wider community.—[Official Report, 19 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 570W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That again keys into those two interests—workplace competence and access to wider educational opportunities. So far there is no objection, although I suppose it is fair to say that such a substantial sum has to be considered in terms of overall priorities. It is a political decision for Ministers as to whether they think that that is the best use of money, and that they should defend it.
<P>
In relation to administration, there is an important point of principle. I went on to ask about the supervision of those funds and the monitoring of the outcome of their use. Those are proper questions for legislators to ask about the use of public money. Indeed, my right. hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, together with his Committee, which operates very much on a bipartisan basis, has said over the years that where public money is spent it should be open to the PAC and the National Audit Office to follow that money through to ensure that it is properly accounted for.
<P>
In the same way, to say, as the Minister did in his response to me, that a trade union learning fund is administered and evaluated by officials in the Department is not really a sufficient or modern response. I am not suggesting for a moment that officials will not ensure that the moneys are properly spent: they will try to make sure that there has been no fraud and no diversion of the money, and that it has all been spent on the purposes for which it was intended and in accordance with the Ministers' remit. That is not an issue, and it is certainly not intended to cast any aspersions on their competence.
<P>
On the other hand, this is an education activity. It involves public money, and the principle of making that transparent and ``inspectable'' by an inspectorate is a proper one because it could be—although I hope that it would not be, and I would he happy for it to be proved not to be—that the money was not being used cost-effectively. It might be being diverted to political purposes or whatever. That is not the purpose of the amendment. However, the principle should apply that if public money is used for an educational purpose, whether or not transmitted through the Learning and Skills Council—and it would not be so dispensed under the present arrangements, but any continuing fund might be, and that is for the Minister to explain—it should be possible to have it inspected and evaluated.
<P>
I say that in the interests of public accountability and not to make a party political point. I even go beyond that and say that it might well be in the interests of the union's own activities to have some independent dipstick as a measure of the efficiency of its educational activities. Of course I respect the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East, who spoke so eloquently in the earlier debate about self assessment and self motivation. That is good. I do not wish to suggest to the Committee that trade union learning activities are a waste of time or inappropriate: that is not the purpose of the amendment. However, the best way of ensuring that that does not happen and that public money is properly spent and achieves an educational benefit is for these or similar funds in the future to be inspected properly by an inspectorate that has an understanding of and sympathy for the industrial situation, is not anxious to make waves but, on the other hand, is anxious to see that money is properly spent and that activities are conducted to the highest possible standards.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): Amendment No. 81 deals with the inspection of the regime covering the accreditation of careers guidance, on which we sought clarification when the Bill was going through another place. There are still some points outstanding, and in particular we are concerned that we do not end up with the accreditation of careers guidance being detached to too great a degree from the inspection frameworks for education and training.
<P>
We understand that the guidance council has set up an accreditation board to accredit careers guidance, which we support, but we are concerned that that may not extend far enough in the context of the learning and skills councils. We expect there to be a significant growth in informal careers guidance provided in the workplace by workplace training officers and learning representatives, which trade unions are promoting in the workplace. The current structure set up by the guidance council will not be able to deal with that. As the local learning and skills councils in particular take on some of the TEC responsibilities, they will deal with the training element and with people who offer guidance services that are not within the formal careers guidance structures as they currently exist. We want to be sure that there is some quality control and that those services are covered. We seek not to usurp the role of the guidance council's accreditation board, but to suggest to the Government that there may be a role for ALI, the inspection arm of the Learning and Skills Council, in cases where it is not possible to enforce quality control or accreditation.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As for paying for inspection of the services, our understanding is that the accreditation board will be funded by fees from individual providers, but that may be an issue. It makes sense for career service providers that are set up as companies to form part of the board and pay a fee to be accredited. However, I doubt whether the same funding structure will work for workplace learners and small to medium-sized enterprises that have been encouraged by the local LSC to offer guidance services. They will not consider it appropriate to sign up to the accreditation board on a fee-based regime. Instead, they will attempt to gain their quality control through inspection by a body at no cost. We wonder whether the Government have given this any thought, and whether they can assure companies that wish to develop their guidance services internally so as to direct people to the right training course that that should be done at no cost. Small and medium-size enterprises might otherwise find it difficult to participate in quality control procedures.
<P>
We are also concerned about the relative status that will be given to the various forms of inspection and quality control. Ofsted and ALI will be set up under statutory guidance, but if the accreditation board is set up outwith the statutory framework it will not have the same kind of status, and that the careers guidance element will not be taken seriously because of the absence of the statutory framework for inspections. This has been pointed out to us. It would be less of an issue if the accreditation board were able to meet providers' concerns. We would be more comfortable with a framework that made it clear that quality control and the careers guidance element were as significant as training and education. If the Government resist the amendment and propose to move to a non-statutory basis, I hope that the Minister will at least put on the record their view about the importance of ensuring the same quality control for guidance services as for training and education. We are raising specific concerns to which I hope the Minister will respond. We want assurance that guidance provided not by career companies and the more obvious guidance sources but through other sources that fall within the LSC's remit, especially in the workplace, will be available—especially if the Government do not agree that ALI should have a role. We consider that the accreditation board's role will be important in assisting LSCs to succeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I will consider amendments Nos 212 and 213 together. The hon. Member for Daventry set out his reasons for wanting assistance to employers organisations and trade unions to be inspected by the adult learning inspectorate. I agree broadly with his reasoning.
<P>
Where provision such as this is supported by public funds, assistance should be inspected. Most provision of this nature will fall within the part of the inspectorate's remit for which clause 51(l)(d) provides. It makes it clear that the new adult learning inspectorate will be able to inspect this type of provision. That is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most reassured by what the Minister said. That is progress. However, I want to be clear about the facts. Given that a trade union learning fund is financed outwith the learning and skills remit, will the inspectorate be able to examine it, or at least be encouraged to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes. The trade union learning fund is small but significant, and has facilitated much good work. I would need to consider the detail of that proposal, but I take the point that we are using public money to set up inspection regimes for different kinds of learning, including that to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Scrutiny of particular schemes or the whole scheme could be considered, and he has made an important point.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry did not mention it, but I hope that the Committee is encouraged by the work that the trade union learning fund has facilitated. For example, I recently helped to launch an IT centre not far from here in Westminster. The Public and Commercial Services Union—a civil service union—established it with support from the trade union learning fund and others. I saw how the fund was enabling union members who had previously worked in the national insurance sector, to re-skill and get to grips with IT for the first time, thereby assuring their places in the labour market in the future. That is good practice.
<P>
More recently, I learned that the trade union learning fund was operating in a different setting. At a conference in the midlands, I heard a representative of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers talk about telesales, specifically in Littlewoods. Employers and trade unions were working closely together to enable the work force to develop IT skills in particular, because, as we all understand, the internet will soon dominate telesales. That was also good practice. The hon. Member for Daventry is interested in the issue, so I encourage him to visit a scheme, if he has not already done so. I hope that I have given him some reassurance about inspection and whether it is needed.
<P>
I cannot accept amendment No. 213. We described the reasons for the power in subsection (1)(e) in our memorandum to the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee, but it might help to remind the Committee of our thinking. We said that the power was designed to allow minor additions to the principal remit, to ensure that the adult learning inspectorate's expertise applied to other relevant education and training as provision developed. It is impractical to include a full list in the Bill, so the regulation-making power will allow the Secretary of State to add to the remit.
<P>
That might be necessary because of the fast-changing nature of post-16 education and training and particularly the growth in virtual or distance learning. Provision is increasingly made in non-traditional locations, and partnerships are possible with new types of provider. Subsection (2) already allows for the power to be used to prescribe the training of further education teachers and others. Another potentially important possibility is education in prisons.
<P>
The regulations made under the power will represent comparatively minor additions to the adult learning inspectorate's remit. The provision is analogous to the power to confer supplementary functions on the LSC, as described in clause 18(4). As with that provision and its precedent in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the negative procedure is appropriate.
<P>
The House of Lords Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Deregulation was completely satisfied with my Department's memorandum. Indeed, it commented that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the comprehensive nature of the department's memorandum and its sensitive appreciation and application of the criteria to govern the control of delegated legislation has enabled<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Committee's
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>report to be shorter than might have been the case.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. The need for the regulations is clear and unequivocal, and I therefore invite him to consider withdrawing amendment No. 213.
<P>
I must deal at some length with amendment No. 81, which was moved by the hon. Member for Hallam, because it relates to an important aspect of our policy. The amendment was previously considered in another place. The Government have good reasons for not accepting that the adult learning inspectorate should have the remit for adult information, advice and guidance, and my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone has already set those out in another place. My comments will in general reflect hers, as nothing new has been added to the debate today. I do not mean that pejoratively, because the arguments were well set out in another place and this debate is a useful reminder of the issues.
<P>
I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Hallam that good advice, guidance and information are critical to successful adult learning. We are moving into an era in which we cannot think of guidance and advice as somehow solely restricted to young people. Given the nature of the employment market, many of us will perhaps need to re-educate ourselves and retrain for the changes that we are seeing. Therefore, guidance and advice is important and will arguably become more important in future. In an increasingly flexible labour market, it is essential that adults receive suitable help to plan their careers. They need to be on the right courses and acquiring the right qualifications.
<P>
A suitable and rigorous quality assurance system is needed to ensure that standards of information, advice and guidance remain high. Therefore, I do not think that there is much in essence between the hon. Member for Hallam and me. However, the Government's view is that that is not an appropriate role for the adult learning inspectorate. Instead, we intend that the guidance accreditation board, which was set up last year by the guidance council with support from my Department, should carry out inspection of this provision. I want to stress that the guidance accreditation board will be independent of the guidance council and that, under our intended quality assurance regime, they will have fundamentally different roles.
<P>
The guidance council will be responsible for maintaining and updating the quality standards and for providing advice and support to practitioners on continuous quality improvement and interpretation of the standards. Organisations that deliver information, advice and guidance for adults as part of local learning partnerships will be required to comply with the guidance council's quality standards by April 2002.
<P>
In contrast, the accreditation board will be responsible for inspecting provision, assessing whether providers meet quality standards and, where necessary, withdrawing their accreditation.
<P>
Let me stress the principal reasons why it is most appropriate to secure the inspection and quality assurance of information, advice and guidance for adults through the route that I have mentioned, rather than through the ALI. First, information, advice and guidance is a specialist activity that is connected with—but separate from—learning. Therefore, an appropriately tailored inspection and quality assurance regime is required. Secondly, the arrangement with the guidance council that I have described is already in place. It has been developed since April 1999 in tandem with developments in local information, advice and guidance provision for adults. Placing responsibility for inspecting that provision with ALI would delay the implementation of a quality regime for information, advice and guidance, and would not be in the interests of clients.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the delivery of information, advice and guidance for adults is extremely diffuse. It is not just a question of provision made by careers services or by FE institutions for their own students, important though that is. Under our policy, information advice and guidance is being delivered by an extremely wide range of organisations, including community and voluntary organisations and libraries, as well as employers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam asked about informal guidance in the workplace. If employers have applied for accreditation, the inspection would take place. We want to encourage employers, where relevant, to seek that accreditation and therefore be subject to inspection.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Could the Minister follow that up by answering the other point about whether employers who apply for accreditation will have to pay a fee for the service, which could be critical to many employers, particularly in the small business sector, in deciding whether to seek accreditation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We expect fees to be appropriate, and much of the income will come from fees. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that it might be a critical issue for small businesses, but I am sure that the body will be sensitive to such issues. For a smallish company, inspection can be light-touch while remaining rigorous and should not involve huge costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following the argument and exchanges with interest. The point made by the hon. Member for Hallam is that whatever fee is charged for inspection in connection with accreditation should not be so high that it deters a company from participating in a thoroughly sensible scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Indeed. I understand that point. It should be possible for the inspection of a small company to be rigorous without being expensive. We are sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
The plans that we have been discussing with the guidance council are based on the assumption that up to 1,500 provider organisations will need to be accredited between now and the end of 2001–02. Many of those are not learning providers at all. The sheer numbers involved—and their diversity—make essential an accreditation regime of the sort that is already in operation. Placing responsibility for inspection of this provision with ALI would significantly increase the number of organisations with which it would have to deal, for little obvious gain.
<P>
Finally, the arrangements through the guidance council are not just about the accreditation of provision that will be funded by the LSC or even about wider publicly funded provision. Much provision in the adult guidance field is in the private sector and will continue to be paid for by employers and individuals. It will be open to such private sector organisations to seek accreditation from the guidance accreditation board too. Accreditation will give an assurance about the quality of private sector provision, and will also help to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of those arrangements, because such providers will pay a fee to the accreditation board. The guidance council's business plan for these arrangements envisages that—depending on the level of fee income achieved—it will be self financing over the medium term.
<P>
I cannot therefore accept the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Hallam, however well intentioned. We believe that the arrangement that we intend to put in place will work. There has never been independent inspection of adult advice and guidance. We are in fairly uncharted waters here, though last year we made a significant new investment in adult advice and guidance provision. We wanted to ensure that it was underpinned by national arrangements to improve its quality. The guidance accreditation board arrangements, which are already up and running, will help to achieve that.
<P>
We want all providers of adult information advice and guidance that receive public funding from the LSC for that purpose to comply with the quality standards developed by the guidance council. Current plans envisage that all such providers will need to comply with the standards by March 2002. If they do not, they will be able to access public funding for adult advice and guidance through the LSC.
<P>
Finally, I want to deal with the hon. Gentleman's point that the proposed arrangements lack resources. We provided £700,000 of pump-priming funding to the guidance council in 1999–2000 to establish the guidance accreditation board, to develop the quality standards further and to provide a continuous quality improvement service for IAG providers.
<P>
In 2000–01 we have contracted with the guidance council for a further £750,000 to introduce the quality standards across the sector, accredit at least 600 providers to the appropriate quality mark in such a way as to create growing recognition of their value and importance in raising service standards. We envisage, however, that the direct cost to the taxpayer of the accreditation mechanism will fall to zero by 2002–03, as fee income from providers rises. In relation to fee income, the guidance council envisages that, over time, much of it will come from private sector organisations that are not in receipt of public funds.
<P>
We want accreditation by the guidance accreditation board to become a badge of quality for all providers in both public and private sectors. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. It was well intentioned, but I hope that I have convinced him of the Government's arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I once found in a second-hand bookshop an 18th century volume of sermons whose title was inscribed on the spine as being ``Adultery etc.''. That was because the first sermon in the volume dealt with adultery; many other sermons followed that were addressed to different subjects. I am not suggesting that the adult learning inspectorate's remit under clause 51(1)(a) to (d) is equivalent to adultery, but clause 51(1)(e), to which amendment No. 213 was addressed, clearly falls under the category of et cetera.
<P>
The Minister said initially that he could not accept the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry had already said that it was a probing amendment, so that was not an unreasonable position for the Minister to adopt. Equally, it was not unreasonable for my hon. Friend to propose the amendment. We learned a great deal from the Minister's reply, which certainly convinced me.
<P>
Regarding amendment No. 81, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, I am conscious that Standing Committees are often used as a training programme for Members of Parliament who are enjoying their first Session. I believe that I should keep my hand in, and I try to attend a Standing Committee every year. I know that others adopt the same attitude. In the process, one learns about the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
I served last year on the Greater London Authority Bill, which comprised 270 clauses and 30 schedules. An attempt was made by the Government Whip to run a timetable of one sort or another, and the Opposition collectively delivered against that timetable. However, the process of delivering was made a nightmare by the frequency with which the Liberal Democrats tabled amendments and the immense length at which the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) spoke to them.
<P>
In the context of the current Bill, I notice that amendment No. 81 is the only Liberal Democrat amendment on either side of the selection list. Both Liberal Democrat members of this Committee come from Yorkshire, and those who tabled amendments to the Greater London Authority Bill came from London—further evidence of the familiar Liberal Democrat practice of behaving in different ways in different parts of the country and hoping that others will not notice.
<P>
I have one question for the Minister. He can assent by nodding his head; he does not need to speak. I have picked up from the debate in the Lords what he subsequently quoted. Baroness Blackstone said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The plans we have been discussing with the Guidance Council are based on the assumption that up to 1,500 provider organisations will need to be accredited between now and the end of 2001–02.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 15 February 2000; Vol. 609, c. 1166.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I inferred from that that the arrangements with the guidance council would deliver that number of accreditations between now and then. If the Minister can confirm that simply by nodding his head I shall be grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I can do better than that and shall rise to my feet. That is our assumption and intention. I will not comment on the right hon. Gentleman's remarks about the Liberal Democrats, except to say that in my experience the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) needs no encouragement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I thought that the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster was going to congratulate us on not wasting the Committee's time; I should have known that we would get political. My Yorkshire colleagues do not like to waste their breath. Given sufficient encouragement, however, we could table amendments to later parts of the Bill.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his response to amendment No. 81. It was helpful to have the issues surrounding the guidance council accreditation board placed on the record. This is a useful step forward. We have had representations that express confidence about that, and the Minister's words add to that. We are still concerned about how the fees will pan out in practice. The Minister mentioned quite a large figure that the Government have put in to prime the pump and added that the private sector will eventually pick up the cost. If sums are recouped from the private sector by getting in a lot of providers at a level that is appropriate, the accreditation will work. If the fee levels are set too high because the driving force is to ensure that we recoup costs rather than spreading accreditation, many people who should be brought into the scheme will simply opt out. There will be no compulsion on them.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will follow up his comments to the Committee. Again it is useful to have it on the record that he is aware of that possible problem. I hope that over the next few years he will keep a close eye on what is happening out there and will look at numbers of accreditation and at feedback from businesses to see whether fee levels are an issue for them. We would certainly wish accreditation to take place as far as is possible.
<P>
In terms of my own career, I shall seek guidance from the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster on how we should proceed on the rest of the Bill. I am sure that I will receive quality advice. I will not seek to make any further political points, but merely note that the heat in the Committee seems to have got to us. We had adultery from the right hon. Gentleman and references to partnerships and people pledging to each other from the hon. Member for Daventry. I certainly hope that the new inspection services will marry effectively with the services that they are trying to inspect. I hope that the accreditation board, whether by a pre-nuptial or any other agreement, can coexist happily with the careers guidance services. We will not press the amendments any further because we are confident that the system will work effectively if these key problems can be overcome.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I hope that the Government will not devise any disincentive to the institution of marriage. It occurred to me that we have had no cricket analogy this morning. The way that the Minister handled the amendment reminds me of the story of the rookie university batsman, who, playing first class cricket for the first time and opening the innings, was confronted by a well-known Yorkshire fast bowler. He played and missed the first two balls of the over, and had his middle stump removed by the third. He is reputed to have said, as he walked back to the pavilion, ``That was a very good ball.'' The reply was, ``Aye, but `t were so-and-so well wasted on thee.'' That may be the case here. However, if the Liberal Democrats stimulate debates of quality on serious issues, and the Minister responds reasonably, I shall not seek to prolong matters.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Equally, I thought that the Minister responded helpfully to our probing amendment, No. 213. It is good to have the endorsement of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. The provision is not an abuse of delegated powers, and I am sure that the Minister will not bear the spirit in which he proposed his report to the Committee into its implementation.
<P>
The Minister responded helpfully to amendment No. 212, which could have been pointed. However, having conceded the principle that one should be able to follow through the provision of public money and inspect it accordingly, he did not give a precise answer on his proposals for the trade union learning fund. There is a common interest in examining how the fund develops and in breaking it from the confines of the Department that will administer it. I shall not press the Minister on that now. Nor shall I press the amendment, except to say that it would be helpful if the Minister could correspond with me and set out his thinking at greater length and at greater leisure. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Subsection (2) deals with the training of teachers and others who provide education within the remit of the adult learning Inspectorate. I want to push the Government a little further on their attitude towards the professionalisation of teaching staff in that sector. If we are to deliver high-quality teaching to students, we must be mindful of how we accommodate it. I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to give me some assurance about what the Government are going to do in that regard. If a professional body is the desired option, how can that mechanism best be brought about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that issue, and I shall do my best to respond. If I do not go into enough detail now, I shall write to my hon. Friend.
<P>
The Government have recently run a consultation exercise on teaching qualifications in further education. In particular, we wanted to gauge the response to our proposition that all teachers in FE should be required from September 2001 to possess or be working towards a minimum-level professional teaching qualification, which would signify competence in a range of skills in teaching and managing learning. That will help to improve the quality of tuition and student achievement, which will make a significant contribution to our campaign to raise standards. The consultation exercise has just ended, so I am not able to say what the outcome is. I shall, however, carefully examine the responses.
<P>
I say that because we need to examine trainer training in the same context. The position is rather similar to that in further education, although we are not so far down the line. We intend to set minimum standards for the skills and qualifications of trainers in work-based learning. The criteria that the future LSC will use when selecting training providers will include those minimum requirements. However, the process is at an earlier stage than the exercise that we are carrying out in the FE sector, which is reasonably advanced. None the less, we take the points that my hon. Friend has made, and I thank him for drawing the matter to the Committee's attention. I shall certainly keep him and the Committee informed of our thinking.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 51 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 52</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions of the Inspectorate and Chief Inspector</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 214, in page 22, line 24, after `training;', insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ba) the extent to which institutions offering education and training within the remit of the Inspectorate meet the needs of individuals and of employers;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come to a slightly different side of the same subject: the functions of the Inspectorate and the Chief Inspector. Amendment No. 214 is modest and straightforward and will, we hope, attract support from all parts of the Committee, including the hon. Gentlemen who speak for the Liberal Democrats. I shall not join other hon. Members in commenting on the propensities of Liberal Democrats to say different things in different places, as in Yorkshire and Lancashire. However, perhaps I could make just a brief comment about cricket, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said that we had not heard about it this morning. It may give you, Mr. Benton, as much pleasure as it gives me to see that Yorkshire and Lancashire are in the top two places in the county championship. I shall say no more than that and shall trespass no further on your good nature.
<P>
On amendment No. 214, subsection (1) refers to the Inspectorate—I prefer that term to the description that the Minister used, although I appreciate that the Inspectorate might become known by its shorthand name. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Inspectorate must keep the Secretary of State informed about<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
certain matters. Those are set out in very general terms perhaps too general. For example, the inspectorate must keep the Secretary of State informed about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the quality of the education and training within its remit.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does that mean in practice? Should the Inspectorate keep the Secretary of State informed about the general quality of education and training or should it go so far as to report on individual institutions, as amendment No. 214 would require? The amendment would require the Inspectorate to report, in particular, on how well institutions meet the needs of individuals and employers. It would be useful to give the clause a little more particularity by charging the Inspectorate with that task. The Minister may tell me that he envisages that happening in any case, but it would be useful to hear him say so in Committee, bringing matters into the open, rather than leaving them on a general basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> As so often, the hon. Member for Hertsmere has raised some important issues, and I shall take some time to deal with them.
<P>
We agree that the Secretary of State and, indeed, members of the public have a right to know whether local institutions—and, more widely, providers of post-16 learning—are meeting local needs. It goes without saying that the needs of individuals and local employers in respect of post-16 learning are important and must be addressed. Those concerns lie at the heart of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked us to be more particular, so I shall examine what the needs of individual learners. Obviously, they will vary with the individual, but we could compile a considerable list of possibilities. Somewhere near the top of a list on which we could all agree would be competent teachers, trainers and assessors; good information, advice and guidance to help people make a realistic choice of courses; access to the right resources; and, in many cases, good pathways for progression.
<P>
Employers' needs are inevitably different. A list on which we could all agree would include ensuring that employers can recruit staff with the appropriate skills; general access to relevant training; and flexibility and responsiveness from the local college or training provider. In my view the two sets of requirements embody fundamental differences that are highlighted by the list that I have given.
<P>
There are strategic problems to be solved in meeting the needs of employers. They are addressed by the planning and funding process for post-16 education and training and LSCs, whereas questions as to whether provision is suited to individuals' needs more closely reflect the quality of teaching and its effectiveness in helping students to attain their personal learning goals. For that reason I tend to the view that the amendment would probably create confusion between the roles that we envisage for the different bodies, although I accept that that is not what the hon. Gentleman intended.
<P>
As we discussed earlier, the main function of the adult learning inspectorate—and these comments also apply to Ofsted—is to provide rigorous independent inspection of the quality of provision and the standards achieved by learners. By contrast, the LSC has a strategic role, which is an integral component of its overall operation and planning strategy. In bearing in mind the differing roles of the inspectorate and the LSC, we can expect the inspection processes to keep the Secretary of State and other interested parties well informed about how colleges and others meet the individual needs. Inevitably this information will go to individual institutions also.
<P>
The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) referred to the common inspection framework. That is important. I am pleased to remind the Committee that a working draft has been prepared by the three existing inspectorates—Ofsted, the TSC and the FESC—and is out to consultation. It is a useful document that sets out the detail that the final framework may contain. It asks, ``How well do courses and programmes meet the needs and interests of learners?'' and describes the issues that inspection will address in answering that question. We can be confident that the new inspection regime will keep everyone informed about how well institutions are meeting learners' needs.
<P>
That does not mean that the function must be written into the Bill, however. The framework asks other significant questions. For example, how effective is the assessment and monitoring of learners' progress? How effective are teaching and learning? How effective are leadership and management? I expect that inspection reports will produce the answers. In a community with many manufacturing employers, it will be important to know about the quality of engineering courses at a local college. Local LSCs will be expected to make good use of that information as they formulate local plans. However, for the reasons that I have given, an assessment of how well local provision meets the needs of employers in a locality is primarily a matter for local LSCs, not the inspectorates.
<P>
To summarise, amendment No. 214 raises important issues. I hope that my somewhat lengthy explanation has convinced the hon. Member for Hertsmere that inspection evidence is only part of the answer to his concern about the needs of employers and individual learners. I hope that he agrees that the common inspection framework provides a good way forward and I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's response, especially about the common inspection framework. He will realise that it raises other issues. However, the amendment has drawn a useful response from the Government. Hearing a little more about information has clarified matters. We share the Minister's desire to provide for inspection that brings about high-quality adult education, and his explanation has helped. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 22, line 43, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) In carrying out inspections of particular institutions, the Chief Inspector shall wherever possible involve at least one person employed by that institution in that inspection'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 234, in Clause 60, page 26, line 21, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) In carrying out inspections of particular institutions in the further education sector, the Chief Inspector shall wherever possible involve at least one person employed by that institution in that inspection.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Superficially, these amendments might seem to reproduce one another. The Committee may remember a famous story of Sir Winston Churchill, when Prime Minister. He was somewhat indisposed at the time, recovering from a stroke. He was speaking to a party conference and in the script before him, the same page appeared twice. Having read out the page the second time, he realised what he had done and is reputed to have said, ``You ask why I repeat myself? Because it is the very core of our argument.'' In a sense that is true in this case, because there is a concern here that reflects the experience of further education inspections over the years and it is at least worth a moment or two of the Committee's time.
<P>
In any case, the two provisions are not absolutely identical, because although they both refer to a chief inspector, amendment No. 215 relates to the chief inspector of adult learning and the provisions in this chapter of part III of the Bill. The later amendment refers to the chief inspector of schools, in so far as his powers are being extended to cover what at the moment is within the remit of the further education inspectorate.
<P>
I touched on these points earlier and I shall not repeat them at length, but the experience of the further education inspectorate—replicated by the Training Standards Council arrangements—is that inspections are well served when a staff member participates as one of the team. The reasons for that are first, that the person involved can brief the inspectors on provision, particularly where it is complex and the college has a wide remit, and can clear up any misconceptions of fact which may arise.
<P>
The second argument for including a staff member is wider. It provides at least a degree of ownership in the process for the institution in question. That seems to have worked well. We know that the Government says ``What is good is what works'', and this does seem to have achieved a measure of success and an even greater level of credibility in the further education sector. Anything that goes on beyond the age of 16 is outwith compulsory education, so a degree of modulation or feedback is provided by the fact that all students over that age are volunteers.
<P>
One distinctive element on which I did not touch earlier is that further education institutions are bodies corporate. They have their own governors, and, as has already been said eloquently, their own internal arrangements for quality assurance, in a way not likely to be secured to quite the same extent—or certainly not in the same form—by schools and sixth forms, particularly in the maintained sector. That is not to devalue the arrangements made in schools, but to point out that institutional provisions are in place in further education. This has not failed to raise some problems in the past and we are aware of those. There is also no guarantee that incorporating a staff inspector will immediately achieve consensus, nor, conversely that the whole thing can be whitewashed by skewing the judgments that the inspector needs to make. However, in practical terms it seems to have worked very well in further education. The amendments would secure on a statutory basis a continuing involvement for a staff person in adult inspections, and amendment No. 234 would make similar provisions for Ofsted inspections for 16 to 19-„year-olds. In neither case is this mandatory. The amendments provide for the possibility that it might not be practical in a particular case, and that would not invalidate the inspection. But it is good practice and although it has not happened traditionally in maintained schools pre-16, it is a model that might be considered for a wider context and should certainly not be taken away as an unintended consequence of the new inspection arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> Both these amendments, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, raise similar issues of principle in relation to the important question of the college or provider nominee. I am aware of the current practice in FEFC and TSC inspections to have a member of the college or training provider staff as a nominee in the inspection team. I know too that many colleges backed by the Association of Colleges would like the practice to continue.
<P>
Our approach is governed by the common inspection framework which addresses this point. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Inspection teams will maintain close links with the provider . . . in order to ensure the smooth running of inspections . . . ascertain views and clarify facts . . . and share emerging findings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An established conduit for such liaison . . . is the ``provider's nominee''. This is a senior member of staff designated to act with the inspection team and to be involved throughout. In schools the main link with the inspection team is usually the headteacher.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The consultation on the draft framework clearly envisages this helpful arrangement continuing and thereby allows for the involvement of somebody who is employed by the institution that is being inspected. The term ``involvement'' may, however, mean different things. It is for this reason that the common inspection framework specifically consults on the point as to whether the provider nominee should be present at inspection team meetings where collective judgments are made.
<P>
While the common inspection framework is a matter for Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools and the chief inspector for adult learning, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured when I say that on the evidence of the present draft, provider nominations will continue to be a general feature of inspections under the new arrangements. While I cannot agree that the role of the provider nominee should be fixed in law, the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the Bill does provide that the common framework will be created by means of a statutory procedure, which includes a period of consultation of not less than three months. On that basis, I hope that he will be willing to withdraw these amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That has been a useful short debate. It is helpful to have confirmation from Ministers. In all normal circumstances the arrangement for a provider nominee is beneficial and we are satisfied that by the time the consultation process on the common framework has been rolled out and considered by Ministers, that will be largely secured. Therefore we do not wish to press the amendments to a Division at this stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 184, in page 23, line 19, leave out subsections (6) and (7).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to also discuss Government amendments Nos. 187, 191, 203 and 204 and Government new clause 5 Defamation: Part III.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> These six amendments simply tidy up the text of part III. Identical wording in relation to defamation and privilege occurs five times in part III. By deleting the five references and inserting the provision once within a new short clause, a clearer and less repetitive text is produced, with no legal change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am curious, at an intellectual level, as to why it was ever necessary to print the Bill in this form. As the Minister knows, two groups of two references and one group of one have identical wording. I have no objection to tidying that up at this stage, but I find it curious that it was not done earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> The world is full of curious things, and we have already heard the right hon. Gentleman's thoughts on some of those during the proceedings. I can assure him that I am happy to write to him with a detailed explanation of precisely how this state of affairs has come about.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 185 and 186.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now move on to a slightly different subject, which arises from the adult learning inspectorate's power to inspect training funded by the employer, when the request to do so is made by the employer. Such inspections of training and education that have not been funded publicly, to put it in shorthand, are triggered not by their falling within the inspectorate's normal remit, but at the request of the employer. An inspection at the employer's request is desirable for a number of reasons, and an employer who seeks an inspection of that type deserves encouragement and credit.
<P>
Therefore, it would be wrong to put too much of a burden on the employer by way of charges for the inspection. Subsection (4) makes provision for the employer to be charged for such an inspection. Our amendment would limit that to a ``reasonable'' charge. We hope that the Minister will sympathise with our desire to limit the charge and thereby encourage employers to have inspections. It is in everyone's interest to encourage such inspections.
<P>
Government amendment No. 186 provides that the inspectorate may arrange for a report of an inspection of that type to be published. We wonder what role the employer's wishes will play in the exercise of that power and whether an employer will be consulted before a report is published. We imagine that that will be the case, but we hope that the Minister will give us a little more detail.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made the case for his amendment reasonably, and I want to be reasonable in response. Amendment No. 216 allows me to point out that subsection (3) provides a power for privately funded training to be inspected. That is important, as many large companies spend a considerable and commendable sum on training their employees. Some companies—perhaps quite a few—will want to have that training professionally evaluated, and the adult learning inspectorate will be able to do that.
<P>
However, it would not be appropriate for a public body, such as the ALI, to subsidise a private arrangement. Therefore, there is provision for the cost of any private inspection to be recovered. The word ``cost'' means in practice the full cost; otherwise, subsidy, by definition, occurs. It follows that, although the hon. Gentleman's argument is well intentioned, I cannot accept the amendment. The word ``reasonable'' would confuse the picture. What is a reasonable cost to one company might seem unreasonable to another. The relationship between the adult learning inspectorate and a private training provider in the circumstances described will be governed by the ordinary principles of contract law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> When the Minister uses the phrase ``full cost'', I take it that he means the full cost at the average cost of such provision, having regard to, for example, a full allowance for overhead expenses. In other words, it would be impossible for the inspectorate to offer a marginal-cost service. Is that broadly the distinction that the Minister seeks to draw? Perhaps he could advise the Committee later on how that will be defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> If I can give any advice to the hon. Gentleman and the rest of the Committee later, I will. I do not feel qualified to enter into precise accountancy discussions, but I think that the full cost means more than just the immediate cost of carrying out an inspection. Although the inspectorate will not subsidise the private employer, we expect it to be reasonable, not least with smaller companies, which do their best to train, and which will call in the inspectorate to evaluate their training. Although I will not accept the amendment, I hope that the inspectorate will be reasonable in practice.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said, the adult learning inspectorate will offer its services at full cost, and if the company thinks that reasonable, it can pursue the inspection. If it thinks that the cost is too steep, it might not pursue the inspection, or it might call in others to help to evaluate its training. Either way, private companies will not receive hidden subsidies.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 185 and 186 need only a short explanation. Under the clause, a private employer may contract for the inspectorate to evaluate the quality of training for which the company has paid privately, and which is not Government-supported. In those circumstances, the inspectorate will not have a duty to publish the report. Such inspections will be private matters between the employer and the inspectorate, and it would be inappropriate to place a duty on the inspectorate to publish the results, especially if the employer were reluctant for them to be published. The important point is that the inspectorate may choose to publish, under arrangements that it reaches with employers. It will probably wish to do so when it comes across good practice, and many companies might be keen for such reports to be published. I recommend amendments Nos. 185 and 186, and ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I thought that what the Minister said about amendment No. 185 would be the case and that the inspectorate might wish to publicise good practice. I was simply concerned about whether an employer could voluntarily ask for his training to be inspected, but be the subject of a report published against his wishes. The Minister has reassured me, and I note, as I already knew, that it is a power rather than a duty to publish.
<P>
I did not intend to subsidise private employers, but I wanted to prevent the inspectorate from pursuing a deliberate policy of setting the charges at a level that would discourage employers. I drew a little reassurance from the Minister. I understand that the charge is the full cost, but it would help to clarify matters if he could say more, although I understand if he cannot today. Perhaps he could write to the Committee with more details about the costs, and about such matters as the marginal costs, the average costs and the base of the costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I will consider that and write if I can help. We should also ensure that our discussions are brought to the attention of the head of the adult learning inspectorate when he or she is appointed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is helpful. There is a joint wish to see such inspections encouraged, and, to allow further progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 235, in Clause 61, page 27, line 7, at end insert `excluding the house of that person'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We return to inspections that are within the remit of the inspectorate and where publicly funded provision is being inspected. We come to the powers of the adult learning inspectorate. The Committee will recollect from earlier debates on the powers that the Bill proposes to grant to tbe LSC, that we are concerned generally about the granting of powers—it must be justified. We appreciate that the use of public resources is involved. That is an issue of accountability but we should not grant powers in excess of those needed to ensure accountability.
<P>
Amendment No. 217 relates to subsection (2)(a), which gives inspectors a right of entry to premises on which education and training is being provided Does it include the right of entry to premises where education is taking place if they belong, not to the person providing it, but a third party? Where the premises are those of the person providing the education and training, is there a right of entry to all his premises or just to the part of them where the education and training is taking place? That needs to be clarified. I remember a similar debate on earlier powers granted to the LSC.
<P>
Amendment No. 145 deals with subsection (3), which provides that in respect of education and training provided by the employer in the work place, a right of entry can be exercised only if the employer has been given notice in writing. We think that that is sensible and necessary. The purpose of the amendment is simply to seek clarification on what is reasonable notice in writing. We should appreciate a few words from the Minister.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 would give inspectors the right to inspect and take copies of any records kept by the education and training provider and any other documents containing information relating to education or training. We note that that includes a right of access to computers, and should like to hear a little bit more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Clause 55 deals with the right of entry of the adult learning inspectorate to premises, including, where necessary, the premises of an employer. This is a potentially sensitive area and we must get the provision right. Amendment No. 217 would extend inspectors' rights of access to any premises used in connection with education and training that is being inspected, regardless of whether they belong to the provider. The provisions in the Bill are more modest. Subsection (2)(a) provides that inspectors have a right of access to premises at which education and training are provided. Subsection (2)(b) provides a right of access to the premises of the provider that are used in connection with that education and training.
<P>
The latter might include, for example, the headquarters of a large provider where the training being inspected is provided at a subsidiary location. But neither subsection (2)(a) nor (b) would allow ALI access to, say, the separate premises of the provider's accountant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is just possible, especially in these days of computers and on-line provision, that a provider, or at least his employer, might be at home, and able to download the written work. Is there any question of a member of the inspectorate being able to visit the home of a person employed by the institution that provided the education and training?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> May I proceed now, but come back to that point, because I want to deal with certain complexities in home education provision?
<P>
The inspectorate will be able to gain access to documents material to the inspection that are not kept on a premises—as set out in subsection (2)(a) and (b)—by means of its powers to require providers to allow it to inspect, and take copies of, any documents
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>relating to the education or training which the inspector requires for the inspection<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under clause 55(1). The inspectorate will be able to require the provider to furnish those documents. If a provider fails to do so following a request from ALI, that could constitute an offence under clause 55(7). We do not believe that the inspectorate requires rights to entry that are more extensive than those that the Bill provides. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will therefore withdraw amendment No. 217.
<P>
I confess to being intrigued by amendment No. 145. The wording of clause 55(3) reflects largely the efforts of his noble Friend Baroness Blatch. In the other place, the Government had no difficulty in accepting in principle an amendment from the noble Lady to ensure that employers were not placed under an undue burden by the inspectorate. Indeed, at the time, Baroness Blatch said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister and thank him most warmly . . . I gratefully accept what is proposed.—[Official Report, House of Lords; 23 March, 2000; Vol. 611, c. 422.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point was that employers need reasonable notice when the inspectorate intends to conduct an inspection. The hon. Gentleman and his noble Friend Baroness Blatch will have to discuss the details if they disagree on them. It is not an argument in which I wish to be involved.
<P>
On the detail, I do not think that it is necessary to prescribe one month's notice. I agree that one month would be reasonable. However, some companies might prefer five weeks, while others would be happy with two or three. There is no real need to be prescriptive. I prefer to keep the legislation flexible. I have no doubt that the chief inspector of learning, whom we hope to appoint in the summer, will be a reasonable person, as well as one of the highest professional calibre. The inspectorate will not write to an employee one day, and turn up the next. We have plenty of options for advice and guidance to the inspectorates. I would not hesitate to advise the inspectorate in strong terms in the unlikely event that written notice of inspections to employers was too peremptory.
<P>
Amendment No. 235 relates to Ofsted's right of access under its new remit to the premises of a provider. The hon. Gentleman wishes to secure beyond doubt the fact that such access will not extend to a private house. In some instances, college buildings represent the private dwelling of the provider. I am thinking particularly of residential colleges, which may include a flat for the principal, or a house in the grounds. We can envisage a common-sense approach here. Parts of a college will be accessible to staff, students and visitors—and to inspectors when they visit. The principal's dwelling can remain private, and if his or her office is inside the house—another, more public, meeting room can be arranged. If data are stored on the computer in the house and we can envisage that—they can be transferred to disc, or e-mailed to another computer. I am sure that a common-sense approach will prevail. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. I was further persuaded that the amendment was unnecessary when I checked the analogous provisions of the School Inspections Act 1996—
