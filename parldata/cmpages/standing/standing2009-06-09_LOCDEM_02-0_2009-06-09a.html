Bill.</div>
<a name="09061017000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061017000666"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): Welcome to the Chair,
Mr. Amess. It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, as it always has been. Two Ministers new to the Bill are
in the Committee, but we will find a certain repetitive quality to the
debates. I will briefly address clause 3 in the same way that my
Opposition colleagues addressed clauses 1 and 2.</div>
<a name="09061017000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
obviously desirable in principle for local authorities to promote
understanding of other bodies, including monitoring boards, courts
boards and youth offending teams. Many Members of Parliament work
frequently in our constituencies to promote understanding of such
bodies, which is a worthwhile objective. However, we do not understand
why the promotion of understanding has to be included in a Bill, as it
is in this one. We did not receive much of an answer in relation to
other bodies when we discussed clauses 1 and 2, and I suspect that we
will get the same on clause 3.</div>
<a name="09061017000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) was
far ruder about this clause on Second Reading than I intend to be now.
We simply do not understand why it needs to be included in the Bill. It
is separate from clause 2. Presumably, there is a reason why the bodies
included in clause 3 do not fit in the same category as those included
in clause 2.</div>
<a name="09061017000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne pointed out this morning regarding the
bodies listed in clause 2, we wonder whether there will be a reciprocal
duty on the bodies included in clause 3 to promote understanding of
local authorities or themselves. Local authorities will promote
understanding of the bodies, but there is nothing on statute, as far as
I am aware&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>Minister may know otherwise&#151;that obliges the bodies to promote
themselves. By the Government&#146;s logic, surely they should do so.
I look forward to the Minister&#146;s explanation of that, just as we
are looking forward to hearing whether the bodies will have a
reciprocal duty to promote local
authorities.</div><a name="09061017000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
3, like the others, is burdensome, bureaucratic and unnecessary. We see
no reason why it should stand part of the Bill. We have tabled an
amendment that would delete it, which was obviously not selectable. The
Liberal Democrats have since withdrawn their names from it, and it is
over to them to say what they have to say on the
matter.</div>
<a name="09061017000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061017000667"></a><b class="B">Julia
Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Amess. As the hon.
Gentleman said, our concerns are in the same vein as those expressed
about clause 2. It is not clear why only principal authorities should
have a duty to promote the understanding of the organisations listed in
clause 3, just as it was not clear in relation to the bodies included
in clause 2. It is also not clear why there is no reciprocal duty for
the bodies to promote an understanding of their own arrangements and
local authorities&#146;
arrangements.</div><a name="09061017000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads us to conclude that the clauses serve only to highlight what a
dog&#146;s breakfast the current arrangements are, and how confusing
it is for a member of the public who seeks to understand not only what
all these organisations do, but their complaints procedures,
accountability processes and so on. They are completely different from
organisation to organisation, but rather than attempting to streamline
that process or to consider how complicated things are from the point
of view of the people who receive those public services, it seems that
the Government have simply palmed off the responsibility. Rather than
explaining something that is complicated and incomprehensible to most
people, they have given the responsibility to the local authorities,
and said, &#147;It is your job to explain
that.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061017000668"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stewart Jackson</b> (Peterborough) (Con): The hon. Lady is
making a very strong case. What would she say to my constituents, and
perhaps hers as well, who look at clause 3 and may accept the premise
on which it is based but at the same time are told that, for instance,
they are not permitted to know the location of bail hostels? That,
again, is the interface of locality with the criminal justice system.
It has been outsourced to ClearSprings, for instance, and Ministers are
not permitted to divulge, or choose not to, their location or set up
structures where proper consultation can take place in residential
areas when such hostels are proposed.</div>
<a name="09061017000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000669"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point.
It seems ironic that the Bill will defeat the object of what the
previous Secretary of State claimed it would achieve when she first
established in her White Paper &#147;Communities in control&#148;
what it was designed to achieve: to get people engaged in how public
services are delivered at a local level, and to try to see things from
the perspective of the people consuming public services. What we have
instead, unfortunately, is the silos that already exist, which the Bill
seems to entrench. Instead of trying to look at the issue in a
cross-cutting way, the Bill is suddenly lumping responsibility for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>explaining all the complications with the local authority. As I said, it
seems to be entrenching the silos, rather than resolving
them.</div><a name="09061017000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to the point made by the hon. Member for Wycombe about the
withdrawal of our amendments. My understanding is that we tabled
amendments identical to his. Those have been withdrawn and our names
added to his amendments, so I hope that makes it clear that we are of
one mind on how extraneous the proposals are. We do not need them in
the Bill. I do not see how they will simplify a very complicated set of
arrangements. For that reason, we will oppose
them.</div><a name="09061017000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000670"></a>The
Minister for Regional Economic Development and Co-ordination (Ms Rosie
Winterton):</b> I welcome you warmly to the Chair,
Mr. Amess. What a great pleasure it will be to serve under
your chairmanship on this interesting Bill, which has already
engendered a great deal of lively debate and I am sure will continue to
do so.</div>
<a name="09061017000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3
requires principal local authorities to promote understanding among
local people about independent monitoring boards for prisons and
immigration removal centres, courts boards and youth offending teams in
their area. Such information will be about how those bodies function,
how a person can become a member of the boards and bodies, and how they
can participate in some of the associated decision making and
mechanisms.</div>
<a name="09061017000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we want
really to promote active participation in decision making in our local
democracy, we need to look beyond just councils and councillors and to
other bodies in which people can play a civic role. In making it as
easy as possible for people to do that, we have clause 1, which is
about promoting understanding of the role of the councillor. We promote
civic roles in connected authorities under clause 2, such as a school
governor or member of a police authority. Other key civic figures are
set out in clauses 3 and 4, so people have the maximum amount of
information available to
them.</div><a name="09061017000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we look at some of the statistics on representation
in those other important civic roles in our society. Only a third of
courts board members are women. We talk a lot about getting younger
people to play a part in their local communities, but 80 per cent. of
magistrates nationally are over 50, and the average age is 57. Although
50 is of course a fantastic age to be, it is important that younger
people, who, along with 50-year-olds, have so much to offer, become
involved and interested in what is happening around them. Again, the
proportion of black and minority ethnic members on independent
monitoring boards does not mirror the composition of the local
population.</div>
<a name="09061017000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000671"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to our
earlier debate on how people are confused about the difference between
a council and an officer, and about the different services councils
provide. Does she not think that requiring councils to promote the
understanding of those other boards could generate more confusion? If
councils are responsible for promoting them, people might be led to
believe that councils are also responsible for delivering those
services. Can she explain how councils will be expected to promote
understanding of those organisations, and should regard not be paid to
other ways in which that could be done?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="09061017000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to the Councillors Commission, which put
quite a large responsibility on political parties to ensure that they
raise awareness. It has supported political parties in promoting
understanding to help tackle the lack of representation she has spoken
about. That responsibility need not rest solely on the shoulders of
councils, which, unfortunately, is the impression the Bill has given.
Finally, how do the Government propose that both they and local
authorities will assess the impact of the promotion of that
understanding?</div><a name="09061017000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000672"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I want to stress that clause 3 is not an
attempt to take away from the other bodies any responsibility for
promoting what happens or how people can get involved in their
organisations. It is an attempt to build upon that and to ensure that
the roles available for our constituents are promoted even more widely.
I challenge the hon. Lady&#146;s assumption that that would become
confusing because, when trying to increase people&#146;s
understanding of the possibilities of playing a role in civic life, it
is a good idea to have information about all the possibilities in one
place. We all know that people get confused and irritated by having to
run to many different information points to get an idea of what they
might be able to do, so having the information in one place is a good
way of helping them to look through what is available and decide what
is most relevant. That fits with bringing together into one information
hub all the possibilities for people who want either to fulfil a civic
duty, or to understand how they can best shape their local services and
play a role in their local communities.</div>
<a name="09061017000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The opposite
of what the hon. Lady is talking about is in fact the case: we want to
broaden the number of people involved. It is true to say that people
who get involved in one area of civic life often, as a result, get
involved in many others. That is all very laudable, but we want to
ensure that different people get involved in areas they feel are
relevant to them, because sometimes&#151;we need to be honest about
this&#151;a smaller number of people take on many roles. We want to
ensure that a whole range of people get
involved.</div><a name="09061017000619"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09061017000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000673"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> The Minister is making a perfectly good case for
the promotion of
understanding&#151;</div><a name="09061017000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000674"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b>
Good.</div><a name="09061017000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000675"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> The right hon. Lady should not be quite so swift
to assume that the rest of the sentence will be laudatory. She is
making a perfectly good case for the promotion of understanding of the
bodies. It is curious that the Bill slaps the duty on local authorities
but not on the bodies themselves. She is making a perfectly good
argument for local authorities promoting understanding of themselves.
Surely, it must therefore follow that if they are going to do that to
local authorities, the Government will place in legislation a similar
duty on those bodies to promote
themselves.</div><a name="09061017000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000676"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As I have said, we do not want to take away the
responsibility of other bodies to promote understanding of how people
can get involved, but we are discussing a local government Bill, which
is about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>the duties that fall upon local authorities. Where local authorities are
entering into this exciting initiative to ensure that more people at
local level are aware of the role that they can play in civic life and
how they can shape their services, we are keen to ensure that there is
the ability to gather all that information in one
place.</div><a name="09061017000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the hon. Lady&#146;s other question, we discussed in some detail this
morning how we intend to ensure that monitoring can take place
effectively in the ways that we talked about, whether through the
comprehensive area assessment, the Audit Commission or otherwise. The
usual ways in which that monitoring is done will ensure that we have a
good, sound system that all our citizens will find effective, and which
will encourage them to play a greater role in our civic
society.</div><a name="09061017000073"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000678"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I was just about to finish&#151;I know that
my Whip would like that&#151;however, I shall give

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000679"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I am slightly concerned about the developing
rather insidious nature of the clause. The right hon. Lady, in her
eloquent and charming way, is effectively leading us to the idea that
local authorities will have a new legal responsibility and duty, under
which, one assumes, they will be punished for the inability of separate
third-party bodies to recruit adequate numbers of women and people from
black and minority ethnic communities, based on adverse decisions with
respect to the comprehensive assessment prevalent in local government.
That does not seem fair, and indeed seems rather
iniquitous.</div><a name="09061017000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000680"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> It is not iniquitous at all. Obviously, if the
hon. Gentleman had his way none of this would be done. If we took the
&#147;do nothing&#148; attitude&#151;where did that phrase come
from?&#151;we would make no progress whatever in gathering the
information and trying to encourage our local authorities to get people
more involved in playing a role in our civic society. It is always
easier to say, &#147;Let&#146;s not try. Let&#146;s do nothing.
Let&#146;s sit back&#148;, and just hope that it all happens as if
by magic. What we are doing is looking at where we feel there can be
greater participation, encouragement for participation, and promotion
of understanding. People will find that an effective and helpful way of
encouraging them to shape services, to be involved in decision making,
and to get involved in civic life. I hope that with those reassurances
the opposition to the clause will crumble and the clause will have
unanimous
support.</div><a name="09061017000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09061017000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000695"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> When we were both even younger than we are now,
Mr. Amess, and when all the other members of the Committee
were younger, a famous politician got into a bit of trouble. I will not
identify his political party, because, heavens, that would be too
controversial, but his answer to all difficult questions was
&#147;ditto&#148;, over and over again. Clause 4 is a ditto clause
in that we will get the ditto answer from the Minister to our ditto
objections. There is no reason whatever for the clause to be in the
Bill. It is perfectly worth while for local authorities to promote
understanding of a lay justice, but there is no reason why such
promotion should be burdensome and
bureaucratic.</div><a name="09061017000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000696"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have been trying to follow the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks, but either I was too young to be aware of
the politician he mentions, or I was not even born at the time.
However, his theme is
relevant.</div><a name="09061017000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Minister&#146;s closing remarks on the previous clause, she
talked about the &#147;do nothing&#148; approach. The Liberal
Democrats are not saying that nothing needs to be done, but the
Government&#146;s approach seems to be, &#147;If in doubt,
legislate.&#148; That seems to be the case in so much Home Office
legislation, which has demonstrated that legislation is not a proxy for
action. Putting provisions into primary legislation does not mean that
we will end up with the results that the right hon. Lady hopes for. In
fact, the Councillors Commission and the &#147;be a
councillor&#148; campaign have shown that the most effective
advocates for encouraging wider participation in civic life are
individuals who recruit and head-hunt others, and explain the role to
them. That is better than a corporate approach, although it is
available as back-up, but all the campaign&#146;s excellent work was
achieved without the need for an Act to support it. The work was all
about supporting individuals, but unfortunately the Bill is presumably
about providing corporate material and putting a duty on councils,
rather than stating that there should be a duty for everybody
involved.</div><a name="09061017000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
strongly feel that such a silo mentality needs to be broken down. It
would have been refreshing if the Bill had mentioned how some of the
issues could be dealt with by cutting across different Departments.
Perhaps the issues would be best addressed through guidance and a
best-practice manual, but by trying to deal with them through primary
legislation, the Government are boxing themselves into a corner, which
will not achieve their stated
aims.</div><a name="09061017000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000697"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I will be very brief, because a lot of dittoing
may be going on. In that respect, I can say only that the hon. Lady is
not right to say that the issues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>should be spread wider instead of brought together under one hub. What I
said was that we certainly believe that other organisations should
promote how they work and how people can get involved in decision
making, but we think it is a good idea for local councils to bring that
information
together.</div><a name="09061017000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000698"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> In which case, why is there not a requirement
for local authorities to promote the way that democracy works in
Westminster? If local authorities are to be the hub, why is there not
more on the face of the Bill to explain how democratic institutions
work at national level, and perhaps at European level? Why are there
not other duties to promote understanding of all those bodies, such as
the Child Support Agency, which was referred to earlier, where there
may not be a local impact? How those services impact on an individual
would certainly be of great interest to that
individual.</div><a name="09061017000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000699"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> As I said, the measure is about services at
local level. It is about people getting involved in shaping those
services. It is about people understanding how different organisations
work at local level; this is a local government Bill. I very much hope
that with those reassurances the Opposition will again crumble,
although I think it unlikely. However, I hope the Committee support
this wonderful

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000715"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Subsection 6 was added in the Lords, if I
remember rightly. I have nothing more to say about it. Generally, the
aim of the clause appears to be&#151;I hope the Minister will say a
little more about it in a moment&#151;to protect local authorities,
up to a point, from some of the consequences of the earlier clauses
that we debated this morning. Subsection (1) looks forward to a
situation in which a local authority has apparently requested
information from other bodies in order to promote understanding and so
on, and those other bodies have been less than helpful. Someone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>somewhere&#151;one of the many brilliant civil servants who work on
the Bill&#151;presumably said, &#147;Look Minister, we need some
protection for local authorities if all those many other bodies we have
listed in earlier clauses turn out to act unreasonably.&#148; That,
returning to our leitmotif, illustrates the folly of putting all these
things on the statute book at all, because having done so one then has
to insert supplementary clauses such as this one in order to protect
bodies that have been listed in earlier
clauses.</div><a name="09061017000620"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09061017000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not a lawyer, but I am quite interested in this. There will
presumably be a legal definition that the Minister knows, or
inspiration will provide an answer about the extent to which the other
body has not provided the information for the local authority as
required. I am curious to know how one judges the extent to which the
body has provided or not provided the information that would enable the
local authority to be protected by the
clause.</div><a name="09061017000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061017000716"></a><b class="B">Dan
Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I echo the comments of
other members of the Committee in that it is a pleasure to see you in
the Chair, Mr. Amess, providing a style complementary to
that of your fellow Chairman, whom we had the pleasure of serving under
earlier.</div><a name="09061017000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Wycombe pointed out, this aspect highlights the
weakness in all that has gone before. It obviously felt unreasonable to
ask the local authorities to do something over which they have no
control&#151;that is, where they need information to provide it to
local people, they must be able to request it from the bodies
concerned. If those bodies turn out to be far too busy or have other
priorities and do not provide it, it is only reasonable that the local
authority is not held to that duty.</div>
<a name="09061017000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
strikes me that it would be far more reasonable not to impose that duty
in the first place, which is what we have been talking about
throughout. This really highlights the nonsense that is the early part
of the Bill&#151;imposing a duty on a local authority rather than
issuing guidance on best practice. As I and other hon. Members said
during consideration of previous clauses, that would be a far more
sensible way
forward.</div><a name="09061017000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Liberal Democrats see the clause as highlighting the problem with the
whole of this part of the Bill. It is there so the Government can be
seen to be acting and forcing local authorities to do something that in
many circumstances they may not be able to do. This part of the Bill is
pretty pointless and clause 5 serves to highlight
that.</div><a name="09061017000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000717"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The hon. Member for Wycombe has shown a sharp,
razor-like understanding of what the clause is all
about&#151;ensuring that local authorities have the protection he
referred to, and rightly so. Obviously, the words &#147;to the extent
that&#148; have been advised by lawyers and parliamentary draftsmen
to make the provision absolutely clear cut. It is also true that we
think it important to have these safeguards in the legislation, which
is why clause 5 is there. There is no point in going over the arguments
we have already had about whether any of these clauses should exist. We
think this an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>important part of ensuring that local people understand how to get
involved in local institutions and play a role in civic
life.</div><a name="09061017000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000733"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> A moment ago, Mr. Amess, you may have
heard one of the Ministers on the Front Bench mutter, &#147;Are they
going to vote against every clause of the Bill?&#148;
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The answer, of course, is,
&#147;Wait and see.&#148; However, this is one of the more
innocuous clauses, or would be were it not for the
words</div><a name="09061017000601"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
discharge of their duties under this
Chapter&#148;,</div><a name="09061017000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
many of which we think unnecessary for the reasons we have advanced.
However, we are inclined to let it
go.</div><a name="09061017000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
more constructively, from the Minister&#146;s point of view I do not
think that there can be any reason in principle to oppose issuing
guidance on promoting understanding, although some people might argue
that it is somewhat heavy-handed. I would be grateful if she said a few
more words about what the consultation under the clause will consist of
and when she expects guidance to be
issued.</div><a name="09061017000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that we have had a letter on that point from the right hon. Member
for Wentworth (John Healey), who is now Minister for Housing, but
frankly, it came rather late. A brief exposition from the Minister on
the subject of guidance would be helpful for those following the
proceedings of this wretched
Bill.</div><a name="09061017000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000734"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I quite agree with the hon. Gentleman that
guidance is what it should be all about. Therefore, we would be happy
if not for the fact that the sensible proposition that Government might
issue guidance to local authorities on how to promote public
involvement in democracy in their areas is, sadly, nestling within a
nest of other proposals imposing duties on local authorities.</div>
<a name="09061017000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">For all the
reasons that we have outlined in our discussions on previous clauses,
which I will not revisit, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>we do not believe that imposing a duty is a sensible way to proceed.
Therefore, regretfully, we disagree yet again with the measures
proposed in the
clause.</div><a name="09061017000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000735"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> On when the guidance will be published, we will
obviously undertake consultation with relevant bodies, principally
local government representatives such as the Local Government
Association family, those representing the parish sector and the
connected authorities, and representatives of those carrying out the
roles covered in clauses 3 and
4.</div><a name="09061017000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would very much like to take into account the views of community
sector, for example, as well as those of the Equality and Human Rights
Commission, the Office for Disability Issues and the Government
Equalities Office. Again, it is important that we take into account, as
we have during discussions on the Bill, the views of the Committee and
any relevant amendments, so it is obviously wise to wait until Royal
Assent before publishing final guidance. It is important to have that
guidance and consult widely on
it.</div><a name="09061017000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000736"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I can understand why it would not be
appropriate to publish final guidance until the Bill has become an Act
and is on the statute book, but I cannot understand why draft guidance,
or even the terms of the consultation, might not be available. Surely
that would have aided our understanding of exactly how the Government
intend local councils to deliver on the responsibilities being imposed
on them through the
Bill.</div><a name="09061017000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000737"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Let me try to be helpful and assure the hon.
Lady that the guidance will include topics such as how the duties
relating to the promotion of democracy link to other legislation. There
will be guidance on what we mean by the various types of information
that should be made available and what is meant by &#147;promoting
understanding&#148;. Those are all issues that have rightly been
raised by the
Committee.</div><a name="09061017000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be guidance on what is meant by &#147;how to become a
councillor&#148;, the limits of what a council should do in
attracting people to stand, what constitutes support for a councillor,
which bodies are involved under clauses 2, 3 and 4, and what minimum
information should be covered. There will be an explanation of the
power to amend the list of
authorities.</div><a name="09061017000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061017000738"></a><b class="B">Barry

of
Scilly</div><a name="09061017000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000755"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I am trying to imagine a situation in which the
Opposition or others voted successfully to delete all the rest of the
clauses in this chapter but&#151;out of sheer whim, caprice and
mischief&#151;decided to leave clause 7 standing just to satisfy
Ministers that we were not opposing every clause in the Bill. I think
that would be a piece of whim, mischief and caprice too far. For that
reason, I see no logical reason why the clause should
stand.</div><a name="09061017000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000756"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for St.
Ives (Andrew George) would be delighted that we are taking a close
interest in matters that affect the Isles of Scilly and the people of
the Isles of Scilly. It strikes me that we are talking about
potentially applying such duties as may be imposed through guidance to
authorities as large as cities and, equally, to a council the size of
that for the Isles of
Scilly.</div><a name="09061017000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend has talked about the number of inspections of local
authorities that need to be undertaken in line with statute, and I
understand that although things may have been simplified a little, the
very same inspections all had to be undertaken of the Isles of Scilly
council. That may well have been a popular brief for the civil servants
who were required to visit the Isles of Scilly to undertake in-depth
evaluation of the council and its discharge of its responsibilities,
but it highlights the problem with the
provision.</div><a name="09061017000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne and I were
discussing earlier&#151;while paying all due attention to the debate
as it proceeded, of course&#151;the fact that such an exercise might
involve employing just about all the citizens of the Isles of Scilly to
discharge such duties as may be imposed on the council by the
provision. Although that might be a worthy attempt at job creation in
the Isles of Scilly, I suspect it might not be very
efficient.</div>
<a name="09061017000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet again, we
consider the proposals&#151;as set out in previous clauses, as they
pertain to the Isles of Scilly&#151;somewhat ill thought
out.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000757"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> The order-making power under clause
7 allows the Secretary of State to apply the duties relating to the
promotion of democracy to the Isles of Scilly, where local government
arrangements are slightly different. It might be necessary for the
provisions to be applied with modifications, but it is vital that we
include the clause, so that the Isles of Scilly will not be missed out
by the duty.</div>
<a name="09061017000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061017000758"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Lilley</b> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con): May I ask a
little more about the phrase &#147;with or without
modifications&#148;? I think that the terms are loosely worded and
badly drafted, because it is not clear whether the Act can be modified,
or whether statutory instruments introduced under the Act can be
different from legislation relating to the Isles of Scilly or
elsewhere. It has already been said that the statutory instruments can
differ between local authorities, and different wording was used. The
legislation implies that the Minister is given freedom to mould the
Act&#151;the primary legislation&#151;according to her whim and
fantasy, to fit the people of the Isles of Scilly. I do not think that
those people should be left to the caprice of Ministers. It should be
for Parliament to lay down what the primary legislation is, rather than
saying that it may or may not be modified.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000759"></a>Ms

any whims or fancies. The measure is included simply to ensure that the
duty is applied properly to the Isles of Scilly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000774"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I assume that this clause is one of a kind that
is often found in Bills and is a sort of belt-and-braces exercise for
Ministers that allows them to shovel in statutory instruments at a
later date to amend the legislation. There is a great deal of debate
and discussion in Parliament about whether, over many years, the
Executive have tended to use statutory instruments too often. I will
not get into that argument this afternoon,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000810"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess; that is
helpful.</div><a name="09061017000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall confine my remarks to the amendments tabled in my name and that
of my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall. They would ensure that
local authorities will not be penalised if they seek to go beyond the
base line of the scheme established under the Bill.
Amendment 38 would amend subsection 6 of the clause, so that
it
reads:</div><a name="09061017000603"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
principal local authority must comply with the statutory provisions of
its petition
scheme.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
therefore, if an authority wishes to go beyond the scope of the
statutory provisions and then fails to meet its ambitions, it will not
be penalised for having done so.</div>
<a name="09061017000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">As with so
many other things, including planning guidance, the lowest common
denominator is established and local authorities are averse to the risk
of going beyond that, which means that people are not encouraged to go
further. I hope that the Government want councils to do whatever they
can to be as responsive as possible and that, rather than penalising
councils that are slightly over-ambitious and are unable to deliver on
those ambitions, they ensure that a minimum requirement is delivered.
Similarly, amendment 39 would ensure that, if the requirements are
applied more widely, there will be no impact on councils if they wish
to go
further.</div><a name="09061017000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are straightforward, and I hope that the Minister will take
them in the spirit in which they were tabled&#151;they are all about
seeking reassurance that authorities that wish to go further and,
perhaps, push best practice even further will not be penalised for
doing
so.</div><a name="09061017000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000811"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> These amendments express, I think, the hon.
Lady&#146;s concerns that the requirements in the Bill may open the
way for increased numbers of judicial reviews or complaints. I hope
that I can reassure her on that and persuade her to withdraw the
amendment. We do not believe that the petitions regime will be onerous
for local authorities. When a council gets a petition, it must
acknowledge it and take appropriate action in respect of it.</div>
<a name="09061017000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the law
currently stands, if the council received a petition and responded in a
wholly unreasonable manner, it would be liable to challenge by judicial
review. Although what we seek to do will not look fantastically
different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>from the current situation, the profile of petitions will be raised.
People will know more clearly where and how to submit petitions and,
crucially, they will know that there will be guaranteed a response.
That is what is so important about the changes.</div>
<a name="09061017000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
true to say that, if all councils have a clear procedure for dealing
with petitions, they will be protected from any accusation that they
have acted in an unreasonable manner. Again, that is not necessarily
very different from what councils do in relation to any other function
that they discharge. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Lady.</div>
<a name="09061017000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 39
proposes to insert that nothing in this
chapter</div><a name="09061017000604"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prevents
a principal local authority from relaxing the requirements of its
petition schemes so as to apply it more widely than is required by this
Chapter of the
scheme&#148;.</div><a name="09061017000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the hon. Lady&#146;s concern is that, once a principal local
authority has a petition scheme, it would be considered unreasonable
and therefore a waste of resources for it to act in response to
petitions that fall outside that scheme. I can give her some
reassurance on that. I do not think that any aspect of the
Bill&#146;s requirements could be interpreted as imposing any sort of
exclusive set of obligations for the handling of petitions. Therefore,
we would not get the kind of criticism that she fears.</div>
<a name="09061017000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we have
tried to do in this chapter is make it very clear that the authorities
are given a very wide discretion about what to include in their schemes
and how to respond to petitions. Although local authorities must do at
least what their petition schemes say they will do, they will continue
to have discretion to go wider if they wish, and the provision will not
prevent them from responding to any petition that they receive. With
that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="09061017000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000812"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b><b class="B"> </b>I will not seek to push these
amendments to a vote, but I would like to respond and reflect on some
of the comments that the Minister has made. The Minister initially said
that these were not onerous requirements. If that is the case, I wonder
whether the Minister&#146;s own Department will be taking on such a
policy in relation to petitions. I understand that it does not count
the number of petitions that it receives. If best practice is so
straightforward, I see no reason why the Department for Communities and
Local Government should not improve its efforts to ensure that it too
abides by similar best practice.</div>
<a name="09061017000622"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09061017000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention of the amendments was to raise questions about the sanctions
in the Bill imposed on those local authorities not complying with the
requirements on petitions. It seems that there will not be any.
However, as was the case with the duties in the previous chapter that
would promote democracy at a local level, I wonder whether it is
another example of compliance being monitored by yet another key
performance indicator. Once again, we are seeing mission creep: the
Government say that they are reducing the number of key performance
indicators but are increasing them through the back door.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="09061017000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I still have
serious concerns about why this more general point is included in the

to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000813"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> As ever, Mr. Amess, it is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="09061017000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 11,
like the chapter, is similar to the previous one in its complete
vacuity. One has to ask the deep philosophical question, &#147;If
this clause did not exist, would local government in Britain be
demonstrably the poorer for it?&#148; I suspect that the answer is
no. It forcefully makes the case that the Government have run out of
ideas. After 12 years of Labour Governments, the clause is a triumph of
trivia. I am amazed that Ministers and Labour Members should be
surprised that councillors feel undervalued from time to time. With
such legislation, their decisions, their authority and their autonomy
are circumscribed.</div>
<a name="09061017000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
question is why it is necessary for such provisions to be made in
primary legislation, reaching as they do into the nooks and crannies,
and the minutiae of local government. Effectively, it is an
assertion writ large that local councillors cannot be trusted to
administer their areas properly&#151;and, more
importantly, that local electors are frankly too stupid to realise that
their councils are either very good or very bad, and that
they have to be drawn to water like the proverbial horse.</div>
<a name="09061017000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The irony is
that things could have been different. When the White Paper
&#147;Communities in Control&#148; was published in July
2008&#151;it followed the Green White Paper &#147;The Governance of
Britain&#148;, published by the Prime Minister in July
2007&#151;there was a real opportunity to empower communities. To
give the right hon. Member for Salford (Hazel Blears) her due, the late
and not much lamented by the Labour party Secretary of State was
committed. Some people made hay in the other place about the lack of
petitions in Salford. I would not dare to make that point again, but
the fact is that it would be a wasted opportunity.</div>
<a name="09061017000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
problem is the accretion of power to unelected quangos and other
bodies. The Bill makes no mention of that. As we all
know&#151;reference has been made to this before&#151;people are
concerned about the Child Support Agency, the Border and Immigration
Agency, Jobcentre Plus and CAFCASS to name but a few, but where is the
opportunity to petition them for immediate action? It is much easier
for the Government to beat up on local government and make the
assertion that councillors are not fulfilling the functions for which
they were elected. That is wrong.</div>
<a name="09061017000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
empirical or academic evidence to underpin the clause, but a rather
dodgy survey, the provenance and robustness of which we have never
established, was debated in the other place in January. A Local
Government Association survey apparently showed that 30 per cent. of
councils fail to deal properly with petitions. That is the only
evidence of the need for this intrusive, prescriptive and draconian
clause to force local councils to do what they are already
doing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000814"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Does my hon. Friend believe that the force of the
Government&#146;s argument is that there is a case for requiring
Departments to respond to petitions? To give the hon. Member for
Falmouth and Camborne her due, she pointed out on Second Reading that
the Department does not have a good record in responding to petitions,
and I am sure that she will make great play of that later. If the
Department cannot get it right, why are the Government putting these
cumbersome and burdensome duties on local
authorities?</div><a name="09061017000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000815"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> My hon. Friend makes his point powerfully, and I
suspect that the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne is no longer on
the South West of England Development Agency&#146;s Christmas card
list. Nevertheless, she made a strong
point.</div><a name="09061017000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is a displacement activity to cover up what the Government
should have done, but have not done, to empower local people and to
give them real financial autonomy and democratic powers. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden made the important point
that many of us have constituents who have issues with housing and
arm&#146;s length management organisations, but instead of providing
them with the capacity to petition, we are concentrating on other
third-party bodies. Those responsibilities are falling to local
authorities
unfairly.</div><a name="09061017000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
back at House of Lords debates shows that there was significant
consensus about the possible efficacy of the clause. It is interesting
that many people with years of direct experience in local government
held forth ad infinitum on the matter, and made some powerful points.
Lord Greaves, the sage of Pendle said on
Report:</div><a name="09061017000605"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would much prefer that the entire chapter on petitions did not exist.

view.</div><a name="09061017000606"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part
1, chapter 2 deals with petitions, and probably the less said about
that the better. Petitions provide one mechanism for citizens to
highlight concerns, but one must question whether 11 clauses are
necessary. It looks to me suspiciously like
micro-management.&#148;&#151; [<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 1 June 2009;

Second Reading. Does my hon. Friend hope, as I do, that the right hon.

views?</div><a name="09061017000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000817"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich
is being uncharacteristically taciturn. As an hon. and fair-minded
Member, he cannot reconcile the dichotomy between commitments in
various Green and White Papers and by Ministers for real localism and
the top-down centralism of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061017000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), who
knows what he is talking about with his expertise, said in response to
the White Paper on 8 July
2008:</div><a name="09061017000607"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
petitions are to play a more important role, does the Secretary of
State realise that listening to them will be all the more important?
The Government have ignored petitions on post office closures,
polyclinics, a referendum on the European treaty and the congestion
charge. What is the point in a council having a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>duty to respond to petitions if it has been stripped of its powers to
make any difference?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 9 July
2008; Vol. 478, c.
1415.]</div><a name="09061017000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is important. Furthermore, Ministers pray in aid the support that they
have received from the Local Government Association. The Minister will
know that the LGA believes that the clause, and its associated clauses,
is a turkey. It says
that</div><a name="09061017000608"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
LGA does not accept evidence of widespread public dissatisfaction with
the way petitions are currently handled by local
authorities.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also says that it
foresees</div><a name="09061017000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;problems
with the introduction of a prescriptive process for handling petitions,
leading to a greater bureaucracy for dealing with them...The LGA
does not therefore agree with the proposal to impose a duty to respond
to local petitions as outlined in the consultation
paper&#148;.</div><a name="09061017000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
as Ministers will know, the LGA offers an alternative which we would
have supported had Ministers themselves brought it forward as an
amendment. That is to
update</div><a name="09061017000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
model constitution published by CLG following the Local Government Act
2000, along with updated guidance under S31 of that Act, setting out
best practice guidance on handling petitions and
deputations.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leads me to another important point. Given that these powers, duties
and responsibilities are new to local authorities, I fail to see how
any realistic impact assessment can be made of the cost of the
proposals. They are plucked out of the air. We have no idea. In this
age of difficult fiscal decisions and a lack money in terms of the
grants given to local authorities, we will be piling even more
responsibilities on them to deal, particularly, with
petitions.</div>
<a name="09061017000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause&#151;and others&#151;is superfluous and unnecessary, as my
right hon. Friend said. It is at the end game of a drive to a unitary
state&#151;not federalism, not localism, top-down Stalinist,
draconian proposals which force people to do the bidding of Government.
It stands as a disreputable rebuke to the best interests of local
people and to democracy in this country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000819"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I have respect for the hon. Gentleman and the
question was fair. However, at that stage, ultimately, the sanction of
the voters of Scotland and the other parts of the UK came into play.
That is not any kind of analogy.</div>
<a name="09061017000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Bill,
the Government seek to take away what authority and autonomy local
government have left by forcing them into prescriptive schemes for
petitions on the basis that they do not know what is good for their
local area. For that reason, we want to divide the Committee on the
stand part debate.</div>

Goldsworthy:</b> I am not sure that I will be talking in quite
such hyperbole as the previous speaker. However, I wonder whether the
Labour party will draw some lessons from the example just raised, in
which an unpopular policy was introduced that resulted in the Prime
Minister losing her job and being replaced by somebody else. Perhaps
this is the policy&#151;perhaps this is the one&#151;that will
drive people to revolt. I suspect not.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="09061017000303"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000822"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I will not push the analogy too far. The only
analogy that I begin my remarks with is that, once again, it is
groundhog day because the first question has to be: why is this in
primary legislation? If No. 10 can introduce an e-petition system on
its website without the need for primary legislation, it begs the
question of why we need to have this set-up for local authorities in
primary legislation. I doubt whether anyone in this room thinks that it
is best practice for councils not to respond to petitions. Everyone
thinks it is a good idea to ensure that councils are as responsive as
possible in whatever way
possible.</div><a name="09061017000623"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="09061017000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000823"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Does my hon. Friend share my concern that the
Bill says nothing about how councils should respond to a letter or a
telephone call? Perhaps we need some primary legislation to inform
council offices how long they should take to respond to a letter, which
paper they should use and whether it is in the right sort of
envelope.</div>
<a name="09061017000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000824"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> My hon. Friend is exactly right. If we are
going to specify how councils should respond to petitions, why not
specify how they should respond to debates, after how many rings they
should answer the phone, what their working hours should be, how many
times a year they should sit, the details of their scrutiny committees
and how many visits planning officers should make? If this is where it
starts, where does it stop in terms of the Government ensuring that
local authorities fulfil their duties and are as responsive as
possible? That is something that should be decided at the ballot box.
If people feel that their council is inaccessible, they will have the
opportunity to elect members who will stand on a platform to make their
councils more responsive. The more responsive the members are,
presumably the more likely they are to get
elected.</div><a name="09061017000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000825"></a>Ian
Stewart:</b> Does the hon. Lady, in her calmer moments, not
realise that there have to be certain basic standards across local
government? Surely it is the role of national Government to help to set
those basic
standards.</div><a name="09061017000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000826"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting
point. To follow the logic of that argument, one would expect central
Government to be setting those standards and abiding by them
themselves. Instead, the very Department that imposes these standards
on local authorities, has no policy for dealing with petitions. It does
not even count the petitions that it receives. There is no common
standard set for any Government Department and even this Parliament has
no clear procedure for dealing with petitions. Most of the petitions
that get presented ultimately disappear into a beige sack; no one ever
sees what happens to them.</div>
<a name="09061017000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument is that we need consistency, why are we not
applying the measure across the board? Why are we not setting down
standards that ensure that all public bodies respond to petitions in
the same way so that if people submit a petition to Parliament, a
Government Department or the Prime Minister they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>know that there will be consistency in the response that they receive?
Should not the same be true of other bodies making decisions about
public spending in their area, such as strategic health authorities,
primary care trusts and all the other organisations we discussed in
respect of previous clauses? If there is a need for consistency, and if
that consistency would help people to understand how the process should
work, why not apply the measure across the board? Why are we singling
out local authorities in this
way?</div><a name="09061017000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000827"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Lady and I are in danger of agreeing on
too many things. Is there not a huge chasm between this
micromanagement, interference at local level and the undermining of
local autonomy and what we see in our casework in dealing with
organisations such as the UK Border Agency? We routinely receive
letters as Members of Parliament acting on behalf of constituents
telling us that it will be two years before cases are even looked at.
Is that not a huge chasm that the Government should be looking
at?</div><a name="09061017000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000828"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The Government should be looking at that. If
this is about trying to get people to understand how the process works
and to have an impact on it, it should cross cut all Departments. The
hon. Gentleman implies that the Government&#146;s motivation behind
all this is that they cannot help but centralise. That might be one of
their tendencies, but I wonder whether the reason the provision is in
the Bill is that we have so little on the legislative agenda. They
thought that they could throw that in to provide an afternoon&#146;s
debate&#151;it was an act of desperation to get something on the
legislative agenda. We thought that a general election might have been
and gone by now. So very little is on the
agenda.</div><a name="09061017000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
main concern is that, by singling out petitions, the Bill might give
people the impression that, if they have a problem, petitions are their
only possible recourse. In reality, however, many other options are
open to them, should they receive a service with which they are
dissatisfied or a decision be made with which they do not agree. As
will be seen in the discussion on later clauses, councils&#146;
complaints procedures might be far more effective in resolving problems
with individual officers. By putting petitions at front and centre,
people might get the impression that they are the only way in which to
register discontent. In some cases, however, they are not the most
effective way in which to highlight or to resolve problems that
individuals might
encounter.</div><a name="09061017000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
comes back to a fundamental misunderstanding by the Government. The
problem with petitions is similar to that with consultation, which has
become a dirty word, because people think that it simply pays lip
service to the decision-making process. For example, during the Post
Office consultation, people had no impact on the outcome. They were
basically told, &#147;You will have an opportunity to have your say,
but then we will do what we planned to do anyway.&#148; That is why
people are frustrated. There is no lack of understanding of how the
process works. Petitions are not a miraculous way in which to address
people&#146;s frustrations.</div>
<a name="09061017000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key thing
that people want is this: if they have a problem or disagreement, their
involvement must have the potential to impact on the outcome. However,
the provisions in the Bill do not provide for that, basically because
it is impossible for primary legislation to set out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>how people&#146;s involvement, through petitions or anything else,
will impact on the decision-making process. That is what people care
about. Clause 11(7)
reads:</div><a name="09061017000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Subject
to that, nothing in this Chapter affects the powers or duties of a
principal local authority in relation to any petition to
it.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Basically,
that means that councils will have a duty to respond to petitions, but
not to ensure that they have any impact on any policy or
decision.</div><a name="09061017000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000829"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> Again the hon. Lady makes a strong point, and it
was made also by the Local Government Association: it is disingenuous
of the Government to refuse to devolve further powers to local
authorities while, in this Bill, making more onerous commitments on
their behalf. In its response to the Bill, the LGA
wrote:</div><a name="09061017000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the government is transferring power and influence to local authorities
and citizens then councils should have the ability to take up issues on
behalf of their residents with other public service
providers.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000830"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> The key issue is not that councils should be
required to respond to members of the public in their area; it is about
what we can do to enable councils to be more responsive to the wishes
and needs of the people living in the area. This part of the Bill,
especially clause 11, does not address that point. I fear that it is
just another example of how the Government, in their proposals, are
missing the point. They are not hitting the target. People want the
ability to impact on the decision-making process. They do not want to
feel that they have simply been consulted to death, only for the
original decision to be taken anyway.</div>
<a name="09061017000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">That key
issue has not been, and cannot be, resolved through primary
legislation. It can be resolved only by genuinely devolving more power
and resources to local authorities. We then have to give people the
power at the ballot box to make their choices, if they do not feel that
their council has done the right thing. It seems that the Government
are terrified of letting go and allowing local authorities to be
masters of their own destiny. To me, that is what is so depressing
about so many of the provisions. I never doubted the willingness of the
right hon. Member for Salford (Hazel Blears) to engage with people, but
if these proposals are the answer, I wonder what the Government think
that the question
is.</div><a name="09061017000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000831"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Apart from the slightly odd intervention about
draconian, dictatorial imposition on local authorities and individuals,
what has emerged from the debate is that the Committee believes that
petitions have a role to play in allowing local people to express their
views and to hold their local authorities to account. Indeed, the
Conservative document, &#147;Control Shift&#151;Returning Power to
Local Communities&#148; talks about petitions signed by more than 5
per cent. of local residents within six months being able to trigger a
referendum. Obviously, the Conservative party approach to petitions
recognises their role and, in that case, talks about being able to have
a referendum. Therefore, I hope that there is not a huge difference of
opinion on petitions having an important role to play.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="09061017000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lots of
remarks have been made about central Government. The CLG website
clearly signposts people to how we deal with petitions, confirming that
the Department already responds to all petitions and aims to do so
within 20 days. From 9 July details of petitions received by CLG will
be published on the site alongside the response. The Downing street
e-petition has been extremely successful&#151;something like 27,000
petitions have been accepted for response. The Downing street petition
system does not respond to petitions that are offensive to
sections of society, but all petitions are acknowledged and, once
petitions have closed, they are either passed to the Prime
Minister&#146;s office or sent to the Department. Where a petition is
signed by at least 500 people, signatories receive an e-mail detailing
the Government&#146;s response to the issues raised. We are certainly
setting an example at the national Government
level.</div><a name="09061017000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a Local Government
Association survey of 102 councils in England&#151;something like a
quarter of the sector&#151; which found that only 28 per
cent. of councils guarantee an automatic response to petitions.
However, at the same time a YouGov poll found that, if a
response  were guaranteed, 84 per cent. of people would be more
likely to sign a petition to their council and more  than half
of people would be more likely to organise a
petition.</div><a name="09061017000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne,
if a petition is simply ignored&#151;there is, as I said, rather a
lot of evidence that that happens&#151;people will not know whether
the points raised in the petition have been responded to. She was
saying, &#147;Well, they can make up their minds at the ballot
box&#148;, but if they do not know what response there has been to
their petition, it is very difficult for individuals to know whether
changes have been made&#151;sometimes, frankly, changes might well
have been made. However, if people do not know about it, because no
response was given, it is more difficult to make that judgment. That is
why we are setting out a procedure that enables people to respond to a
petition. That is one of many procedures that we have brought forward
to ensure that petitions become an effective way for local people to
express their
views.</div><a name="09061017000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000847"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> Casting your eye over these amendments,
Mr. Amess, it should strike you that they cover, at least in
part, the same issue. Although they are related, amendment 41 goes
slightly further. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne
and I tabled these amendments to seek clarification from the Minister
about the intention of the Bill, particularly in relation to petitions
submitted concerning contentious planning or licensing
issues.</div><a name="09061017000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Planning
and licensing are covered by other legislation. I feel, and many of our
constituents feel, that their views are not always taken thoroughly
into consideration. The planning system needs reform further to recent
Acts in order to reassure people that their views are being taken into
account on issues that affect the development of their local area. The
system needs some change to engage them with that process. As my hon.
Friend said earlier, people are beginning to believe that what they say
has no effect&#151;planning is a prominent example of that. That is
not to say that local authority members should not be free to make
decisions based on the information available to them&#151;information
that might not be available to petitioners, who may bring forward other
issues. Objectors feel that they do not have enough say when
considering the possibility of a third-party right of appeal&#151;an
issue that I debated with the Minister&#146;s colleagues during the
passage of the Planning and Energy Act 2008. Such changes would
reassure people that their views were being taken into account and that
the planning system was more democratic than it currently
is.</div><a name="09061017000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are issues pertaining to planning and licensing that could necessitate
a different approach. When we move on to discuss what local authorities
should do when dealing with petitions, we ought to consider that
certain issues, notably planning and licensing, are different from
function and need to be handled differently.</div>
<a name="09061017000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 41
relates to how petitions on proposals that are already being considered
by a principal local authority should be dealt with. Should they
trigger the procedure that a principal local authority would have to
follow under the Bill or could they simply be accepted and responded to
as part of the existing consultation process? When such things are put
on a statutory basis, I, like my hon. Friend, fear that they will
become the main route for interaction with the local community. People
on both sides of the process might try to slow 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>the planning or licensing process by triggering lots of petitions that
would all have to be considered in the same
way.</div><a name="09061017000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
contention is that we ought to be cautious in imposing standardised
ways of dealing with petitions because particular factors pertain to
planning and licensing. It is possible that existing consultation
processes will be cut across. Sadly, as my hon. Friend pointed out,
consultation has become a devalued concept. However, it does go on. I
would hope that local authorities take more account of consultations
than central Government and there is evidence that they do. In places
where that is happening properly, it would be a shame to do something
that cuts across the good
work.</div><a name="09061017000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments prod the Minister to defend the use of a standardised
petition for considering petitions right across the functions of a
council, even what some would call the quasi-judicial functions such as
planning and
licensing.</div><a name="09061017000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000848"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good case and has
explained the rationale behind the Liberal Democrat amendments. I would
fight shy of anything that reduces the validity of petitions in the
remit of quasi-judicial bodies. As a London borough councillor, I
served on the licensing panel and the planning and regulatory committee
in the good old days when we had a proper committee system and did not
have first and second-class councillors, as we do now. I was always
mindful of the importance of a petition in informing the debate, even
when further judicial determinations were
necessary.</div><a name="09061017000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
practical ramification of the Licensing Act 2003 and the secondary
legislation attached to it is that the consultation procedures on
matters such as varying the opening times of licensed premises and
restaurants are very prescriptive. It is important that we
have&#151;to use a ghastly term because I cannot think of a better
one&#151;an holistic approach. To give a simple example, the
McDonald&#146;s in Peterborough city centre sought to open virtually
24 hours a day. As the constituency MP, I did not think that
that should happen. I was told that as a result of case law and
regulations, I was not permitted&#151;even as the MP for
Peterborough&#151;to comment on that because I was not a local
resident. However, had I organised a petition it might have been a
different matter. If there were local residents on the petition, it
would have been a valid objection to those
proposals.</div><a name="09061017000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am in sympathy with the idea that petitions need to be complementary to
quasi-judicial processes, and the Minister should take that into
account when
responding.</div><a name="09061017000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000849"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> Amendments 40 and 41 relate to the
Government&#146;s public commitment to use the order-making power
under clause 14 to exclude planning and licensing applications from the
scope of the duty to respond to petitions. I want to make it clear that
the list of issues excluded from the duty to respond to petitions
should be very limited. We believe that building petitions into council
decision-making processes will empower people, so we want to minimise
the issues that are excluded and keep the scope of the duty as broad as
possible. Obviously, there are some issues that it makes sense to
exclude, such as licensing and planning applications, because we do not
want to set up parallel routes for considering 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>local people&#146;s concerns in such circumstances. There are already
extensive processes for public involvement in planning and licensing
applications.</div><a name="09061017000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a technical reservation about amendments 40 and 41, although they
capture the broad aims of our intention. For instance, we want to
ensure that, in addition to planning applications, planning enforcement
decisions and the decision not to enforce would be excluded. To explain
the sort of extra detail that we need to look at, it might be helpful
to refer the Committee to Statutory Instrument No. 3261, the Overview
and Scrutiny (Reference by Councillors) (Excluded Matters) (England)
Order 2008. That order took the same approach for the councillor call
for action, as we intend to take for petitions. However, it is quite
long&#151;30 lines&#151;and adding such provisions to the Bill
would not be the right
approach.</div><a name="09061017000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
41 contains one additional exclusion. It provides that issues on which
the authority is currently carrying out a formal public consultation
should be excluded. That is an interesting idea. The rationale is the
same for excluding planning and licensing applications. However, it
would be important to reflect further on such matters and particular
discussions with local government on how an exclusion might work in
practice. The issues need to be thought through in detail, and using
secondary legislation allows us to do that. We intend to consult on
which issues should be excluded from the duty to respond to petitions
after the Bill has received Royal Assent.</div>
<a name="09061017000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, we want to keep exclusions to a minimum, but it is also important
that, in drawing up further legislation, we consult local authorities.
I therefore cannot support amendments 40 and 41, and ask that they be
withdrawn.</div>
<a name="09061017000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000850"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I am pleased that the Minister is considering
such issues in detail. I confess that I would not have expected her to
have accepted them straight into the Bill. I wish to clarify that it is
not my intention to imply that councils should not respond to petitions
on planning or licensing issues. I am sure that the hon. Member for
Peterborough was not implying that it was. It merely is that matters
might be done differently from more standardised petitions on a matter
of policy for a principal
council.</div><a name="09061017000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s McDonald&#146;s reference, a particularly
contentious issue in part of my constituency is a lap-dancing club. I
know that a number of hon. Members from all parties have contended with
that issue in their constituencies. There is some dissatisfaction among
local residents about how the petitions may have been submitted on that
and whether current licensing powers mean that their local authority is
able to respond to the wishes of the local community. The Government
will now hopefully look at that through the recent Act put through by
the Home
Office.</div><a name="09061017000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taking
into account that the Minister said she would take on board the fact
that there are differences between planning, licensing and more general
matters of policy, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000853"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> The amendments in my name and that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne relate to a couple of
issues on which we, again, seek clarification about the
Government&#146;s intention.</div>
<a name="09061017000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
amendment 42, we are seeking to explore what the appropriate route
would be for a petition to be considered. We have a system in which
executive members are responsible for the functions of an authority and
who have a particular role in setting out those functions and presiding
over the delivery of them, as was alluded to by the hon. Member for
Peterborough with regard to the old committee situation. The way that
we do things now in local authorities means that particular members
have responsibility for the delivery of functions and so, through
amendment 42, we seek to explore whether it is appropriate for
petitions to be directed to those responsible members and for them to
respond as to what the council&#146;s policy is and what the response
is.</div><a name="09061017000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
43 covers an issue that is certainly missing. If we accept&#151;as we
seem to have done following a vote on an earlier clause&#151;that
provisions will set out what the response to a petition should be,
under the clause we are now considering, the local authority is
committed to deciding whether the petition is a matter for that local
authority or for a local partner body. So, if a petition on an issue is
submitted to a council, it can say, &#147;This is for us and is
something to which we must respond&#148; or, &#147;This is
something for another local body and it must be passed on to
them.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061017000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The omission
there seems to be in relation to matters for central
Government&#151;a Department or an agency of a Department&#151;and
therefore amendment 43 would provide the extra option of passing the
petition on to the responsible Department. That is important. If we are
in the business of encouraging people to understand what the different
levels of government do, what their functions are and how they
interact, it would be rather strange for a local authority to be forced
in some way to consider a policy matter that is clearly determined by a
central Government Department. The amendment would be a sensible way of
resolving that situation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div><a name="09061017000368"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000854"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> I shall make a brief general point; I hope that
you do not rule me out of order, Mr. Amess. In respect of
clause 14, I think that hon. Members across the House might be
concerned about the loose definition of subsection (1)(b) in respect of
petitions that are vexatious, abusive or otherwise inappropriate. In
practical terms, we have seen the recent controversy in Mid
Bedfordshire district council&#151;as it then was&#151;over a
petition concerning Gypsies and Travellers. I understand that a value
judgment was made by council officers without recourse to elected
members&#151;or, at least, elected members were sent the letters but
did not read them&#151;that branded petitioners potentially racist. I
know this is rather tangential, but perhaps the Minister will dwell on
the value judgments that are made about what is inappropriate or
vexatious.</div><a name="09061017000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall come back to order, Mr. Amess, and return to the point
of the hon. Member for North Cornwall point concerning the appropriate
cabinet member or leader. If we are to be consistent in our
philosophical approach to the Bill, we are not predisposed to support
this point simply because there is a practical issue with it. I should
like to quote the good Lord Greaves again on that. If a small
cul-de-sac wants its pavements to be looked at by the local authority
or highways maintenance and has 15 signatures, or if there is a
petition against the third runway that has 75,000 or 100,000
signatures, it might not be practical to remit that petition or all
petitions, through the Bill, to one named individual or office holder.
That would set a dangerous precedent and it would not be consistent
with our ideological and philosophical approach to accept
that.</div>
<a name="09061017000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are minded
to look favourably on amendment 43, which was tabled by the hon. Member
for North Cornwall. I think that he seeks, by a circuitous sleight of
hand, to do what we pressed the Minister and the Government to do
earlier and practise what they preach. If local authorities are to have
responsibilities cascaded down to them, they should not be responsible
for discharging duties in relation to people for whom they have no
democratic influence or accountability. On that basis, if the hon.
Gentleman presses the amendment to a vote, we will support
it.</div><a name="09061017000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000855"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I shall deal first with amendment 42. I am sure
that the hon. Member for North Cornwall did not intend it to create a
barrier, but I fear that what has already been said is correct and that
it would make things difficult for people who are petitioning. Local
people do not always know who their local councillor is, let alone who
the cabinet member is, so the amendment would create a problem and I do
not want to accept it.</div>
<a name="09061017000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
43, I understand that the hon. Gentleman is trying to increase the
transparency of the way that petitions are dealt with, and I am in
favour of that, but the amendment is not necessary because in many ways
its aims have already been achieved. Members of the public can already
ask the Secretary of State to call in planning applications. Recently
published direction on that prioritises the cases that we think most
appropriate for the Secretary of State to consider, such as those
affecting green belt land, but the Secretary of State can call in any
application.</div>
<a name="09061017000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some
cases, the aims of the amendment are already achieved, and in others I
am not convinced that it would be useful. We have yet to consult on the
issues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>that should be excluded by order under the clause 14 power, but
depending what the exclusions are, the relevant Department may not
always be able to act on the petition. Again, we cannot pre-empt the
consultation that we are going to undertake in this case, and there is
therefore a risk that the amendment proposed would put an additional
administrative burden on local authorities without having the effect
that we are trying to achieve of empowering petitions. I am sorry that
I cannot ask the Committee to support amendments 43 and 42, but I hope
that I have been clear as to
why.</div><a name="09061017000374"></a>

that petitions should be referred to central Government Departments.
That would be a helpful additional to the Bill. If strictures are to be
placed on local authorities when dealing with petitions, it is
unreasonable that they should be asked to deal with issues that are not
relevant to them. Indeed, local people&#146;s understanding about
which level of government is responsible for which function&#151;the
issue that we were debating this morning&#151;would not be increased
if there were not the facility for petitions to be referred back to the
authority that can best consider
them.</div><a name="09061017000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 42, I accept what the Minister said about the matter going to
the appropriate cabinet member or leader, although that would be
consistent with the approach to local democracy that the Government
have advanced, which puts the executive function in the hands of a
certain group of members. If that is not the correct way to do it,
perhaps another way could be arrived at that would allow those
executive members to consider petitions that are referred to the
authority, after which the appropriate cabinet member or leader would
be able to respond to them, with support or information provided by
officers. So although we would not expect all the work to be done by
the poor cabinet member, they would certainly have a role in justifying
the position of the authority in line with the office that they
hold.</div><a name="09061017000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000898"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I beg to move amendment 47, in
clause 16, page 10, line 22, leave
out from &#145;means&#146; to end of line
25.</div><a name="09061017000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
16 relates to a particular kind of petition, namely the requirement to
call an officer to account. In the debates in another place, it was
felt that the matter needs to be handled carefully and sensitively.
Officers of all grades in authorities work day to day with local people
in local communities and may have to take decisions or make judgments
that make them unpopular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>with those people. If it were possible for officers to be called to
account by the public, in a very public way, perhaps when the
petitioners do not have all the facts available to them, it would be
stressful and difficult for them to do their jobs. Therefore, amendment
47 seeks to limit officers who can be called to account to those at the
highest level in authorities and those who take the ultimate
responsibility for many of the functions delivered by the paid service.
That seems far more reasonable. That group is of a position and
authority&#151;indeed, they will have the support behind
them&#151;to be able to deal with a public debate on whether they
have fulfilled their
role.</div>
<a name="09061017000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not seek
to detain the Committee for long, but this is an important point. We
want to encourage people to come into public service, to work for local
authorities and to continue to do good work, and it is important that
only those of a senior grade are affected by such a measure and that
only they will be called to account in such a
way.</div>
<a name="09061017000437"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000899"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> My concern about the clause is that we are
beginning to blur the lines of responsibility between elected
councillors, who must regularly be held responsible to their
electorates, and paid professionals, who serve in a civil service role
at local
level.</div><a name="09061017000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
of us who has attended public meetings over contentious issues such as
school closures, noise from industrial units or telecoms masts will
know that members of the public can become upset and angry, and that
they can direct some of that energy towards officers. I feel profoundly
uncomfortable about absolving councillors of the responsibility of
having a coherent policy and answering to their constituents. Under the
Bill, it would almost be as though they could pass the buck to
officers. The measure is the thin end of the
wedge.</div><a name="09061017000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not a partisan issue. When the Bill was debated in the other place,
Baroness Hamwee made similar points, but Baroness Andrews, the
Minister, did not sufficiently assuage her genuine concerns and those
of others. I invite the Minister to touch on those concerns in her
remarks.</div>
<a name="09061017000440"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000900"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> I certainly have some sympathy with the
amendment and its attempt to protect junior local authority officers
from being required to attend meetings under the clause. The hon.
Member for North Cornwall mentioned some of the meetings that we, as
MPs, have attended, where junior officers have been put under
considerable pressure. I think that brings home to us the importance of
ensuring that the correct safeguards are in
place.</div><a name="09061017000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to ensure that certain officers can be required to attend
meetings, and to start with, we have set out some methods. For example,
in subsection (3), the authority&#146;s petition scheme must specify
how many signatures will be needed to require an officer to attend a
public hearing. That gives the local authority some discretion. We are
also looking at other provisions. For example, under the Local
Government Act 2003, any officer of the authority can be required to
give evidence at a meeting of the overview and scrutiny committee. That
is one way in which local authorities call officers  to
account.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div><a name="09061017000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment
in the Bill, it is for authorities themselves to determine which of
their officers will be liable to be called to give evidence by
petition. If the petitions are to have a meaningful impact, it is
important that the most senior officers can certainly be called upon.
That is why under the clause, as a minimum, petition schemes will
provide that the head of paid service&#151;often known as the chief
executive&#151;and the most senior officers responsible for the
delivery of services can be required to provide information on their
activities at public meetings of overview and scrutiny
committees.</div><a name="09061017000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
certainly want to ensure that, in our guidance, when we have consulted
closely with local authorities and others, we reach a situation where
junior officers would not be subjected to inappropriate public pressure
as a result of the clause. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we will
make that clear in the guidance that we intend to issue to aid local
authorities in interpreting the legislation. I hope that that offers
some reassurance to
him.</div><a name="09061017000444"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000901"></a>Dan
Rogerson:</b> I find that somewhat reassuring, and I think
that it is important that we have had the debate. I know that those who
will implement the legislation will have regard to the discussions that
we have had here in Committee and on the Floor of the House. It is
important, therefore, that we put on the record our concerns for junior
officers.</div>
<a name="09061017000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
sympathy with what the hon. Member for Peterborough said about the
whole idea behind the clause&#151;calling officers to
account&#151;but it is not totally unreasonable to expect the most
senior officers of an authority to come and give evidence on an issue
to a meeting of that authority. I am talking not about a public meeting
arranged in the community by a pressure group, but about meetings of
that authority. People would particularly like to see the chief officer
there, giving evidence while an issue was being considered. I think
that that is a reasonable way to proceed, but there are concerns about
junior officers, as I said. They might not be supported or, indeed,
paid well enough to be expected to take the heat at a public meeting in
that way. I am glad that the Minister has considered it. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061017000446"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
19</h4><a name="09061017000020"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Powers
of appropriate national
authority</div><a name="09061017000484"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000928"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I beg to move amendment 48, in
clause 19, page 12, line 29, leave
out subsection
(1).</div><a name="09061017000485"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000929"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 50, in
clause 19, page 13, line 1, leave
out subsection
(6).</div><a name="09061017000486"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000930"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I do not propose to detain the Committee for
long. The amendment repeats a point that has been made many times
already. Earlier in this chapter, there were discussions about how
councils could formulate their own policy on responding to petitions.
However, clause 19 then basically says that the Secretary of State can
do whatever he or she likes anyway and that the Government can impose
whatever schemes they like.</div>
<a name="09061017000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would withdraw the provisions in the clause that allow the
Secretary of State to do whatever he or she likes. Subsection (1)
allows the appropriate national authority to make provisions as to what
a petition scheme must or must not contain, which seems exactly the
opposite of what the Minister says the Bill is intended to achieve,
because it involves central diktats. Subsection (6)
states:</div><a name="09061017000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
appropriate national authority may direct a principal local authority
to make such revisions to its petition scheme as may be specified in
the direction&#148;,</div>
<a name="09061017000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on.</div>
<a name="09061017000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other aspects
of the clause are quite helpful. I do not see any problem with
providing a model petition scheme to make it easier for local
authorities to decide what they wish to take up, and I do not see any
reason why local authorities should not be provided with guidance, but
I see no reason why any national body should seek to dictate exactly
how any local authority should respond to a petition. For that reason,
I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="09061017000490"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000931"></a>Ms
Winterton:</b> There are two principles here. We want to
ensure that if it is necessary to intervene in particular
circumstances&#151;in extremis&#151;that will happen. I assure the
Committee and particularly the hon. Lady that we do not intend to use
the power unless very particular problems occur. Obviously, all these
issues would be discussed with local authorities before any
intervention.</div><a name="09061017000627"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="09061017000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to amendment 50, it is important that we recognise that
legislation is not always a precise science. Some things are much too
detailed to put in the Bill and it is important that we have secondary
legislation to assist us. So I hope that, in these circumstances, the
hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="09061017000492"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000932"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I am afraid that I will have to disappoint
the Minister. These aspects of the clause seem to assume the worst of
all local authorities and the best of central Government, which is a
very dangerous assumption to make.</div>
<a name="09061017000493"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000933"></a>Mr.
Jackson:</b> We can call this the BAA amendment. Let us
imagine that it was in place in a Bill when we were considering public
consultation and petitions with regard to the third runway. For what
possible reason would the Secretary of State wish to intervene in the
powers and duties of a local authority to tell it how to have a
petition? It seems to me that the provision is insidious and I am
delighted to support the hon. Lady on this
issue.</div><a name="09061017000494"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017000934"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There are
serious questions to be asked about why the Government should seek to
specify how councils respond to petitions, let alone why they should
reserve the right to do so further in the future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017001002"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> Well, another clause, another duty. The
succession of duties in clauses perhaps explains why so far only clause
16 has gone through
unopposed.</div><a name="09061017000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
23 is curious because, if one reads it closely, it does not appear to
have a great deal of confidence in itself. It begins by describing a
number of bodies that are not local authorities at all. Earlier, the
Minister was making a great deal of saying in her responses to points
raised and in her remarks that, after all, the Bill was about local
authorities. Yet here is a clause that is not aimed at local
authorities at all, which rather belies the drift of her earlier
remarks.</div><a name="09061017000590"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause states that an authority may consider it appropriate to involve
interested persons&#151;who, let us note, is anyone who may appear to
the authority to be a representative of interested persons&#151;but
it does not specify on what basis such appearance is to be judged,
which is part of the nonsense that one gets into, I am afraid, when
such clauses are tabled.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div><a name="09061017000591"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)
states that once an authority considers it appropriate to involve
interested persons,</div>
<a name="09061017000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it must take
such steps as it considers
appropriate&#148;.</div><a name="09061017000592"></a><div class="hs_Para">Note
the word &#147;must&#148;. Once again, the essential heaviness of
the duty&#151;its burdensome nature&#151;is revealed in that word.
Then a whole series of bodies is listed. I will not make a great meal
of asking why they are there, because I am sure that that was discussed
in the Lords and that the Minister will tell us. However, what follows
in the Bill seems to demonstrate a certain lack of confidence in the
clause.</div>
<a name="09061017000593"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) states that subsection (1), which is the foundation on which the
whole idea
rests,</div><a name="09061017000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not require an authority to take a
step&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09061017000594"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
other words, to do anything at
all&#151;</div><a name="09061017000616"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
the authority does not have the power to take the step apart from this
section&#148;.</div><a name="09061017000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to indicate that the Minister thinks that the section is not
enough to compel the duty to come into being, which does not seem to
show a great deal of confidence.</div>
<a name="09061017000596"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5), which is a further safety section, makes it clear that the whole
bang
shoot</div><a name="09061017000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;does
not apply in such cases as the Secretary of State may be order made by
statutory instrument
specify.&#148;</div><a name="09061017000597"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is an unsatisfactory clause, so unless the Minister can give a better
account for it than for most clauses that we have considered so far, we
intend to divide the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061017001003"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I shall make some brief remarks on the
clause. I cannot see it doing anything other than contradicting
everything the Minister has said previously. The first clause that we
debated gives the principal local authority a duty to promote an
understanding of the functions and democratic arrangements of an
authority and of how members of the public can take part in those
arrangements. We had a long debate on why regional development agencies
should not be part of the authorities that local authorities were
trying to promote an understanding of. However, clause 23 specifies the
regional development agencies, but under a kind of power that says,
&#147;You can do what you like, really: if you would like to engage
with people, you may do so, but if you do not, then do not worry about
it.&#148; If some regional development agencies are coming forward to
involve people in the exercise of that function, I still do not
understand why they have been excluded from previous clauses. Why have
they been included in this clause when they have been excluded in
previous clauses? That just points to some wider flaws in the Bill. It
seems that the clause is nothing more than legislative filler, so I
will vote against it if I get the
opportunity.</div><a name="09061017000599"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,
