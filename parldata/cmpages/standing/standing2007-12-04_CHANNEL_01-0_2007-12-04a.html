						</b> Before we begin, I have a few housekeeping
announcements to make. If men wish to take off their jackets, they may.
Will everyone please ensure that mobile phones are silenced? I remind
the Committee that there is a Ways and Means resolution in relation to
the Bill, of which copies are available in the Room, and that adequate
notice should be given of amendments, because it is not my general
intention to call starred amendments.</div>
					<a name="07120469000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process of taking oral
evidence in Public Bill Committees is still quite new, so it may help
if I briefly explain what we are going to do. Having said that, it is
as new to me as it probably is to many of you, so please bear with us.
The Committee first considers the programme motion on the amendment
paper. Debate on that, if it is necessary, is limited to half an hour.
We shall then proceed to a motion to report written evidence and
afterward to a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private
in advance of the oral evidence session. I hope that we can take those
latter motions formally. The purpose of the private session is to
consider the brief that we have been given, and to allow questions to
be dealt with.</div>
					<a name="07120469000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming that the second motion
is agreed, the Committee will then move into public session for the
oral evidence. If the Committee completes its questioning of witnesses
in good time, we will move on to clause-by-clause consideration. If we
manage that before 1 pm, we shall have to move to Committee Room 12,
for reasons that I shall not bore you with. We shall adjourn for 15
minutes while that happens. Finally, will speakers please remain seated
when they speak? The reason is that the microphones in this Room do not
work.</div>

legislation with the phrase &#147;for the avoidance of doubt&#148;.
I am not sure whether any other piece of legislation starts in that
way. The problem is that if two pieces of legislation speak to the same
subject, there can be confusion as to what Parliament intended. The
Department for Transport and London and Continental Railways feel that
a potential purchaser of the infrastructure may not be sufficiently
clear about how the Secretary of State&#146;s powers might be used.
It is nothing more than a clarifying clause and does not give any
additional powers to the Secretary of

in most circumstances, a reasonable view of a court would be,
&#147;Fine, you can fund,&#148; but there might be doubt at the

2 is supposed to normalise arrangements and put all access on the same

						</i> It is different from the rest of the rail
network. We look on High Speed 1 as an exception to the rest of the
network. Unlike for the rest of the network, which is essentially a
Victorian legacy, we know exactly what HS1&#146;s cost base is; it is
not an unknown quantity. For the rest of the network, there is a
provision in existing legislation for five-yearly reviews of access
charges. That would not be necessary with HS1 simply because it is a
new asset.</div>

the regulation of the rest of the network goes, the Office of the Rail
Regulator&#146;s primary role is to determine those five-yearly
access charge reviews. That is not something that we want to apply to
HS1, simply because it is a brand new asset. In that respect, we can
justifiably say that it is a separate case. The ORR will retain some
regulatory functions as far as HS1 goes, but the arrangements are
different from those covering the rest of the

are two points that I would like to return to. First, my understanding
of clause 2 was that it was supposed to ensure that arrangements across
the network were as one. That clearly is not what is going to happen.
Secondly, on a five-yearly view, assets will depreciate and move in
value. Is it not appropriate for there to be a review of the cost of an
asset base, even after five years?</div>

						</i> It is my view that there should not be a
review of an asset base over a short period of time like
that&#151;not for a brand-new railway. As I say, the rest of the
railway is a different beast, given its age. We believe that HS1,
because it is a brand-new asset, should be treated completely

						</b> As the Minister will know, there is a great deal
of concern in the industry that the legislation as it stands, and as
changed by this Bill, will still make it exceedingly difficult for new
operators to provide international services. I think that we can say
that the taxpayer has contributed very substantially to the creation of
this asset. Obviously, the Secretary of State wants an environment that
means that the asset can be sold fairly attractively to get a good
return to the Treasury on the money that has been put in, but can I
suggest that the taxpayer at large also wants to see the maximum
opportunity for running new services to continental Europe? Can the
Minister give us some comfort that the changes that he is proposing,
combined with the existing regime, will create an environment in which
it is realistically reasonable for new operators to be able to come in
and provide those services, and that we are going to see the maximum
and optimal use of the asset? That uncertainty remains, despite the
language on the

								Mr.

						</i> I think that those are valid concerns. Let us
look at the picture of open access, first as it relates to the domestic
network. Open access operators&#151;those that are not provided for
through a domestic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>franchise&#151;are provided for in EU regulations, not through this
Bill or our own domestic railway legislation. When we have had
successful applications for open access operators, most recently for
the Wrexham-Marylebone service that has been given the go-ahead by the
ORR, that is provided for on the basis of, first, EU legislation and,
secondly, ORR&#146;s assessment of whether there is enough capacity
on a particular route. In the case of the Wrexham line, it concluded
that there was enough capacity. There are many other main lines on
which there is not an awful lot of spare
capacity.</div>
					<a name="07120469000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
lot of spare capacity on HS1. Some 40 per cent. of the paths on HS1 are
being reserved for domestic services and, as I said, that will be taken
care of by a domestic franchise agreement. Eurostar is not using the
full quota of available paths for international services. I very much
hope that international operators will apply for open access to HS1 at
an early stage. We cannot provide for that because open access is a
matter for Europe&#151;as it should be, given that these are
international services. However, I would be very surprised if
international operators did not take advantage of the fact that HS1 is
there, and that train paths are
available.</div>

						</b> The Minister is saying that market forces will
deal with this, but as I and others have pointed out to him, the way in
which the assets are to be sold would allow for cross-ownership between
the owner of the track and the owner of Eurostar, creating, some might
believe, a disincentive for open access for certain kinds of services
that would be highly competitive in various ways to the Eurostar
service. The body that has always held the ring, if you like, in
disputes of this kind has been the Office of the Rail Regulator, which
has now essentially moved to a position of last resort in terms of
regulating access. I am looking for him to give us some comfort.
Because cross-ownership of both the track and Eurostar is very
likely&#151;SNCF currently has such cross-ownership&#151;I am
extremely concerned that we do not put an institutional arrangement in
place that leaves everybody helpless in the face of that kind of
economic pressure. The answer that market forces will deal with the

that, if we express an expectation under the Bill that the fees charged
are reasonably incurred, that is something that can be challenged in
court and judicially reviewed. It would be quite robust in terms of the

is not paid, so the ORR issues a third notice, adding the

we hope it will be and in order for it to achieve its value.</div>
					<a name="07120469000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 attempts to clear up

<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>As we have heard from the Minister, that is deemed necessary for the

					<a name="07120469000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was

sections 31 to 33 of the 1996 Act prevents the powers of the Secretary

						</b> I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr.

treading in new territory at the moment, and I am not sure when there
would have been an earlier opportunity.</div>
					<a name="07120469000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Wimbledon
always tries to be helpful. I can tell when he is doing so because he
says that he is trying to be helpful. However, as in this particular
case, it never quite works out that way. I understand the sentiment
behind the amendment, and I sympathise with his intentions and the
commercial principle that he promotes. It would be wrong for the UK
taxpayer to subsidise services across the continent. Members of the
Committee might take comfort in the fact that the Secretary of State
would not have the power to do so, even if she wanted to. The power to
support services under the 2005 Act extends to Great Britain
only&#151;not to France, Belgium, or anywhere else where a commercial
operator might wish to run services.</div>
					<a name="07120469000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Eurostar is a joint venture.
Its present structure is supported by a set of cost and revenue-sharing
protocols among the three partner companies in the UK, France and
Belgium. Under those agreements, Eurostar UK Ltd&#151;the UK partner
owned by London and Continental Railways&#151;pays only the access
charges on the UK side, and half of the charges for the tunnel itself.
Any restructuring of the joint venture would also have to be on terms
that protected taxpayers&#146; interests.</div>
					<a name="07120469000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would rule out
leaving in place some of the historical support that the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>have already agreed to provide to Eurostar UK Ltd, such as the access
charge loan and the guarantees of its rolling stock places. An
objective for next year&#146;s restructuring is to make Eurostar and
all LCR&#146;s businesses independent, self-standing and financially
sustainable. The Government and LCR should be in a position in which a
full range of options is available to meet that objective so that
decisions taken best protect the taxpayers&#146;
interests.</div>
					<a name="07120469000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is right in that the Government&#146;s intention behind the

not international services. I said on Second

					<a name="07120469000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It

on two things that he said in his explanation? First, he said that
there is no power in the 2005 Act for the Secretary of State to
subsidise services across the continent. I understand that point.
However, in extremis, does not the Bill allow the possibility of part
of the service that Eurostar is running in the UK being open to revenue
funding? Is that really what the Government intend to
do?</div>
					<a name="07120469000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I fail
to understand how my amendment could possibly have an impact on the
guarantees that were previously given on access and rolling stock. Will
the Minister clarify why he thinks that it would in any way affect
those?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000358"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second point, I
think that it is quite feasible that if we were to amend the Bill in
the way in which he suggests so that it said that international
services were precluded from any such public subsidy of any shape or
form, any existing financial agreements, such as rolling stock leases,
could clearly be challengeable in court.</div>
					<a name="07120469000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the first point&#151;will
the hon. Gentleman remind me what his first point
was?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000359"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> My first point was that the Minister rightly
stated&#151;we all understand this&#151;that the intention was to
provide financial assistance for revenue operations, potentially
regarding the domestic service only. He said that there was nothing in
the 2005 Act that would allow the Secretary of State to subsidise
services operating on the continent. However, I am saying that if the
Bill is not amended, there might be a position in which it will be
possible for her to subsidise the UK portion of Eurostar&#146;s
operations. Is that really what the Government intend to
do?</div>
					<a name="07120469000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000360"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I am grateful for that
clarification.</div>
					<a name="07120469000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, if, in the short term, any extra subsidy were to be provided
to Eurostar Ltd, such as through the leasing stock agreements, the hon.
Gentleman is right. That could be interpreted as being a short-term
subsidy from the Government. However, as I have said repeatedly, it is
not the intention of the Government publicly to provide any subsidy to
Eurostar in the long term. However, there will be an interim period 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>following the restructuring of LCR in which there will be a necessity
for perceived public funds to be available to Eurostar, but it will be
only a short period. Certainly, in the long term, we do not expect
Eurostar to be publicly funded; we expect it to be a viable commercial
operation that stands on its own two feet. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment would preclude us from offering even short-term support in
whatever form, such as through subsidy or leasing stock
agreements.</div>
					<a name="07120469000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000361"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I have listened carefully to what the Minister
has said. If he had wanted such a provision, as we have seen from other
pieces of legislation that we have examined, he could have done so
though the use of an interim period clause. I accept that the
Government intend to concentrate revenue funding on domestic services.
However, I shall examine carefully why the Minister thinks that the
measure has an impact on matters such as the leasing arrangements for
Eurostar because it seems to tackle the operation of domestic services.
We might revisit that on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07120469000364"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> We have already had the benefit of a number of
written submissions from the Minister and his officials, together with
public evidence today. The 1996 Act gave certain powers and priorities
to the Secretary of State and London and Continental Railways to
facilitate the construction of High Speed 1. Obviously, the
construction is finished, so some of those rights and obligations are
no longer required. Clauses 2 and 3 seek to clarify what is still
required and what should be repealed. My concern is about not what is
being repealed, but what is not being repealed.</div>
					<a name="07120469000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2 relates to access
contracts. Previously, all the CTRL access contracts, with the
exception of those intersecting with other parts of the network, were
immune from the normal procedure set out in the Railways Act 1993. In
other words, they were immune from direction by and approval from the
ORR. Clause 2 removes the specific provisions relating to access
contracts in places where the new line interconnects with the national
rail network and will therefore ensure that in future no access
contract relating to High Speed 1 will be subject to direction by the
ORR. I understand that despite there being no need for ORR approval, it
is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>intended that all High Speed 1 access contracts will be subject to some
form of regulation. That regulation would appear to be under the direct
oversight of the Secretary of State, who will supervise the access
negotiations.</div>
					<a name="07120469000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment probes why there should be different regulation for High
Speed 1 and why that needs to be different from that for other parts of
the rail network now that the construction phase is finished. I was
interested to read the written response that the Minister provided to a
question asked on Second Reading, in which he said that the key
difference is that the domestic network is subject to economic
regulation, whereas high speed rail is not. I understand that, but I
seek further
clarification.</div>
					<a name="07120469000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
role of the regulator in relation to access contracts is not merely to
set the economic regulation of the access charge&#151;it goes well
beyond that. The ORR decides where access needs to be granted to
improve train operations and infrastructure. I believe that the access
arrangements for High Speed 1 would benefit from such independent
oversight by ORR, so amendment No. 2 would make the High Speed 1 access
arrangements consistent with those for the rest of the
network.</div>
					<a name="07120469000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">If,
as I propose, the whole of section 17 of the 1996 Act were repealed,
the rules governing High Speed 1 access contracts would be in line with
those for all other such contracts. I believe that that is the
Government&#146;s stated intention&#151;the Minister has confirmed
that in writing. It seems to me that, by switching power and scrutiny,
the amendment would achieve that ambition. If the Bill were to remain
in its current form, I am unconvinced that it would be unambiguous as
to whether two sets of approval were required. If that were the case,
far from being subject to the consistent regime to which the Minister
has referred, High Speed 1 would be subject to a different
regime.</div>
					<a name="07120469000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The form of
amendment No. 3 is similar to that of amendment No. 2, in that it would
repeal a provision in existing legislation. Section 21 of the 1996 Act
deals with the overriding duties of the Office of the Rail Regulator.
This is a similar point to one that we have discussed in relation to
the Crossrail Bill, as much of what is in that existing legislation is
taken as a direct precedent for the
Bill.</div>
				
					<a name="07120469000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07120469000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 3 would
repeal the bulk of section 21, but crucially it would leave subsection
(1), which
reads:</div>
					<a name="07120469000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Rail Regulator shall have an overriding duty to exercise his regulatory
functions in such a manner as not to impede the performance of any
development
agreement.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07120469000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 5
redefines the development agreement to include the operation and not
just the construction of the rail rink. Taken together, it seems that
those clauses mean that in future the ORR will have to carry out its
duties in such a way as to give absolute priority to High Speed 1
services over any other services or any other part of the network. The
implication, therefore, is that a much higher test is being applied
when the ORR is combined with the term
&#147;overriding&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07120469000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand why the ORR should
have that overriding duty during the construction phase, but not once
the operational phase is reached. I want to draw 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>the analogy and test the Minister because in our parallel discussions
about Crossrail we were talking about interim phases that would be
extended only until services are fully operational. The Bill appears,
however, to extend those powers well beyond that moment of being fully
operational. In other words, if we apply the same rationale, the
effects of clauses 3 and 5 would represent a serious
inconsistency.</div>
					<a name="07120469000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of section 21 of the 1996 Act, like clause 23 of the Crossrail
Bill, was to give the ORR power to give CTRL priority treatment during
its construction phase in order to facilitate the project. Clause 3,
when taken together with clause 5, extends that obligation well beyond
the construction phase. I seek the Minister&#146;s assurance that
that is absolutely necessary, because it seems incongruous with the
original motivation for granting such powers. The amendment would
repeal the whole of section 21 of the 1996 Act, as it contains
provisions that should apply only to the construction phase of CTRL, a
phase that we all know is complete. I am looking for the Minister to
reassure me as to why such wide-ranging powers are now needed during
the operational phase.</div>
					<a name="07120469000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000365"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The amendments would make all HS1 access contracts
subject to prior ORR approval under the 1993 Act. Since the Secretary
of State already has oversight of such access contracts under the
development agreement, that creates potential for dual regulation,
which is what clause 2 was intended to remove. However, that is more of
a drafting complaint; there are deeper and more principled reasons for
objecting to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07120469000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 3 would remove the ORR&#146;s duty from the 1996 Act not to
impede the development agreement when carrying out its functions under
the 1993 Act. That duty has been in place since 1996 and it remains as
relevant today, during the operational phase of HS1, as it did during
the construction phase. If it were removed, it could have an adverse
effect on the value to be secured for the taxpayer on a sale of HS1.
Potential investors might well be concerned that the ORR&#146;s
regulation of the national network could have unintended consequences
for HS1&#146;s revenues if the duty were
removed.</div>
					<a name="07120469000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view in 1996 was that operation of the new railway
would not have to be subjected to economic regulation under the 1993
Act. That is also the view of the current Government. It is not our
policy to subject this or any other business to regulation beyond what
is necessary to protect the wider public interest. Safety, for example,
on HS1, as I said in an earlier sitting, will be regulated in a similar
way to safety on the national network. However, access charges will
not. I hope that, with the benefit of those clarifications, the hon.
Member for Wimbledon will be persuaded not to pursue the
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000366"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> In providing his explanation, the Minister used
the phrase &#147;public interest&#148;. Can he explain why
oversight by the ORR would not be in the public interest in terms of
maximally benefiting the taxpayer by providing a more optimal service
regime?</div>
					<a name="07120469000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000367"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> It is surely in the taxpayer&#146;s interest to
obtain the highest value for the sale of HS1. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Wimbledon could prejudice or
undermine that case if potential investors were worried that the ORR
might give precedence to other domestic services rather than services
running on
HS1.</div>
					<a name="07120469000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000368"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I thank the Minister for being extremely generous
about interventions, but in saying that what the taxpayer wants is the
maximum from the sale of HS1, how is he balancing that with the fact
that the original motivation of the taxpayer to invest in this huge
asset from the beginning was to improve overall transport and rail
services for people living in the UK? Those two elements can of course
come into conflict. Perhaps he can explain how he has balanced them in
deciding to give priority to a one-time cash return over, as it were,
an almost infinite maximal service
operation.</div>
					<a name="07120469000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07120469000369"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The hon. Lady makes my point for me. She raised
two issues. One is the interest of the taxpayer, which I have already
covered. The second is the wider interest of the taxpayer in the
viability of HS1 as a going concern. My concern is to ensure that the
ORR continues to treat HS1 as a priority when making any decisions, or
that access contracts are made on that basis&#151;that nothing should
be done to impede the working of HS1. As a side issue, that will
generate more money for the Exchequer when it comes to selling, but the
main issue is that services on HS1, which of course we are all in
favour of seeing as a success, will be protected by the clause in its
unamended form.</div>
					<a name="07120469000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
the whole point of building HS1 was to provide fast and reliable
services from London to the continent. The addition of domestic
services was introduced by the present Government, but the initial
intention of HS1 was to link Britain to the continent with a high-speed
line. Surely that is in the interest of the taxpayer and of the fare
payer. I am not sure how agreeing to the amendment and making ambiguous
the role of the ORR or the effect on HS1 of decisions that the ORR
might make could benefit either taxpayer or fare payer. I hope that,
with those points in mind, the hon. Member for Wimbledon will see fit
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07120469000370"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I have listened carefully to the
Minister&#146;s explanation and his response to the interventions,
but I still fail to grasp why the ORR should not be required to look at
HS1 in the same way as it looks at the rest of the network. There seems
to be no definition regarding the length of special measures. My
understanding was that the Government wanted to put the relationships
on the same footing, but the clauses do not do that at the
moment.</div>

						</b> I am attempting to be helpful to the hon.
Gentleman; it was the intention of a previous, Conservative, Secretary
of State for Transport that this clause would be maintained during the
operational phase of HS1. It was always part of the original vision for
HS1 that priority would be given to services on HS1. If the hon.
Gentleman wishes to make any criticism of that, I shall be interested
to hear it.</div>

allows the ORR to charge those operating CTRL a fee by reference to the

the heart of the matter and clear up the
problem.</div>

clear in the Bill. The amendment would bring the CTRL arrangements in

the licence fee paid by the operator on other parts of the

					<a name="07120469000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment

from other operators in respect of the access contracts that we have
discussed, but only slightly. That does not mean that the basis of
calculation that is being used for the setting of the level of the fee
should be different from that of the rest of the network. I look to the

add to what I said in our evidence session. However, I shall give it a
try. I am grateful to him for outlining the intention behind the
amendment. It is not our policy to subject this or any other business
to regulation beyond what is necessary. With that in mind, we are clear
that the regulatory costs borne by the owner of HS1 should be limited
to what is absolutely necessary. That is why subsection (2) makes it
clear that the costs should be reasonably incurred when passed on to
the owner of HS1.</div>

However, a part of those functions in regard to CTRL is similar to the

regulatory functions because if it is acceptable to use that basis for
part of the regulatory function of the network, why cannot it be
reasonable to use the same basis for
CTRL?</div>

be  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>possible to tighten up the wording of this clause. If, as appears to be
the case, the Minister is not willing to accept my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendment, I hope that he will reflect on the matter to see whether he
can improve the clause in the later stages of this Bill. The Minister
is right to say that the word &#147;reasonably&#148; is in the
clause, but it is a subjective test, as I mentioned in a question
earlier. It is not what a reasonable man would consider to be
reasonable. It is what the Office of Rail Regulation considers to be
reasonable. I can foresee circumstances in which someone who is
managing a sloppy administration and running up unnecessary expense
incurs charges which are, in their view, not unreasonable. The test
should be objective. I have real concerns about the wording of

							<a name="07120469000400"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I want to have a small debate on the clause
because, as I mentioned when I spoke to my amendment to clause 3, I
have concerns about the wide-ranging impact of clause 5. I am grateful
to the Minister and his officials who, during the suspension, clarified
one of the points that I raised during the evidence-taking session
about the rail link and rail services on it. I now accept that the
clause deals with the rail link, rather than with the
services.</div>
					<a name="07120469000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, I wonder if the Minister could provide us with a few more
examples and explanations. Adding the words &#147;or
operation&#148; to the development agreement will have a significant
impact on every clause in the Act that relates to development
agreements. Rights and obligations provided for in those clauses will
be extended, so that they will apply not only during the construction
phase but once the rail link is operational. I voiced my concerns about
the possible implications of that change during our discussion on
clause 3.</div>
					<a name="07120469000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to ask the Minister whether there are any other provisions in the
1996 Act which relate to development agreements, and which this measure
would retrospectively change. Can he be clear what the impact of those
changes might be? It is a wide-ranging change, and I wonder whether the
measures in the clause might not have been obtained more prudently by
making some specific, rather than general, provisions. The development
agreement was supposed to deal with the construction phase, which is
now complete. We are now into the operation phase. The clause could
potentially be used extremely widely, and I wonder whether the Minister
could give some reassurances about the intentions of its operation,
perhaps give some examples, and indeed tell us where it will
potentially impact on other provisions in the 1996 Act.

							<a name="07120469000401"></a>Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Further to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s explanation
of an earlier discussion during the evidence session, I gave an
undertaking to report to the whole Committee and to clarify the issue
raised by the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire and the hon. Member
for Wimbledon on the development agreement. For the record, the 1996
Act defines a development agreement
as</div>
					<a name="07120469000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
agreement...in relation to the design, construction...or
maintenance of the rail
link&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07120469000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">which is defined
as the HS1 infrastructure. It does not cover train services. In that
respect, the 2005 Act is irrelevant. I hope that that clarifies the
matter for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>Committee. I apologise that due to unusual circumstances, I have not
been able to put it in writing for every Committee
member.</div>
					<a name="07120469000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall try to address the points made by the hon. Member for Wimbledon.
He can seek further clarification if I fail to do so. The clause will
amend the definition of a development agreement in section 56 of the
Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996. London and Continental Railways
designed and constructed HS1 in accordance with the terms of the
development agreement that it signed with the Secretary of State in
February 1996. The development agreement contains the terms of the
concession to operate the railway and will continue post-construction.
To reflect more clearly the fact that the 1996 Act provisions referring
to the development agreement apply where relevant to agreements
relating to operations, the clause will amend the definition of a
development agreement to include the word
&#147;operation&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07120469000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is proposed to amend the
current development agreement as part of restructuring so that it
focuses on the railway&#146;s operation. If the definition of a
development agreement in the 1996 Act were not amended, it would be
more uncertain whether the revised agreement fell within the
definition. The effect of a court finding that the revised development
agreement did not fall within the definition could be serious. Under
the 2005 regulations, the Secretary of State is required to set a
charging framework for access charges to HS1 through the development
agreement as defined in the 1996 Act. If there is found to be no
development agreement as defined, there will also be no effective
charging framework, giving train operators greater scope to challenge
access charges levied by the HS1 operator. I hope that that clarifies
the
matter.</div>

							<a name="07120469000402"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I think that the Minister is encouraging me to
say, &#147;Definitely.&#148; I think that he has clarified the
point, but after reading the <i class="I">Hansard </i>report, I may come back to
him. I think that he is saying that we need to amend the development
agreement so that the charging regime can stay in place through the
operational phase. If that is the short summary of what he said, it
clarifies the point, and I am grateful to him.</div>

							<a name="07120469000403"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> In the interest of fairness, and in the same
spirit displayed earlier by the Minister, I thought it right and proper
that I should rise to catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson. The
Minister was criticised by the Opposition for the loose drafting of
clause 4, and he said very fairly that he would be willing to consider
it on Report. In the interest of balance, I therefore rise to praise
him for the drafting of clause 6, which for once  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>shows positive action. It gives a firm and definite implementation date,
not one to be determined on some unspecified day. The Act will come
into force two months from the day on which the Bill is passed. Well
done, I
say.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I hope that I have my timing right,
Mr. Atkinson. During debate on the Crossrail Bill, I tried
three times unsuccessfully to offer a vote of thanks to you as the
Chair. It has been a short but delightful experience to serve under
your chairmanship. The Bill may go down in history as having undergone
one of the shortest periods of Committee scrutiny. It is probably
equivalent in length to some delegated legislation Committees on which
I have served. That is certainly due at least in part to you,
Mr. Atkinson.</div>
					<a name="07120469000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
your Clerk, of whom I had experience when I was a member of the Select
Committee on Science and Technology. He is a fine chap, and I am sure
that he has done an excellent job for you. I also thank the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>reporters, the Doorkeepers, the police officers, my own officials,
who have done an outstanding job, and my private secretary, Sandra St.
Louis. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Wimbledon and the hon.
Member for Richmond Park for adopting a very healthy bipartisan and
constructive approach. Finally, as I forgot to do so last week, I must
thank members of my own party on the Committee. I am grateful to them
all for their sterling and reliable support during this very brief
sitting.</div>

this short Public Bill Committee, Mr. Atkinson. It has been
shortened by the Minister&#146;s help to the Opposition in the form
of a briefing, and by his answers to a number of our questions, and we
are grateful for that. I echo the Minister&#146;s thanks to the
Clerk, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, my researcher, who helped me
tremendously with the construction of our amendments, and indeed to my
hon. Friends for their support.</div>

in something that was quite new to us  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>today. The reason why we had to move from the Boothroyd Room to here was
the simple one that, if there are officials or witnesses to
interrogate, they need a microphone and a place to sit. At the moment,
only one Public Bill Committee Room has been kitted out in that way,
and that Room had been bagged by another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>Bill this morning. Despite that disturbance, we have had a very easy and
well-mannered Committee, and I thank everyone for that.</div>
