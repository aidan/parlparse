<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000374"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I shall speak to amendments Nos. 40, 39, 166,
41, 42, 43, 165, 417 and new clause 1. The issue of directors&#146;
duties is the area of the Bill that has courted the most controversy.
It is also the issue that, rightly or wrongly, has political as much as
financial or administrative implications. I do not believe that the
Government really wanted that, but gradually over the last few years,
they have dug themselves into a hole on these provisions and they are
now finding it difficult to extricate themselves.</div>
<a name="06071163000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another place during the
later stages of consideration of the Bill, Lords Hodgson and Freeman
introduced amendments that would have removed the six considerations to
which a director must have regard under the clause and returned the
position towards the existing common law. The Government rejected that
outright, so we have had to make a basic choice here. Do I just stand
here today and say the same things as we said in the Lords and get
another negative answer, or do I attempt a more constructive approach
as to how the provisions could be improved? I shall take the latter
route, although the issues are not straightforward and we reserve our
position on this, depending on the Government&#146;s
approach.</div> <a name="06071163000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
mainly probing amendments therefore initiate debate on how to improve
the drafting to take account of the still widespread concerns
throughout the legal and business communities, which can be seen on the
pages of most of the financial press, including <i class="I">The Economist
</i>and<i class="I"> </i>the<i class="I"> Financial Times, </i>which have both attacked the
clause.</div> <a name="06071163000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have six
primary concerns with this part of the Bill. The first involves the
technical problems arising from the codification of the existing common
law duties in statute. The second is over the seemingly random choice
of factors and duties that a director must consider; these new duties
could cloud the directors&#146; paramount duty to look after the
best 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 545</div>interests of the company. The third is over the confusing new language
that the Government have introduced and how it will be
interpreted.</div> <a name="06071163000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
fourth concern is that the clause has been inserted as an offering to
various, albeit often worthy, different agendas when those issues could
be more effectively advanced by means other than distorting what is
essentially a legislative framework built for companies. There is also
the fear that over-regulation will make this country less able to
compete in the global marketplace. Finally, we think it would be a
great pity if this country went down the route of over-regulation that
has been taken in recent times in the United States with
Sarbanes-Oxley, which results in companies being driven overseas. That
is a real fear.</div><a name="06071163000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal first with codification of the common law. Part 10 of the
Bill aims to codify existing common law principles relating to
the responsibilities of directors. That has led to vociferous and
growing complaints from across the legal and business communities that
this could cause company law to be dramatically altered for the worst.
Historically, judges have had the discretion to deal with complicated
issues relating to directors&#146; duties case by case. That system
has been adaptable and effective in dealing with cases that are often
complicated and highly
technical.</div><a name="06071163000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing duties found in common law rules and equitable principles,
which have been built up in the courts over the years, are to be
replaced by the statutory statement in part 10. A flexible system is to
be replaced with an inflexible
one.</div><a name="06071163000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my noble
Friend Lord Freeman pointed out in the Lords, there is an inherent
danger in cross-referring to case law but not defining it&#151;a
situation he aptly described as a minefield. On the one hand, the
Government have said that there will be no change in the common law
position, but, on the other, they have introduced the concept of
enlightened shareholder value, which all experts seem to agree will
alter the common law position on directors acting in the best interests
of their company. That is no better illustrated than by a letter sent
to me by the Minister herself on 9 June, in which she
wrote:</div><a name="06071163000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We had
two main intentions in introducing a statutory statement of
directors&#146; duties.</div>
<a name="06071163000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">First, it will provide much
greater clarity on what is expected of directors and make the law more
accessible. The duties are at the moment found in case law&#151;that
is, decisions in individual court cases over the years&#151;rather
than in the Companies Act. Many directors are understandably unaware
of, or unclear about, what their duties are, and we want to address
this both through the Bill and through non-statutory
guidance.</div><a name="06071163000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">Secondly, it
enshrines in statute a concept called &#145;Enlightened Shareholder
Value&#146;. This recognises that directors will be more likely to
achieve long-term sustainable success for the benefit of their
shareholders if their companies behave responsibly. Directors will
therefore be required to promote the success of the company in the
collective best interests of shareholders, but must in doing so have
regard to wider factors such as the interests of employees and the
environment.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a fundamental gap in the Government&#146;s train of thought:
either they are introducing a new concept called enlightened
shareholder value, an extension of the common law, or they are simply
codifying existing common law. I hope that the Minister makes clear
which course they are taking.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 546</div><a name="06071163000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">From our consultations on the
Bill with many interested parties, the position seems clear. If the
audience is business oriented, the Government&#146;s message is,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, nothing is going to change. This is only a
restatement of the common law position.&#148; If the audience is a
campaigning body, the tactics change and the emphasis is on explaining
how the concept of enlightened shareholder value will change
things.</div><a name="06071163000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000375"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire
(Lembit &#214;pik) cannot come within the curtilage of the Committee.
Would he care to leave? <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am sorry, but he
really cannot come into the curtilage of the Committee during its
consideration of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071163000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000376"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We may examine what the Government&#146;s
supporters believe they are doing. I refer to the TUC briefing of 6
June, which
says:</div><a name="06071163000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The TUC
supports codification of directors&#146; duties, and considers that
putting them into statute is the best way of ensuring clarity on what
is expected of directors and giving the duties prominence in the eyes
of directors and
stakeholders.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on
to say:</div><a name="06071163000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Making
an explicit link between the success of the company and the interests
of employees and the other matters for consideration listed in clause
158, and making it clear that directors should have regard to these
matters, is a significant step that the TUC welcomes. Backed up by
clear and comprehensive guidance and reporting requirements, the TUC
hopes that clause 158 will contribute to raising standards of
corporate behaviour.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition have no problem with, and indeed support, many of the good
intentions voiced by the Government whenever they talk about
enlightened shareholder value. However, in the context of sound law,
such intentions can easily slip into meaningless platitudes. That is
reflected in the Association of British Insurers paper of 14 June 2006,
which
states:</div><a name="06071163000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
clauses propose that the general duties owed by directors to their
company will be set out in statute reflecting the &#145;enlightened
shareholder value&#146; approach, which recognises that boards need
to take account of the impact on the company of non-financial social,
environmental and ethical
issues.</div><a name="06071163000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">The ABI
supports the &#145;enlightened shareholder value&#146; approach. We
have nevertheless had concerns that codification might lead to a
compliance-driven approach to the exercise of directors&#146; duties
rather than one based on the making of good-faith judgments. This could
lead directors to take expensive and time-consuming legal advice,
impair efficient decision-making and add an unnecessary layer of
bureaucracy to board practices. Codification of directors&#146;
duties would not then achieve its goal of greater transparency and
accountability, but instead create new uncertainties and larger
administrative burden. The ABI welcomes the efforts made by the
Government at the time of the House of Lords deliberations to amend the
Bill to lessen these risks. However, we consider this remains an area
where further Parliamentary scrutiny is
necessary.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society&#146;s June briefing
says:</div><a name="06071163000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Law
Society doubts that the savings for business which the Government
anticipates will be achieved. On the contrary, the new provisions on
directors&#146; duties will result in new uncertainty, increased
legal costs and additional
bureaucracy.</div><a name="06071163000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
particular, the Law Society believes that the new code is
inflexible&#151;at present, the courts have considerable freedom to
develop the law on directors&#146; duties to suit changing needs and
expectations and in practice the code will not be more accessible than
common law rules, as its meaning will over time become less and less
clear to a reader who does not also understand how it has been
interpreted and applied by the courts.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 547</div><a name="06071163000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, although the Government
protest that they are not changing the common law position, they are in
fact doing just that. That will lead only to confusion where there
should be clarity. Also, and in some ways even less helpfully, the
clause could impede the development of common
law.</div><a name="06071163000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The six factors
in clause 158(1)(a) to (f), to which the director must have regard,
seem arbitrary. It has been calculated that directors have had some 650
duties laid down through the common law and various statutes over the
years. Why have those six been deemed more important than the other
640-odd? We recognise that putting those duties in one format will give
clarity to company directors. That is why we supported the Law Society
proposal to publish a non-statutory guide to directors&#146; duties.
The Government have said that they intend also to give non-statutory
guidance to directors, but have not yet done
so.</div><a name="06071163000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We support fully
an official guide to the roles and responsibilities of directors, and
have tabled amendment No. 417 to have that requirement set out in the
Bill. The duties, roles and responsibilities that directors of UK
companies face are great and myriad. The Institute of Directors
published a helpful guide to directors&#146; duties, responsibilities
and liabilities called &#147;The Director&#146;s Handbook&#148;.
It was endorsed warmly by none other than the ex-Secretary of State,
who now has responsibility for the Department for Education and Skills
and who called it
a</div><a name="06071163000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;valuable and reliable
source of information and
guidance.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do the
Government consider it adequate for an area of business law that can
fill an entire book to be set out in six lines of
statute?</div><a name="06071163000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
contains heavily edited common law duties. I believe that we should
give some consideration to those roles, duties, responsibilities and
liabilities that the Government do not consider important enough to be
enshrined in statute. Why have they not been included in the clause?
For example, here are a small number of common law directors&#146;
duties that the Government have not included in that list&#151;the
Minister might like to explain why she does not consider each duty
worthy of codification in statute: duty to act for proper purposes;
duty to prepare true and fair accounts; duty not to make secret
profits; duty not to act ultra vires; duty to supervise the discharge
of delegated functions; duty to pass on relevant information; duty of
mutual trust and confidence; duty to ensure that undertakings are
complied with; and duty not to profit from their position without
approval.</div><a name="06071163000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000377"></a><b class="B">David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000378"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> They are but, as the hon. Gentleman will
remember, we had problems with how those were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 548</div>set down. Furthermore, the statute differs from the common law position.
By the way, that is relevant to a further clause that we will come on
to in part 10.</div><a name="06071163000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
continue the list, duty to declare an interest in contracts; duty to
account to company for property under control; duty to attend board
meetings&#151;directors have a general duty to attend board meetings,
but do not need to attend every one; duty to account for profits while
taking advantage of his position as director; duty to exercise
reasonable care and skill while carrying out his duties; duty not to
oppress minority shareholders; and duty not to abuse powers, including
powers to issue shares for not the right
purpose.</div><a name="06071163000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have set
out a few of the extra duties, but there are hundreds more. For
example, there are a number of insolvency-related duties that the
Government have chosen to exclude from the provisions, as well as the
duty to consider the interests of creditors above those of members, to
take steps to avoid loss to creditors, and not to enter into
transactions at an undervalue or make
preferences.</div><a name="06071163000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div> <a name="06071163000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The factors to
which directors must have regard relate to many responsibilities to
which directors must already have regard, such as environmental
concerns, as set out in statute. In some cases, the Government are
weakening directors&#146; existing statutory duties. That is
particularly the case with the introduction of clause 158(1)(b), which
states that they should have regard
to</div><a name="06071163000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the interests of the
company&#146;s
employees&#148;,</div><a name="06071163000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the
removal of the section 309 in the Companies Act 1985. That waters down
the provisions in the 1985 Act which deal with employees and it could
be detrimental to the interests of employees. That is why the first
amendment we tabled was new clause 1, which aimed to reintroduce the
existing employee protection language. Although the Government have
taken some of the more fashionable responsibilities already imposed on
directors by statute or common law, they have curiously chosen to
ignore others.</div> <a name="06071163000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why,
for example, have the Government chosen to ignore the health and safety
duties to which a director must have regard? Why are they not included?
I am not saying that they or any others should be, but I am asking why,
using the Government&#146;s rationale, they are not listed in the
clause. The possibility of corporate manslaughter is a hugely serious
and important issue of which all directors should be
aware.</div>
<a name="06071163000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000379"></a><b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting
that the clause as drafted abolishes other statutes and wipes out
centuries of common law?</div>
<a name="06071163000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000380"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am saying that clause 158 abolishes some
statutes that place duties on directors&#151;for instance,
employees&#146; rights&#151;and, in other cases, wipes out or
amends the common law position. However, more importantly, it raises
certain common law rights above others by placing them in the Bill. If
the Government are saying that one common law right is not more
important than another common law right, why are they only choosing
six? That is the core of my argument.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 549</div><a name="06071163000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government consider
health and safety to be important, will the Minister explain how a
director new to his job is meant to know from the Bill as drafted that
he should be aware of the importance of health and safety while making
a decision? He could reasonably presume that as environmental issues
have been included, the Government have incorporated all the statutory
duties necessary. That is more confusing than enlightening.</div>
<a name="06071163000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Competition law is another
thing that the Government have chosen to ignore. Directors can be held
personally liable for breaches of EC and UK competition law. A director
who is found guilty of participating in a so-called cartel offence can
be disqualified from acting as a director for up to 15 years. A
director who is found guilty of dishonestly agreeing to take part in
hardcore anti-competitive activities in the UK can face imprisonment,
but the Government have come to the conclusion that a breach of
competition law is not worth mentioning above the impact of the
company&#146;s operations on the community.
</div><a name="06071163000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government will
no doubt say that those glaring gaps in the Bill as drafted are covered
by the law as it exists and, possibly, that the duties could be
addressed by non-statutory guidance.</div>
<a name="06071163000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000381"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
have listened to the hon. Gentleman for some time as he takes us on a
complete journey through various duties which, as my hon. Friend said,
are perfectly adequately expressed either in the Bill or in other
legislation. Will the hon. Gentleman come to the point? Do the
Conservatives support a concept of enlightened shareholder value? If
so, what is wrong with having the need to have regard to those
factors&#151;whether it is the community, employees or
environment&#151;set out in clause 158(1)(a) to (f), in pursuit of
the interests of the
business?</div><a name="06071163000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
hon. Gentleman get to the kernel of the argument? Does his party
support us having a wider view of business interests, or does that
apply only to his leader? Does the hon. Gentleman have the narrow,
traditional view of business interests which was articulated before the
clause appeared in any legislation?</div>
<a name="06071163000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000382"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister goes into my party&#146;s wider
beliefs on corporate social responsibility. I shall come on to that.
The kernel of my point is that the six common law responsibilities set
out in the Bill are a statement of fashion rather than
law.</div>
<a name="06071163000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000383"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06071163000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000384"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No, if I can just finish my point. I am making
the case that out of the hundreds of items that the Government could
have chosen, they have decided to include only six items to which
directors must have regard. They maintain that that somehow clarifies
the position, but I maintain that they are doing the exact
opposite.</div><a name="06071163000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000385"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to continue after
this comment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column549" />Column number: 550</div><a name="06071163000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000386"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): Very decent of the
Minister.</div><a name="06071163000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000387"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am trying to get the hon. Member for Huntingdon
(Mr. Djanogly) to the point rather than wasting our time. He is saying
that it is a matter of fashion and nothing else that we should ask
companies to have regard to the interests of the community and the
environment as they promote the success of their company in good
faith.</div>
<a name="06071163000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000388"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> What I am saying to the right hon. Lady is that
she must justify the clause to the Committee, businesses and the
mainstream media, which described the clause as containing
&#147;platitudes&#148;. She must explain why she has chosen those
six duties as opposed to some of the hundreds of others. We think that
it will lead to even more confusion.</div>
<a name="06071163000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are the duties and
responsibilities outlined in the non-statutory guide less important
than those in statute? If they are equally important, as the examples
that I quoted show, why have they not been included? We are not arguing
that all directors&#146; common law duties should be put into
statute. That would be nonsensical, particularly as common law duties
are being advanced all the time. However, our probing amendments Nos.
39 and 41 would oblige company directors to consider all other common
law directors&#146; duties. A non-statutory guide, as provided for in
amendment No. 417, could then give directors guidance on those duties
without it being enshrined in statute. Clearly, the Government have
considered that, as they chopped up and inserted bits into the clause
at earlier stages.</div>
<a name="06071163000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister might believe that
the words &#147;amongst other matters&#148; in subsection (1) cover
that concern. However, we do not accept that that is adequate, which is
why we wish to assert our point in greater detail. At the moment,
however, the Government&#146;s choice of listed duties in the clause
puts fashion over the need for good law. That is a poor basis on which
to make law. For instance, what happens when fashion
changes?</div><a name="06071163000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000389"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
clause is that it is a change, and I think that we should debate it on
the basis that it is a new law. However, I do not think that his other
point about the other clause is well made. In the case of Benfield
Greig, the judges described the Law Commission&#146;s draft of the
duties as amply supported by authority. His other point seems to be
based on breaking down the duties into more and more sub-duties, but it
seems to me that they are all at least plausibly covered by the Bill,
apart from in clause
158.</div><a name="06071163000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000390"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> There is an argument about whether the clauses
are adequate. However, I am making the wider point that the clause does
not adequately cover the existing legal
position.</div><a name="06071163000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In May 2006,
a <i class="I">Financial Times </i>lead article entitled &#147;A Missed
Opportunity&#148;
said:</div><a name="06071163000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
stated aim was to make directors&#146; duties clearer and more
up-to-date. The reality is a confused list that mixes platitudes with
necessary duties...the government&#146;s approach betrays an
underlying mistrust of business.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column550" />Column number: 551</div><a name="06071163000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That problem has prompted serious concerns
from the legal profession. A host of major corporate law firms that
will have the job of interpreting the clause told us that the rigid
list in clause 158(1)(a) to (f) might artificially constrain the
decision-making process and provide inappropriate challenges to the way
in which directors exercise their
discretion.</div><a name="06071163000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, on
9 May, an article in the <i class="I">Financial Times
</i>stated:</div><a name="06071163000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Company Law Reform Bill...requires boards to consider the effects
of their decisions on employees, customers, the environment and local
communities, as well as document the process.</div>
<a name="06071163000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">The in-house counsel and
independent legal experts say such requirements are impractical and
will make decision-making more cumbersome and fraught.</div>
<a name="06071163000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">Peter Kennerley, a member of
the GC 100 group, which represents in-house corporate lawyers, said the
bill&#146;s provisions could encourage lawsuits from pressure groups,
investors and industrial rivals.</div>
<a name="06071163000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">Board deliberations on anything
from approving budgets to locating new production facilities would be
affected, said Mr. Kennerley, company secretary as Scottish
&amp; Newcastle, the
brewer.</div><a name="06071163000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;The
area that worries me is making decisions from which someone else loses
out,&#146; he added. &#145;Short-term investors could seek to
improve their positions by challenging a board decision, for example,
on accepting a (takeover)
offer.&#146;</div><a name="06071163000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">Under
the proposals, lawyers say directors could be left in breach of their
duties if they cannot demonstrate that they have considered every
interest group.</div> <a name="06071163000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">Most
companies accept the need to consider a range of stakeholders, where
relevant, in the decision-making process, but they are opposed to the
rigid codification of those duties.</div>
<a name="06071163000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">James Palmer, chairman of a
company law committee at the City of London Law Society and author of a
letter in today&#146;s Financial Times, said: &#145;We are very
frustrated over this element and think the government doesn&#146;t
get how this would work for companies in
practice.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="06071163000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
list of factors set out in the clause will apply to all types and sizes
of companies, but the listed matters might not be appropriate for
directors to consider in taking the best decisions in all
circumstances. A director of a major plc and the sole director of a
corner shop will not take into account the same factors when they make
important decisions. The judgment of directors is at risk of becoming
artificially fettered by their having to go through a checklist of
factors that may have absolutely no relevance to what their company
does. Again, the Government are taking a one-size-fits-all approach to
company law. The change will lead to a new area of law, in which the
courts will have to interpret circumstances and facts based on the
precise and unbending words of the
clause.</div><a name="06071163000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
is not new. Our continental neighbours have been working on codified
law since Napoleon transported the idea with his armies. However, let
us not forget that the common law system has always been at the
forefront of developing company law in this country, and the question
is whether that will now be under threat. By enshrining in statute the
list in the clause, many believe that the Government are really saying
that they do not trust UK directors to make their own decisions about
what is best for their companies. By and large, directors are directors
because they have shown themselves to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 552</div>good judgment and we should keep trusting them to discharge their
duties. Yes, we should punish wrongdoing, but we should otherwise
regulate lightly and let directors get on with running their
businesses.</div><a name="06071163000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society has pointed out that the list of factors in subsection (1) that
a director must consider raises the possibility that the courts will be
given the power to review business decisions made by directors, thereby
undermining the well established business judgment rule. That could
adversely affect the management of companies and be a significant
burden to businesses in both time and cost, as they would have to
examine the factors set out before taking any decision. The way in
which directors make decisions would therefore be significantly
altered.</div> <a name="06071163000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The change
will impact most harshly on smaller firms, which will have to expend
much more of their resources in ensuring that they comply with the
requirements. That is why we have tabled amendment No. 39 on the
recommendation of the Law Society. It would require directors to take
into account the listed factors only if they were relevant to the
matter under consideration and it was reasonably practicable to do so.
That would qualify the requirement to take all the factors into
account. The Law Society&#146;s June briefing on the amendment
stated:</div><a name="06071163000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
158(1), as amended at the Report stage of the Bill in the House of
Lords, creates an obligation to consider the listed factors which goes
beyond the subjective duty to act in the way the director considers, in
good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company
for the benefit of its members as a whole. To say, as the Government
does, that there is only a single duty rather than two separate duties
does not assist because two duties have been replaced by a single
complex duty which has two facets to it. In other words, a director
cannot discharge the duty imposed by clause 158(1) without having
regard to the factors listed in that
Clause.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Society continues to have serious concerns about the clause, even
as amended, and believes that it will make a material change to
existing law. It
states:</div><a name="06071163000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In our
view, the introduction of a list of factors which the directors are
obliged to consider makes it significantly more likely that the courts
will intervene in matters previously left to the directors&#146;
judgement. We believe that this is likely to lead to wasted management
time, and unnecessary expense, on the company&#146;s
part.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also says that
it is concerned about the extent of the burden that the subsection is
likely to impose on directors. It
states:</div><a name="06071163000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
particular, it is unclear how extensive are the enquiries which the
directors are required to make in order to obtain information which may
be relevant to the matters listed. Furthermore, it is unclear what
weight the directors are expected to attribute to competing factors
when reaching their
decision.</div><a name="06071163000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">As currently
drafted, Clause 158(1) obliges the directors to have regard to a list
of matters in deciding whether a particular course of action is likely
to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members.
Although the basic duty (in Clause 158(1)) is qualified by reference to
the directors&#146; good faith judgement, the obligation to have
regard to the factors now listed in Clause 158(1) is absolute. This is
a significant change from the current law.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071163000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society is concerned
that this change may make it much more difficult for directors to
manage the affairs of their company. It also says:</div>
<a name="06071163000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the introduction of factors which
directors are required to have regard to in discharging their duty
under Clause 158 may also create new uncertainties for third parties.
This is because a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 553</div>transaction entered into with a third party who has notice of a breach
of a fiduciary duty by one or more of the directors relating to the
transaction is voidable at the option of the company. This may result
in third parties seeking an assurance that the directors have complied
with this duty and have had regard to the factors listed in Clause
158(1).&#148;</div>
<a name="06071163000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06071163000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society
then says that</div>
<a name="06071163000079"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;directors will be more exposed to
actions for breach of duty, in particular following a takeover or in
the event of the company becoming insolvent. An increase in the risk of
personal liability is likely to discourage many individuals from taking
up directorships of UK incorporated companies and is also likely to
discourage those who do take up directorships from taking decisions
which might give rise to personal liability in the future if they
ultimately turn out to be detrimental to the
company.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It states that
amendment No. 166</div> <a name="06071163000081"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would
require the directors to consider only those factors which they, in
good faith, considered relevant to the matter in question. Provided
they acted in good faith, their decision on the relevance of a
particular factor could not be called into question by the courts
except to the extent that the directors acted in breach of their duty
to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. This would meet what
the Company Law Review described as its main concern in Paragraph 3.19
of Completing the Structure published in November 2000. In the absence
of an amendment to this effect we believe that there is a significant
risk that those incorporating companies to carry on business in the UK
may choose to incorporate them in a jurisdiction with a less onerous
regime.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000391"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a persuasive case about
the uncertainty that would be caused by the changes proposed in the
clause. Would he care to comment on the direct cost that may be
attributed to companies, particularly in seeking to obtain insurance
for directors and officers in relation to such provisions? Will the
uncertainty have any impact on the premiums that may be charged to such
companies in those
circumstances?</div><a name="06071163000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000392"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As always, my hon. Friend makes a pertinent
point. Yes, areas of additional cost will certainly arise. Costs will
arise, first, in relation to additional advice that boards will need to
take about whether they have covered the points in the list. There will
be costs in relation, secondly, to documenting the steps that they have
taken and, thirdly, to the additional claims that may arise and
resulting litigation. Finally, there will be additional costs for
insurance. I will speak more about that when we debate clause 161,
which many companies and advisers have been saying will affect the
costs of directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability
insurance.</div><a name="06071163000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000393"></a>David
Howarth:</b> To stick to the provision before us and the
possibility of increased insurance costs, can the hon. Gentleman tell
me the likely loss to the company in the case of a takeover where the
incoming directors try to proceed against the previous directors under
the clause? I am struggling to see how any of the duties might be
breached in a way that gives rise to a loss to the company, in which
case there is nothing to insure
against.</div><a name="06071163000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000394"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I gave two examples: a takeover and insolvency.
In themselves the costs will not attach to the clause; they will attach
to the clause in conjunction with other provisions, particularly under
clause 161 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 554</div>and probably in relation to other sections in the Insolvency Act.
Following a hostile takeover during which there was an uncomfortable
situation between competing boards, the winning party might in the
course of selling off the target&#146;s headquarters and going
through papers consider how they could recoup the costs of the
takeover, and it would be attractive to the incoming board to have a go
at the sacked directors of the target
company.</div>
<a name="06071163000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000395"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct that in such a
situation there is an opportunity for the new board to look for
possible legal remedies against the previous directors, and the risk
under clause 161 seems exactly the same as it is now, in that that
practice already happens. The question is what loss there might be to a
company under clause 158 were such a directive to proceed. There cannot
be a legal action in those circumstances unless there is a loss to the
company. Can he specify what that loss would
be?</div>
<a name="06071163000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000396"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I can think of 101 different ways in the
takeover scenario that I mentioned in which there could be financial
loss to the company where the incoming board maintains that it wants to
recoup that loss from the outgoing directors. It will be looking for
areas of alleged mismanagement.</div>
<a name="06071163000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000397"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Shailesh Vara</b> (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con): My hon.
Friend may agree that an example might arise during a property
recession. It is foreseeable that following a takeover the new board
might accuse the former board of not having paid due diligence to a
property recession, and if the company dealt in property, the new board
could seek to recuperate. That would lead to a financial
loss&#151;</div><a name="06071163000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000398"></a>Margaret

it.</div>
<a name="06071163000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000399"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> The Minister should appreciate that the hon. Member
for Cambridge (David Howarth) asked for an example and I have given a
business
example.</div><a name="06071163000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000400"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000401"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> It is; that is an example. If the board has not
taken that into account, the new board can say that there has been a
financial loss to the company and it can seek to claim for it. That
loss can be infinite.</div>
<a name="06071163000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000402"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> His point is that history has shown that in an
economic downturn people are more likely to become litigious and
therefore in a takeover there could be more temptation to look to
recoup. However, the point has been well
covered.</div>
<a name="06071163000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000403"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The point made by the hon. Member for North-West
Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara) concerns clause 160: directors could sue
because of a loss due to a breach of clause 160&#151;the duty to
exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. The question is what
losses could there be under clause 158?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 555</div><a name="06071163000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000404"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Clause 158 would have to be looked at in the
context of other provisions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000405"></a>Margaret

Ah.</div><a name="06071163000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000406"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes, but that does not make clause 158 any less
of a worry.</div> <a name="06071163000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
move on to concerns that have been raised that the list as currently
drafted does not make clear the ranking of the factors to take into
consideration. That is the reason for our amendment No. 43, which
states that no one duty should take precedence over another. Is the
first duty more important than the last? Are they subordinate to a
director&#146;s primary duty to promote the company&#146;s success?
If so, we believe that that should be made clear. As presently drafted
it is not clear and will undoubtedly provide much grist for a number of
court cases.</div> <a name="06071163000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
commentators have been asking whether we necessarily want to invite
judges into the boardroom. The business community does not, as <i class="I">The
Economist</i> clearly sets out in its article of 21 April:</div>
<a name="06071163000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Behind Lord Eldon's
words is a neat principle, usually known in America as the
business-judgment rule. This holds that so long as the directors of a
company act in good faith then their decisions (even the bad ones) will
not be revisited by courts with the benefit of hindsight. Directors who
are dishonest get judged in court and those that are just bad are
judged in the market place. Now a proposed revision of England's
company law threatens to change this
arrangement.</div><a name="06071163000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
Company Law Reform bill, which has its last hearing in the House of
Lords on April 25th, proposes to charge directors with more than
safeguarding the financial interests of the companies they serve. They
will also have to keep in mind their employees, customers and
suppliers, as well as nurture communities and the environment. And the
bill makes it easier for shareholders to sue wayward
directors.</div> <a name="06071163000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">Critics,
generally from business, warn that together these revisions threaten to
release a torrent of litigation as suppliers, customers,
environmentalists and others ask the courts to reverse company
decisions. The mere threat of such suits may gum up board meetings as
directors pay more attention to protecting themselves from legal action
and less to doing what they get paid to do&#151;taking risky
decisions that may sometimes prove
wrong.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
article
concludes:</div><a name="06071163000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposed duties are based on the notion that successful companies are
also good corporate citizens, managed on behalf of &#145;enlightened
shareholders&#146;. Under this doctrine there is a neat intersection
between the desire of shareholders for a better world and their
interest in corporate success, and reward flows to those companies that
are most successful at balancing the needs of different stakeholders.
But the approach bears little relation to
reality.</div><a name="06071163000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">Take tobacco
and liquor companies. They supply products that, while giving pleasure,
may harm their customers and others. Airlines provide convenient
transport but also release greenhouse gases. Under the new law
shareholders could potentially sue directors of these companies for
disregarding their duty to protect the environment and the community.
&#145;You'll have the teetotallers taking over the brewery,&#146;
warns Dan Prentice, a law professor at Oxford's Pembroke
College.</div> <a name="06071163000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">The greater
worry is that, in trying to legislate good behaviour, the bill may make
business decisions subject to subsequent review in court, says Adrian
Levy, a partner at Clifford Chance, a law firm. Directors will be less
happy to sanction a takeover or restructuring knowing that they could
suffer personal liability for honest business decisions. In effect
directors may end up being held liable for decisions simply because
they are wrong, rather than because they acted in bad faith.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column555" />Column number: 556</div><a name="06071163000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">If the bill passes, many think
judges will continue to leave business decisions to businessmen. Judges
&#145;are no good at it and don&#146;t want to take it on,&#146;
says Paul Davies, of the London School of Economics. Perhaps. But
mounting red tape is already deterring qualified people from accepting
board appointments. If they now face the risk of being taken to the
cleaners for business decisions made in good faith, even fewer are
likely to step
forward.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a likely conflict between the factors listed in subsection (1). For
instance, the long-term interests of a company may be best served by
closing a factory, but this is unlikely to be in the interests of the
company&#146;s employees or the wider
community.</div>
<a name="06071163000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000407"></a><b class="B">Keith
Vaz</b> (Leicester, East) (Lab): I am following the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument very carefully. Is he saying that he does
not believe that the average company director in the United Kingdom
would be competent enough to make such
judgments?</div><a name="06071163000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000408"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> No. A director under the existing common law
must make many judgments. Commentators argue that the formulation of
some of the judgments that they have to make under the clause could
confuse rather than clarify the
picture.</div><a name="06071163000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000409"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000410"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000411"></a>Keith
Vaz:</b> If the hon. Gentleman were to put his arguments to
the average company director in the United Kingdom they would be
insulted by the view of these commentators. If directors take on the
responsibilities, they will want to discharge them to the best of their
ability. If they are given judgments to make, they will make them. May
I suggest that the hon. Gentleman talk to some company directors,
rather than academics, and put their views before
us?</div><a name="06071163000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000412"></a>Mr.

have listened to what I have said, which is exactly what he has just
said?</div><a name="06071163000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06071163000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
Herbert Smith, a
director</div><a name="06071163000306"></a><div class="hs_brev" style="text-align: left;">&#147;will
be required to give regard to all of these factors in every decision,
even if a factor is plainly irrelevant and even if it would be
outweighed by other considerations.</div>
<a name="06071163000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">The new formulation poses a
number of questions. What does it mean to &#145;have regard&#146;
to a particular factor? Can a director properly &#145;have
regard&#146; to a factor without full and proper investigation? What
if the director decides not to investigate? Would the reasons
matter?</div><a name="06071163000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">What if a
factor had been outweighed in the context of an almost identical recent
decision? An example might be a proposal to vary a decision reached on
a previous occasion, when the ultimate choice had come down to the
balance between two considerations. On the second occasion, would the
failure to have regard to all six factors amount to a breach?</div>
<a name="06071163000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">What if the director is wrong
about one of the factors? Have they nevertheless &#145;had
regard&#146; to the impact, rather than simply their erroneous
perception of the impact? What if the director&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 557</div>mistake is itself a breach of the separate duty to exercise reasonable
care, skill and diligence?</div>
<a name="06071163000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">There is no clear answer to
many of those questions. Assuming the bill is passed, they will require
detailed consideration by the courts over forthcoming years. It will be
some time before any certainty is achieved.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071163000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The communication from Herbert
Smith goes on to talk about derivative actions. Although that is in
part 11, it establishes an important connection with clause 158. The
communication
states:</div><a name="06071163000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
uncertainty will be exacerbated by reforms expanding the scope of the
derivative action. The Bill replaces the restrictive &#145;wrongdoer
control&#146; and &#145;fraud on the minority&#146; preconditions
with a general discretion for the courts to allow such claims to
proceed. There is a list of considerations that must be taken into
account by the court in exercising this discretion. Even so, the
discretion is very
broad.</div><a name="06071163000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">The new
provisions may mean that derivative actions become a more common
feature of the corporate landscape. They will almost certainly provide
a means for a disaffected shareholder to seek further public debate
about the merits of a challenged decision. As the court has a general
discretion, companies may well feel compelled to justify the substance
of their decisions to the court, rather than simply focusing on why
this applicant should not be permitted to bring the
claim.</div><a name="06071163000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">In the short
term, the likely consequence of all these reforms will be an increase
in the procedural requirements of decision-making as directors strive
to ensure that they have records reflecting proper consideration of
each factor so as to minimise any prospect for challenge by means of
the derivative action or
otherwise.</div><a name="06071163000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">Even so,
the result is likely to be more breaches by directors, many of which
will be largely technical. This may have consequences in terms of
reporting and insurance. It may also trigger contractual provisions,
perhaps in joint ventures or financing
arrangements.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000413"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000414"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The fundamental problem with the Bill is that it
clouds the directors paramount duty to consider the best interests of
the company. That is the kernel of the
issue.</div><a name="06071163000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
duties are all important, as I made clear, but the fundamental
responsibility of a director is to the best interests of their company.
All other responsibilities spring from that fundamental duty. By
clouding that duty, the Government will do a great disservice to
company law and directors for decades to come. That is why we have
tabled amendment No. 165, which
states:</div><a name="06071163000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
duty to promote the success of the company shall be
paramount.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071163000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of concerns
about the interpretation of the new language that the Government have
chosen to introduce to the Bill. For example, what does
&#147;independent judgment&#148; mean for a director? That was
taken up by Patrick Mitchell and Carl Powlson of the City law firm
Herbert
Smith:</div><a name="06071163000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is an unfortunate mixture of subjective and objective standards in this
section. The first part of section 158(1) &#147;<i class="I">A
director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good
faith...&#148;</i> is a subjective test as is the case under the
current common law, whereas the test set out in the remainder of
section 158(1) &#147;<i class="I">...and in doing so have regard (amongst other
matters) 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 558</div>to...&#148; </i>is an objective test, which would allow a court to
find that a director had breached his duty even if acting in good
faith. By introducing this objective requirement into directors&#146;
decision making processes, courts may increasingly be asked to
intervene on issues currently treated as matters for directors&#146;
judgement.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
they make an important
point.</div><a name="06071163000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The law firm,
Linklaters, has raised concerns also about the use of the word
&#147;success&#148; in the clause. Does it differ from the term
&#147;best interests of the company&#148;? There is no case law on
the matter. The report that Linklaters has provided covers all the
duties of directors, and I feel that hon. Members need to listen to
what the legal professionals have to say. The Linklaters report of
February this year
states:</div><a name="06071163000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Almost
since the beginning of the law of companies, it has been clear that
directors had a duty to act in the best interests of their company as a
whole. Over time, this duty has been developed and expanded, but always
in court, never in a way accessible to the thousands of directors who
run small private
companies.</div><a name="06071163000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">Following
one of the key recommendations of the Company Law Review, the Bill
seeks to take the current state of the common law on directors&#146;
duties and put it in statutory form, with the intention of making these
duties clearer and more accessible... However, effective
codification of such a complex area of law is not easily achieved. In
particular... it risks creating a more rigid and restrictive
regime, compared with the ability of case law to apply and develop
established principles in a way that distinguishes between different
situations and circumstances... the Bill uses new wording to
describe the existing duties, and it is not clear whether the courts
will be able to interpret the new wording in the same way as the old
principles that it replaces. Thus codification creates areas of
uncertainty... the statement of duties does not cover all of the
duties a director may owe to a company, for example the duty to
consider the interests of creditors in times of threatened insolvency.
To that extent, the objective of making the law more accessible to
directors is not achieved, since it will still be necessary to refer to
other statutory or common law duties apart from those set out in the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report goes
on:</div><a name="06071163000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
statutory statement of directors&#146; duties is intended in general
to be based on, and not to alter but to replace, common law...
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, the Bill provides that &#145;regard
shall be had to the corresponding common law rules and equitable
principles in interpreting and applying the general
duties.&#146;... Thus, it will be necessary to refer to the
existing historic body of case law to understand the new provisions.
Quite how this is supposed to work where the statutory codification and
common law/equitable rules and principles do not
&#145;correspond&#146; is inevitably a matter of
uncertainty.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues, but the point has been
made.</div><a name="06071163000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
concerns about the pluralist agenda, an issue that is important to many
hon. Members. We are concerned that as drafted, and certainly as
proposed in amendment No. 300, the clause would allow company law to
become the arena for a number of interest groups to further their
causes at the expense of the best interests of a
company.</div><a name="06071163000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Corporate
social responsibility is now taken more or less seriously by all the
larger companies based in this country, and it is generally agreed that
it is only good business sense for them to do so. The Conservative
party has shown how highly it values corporate responsibility. We
support social responsibility in companies and believe that companies,
in preference to the state, can be a positive driver of environmental
and social change. In fact, we in the Conservative party have placed
increased corporate responsibility at the top of our
agenda.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000417"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> That is not a fair response, because the elements
that the hon. Gentleman has just criticised&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]
</i>I do not know how he defines corporate responsibility; perhaps he
will tell me. The elements that he has just
criticised&#151;subsection (1)(a) to (f)&#151;are crucial to any
understanding of a corporate responsibility agenda. The long-term
consequences of decisions; the need to foster relationships with
suppliers, customers and others; the impact of a company&#146;s
operations on the community and the environment; and the desirability
of maintaining high standards of business conduct are elements of a
corporate responsibility agenda. If he has a different understanding, I
do not think that anybody, except perhaps members of his party, shares
it.</div><a name="06071163000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000418"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000419"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000420"></a>Mr.

out the list. I shall read it out again if he so wishes. He said that
those were the elements that he understood. I then asked him a
question: if those are the elements that help to constitute an
understanding of corporate social responsibility, which he claims he
and his party support, why does he oppose their inclusion in the
clause?</div><a name="06071163000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000422"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000423"></a>Margaret

social responsibility that are not mentioned in these measures. I have

me in the round.</div>

time identifying some of the larger campaigns, many of which are
undertaken by pressure groups that have been lobbying the Government
and the Opposition for some time to include mandatory and sometimes
almost punitive obligations in the directors&#146; duties in the
Bill.</div> <a name="06071163000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give a
few examples of those campaigns: the campaign against Nestl(c);
the Greenpeace campaigns against Cargill, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and
McDonald&#146;s; the campaigns against Asia Pulp and Paper, Asia
Pacific Resources International Holdings Ltd, ExxonMobil, Bayer and
Lafarge, which wanted to turn the mountains of South Harris into
aggregates for road building; and the campaigns against Alstom. I think
that hon. Members get the picture. Those are some of the largest
campaigns that have been doing the rounds in recent
times.</div><a name="06071163000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon. Members
are aware, there are many campaigns to improve environmental and social
conditions around the world&#151;the list that I have given only
scratches the surface. From the pluralist viewpoint, there is a problem
with all this: not one of the companies that I mentioned will be
affected by the Bill. Why? Because every single one is not a UK
company, and only UK companies are affected by the
Bill.</div><a name="06071163000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
frank. We can make our company law regime as rigid as we want, but it
will not matter a jot to those foreign companies and will therefore not
go an inch in helping to further any of those campaigns. Most major
multinational companies that are UK listed, such as BP, already take
CSR very seriously and spend considerable time and money on
it.</div> <a name="06071163000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
ignores the fact that many publicly listed companies sell themselves on
their CSR reputation, BP being a prime example. More and more
shareholders are realising that they can exert a positive influence on
the companies that they ultimately control. The rise in green and
ethical investment funds operated by most of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 561</div>the major fund managers has made them clearly aware of that. It is now
simply bad business for a major plc to ignore CSR, as the following
statement from an article in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> of 21 April
makes
clear:</div><a name="06071163000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Corporate
governance is becoming increasingly important to European investors,
according to a new
survey.</div><a name="06071163000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">Jean-Nicolas
Caprasse, managing director of Institutional Shareholder Services
Europe, the proxy voting service, said: &#145;Although to date,
continental European investors have lagged behind their counterparts in
North America and the UK in terms of the priority they place on
corporate governance, this study shows that attitudes are clearly
changing.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="06071163000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
article goes on to show how things are changing in Europe, as well as
in the United Kingdom.</div>
<a name="06071163000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of the rest of the companies
that will be affected by the Bill, the vast majority&#151;probably
more than 90 per cent.&#151;are small and medium sized. Such
companies, which are rarely the target of environmental or social
campaigning, have enough troubles as it is, without being asked to jump
through a series of new statutory hoops.</div>
<a name="06071163000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is that the Bill
deals with UK companies and does not provide the framework to deal with
the issues on which most people have campaigned. It treats the English
corner shop in the same way as the British multinational, and it is the
wrong place to deal with the issues before us, important as they may
be. We have therefore tabled amendment No. 40, which notes that the
duties should
be</div><a name="06071163000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appropriate for the
size of the company&#148;,</div><a name="06071163000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
amendment No. 40, which would exclude small and medium-sized companies
from the
provisions.</div><a name="06071163000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06071163000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
considering that if CSR is made statutory, as some hon. Members wish,
UK companies would be less able to compete in the global marketplace.
Increasingly, we are seeing the emergence of powerful multinational
companies, which are becoming direct competitors to UK companies.
India&#146;s Tata bought Tetley, Hong Kong&#146;s Cheung Kong
Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. is a potential bidder for Thames Water,
and the only potential saviour following the Government&#146;s fiasco
over Rover was a Chinese company.</div>
<a name="06071163000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Corporate Responsibility
Coalition has taken an active interest in the Bill, because it regards
company law as the correct vehicle to deal with the wide range of
issues that its umbrella group encompasses. Those groups are important
stakeholders, and I was pleased to meet them to discuss the Bill. It is
right that I should put forward their views. They say:</div>
<a name="06071163000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;CORE and the Trade
Justice Movement recognise that many UK companies take their
environmental and social responsibilities seriously and play an
important role both here and abroad though job creation, innovation and
technological development. However, as the above examples
demonstrate&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071163000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">CORE
had given a lot of
examples&#151;</div><a name="06071163000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;left to
their own devices some companies seek to minimise their costs and
maximise their profits by taking shortcuts on health and safety and
environmental protection and failing to respect the basic rights of
their workers and the local communities affected by their
operations.</div><a name="06071163000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">UK company
law is the only framework that sets the overarching terms of reference
for UK companies, including the role and priorities of company
directors. Following the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column561" />Column number: 562</div>longstanding campaigning of our members to expose and rectify examples
of corporate abuse, we no longer believe that the current legal
framework is adequate to prevent irresponsible behaviour by UK
companies. Legal measures are needed to set basic minimum obligations
for directors and their companies in relation to their environmental
and social impacts so as to ensure that UK business makes a positive
contribution to the major global challenges we face this century,
including global poverty and social injustice, unsustainable
development, and climate
change.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
examples of India and China show that as we move into an increasingly
international marketplace, we will have to compete with companies that
come from an economic climate in which CSR is not often taken into
account, let alone put on the statute books. The Government&#146;s
attempts to burden every UK company with a series of extra boxes to
tick show that they have no concept of the true nature of the global
marketplace. As Indian and Chinese companies reach around the world and
the economies of those countries grow, should we really be tilting the
playing field in their favour by making our company directors adhere to
these extra regulations? If we are not careful, even more of our
entrepreneurs will pick up sticks and reopen in China. That is
happening now&#151;it is not me speculating.</div>
<a name="06071163000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK should be the world
leader in promoting good corporate responsibility in companies. Where
we lead, other companies will follow. However, the answer to the
question of how to lead the way on CSR is not to impose a heavy
regulatory burden on our companies, but to encourage investors to take
into account a company&#146;s record on CSR and to encourage all the
companies in the UK to understand that being socially responsible is in
their best interests. I have no doubt that CSR will be moved ahead by
market forces. Consumers voting with their feet will always be a more
effective way than regulation of getting companies to take up their CSR
responsibilities.</div> <a name="06071163000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to consider just how damaging an over-regulated
company environment can be. The strict regulatory environment that now
prevails in the United States has led the US Chamber of Commerce to
warn that the US could lose its leading position in global capital
markets. Our companies are steadily falling from their position as the
most competitive in the world and to rest on our past laurels would be
fatal. At a time when our competitors, including those in Europe, are
waking up to the dangers of over-regulation, we should not go down the
regulation route ourselves. Over recent years there has been a plethora
of often individually small changes that have heightened the regulatory
environment for directors in the UK.</div>
<a name="06071163000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">One impact has been the switch
of companies from the London stock exchange to the alternative
investment market exchange. There has also been a significant increase
in moves to company de-listings and venture capital and management
buy-outs. As company directors and investors have become increasingly
wary of the additional regulations and structures imposed on listed
companies, to impose even more costs and burdens on UK company
directors would do nothing to further the course of UK plc. In fact, by
imposing further burdens on UK company directors there are fears that
the right people will be discouraged from becoming company directors
in the UK.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 563</div><a name="06071163000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particular concerns have also
been expressed about directors of smaller companies who will bear the
brunt of further regulation. The Government have said that one of the
Bill&#146;s aims is to help smaller companies. This is one example of
that aim being completely off target. I shall read from a letter to the
editor of the <i class="I">Financial Times, </i>dated 6 January. It
says:</div><a name="06071163000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
impact will fall unduly on the smaller sector. Also the likely
consequence of 158...is that there will be an increase in the
length of minutes and to a large extent those minutes will develop a
standard format. The effect will be a waste of resources, including
cost for no real benefit to UK plc. Even if the government does not
accept it is wrong for company law to be used to regulate the
environment&#151;that should be left to environmental
legislation&#151;it ought to accept that the wording of the code
needs to make it clear that the factors in 158...are subservient
to the prime duty of a director to promote the success (or interests)
of the
company&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt in my mind that increased corporate regulation will do
nothing but hinder our economy. When all is said and done I tend to
agree with James Palmer, a partner at Herbert Smith, who chairs the
City of London Law Society&#146;s law sub-committee, and who is
reported as saying on 30 March that this is one area of company law
where,</div><a name="06071163000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we actually we
didn&#146;t need much change&#148;.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000427"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> I shall speak to amendment No. 300 and new clause 27
in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne,
Central (Jim Cousins), who for health reasons is no longer a member of
the Committee. I have also signed the two submissions.</div>
<a name="06071163000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to make it clear
that I welcome the recognition in this first ever statutory statement
of directors&#146; duties that, in fulfilling their primary duty to
promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members,
directors must have regard to a number of factors, including the
interests of the company&#146;s employees and the impact of the
company&#146;s operations on the community and the environment.
Having said that, I share the concerns expressed by some commentators,
such as the Corporate Responsibility Coalition&#151;CORE&#151;and
the Trade Justice Movement that, contrary to what we have heard from
the hon. Member for Huntingdon, the Bill does not go far enough in
addressing the issue of corporate accountability.</div>
<a name="06071163000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As currently drafted, clause
158, welcome though it is, is unlikely to lead to a sufficient
improvement in the social and environmental performances of UK
companies as a whole. It may be worth mentioning that the two
coalitions to which I have referred include all the major UK
environmental development and human rights organisations as well as a
number of trade unions, businesses and faith-based groups. In total
they represent more than 100 organisations and approximately 9 million
members.</div> <a name="06071163000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key
argument is that all UK businesses should become more accountable for
their wider impacts on communities and the environment, and the Bill
represents a real opportunity to advance the same through the
provisions on social and environmental reporting and on directors
duties. I am not asking for something new; the best companies do that
already. It is an important part of how business operates throughout
the world and in this country.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 564</div><a name="06071163000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Businesses take their social and
environmental responsibilities seriously. British business is more
often than not a force for good, as the hon. Gentleman said. It creates
jobs here and overseas, and it is responsible for innovation and
technological advance. My argument is pro-business. It looks for a
high-standard level playing field where the good are not undermined by
the bad. There are many examples of bad practice at home and overseas,
although I shall not go into detail as they were mentioned on Second
Reading in the House and in the other place.</div>
<a name="06071163000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of today&#146;s debate
involves the consideration of directors duties that took place in the
company law review, which reported to the Government exactly five years
ago. It considered a number of approaches, including the so-called
pluralist approach to directors duties. Such an approach would require
directors to balance shareholder interests with those of a
company&#146;s other stakeholders, such as employees, consumers and
the wider community in which the company operated, including
overseas.</div> <a name="06071163000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have rejected that pluralist approach in favour of an
alternative, which has already been mentioned, known as enlightened
shareholder value. Many see it as integral to the idea of corporate
social responsibility, so I was confused when the hon. Member for
Huntingdon seemingly rejected it while espousing corporate social
responsibility. The clause articulates enlightened shareholder value.
It clearly means that the promotion of shareholder interest remains the
central priority for company directors, and it relegates other
considerations, valuable though they are, to secondary
status.</div> <a name="06071163000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that the introduction of a pluralist approach to directors duties would
be radical and one which, in light of the Government&#146;s position
on the company law review, we could not reasonably have supported or
achieved in the Bill. However, I also share concerns that enlightened
shareholder value relies excessively on the voluntary
approach&#151;voluntary action by companies to improve their impact
on wider stakeholders and the environment. Many volunteer, and they do
that well while being profitable. Some argue that if a company embraces
a wider set of interests, it is more likely to succeed. Others do
not.</div><a name="06071163000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The voluntary
approach is considered inefficient in dealing with some of the worst
examples of corporate social and environmental abuse throughout the
world, and its weaknesses have been highlighted in several reports from
leading international organisations, including the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank. Amendment No.
300 would respond to those concerns by strengthening the clause so that
directors, in fulfilling their primary duty to promote the success of
the company for the benefit of its members, were required not to have
regard to the interests of and impacts on the company&#146;s wider
stakeholders and the environment, but to have a positive duty in
relation to them. In short, directors would be required not to have
regard to the factors in subsection (1)(a) to (f), but to endeavour to
act on each of
them.</div>
<a name="06071163000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06071163000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000428"></a>David
Howarth:</b> To whom would the duties be owed?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 565</div><a name="06071163000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000429"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> The duties would be owed primarily to the
shareholders and members of the company who would be able to raise the
issues. The company would be asked to look beyond the sole prime duty
of maximising profit, which good companies do, and would send a message
to the wider public and society in which it
operates.</div><a name="06071163000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 300 seeks to ask shareholders, in fulfilling the company&#146;s
primary duty to maximise profit, to require directors actively to take
steps to minimise any adverse impact on communities and the
environment. Similarly, directors would be required actively to promote
the interests of their employees rather than simply having to have
regard to them.</div> <a name="06071163000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
similar amendment was tabled by a cross-party group of Lords in the
other place and the Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, expressed concern
that that would point directors in two directions at once. That is
certainly not the intention of amendment No. 300. The duty that the
amendment would introduce would sit within the framework of enlightened
shareholder value and the primary duty of directors would still be to
promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members. The
proposed positive duty would be secondary to that. It is important to
stress that, because there seems to be a great deal of confusion and
fog around these matters, which are important to us and people
throughout the
world.</div><a name="06071163000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there were
conflict between the primary duty to promote the success of the company
and the positive duty to the company&#146;s wider stakeholders, the
duty to shareholders would take precedence. The difference between the
requirement to have regard to the interests of and the impact on the
company&#146;s wider stakeholders&#151;that is what the clause
requires&#151;and the requirement in amendment No. 300 for directors
to endeavour to act positively in relation to those factors is
important, but it is one of emphasis, with the latter requirement being
more likely to lead to real improvements in corporate, social and
environmental performance. I do not believe that that would be a
burden&#151;some companies are already doing that or considering
moving more in that direction&#151;and I do not believe that
directors would find that too much of a difficulty to take on board and
to seek to put into
practice.</div><a name="06071163000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
requirement that directors have regard to a range of other factors
while fulfilling their primary duty provides no obligation for
directors to act on the information, but the proposed positive duty
&#147;to endeavour&#148; to do so would encourage them to be
proactive in their consideration of the environmental and social impact
of their
business.</div><a name="06071163000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000430"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting
point about the need to ensure that we protect the environment,
although I believe that it could be addressed in a different way. His
amendment states that a company should</div>
<a name="06071163000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;minimise any adverse impact of
the company&#146;s operations on the community and the
environment&#148;.</div> <a name="06071163000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would he
concede that in certain circumstances that might mean that a company
would have to stop trading, full stop? For example, a company involved
in waste management and landfill may be carrying out a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 566</div>valuable service, but it could not say 100 per cent. that it minimised
the effect on the environment, so to comply with the amendment it might
have to stop
trading.</div><a name="06071163000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000431"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> No, I do not see that, because a
company trading in that sphere would have to comply
with other law and would do so without difficulty. If the directors
wanted to raise the game above the minimum standards set by the law in
terms of the issues that the hon. Gentleman used as an example,
obviously they would do so provided that it did not lead to a loss by
the company. The fact that there would be extra pressure on them to
raise their game and improve their performance is surely good rather
than
bad.</div><a name="06071163000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000432"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point about
standards coming from other legislation. Does he agree that,
practically, that is the most effective way to deal with the issue,
rather than relying on the more general and vague language of his
amendment? Obviously, the minimising provision in paragraph (d) has to
be read separately. Minimising any adverse impact overrides and
overarches statutory provisions elsewhere, and it might have the
effects that I have already
highlighted.</div><a name="06071163000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000433"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> I do not think that it would have that impact. It
would focus the board on the need to address those issues, not
necessarily only because there is another statute. Of course any
responsible company must comply with the law. My proposal would bring
the issues more into the ethos of the company and put them firmly on
the agenda. Indeed, in order to continue being successful and to become
even more successful, it would encourage a company to address such
issues better if it could do so.</div>
<a name="06071163000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an important signal to
give to all companies, not just the sort of company to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. I do not think that there is a size issue.
Conservative Members have tabled a number of amendments that seek to
limit the application of these matters to large companies. Small and
medium-sized enterprises can have as many as 250 employees as I
understand it. That is a vast percentage of business in this country.
Saying that they should be exempt is the wrong signal to send. I am
talking about encouraging directors to be
proactive.</div><a name="06071163000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000434"></a>Mrs.
Ellman:</b> Does my hon. Friend accept that his proposals
would give a stronger focus to issues of corporate social
responsibility which would be entirely compatible with the more general
measures recommended by the hon. Members for Hornchurch (James
Brokenshire) and for Huntingdon? If their measures went forward on
their own without any focus in company legislation, the impact of
corporate responsibility would be
diminished.</div><a name="06071163000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000435"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> There is a contradiction in the position that has
been taken by the Conservative party on this issue. It is important to
recall that at the recent local elections your party, Mr. Bercow, went
to the country on the ticket, &#147;Go Green, Vote Blue&#148;. Some
of the confusions about the green element of that have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 567</div>revealed in Committee today. We are all talking much the same
language&#151;we are using phrases such as &#147;corporate social
responsibility&#148; and I am pleased that there is all-party
consensus about that, but we must not leave it entirely to chance and
allow individuals to say, &#147;OK, we&#146;ll do a little bit more
about this, that and the other.&#148; There is nothing wrong with
trying to set a fair, achievable, level playing field, which is
pro-business, rather than rewarding those who cannot be bothered to
raise their game and leaving it just to the market for those who are
more responsible in that
regard.</div><a name="06071163000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000436"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from
but does he not feel that there needs to be some specific guidelines as
to what is meant by, for example,</div>
<a name="06071163000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the impact of the
company&#146;s operations on the community and the
environment&#148;</div><a name="06071163000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
subsection (1)(d)? They are such broad terms and so general that there
will be the potential for litigation. The perception of what is in the
best interests of the community and the environment can differ from one
individual to
another.</div><a name="06071163000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000437"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> I will come to new clause 27 shortly. It addresses
the guidance and its status in terms of interpreting such words. As far
as litigation is concerned, nothing in the Bill or in any of the
amendments with which I am associated makes any difference to the
current situation. We are trying to encourage the raising of standards
and a voluntary focused requirement to examine issues in the operation
of companies other than just maximising profit. We want directors to be
proactive and to seek to mitigate or remove adverse social and
environment
effects.</div><a name="06071163000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The term
&#147;having regard to&#148; will create a subjective test, based
on the personal judgment of a director. The proposed wording in
amendment No. 300, &#147;must endeavour to&#148;, would lead to an
objective test. There would need to be evidence of directors seeking to
carry out the additional duties, even if they were unable to. Such
duties are now on the agenda, either on a voluntary basis under the
clause as drafted or in a slightly stronger way as proposed in
amendment No.
300.</div><a name="06071163000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would make no difference to the way in which a director&#146;s duties
are enforced and, as I have said, it would not lead to an increased
risk of litigation. It is intended to provide a stronger signpost for
directors on the type of behaviour that is likely to lead to success
for their companies in the long term, and to provide protection for
directors who act responsibly and seek to raise the standard of their
companies&#146; performance by broadening what they do. That would
protect them from shareholders who say, &#147;Well, the only thing
you&#146;re here for is to maximise profit.&#148; That is another
matter of long-term interests and responsible
behaviour.</div><a name="06071163000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
stronger emphasis on action that amendment No. 300 would deliver would
encourage a more active approach by directors to the social and
environmental impact of their businesses. It would therefore be more
likely to lead to real improvements in the social and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 568</div>environmental performance of poorly performing companies and create a
more level playing field so that the many UK companies that take
seriously their social and environmental duties are less likely to be
undercut by less scrupulous
competitors.</div><a name="06071163000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure
that there is no confusion on what the clause requires of directors,
new clause 27 would introduce a requirement of the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry to publish statutory mandatory guidance on how
the duties in clause 158 should be interpreted. That guidance would
help directors to understand in practical terms what the enhanced
duties will mean for them, and it could be updated freely and
easily.</div> <a name="06071163000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">A similar
proposal was tabled in the other place, in response to which the
Attorney-General committed the Government to publishing non-statutory
guidance on the statutory statement of directors&#146; general duties
in clause 158 and to consulting relevant parties. I look forward to
confirmation from my right hon. Friend the Minister that that is still
the position. I welcome that commitment, but the benefits of amendment
No. 300 in corporate social and environmental performance would be
likely to be maximised if there were a stronger incentive for directors
to comply with guidance; that is, if it were statutory, mandatory
guidance. In the face of statutory guidance, compliance indicates
compliance with the law, but if the guidance is voluntary and
non-statutory, directors will be able to pick and choose whether to
comply. Mandatory guidance is therefore more likely to lead to the
responsible corporate behaviour and long-term business success that we
all hope
for.</div><a name="06071163000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06071163000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
know that my right hon. Friend the Minister takes a close personal
interest in the matter and that she has had a lot of discussions with a
number of people including, briefly, myself. I also know from our
discussion last week when she, I and a small band of others voted on
the title of the Bill in clause 923, that she is one of a small number
of true reformers in the Committee. That being so, although we lost the
vote on that occasion, we can put it right today with her assistance. I
look forward to the comfort that she will give to a fellow reformer
when she comes to make helpful remarks in response to the
debate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000438"></a>David
Howarth:</b><b class="B"> </b>The proposals are of great importance, but
I fear that I will deliver a somewhat hard-nosed legal speech. A lawyer
once told me that the main thing that someone has to remember if they
are told that there is a risk of litigation is to ask two questions.
The first is: who is the plaintiff? The second is: what is the loss? If
there is no plausible plaintiff and there is no loss, there is no risk
of litigation, so do not worry.</div>
<a name="06071163000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be clear about who
will be suing for what. We must go back to clause 156 to see the
fundamental liability regime that we are dealing with. It has
established that the duties concerned are duties &#147;to the
company&#148;. The duties are not to the shareholders. It is a common
misapprehension that shareholders are the same as the company. They are
not. The company is a structure of rules that allows certain people in
certain circumstances to make decisions about the assets that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 569</div>the company holds. The company is, in effect, a bank account and a set
of rules that establish who can take money out of that bank account in
what circumstances.</div><a name="06071163000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
key point to remember about companies is that usually the directors are
in control of the company, and they represent the company for the most
part in company law. Article 70 of table A in the Companies (Tables A
to F) Regulations 1985
states:</div><a name="06071163000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the business of
the company shall be managed by the directors who may exercise all the
powers of the
company&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The belief that
the company is somehow the shareholders goes back to the 19th century,
but it has not been true in practice for a long time.</div>
<a name="06071163000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, sometimes the
shareholders are in charge. Article 70 allows a supermajority of
shareholders&#151;75 per cent., by special
resolution&#151;to give directions to the board. We are not talking
about a mere majority, although an ordinary majority can remove a
director at any time, and we just reaffirmed that principle in clause
154. Some other actions require votes by the shareholders as opposed to
votes by the board of directors, and when we reach chapter 4 of this
part we will see a few examples of those.</div>
<a name="06071163000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Majority shareholders are
therefore in a powerful position, but they are not the same as the
company itself. When the company becomes insolvent, for example, the
creditors take control through the administrator or liquidator. What
matters for the purposes of the discussion we are having on clause 158
is who can speak on behalf of the company in the relevant circumstances
and who can sue on its behalf. That is what determines what counts as
&#147;the company&#148; for the purposes of the clause, and that is
who is the plaintiff.</div>
<a name="06071163000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are basically four
possibilities. The first is the board. For the most part, however,
directors owe their duties to the board, because it decides when the
company will take legal action against anybody. The second possibility
is that in some unusual circumstances shareholders can begin legal
actions. Almost always a special resolution involving a 75 per cent.
supermajority of shareholders can do that, and there are some
circumstances in which the majority of shareholders can take legal
action on behalf of the company. The second possibility therefore
involves the directors and the majority of shareholders, although that
will more often be a supermajority than an ordinary majority.</div>
<a name="06071163000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third possibility is of
minority shareholder legal actions. Under existing law, that happens
under the very rare exceptions to the rule in Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle.
That is being replaced by statutory derivative action in clause 243 and
subsequent clauses, which is fortunate because we will not all have to
know the exceptions to the rule in Foss <i class="I">v.</i> Harbottle. If we read
those clauses, however, we see that it is not at all easy to get a
derivative claim going against the wishes of the majority of
shareholders. Clauses 243 and 246 in particular make it clear that the
likelihood of ratification by the shareholders, particularly
independent shareholders who are not involved in the dispute, is a key
factor in determining whether a derivative action should continue. If
we want to know what ratification is, we go to clause 222, which tell
us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 570</div>that it can be done by a majority of shareholders. It turns out,
therefore, that minority shareholder action will be very rare. In a
sense, it is just a minor variation on the second option, which is
action by the majority of shareholders. It will come into use when the
majority is a majority only because of the votes of a particular
shareholder, who will be the person whose actions are in dispute. In
those rather rare circumstances, the derivative action might come into
use in court.</div> <a name="06071163000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth option, which will be by far the most important in practice,
involves the liquidators who act on behalf of an insolvent company.
When a company goes broke, as the hon. Member for Huntingdon said, the
creditors take over, and their representative collects all the money
that is owing to the company, which might include suing past directors
for breaches of their duty.</div>
<a name="06071163000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">How likely are such legal
actions to take place in reality? As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, it
is only during a takeover that there is any prospect at all of the
board of directors or the majority shareholders using the clauses to
bring legal action against a director. That is because, in the ordinary
course of business, they have far better remedies than suing under
those clauses. They can remove the director at any time under clause
154, for example, and the threat of dismissal is far more effective
than the threat of legal action. Aside from takeover cases, therefore,
we are really only talking about the threat of legal action by the
liquidator.</div> <a name="06071163000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now
come to the important point that I tried to raise in interventions on
the hon. Gentleman. We have established that some people, such as the
liquidators or the new board after a takeover, might occasionally be in
a position to sue. The question, however, is what the loss is. It must
arise from the breach&#151;otherwise, there is nothing to sue
over&#151;but it is difficult to imagine a breach purely of clause
158 by a director giving rise to a loss to the company, and we should
remember that the loss must to the company, not to anyone else. That is
why the hon. Member for Bedford (Patrick Hall) was right to say that
the clause is about enlightened shareholder value, not pluralism. A
pluralistic approach would allow other people to sue on the basis of
losses to them. Here, however, it is only losses to the company that
count.</div> <a name="06071163000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can
imagine circumstances in which the company might incur losses because
it had neglected environmental legislation, been subject to a massive
fine and gone into liquidation. However, clause 158 does not seem to
add to that risk because it would be an action under clause 160
&#147;Duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence&#148;.
So I cannot see clause 158 adding to the risk of
litigation.</div><a name="06071163000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000439"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I would welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments
on clause 158(1)(a), which
states:</div><a name="06071163000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the likely
consequences of any decision in the long
term&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I read it, that
will have an impact on a loss. Decisions can be taken in any manner; it
is a broad spectrum. If a board of directors takes decisions that prove
to be commercially wrong in the long term, will that paragraph not
provide room for them to be
sued?</div><a name="06071163000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000440"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am not sure that that is the case because the
clause also reads:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 571</div><a name="06071163000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the way he considers, in good
faith&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">All the duties
are then expressed in that way. In any case, presumably, that would be
subject to the standards in clause 160. I cannot understand how that
adds anything extra to the problem that directors will have anyway
under clause 160 when making decisions that turn out to be bad.
Usually, in those circumstances, the law helps directors. It treats
them as reasonable people and asks, &#147;Did they act
reasonably?&#148;, not, &#147;Did they act
perfectly?&#148;</div><a name="06071163000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come to the real effect of the clause. This is a slightly
paradoxical argument, but it seems that the clause is
deregulatory and will protect directors. We must go back to section 309
of the Companies Act 1985. It allows directors to have regard
to the interests of employees. The cases that arise under that section
are not about directors who fail to have regard to the interests of
employees, but rather the opposite&#151;cases in which the director
does have regard to their interests, but the successful takeover bidder
objects to that because it results in the company losing
money.</div><a name="06071163000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take a
well known example: the decision of Mr. Justice Hoffmann, as he then
was, in the re Welfab Engineers Ltd case, in which the liquidator
alleged that, faced with the prospect of insolvency, the directors
wrongly sold the business for less than the maximum amount that it
might have fetched at auction. The directors did that because they
thought that the highest bidder wanted only the company&#146;s
property and would asset strip the business. They preferred the second
bidder who promised to carry on the company&#146;s business and
preserve employees&#146; jobs. The liquidator claimed that that
decision caused a loss to the company.</div>
<a name="06071163000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The court&#151;Mr. Justice
Hoffmann&#151;agreed with the directors on the grounds that section
309 allows directors to have regard to the interests of the employees
and therefore that the decision was not illegitimate. That is why the
clause is a protective deregulatory clause. In effect, it extends the
protection offered by section 309 in those circumstances from simply
directors who have regard to the interests of employees to a whole host
of other circumstances, including the environment. So a director who
has regard to the interests of the environment, but in doing so gives
rise to a loss to the company, can say to the liquidator or the
successful takeover bidder, &#147;I acted legitimately and you cannot
sue me personally in order to recover that
loss.&#148;</div><a name="06071163000345"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="06071163000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000441"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I have been listening carefully and avidly to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s detailed comments and legal analysis. Does
he accept that section 309 said that the company should have regard to
the interests of its members and employees, and almost puts them on a
level playing field, whereas clause 158 emphasises the regard to the
success of the company, and then to certain subservient interests? Does
he accept that there is a difference, and that it might lead to
different interpretations, such as the one at which Lord Hoffmann
arrived in the case to which the hon. Gentleman
alluded?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 572</div><a name="06071163000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000442"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not think so. I would have to go back to the
details of the case, but my memory is that the judge assumed that there
was an overriding duty to the members, but thought that the clause
allowed some regard to the interests of employees. In effect, that is
what clause 158 says. There is no risk in a clause 158 case, if we may
call it that, of any variation from the approach that Mr. Justice
Hoffmann, as he then was, took in the Welfab case. The approach would
be the same, because Parliament&#146;s intention seems to be to
create that protection.</div>
<a name="06071163000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is deregulatory. It
reduces the amount of legal pressure on directors. This is an empirical
matter and a question of how we judge the risks. On one hand, there is
the remote risk that breaches of clause 158 would be used as the basis
of legal action. I cannot see how that would happen. I suppose that in
unusual circumstances it might, but the risk is remote. On the other
hand, there is the risk of an action by a liquidator, acting on behalf
of creditors whose interests are short-term, against directors who have
acted on behalf of employees and the environment for the long term.
That is a greater risk and that is why, on balance, the clause is
deregulatory.</div>
<a name="06071163000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000443"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the
irrelevance of the clause means that we should not be bothered about
it?</div>
<a name="06071163000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000444"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Certainly not. It is legitimate for company law
to offer directors that protection. The issue comes down to what we
think is the purpose of company law. Some people say that it should
maximise the value of companies for shareholders. However, shareholder
value is only an interest. The question is whether shareholder value
maximises aggregate social welfare&#151;whether it is for the good of
everyone.</div> <a name="06071163000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">My mentor
on such matters, Professor Henry Hansmann of Yale law school, provides
an example. He said that corporate law would be very unattractive if it
allowed shareholders to gain $1 for every $2 that they took from
creditors and employees. It would not maximise aggregate social
welfare. The question is whether the provisions help to maximise
aggregate social welfare as opposed to mere shareholder
value.</div> <a name="06071163000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The notion of
enlightened shareholder value is admittedly a bit of a fudge, but it
provides a useful exercise in making company law take account of the
interests of society as a whole, not just the short-term interests of
creditors and shareholders. I say creditors first, because in practice,
in terms of who is suing whom, creditors, not shareholders, sue through
the liquidated and insolvent company.</div>
<a name="06071163000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000445"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Surely the administrators, not the creditors,
would sue in the name of the company.</div>
<a name="06071163000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000446"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Yes, but on behalf of the creditors the duty of
the administrators and liquidators is to collect all the money that is
owed to the company. Their purpose is to further the interests of
creditors, and that is why in reality, we talk about creditors, rather
than shareholders, against directors.</div>
<a name="06071163000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that that analysis
means that I have a slightly paradoxical view of some of the
amendments. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 573</div>Amendment No. 40, for example, which deals with small companies, and
amendment No. 42, which has a similar effect, would not help directors
of small companies. They would do quite the opposite and expose them to
more liability than the directors of large companies, because the
welfare defence against an action by a liquidator would not be
available. Directors of small companies seem to me to be just as
entitled as those of large companies to claim the benefit of the clause
158 defence, as I see it, of acting in the interests of the
environment, against a liquidator, a takeover bid or, in the case of a
small company, a buyer. On the other hand, amendment No. 39 and similar
amendments that would make the test more obviously subjective would
help directors. They would help them to claim the benefit of the
protection of clause 158 more easily. For that reason they are better
worth considering.</div> <a name="06071163000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
to amendment No. 300, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Bedford,
I have some basic sympathy with what he said, but it should be clear
from what I said about how the rule works in this context that the
amendment will not add much one way or the other to the protection
offered to directors. I suppose that a duty would make it more obvious
to a liquidator that perhaps no attempt should even be made to sue in
the circumstances. There might be an advantage in that, as opposed to
the formulation &#147;have regard&#148;. There are, however,
disadvantages to the precise wording.</div>
<a name="06071163000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">One disadvantage is that the
amendment seems to set up the possibility of a conflict of duties. It
is possible to &#147;have regard&#148; to contradictory things. It
is a quite simple mental process to think about one thing, think about
another, and reach a conclusion about the balance between the two.
However, asking someone to &#147;endeavour to&#148; do two things
that point in opposite directions seems to me closer to asking the
impossible. </div><a name="06071163000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
worried by one possible example of contradictions between duties in the
amendment, and that is a conflict between employees&#146; interests
and those of the environment. Idealistically we might all wish that
that was not a problem, and that in all circumstances the interests of
employees could be in line with those of the environment. I am afraid
that that is not so. There are jobs in environmentally unfriendly
sectors of the economy that depend on environmentally unfriendly
activities continuing. That sets up a conflict. A conflict of that kind
can be resolved using the formulation &#147;have regard&#148;, but
it is more difficult to resolve it using the formulation
&#147;endeavour
to&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000214"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000447"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> I am not sure that I understand that point. Surely
in endeavouring to do one&#146;s best one does just that, in good
faith, going as far as possible without disturbing the rest of the
balls that one is trying to keep balanced, including the performance of
the company and the interests of
employees.</div><a name="06071163000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000448"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is a possible interpretation, but the hon.
Gentleman spoke about his amendment being more active. That is where
the difficulty comes in; one can do only one thing at a time.</div>
<a name="06071163000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second doubt is only a small
one, and I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman returned to the
matter if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 574</div>he speaks again. The very fact that the word &#147;endeavour&#148;
sets a higher test than the phrase &#147;have regard&#148; might
reduce the protection under the clause. There is a risk, although only
a slight one, that a court might say, &#147;You have not endeavoured,
so you do not get the protection&#148;, whereas perhaps
&#147;having regard&#148; might otherwise have meant that the same
person would get the protection. Since it is harder to endeavour than
to have regard, that might have the paradoxical effect of reducing the
protection.</div><a name="06071163000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
would like some assistance, because I am not entirely clear about the
purpose of the amendments referring to guidelines and would be grateful
for further comment. I have two
questions.</div><a name="06071163000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000449"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Quite simply, the concept is that it would be
better to remain within the existing common law structure and have
non-binding statutory guidelines on how that common law should be
applied in
practice.</div><a name="06071163000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000450"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The amendments refer not to binding or
non-binding or to mandatory or non-mandatory, but to statutory and
non-statutory. I am unclear about the meaning of those words. There is
a bigger problem with &#147;non-statutory&#148;, because there
seems to be an inherent contradiction. Non-statutory guidelines in
statute are, by definition, statutory. I do not understand what that is
about. The amendments should be about something being binding and
mandatory rather than something in a statute. There is a problem
there.</div><a name="06071163000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">To whom are the
guidelines addressed? There are two possibilities and the two speeches
covered one each. One is that they are addressed to the courts, but
they are governmental interpretations of the law. I am not too happy
about that, because the Government should address the courts via
Parliament and not just issue guidelines now and then about what they
think the law should be. That is especially important in company law
where there has been a tradition of putting important rules in an Act
rather than using secondary legislation. Such guidelines would not even
be secondary legislation; it would be tertiary legislation and
legislation by circular. If that is the aim, I have a constitutional
twinge about whether that is the right way to do
it.</div><a name="06071163000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the other hand,
the hon. Member for Huntingdon had a slightly different view: that the
guidelines would be addressed to company directors and would attempt to
describe the existing legal obligations on directors. That seems to be
an attempt at cheap legal advice and undercutting the legal profession.
That has a great deal of merit, but the important question is whether
it would work. Would people read and take notice of it, or would they
go back to lawyers when they got into trouble? Would it in the end have
much practical
effect?</div><a name="06071163000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point
about guidelines is that there is always a temptation to make rules
rather than standards&#151;to make specific detailed rules rather
than vague standards that are clarified later by courts. Sometimes,
that temptation should be given into if it is the right thing to do,
especially when it involves events that happen over and again in
exactly the same way. In 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 575</div>such cases, it is a cheap and efficient solution to tell people in
advance what their rights and obligations are and what the consequences
of not following them would be. However, when there is enormous
variety, enormous differences in circumstances and almost unimaginable
variety of problem cases it is impossible to write such rules and it is
a trap for the unwary because it wastes everyone&#146;s time. People
attempt to write a few rules but in fact they do not help anyone.
Although it is annoying for legislators, in the end the most efficient
and effective thing to do in complicated circumstances is to leave
decisions for the future to the
courts.</div><a name="06071163000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My overall
conclusion is that clause 158 is a protective and deregulatory
provision, which is why I welcome it, and many of the amendments would
have unintended
effects.</div><a name="06071163000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071163000451"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): It is a

him.</div><a name="06071163000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06071163000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
principle is the false and dangerous distinction that the hon.
Gentleman tried to make between a company and its shareholders. I am
sorry if he taught that to his pupils. He was less than logical in
trying to make the entirely spurious distinction between a
company&#146;s directors administering it on behalf of shareholders,
and the shareholders themselves. Five minutes later he said that when a
liquidator or administrator is in charge of a company because its
creditors, rather than its shareholders, have taken it over, that
distinction does not apply. He ignored the role of the administrator or
liquidator and said that it is the creditors who sue. That was
illogical and I hope that he reflects on
it.</div><a name="06071163000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s practical point, he is perfectly right that in
certain cases clause 158 will protect directors who reach a judgment in
good faith and can show the court that they have done so. However,
although he did not seem to think it likely, it is very plausible that
the reverse situation could arise. Directors could be more likely to be
successfully prosecuted as a result of the clause than would otherwise
be the case. Take the case of asbestosis, which resulted in the
liquidation of a large number of companies, particularly in the United
States, including big names such as Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Owens
Corning. There have been a lot of class actions against directors in
the United States as a result of asbestosis. If a provision such as
clause 158 had been in effect at the time, it could have provided a
case against a director accused of having neglected health and safety
by allowing his employees to work with asbestos. Such a case may not so
easily have been made under provisions such as clause 160
alone.</div><a name="06071163000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000452"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I understand why directors might have such a
fear, but I believe that it is unfounded. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 576</div>actions against directors would be dealt with under general, court law.
The duties set out in the Bill are specifically stated in clause 156 to
be duties to a company, which means that the circumstances that were
mentioned would not
arise.</div><a name="06071163000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000453"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> Of course they are duties to a company, but the
suit made by shareholders would be that the company had lost money or
gone into liquidation because a director had failed properly to take
into account the interests of employees or the interests of the
environment as specified in clause 158(1)(d). That is the
countervailing
argument.</div><a name="06071163000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on
Second Reading, I approve of the clause, which is a good piece of law.
Like any good law, it will protect those who, in good faith, go about
their business and try to do a good job from malicious or vexatious
prosecution, but it will open the possibility of legal sanctions when
people default on their duties and obligations in a marked way. That is
what law should do and what the clause will
do.</div><a name="06071163000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I greatly admire
the enormous amount of work that my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon has put into the Bill. It has been extremely impressive and
throughout our debates he has made good and pertinent suggestions. It
was therefore with great regret that, when we reached clause 158, I
found myself parting company with him. He is not on entirely the right
rails. He described the duties of directors set out in the clause as
&#147;seemingly random and arbitrary.&#148; They seem to me a good
distillation of the essential duties of directors. He then lost me
completely by saying that in common law there are 650 duties owed by
directors to their companies. He argued that it would be much better to
leave a situation in which nobody knows which of the 650 duties should
be performed. We probably do not know what the 650 duties
are&#151;probably no human being could comprehend 650 duties at any
one time. If there was no guidance at all on the hierarchy of those
duties, the law would have no influence on company directors in the
pursuit of their obligations. There would be no certainty about what
conclusion the court might come to if it were asked to decide whether a
director had performed his
duty.</div><a name="06071163000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000454"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend slightly misses my point. I am
not saying that any of the duties are not important in themselves. The
question I would ask is why choose six as opposed to any of the
others.</div><a name="06071163000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000455"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> It seems to me that the six have been well chosen.
As someone who has sat on the board of companies on a number of
occasions and does so now, if I were presented with a blank sheet of
paper and asked to spend an hour or two setting out what I thought were
the essential duties of directors, I would pretty much come up with
this list.</div> <a name="06071163000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
start off by saying that the fundamental duty of a director is to
contribute to the success of the company in the interests of its
members and shareholders. A director works for the shareholders and has
a fiduciary obligation to them. That is an absolute duty. In conducting
that duty, he must have regard to a large number of matters, which
could run 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 577</div>to hundreds or even thousands. They cannot all be codified or predicted
in advance. The Bill sets out 11 duties, six in this clause and five in
the subsequent five clauses. That is a good distillation and good
guidance. What is most important is that the clauses establish clarity.
That is a prime purpose of good legislation.</div>
<a name="06071163000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said perhaps slightly
mischievously on Second Reading, there is possibly one profession in
this country that does not necessarily have an interest in removing
legal uncertainty and creating legal clarity, but we should not be
influenced by that any more than we should be influenced by any other
special interest group that may lobby us from time to time. We need to
maintain a proper degree of scepticism about all the lobbying that we
get from different quarters. As it says in clause 159, directors need
&#147;to exercise independent judgment&#148;, which is also what we
are supposed to do in
Committee.</div><a name="06071163000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend gave a number of examples of duties that are not mentioned in
the Bill. I listened attentively to those with my mind as open as
possible to persuasion. However, I was persuaded that my original
stance, as set out on Second Reading, was correct. Among the duties he
cited, which are not specifically mentioned, are the duty to prepare
accurate accounts and the duty not to make secret profits. If accurate
accounts are prepared, there obviously cannot be secret profits. The
obligation to produce accurate accounts is elsewhere in the Bill. The
obligation not to go in for false accounting is a general provision of
the law. Anybody, not just a director, but an accountant, a manager, a
banker or anyone else who prepares false accounts, is rightly subject
to the full sanction of the law.</div>
<a name="06071163000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I am being helpful
to my hon. Friend, but it does not seem to me that the clause should
concern itself with the duties that all citizens have. There would be
terrible confusion if we started including in the list of 11 the 650
duties of directors, which are duties that apply to all
citizens.</div> <a name="06071163000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend mentioned health and safety and competition law obligations.
Those are obligations in statute law and the regulations that have been
made within the ambit of statute law. They apply to everybody, not just
directors. Equally, duties to comply with undertakings is clearly an
obligation that everyone who is a party to an undertaking has. There is
nothing special about directors in that case. It does not need to be
set out in great
detail.</div><a name="06071163000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty to
consider minority shareholders, which my hon. Friend said is important
and fundamental, is well covered by subsection
(1)(f):</div><a name="06071163000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to act
fairly as between members of the company.&#148;</div>
<a name="06071163000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a good protection against any
suggestion that a director should give greater weight to the interests
of a majority of shareholders. It is extremely dangerous when directors
who are connected to a majority shareholder are tempted to look to the
interests of that shareholder rather than to those of the totality and
generality of shareholders. Of course, all directors are under an
obligation at all times to consider the totality of their
shareholders&#146; interests and to ensure that everybody&#151;even
the smallest shareholder&#151;is treated entirely fairly and equally,
and it is important that that is in the Bill. However, we should not go
down the road 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 578</div>of saying that there should be 650 duties that directors must follow.
That would produce anarchy and chaos. There would be a lack of legal
certainty and it would not be good law-making. Instead, we should face
up to the challenge of seeing whether we can distil directors&#146;
essential duties into one clause, and that has been done rather well on
this occasion.</div> <a name="06071163000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
also slightly surprised when my hon. Friend said that he wanted
non-statutory guidance. Since I have been in the House, I have heard
official spokesmen for the Conservative party say over and over
again&#151;indeed, I have said it myself as an official spokesman for
my party&#151;that any obligations or constraints that we place on
the citizen through the law should be made explicit in the relevant
Bill, debated explicitly by Parliament and faced up to, so that any
citizen who reads that Bill will know exactly what his or her
obligations are.</div>
<a name="06071163000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Non-statutory guidance is a
very regrettable halfway house. It is not part of the law of the land,
and nobody is under a legal obligation to follow it, because, by
definition, it is non-statutory. Would a court take it into account in
practice? Nobody knows. Once again, there is a great area of legal
uncertainty. Perhaps some courts would say, &#147;But Mr. Davies, you
should have had regard to the non-statutory guidance.&#148; Other
courts might take a much stricter view and say, &#147;We are in the
business of enforcing the law of the land, and it is perfectly
reasonable for Mr. Davies not to take account of non-statutory
guidance. If Parliament had meant it to be part of the law of the land,
it would have said so and put it in the Act.&#148; Non-statutory
guidance is not a good way of creating obligations on the citizen, and
I do not agree that we want it in this case. Indeed, we do not want it
all. What we want are clear, general principles that are set out in as
unambiguous a way as possible, and that is what we have. Inevitably,
the courts will continue with jurisprudence and will add to the common
law, but we want to provide the minimum scope for that by giving
guidance that is as clear, authoritative and unambiguous as
possible.</div> <a name="06071163000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, my
hon. Friend said that conflicts could arise between the different
obligations. He mentioned a case in which a firm might need to sack
employees to survive, and that is, indeed, sometimes the case. However,
his remark led me to reread the clause, and the fundamental duties are
quite clear. The director must, &#147;in good faith&#148;, do what
is</div> <a name="06071163000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;most likely to
promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a
whole&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06071163000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other
words, for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole. He must also
have regard to the other considerations. It would therefore be a full
defence for the director to say&#151;indeed, this is what I would say
as a director&#151;&#147;My job is to maximise the return for the
shareholders and shareholder value. Of course, I took into account
other considerations and looked at other desirable objectives, such as
giving people a job for life, but it was not possible to reconcile
those with the obligation to maintain the success of the company.
Indeed, the company might have gone down the tubes if I had not fired
people, which, regrettably, is what I had to do. Therefore, I did think
about the matter and I decided that, on balance, to carry out my duties
I had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 579</div>to take the regrettable decision to make some redundancies.&#148; The
Bill provides entirely for that process.</div>
<a name="06071163000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend&#146;s
criticism would have been very valid not against the Bill, but against
the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bedford. As the hon. Member
for Cambridge said, the hon. Member for Bedford introduced his
amendment very charmingly and lucidly, and I hope that he puts it to a
vote because, as he rightly said, a lot of people are riding on it and
anxiously hoping that it will become part of the law of the land. If it
is put to a vote, however, I hope emphatically that it is defeated,
because including it would be a bad move. The amendment would be open
to the exact criticism that my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon
rightly made&#151;that we would have potential conflict and it would
be unclear how it would necessarily be
resolved.</div><a name="06071163000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06071163000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take a
slightly stronger view than the hon. Member for Cambridge about the
language that the hon. Member for Bedford has used and the word
&#147;endeavour&#148;. It could normally be interpreted as
requiring some effort to be made in a direction. For example, &#147;I
endeavour to swim the channel&#148; means not that I thought about
it, but that I got into the water and started out. In my case, I would
not get very far, but I might at least claim that I had endeavoured
after I had done 50 yd, given up and got into the first boat that came
along. It would be wrong to impose on directors the obligation to make
an effort in directions that might be contradictory. It would be a bad
day&#146;s work if we included such a provision in the law of the
land.</div> <a name="06071163000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am glad that
the hon. Member for Bedford spoke to his amendment, because, as we all
know, many people outside this House have been expecting us at least to
take into account and to have regard to this point of view. We have an
obligation to say explicitly why we do not accept the arguments that
have been put to us in that
context.</div><a name="06071163000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Huntingdon quoted a lot of letters from law
firms&#151;I think that they were letters, although they might have
been legal opinions provided by distinguished City law firms. It is
important for us always to remember when we are dealing with such
things that at least 50 per cent. of legal opinions are by definition
wrong. Every point of law that has ever been in dispute has two
contradictory sets of legal opinions about it. One says, &#147;My
client has a good case&#148; and the other says, &#147;Your client
has a very bad case, and my client has a good case.&#148; Some
opinions might be worse than wrong; they might be complete
rubbish&#151;although they will always be expensive rubbish. A
reasonable modicum of scepticism about legal opinions is in
order.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000456"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To clarify, if all the opinions say the same
thing, 50 per cent. of those saying the same thing are still
right.</div>
<a name="06071163000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000457"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I guarantee to my hon. Friend that if I were a
very rich man, which I am not, I could procure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 580</div>an equal number of opinions saying exactly the opposite to the opinions
that he has procured. We all know how that game can be played. There is
a perfectly understandable interest of a particular profession in
selling its services, which is respectable. It is no less respectable
than the desire of ice cream manufacturers to sell ice cream. The fact
is that the legal profession has an interest in selling its advice. It
does not have an interest in clarifying the law or in reducing the
scope for jurisprudence and legal uncertainty.</div>
<a name="06071163000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must emphasise to my hon.
Friend that if there are already 650 possible duties of a director, it
would be El Dorado for company lawyers. They are probably the pupils of
the hon. Member for Cambridge, who I am sure is a kindly tutor and
professor who takes an interest in their careers, and no doubt he has
some mixed feelings on this subject. I have no interest to declare on
this matter, except to say that as a director, as declared in the
Resister of Members&#146; Interests, I do not wish to incur excessive
or unreasonable legal costs for my shareholders or excessive insurance
premiums for having in future to insure against directors&#146;
liability. </div><a name="06071163000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now
to my amendment No. 297, about which hon. Members will be expecting me
to say a few words. I was not going to say much about it, because I do
not intend to put it to the vote. I put it forward for discussion,
because I hoped it would be helpful. A possible criticism of even the
good piece of work in clause 158 might be that some of the duties as
set out are not sufficiently closely defined. They could be considered
too extensive, giving rise to the kind of legal uncertainty that I want
to avoid. That is particularly so in the case of the
environment.</div><a name="06071163000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In most
of the clause, the duties are clear and there is not much scope for
difficulties. However, subsection (1)(d) refers
to</div><a name="06071163000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the impact of the
company&#146;s operations on the community and the
environment&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Community&#148;
is specific and refers to something that one can see or
hear&#151;companies making a lot of noise or smells, or blocking the
traffic. Local people know about such activities and it is reasonably
clear what is
meant.</div><a name="06071163000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
&#147;environment&#148; is a concept of almost limitless bounds, as
we know. Is it conceivable that a director could be accused of not
having taken into account the potential impact of a small business in
Lincolnshire or Liverpool on the Arctic ice cap? It may be said that
some molecules from the company&#146;s emissions had an effect on the
Arctic ice cap or contributed to creating windstorms in the Sahara. It
opens up an indefinable limit to the definition, which is
undesirable.</div><a name="06071163000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
I tabled a probing amendment that would leave out &#147;and the
environment&#148; in order to get reactions from members of the
Committee and to ensure that people focused on the possibility, but I
do not wish to press it further. I would be happy to vote for the
clause as it is if it is put to a vote&#151;perhaps it will not be. I
acknowledge that it is a good piece of work, and I recognise that there
is a certain risk in saying that in my profession in case it all turns
out badly and ends in tears. Given the difficult choices before
us&#151;choices were presented by the hon. Member for Bedford and by
my hon. Friend the Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 581</div>Huntingdon&#151;the clause is the right one to make. Corporate Britain
should be able to live with it comfortably for the foreseeable
future.</div><a name="06071163000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000458"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> We have had a wide-ranging and long debate this
morning. I agree very much with the hon. Member for Grantham
and Stamford (Mr. Davies). His comments on the clause involved
a huge amount of common sense, and I am grateful to him for
that.</div><a name="06071163000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the clause is to introduce certainty and transparency to company law so
that directors know what is expected of them when they do their job. In
the long gestation&#151;eight years&#151;between the
Government&#146;s introducing the company law review and the
Committee&#146;s consideration of the clause this morning, the issue
of certainty has been uppermost in the minds of many who contributed to
the debate.</div><a name="06071163000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pressed
the hon. Member for Huntingdon on his concern about provisions, because
we set out clearly what we intend&#151;even I as a non-lawyer
understand it. The clause
states:</div><a name="06071163000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith,
would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the
benefit of its members as a
whole&#148;.</div><a name="06071163000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">We put two
clauses together in another place, so that the provisions would not
remain the overriding priority for and purpose of directors, in order
to say precisely what the hon. Gentleman feared we were not saying: the
range of other factors are secondary to the overriding and overarching
purpose of the interests of the company. That is why we had the debate
with my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford as to whether there should
be competing duties on directors or one overriding
duty.</div><a name="06071163000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our other
purpose was to introduce the concept of enlightened shareholder value
as part of the business of companies, those who work in them
and those who have responsibilities to them and to their shareholders.
We want to introduce into companies a long-term investment culture.
That is the ethos of the clause.</div>
<a name="06071163000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the one hand, we have been
accused of the heavy hand of regulation by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon, which he says might kill off companies, and on the other,
my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford thinks that we are undertaking
too voluntary an approach and destroying our environment. In the
middle, the hon. Member for Cambridge, to whom I always enjoy
listening, is telling me that I am deregulating, when I thought that I
was regulating. I am grateful to him for that contribution and for the
fact that he believes, as I do, that clause 158 begins to encapsulate
the societal impact and benefit of companies&#146; endeavours in
order to ensure that their narrow concerns protect also the wider
ones.</div><a name="06071163000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000459"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am finding the Minister&#146;s comments
interesting and, in some ways, quite helpful, but I wonder whether she
could deal with the apparent dichotomy in her comments. She says that
the clause seeks to codify and bring together existing common law
duties, but suggests at the same time that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 582</div>something new is being added. That confusion is the cause of some of the
issues raised in this morning&#146;s
debate.</div><a name="06071163000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000460"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The clause does not codify all the common law
duties, as pointed out by the hon. Member for Huntingdon in his long
contribution on the 650 or so directors&#146; duties&#151;I did not
realise that we had got to 650. The clause does codify and bring into
law for the first time duties around corporate social responsibility. I
do not run away from that; it is a deliberate act by the
Government.</div><a name="06071163000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is at
the heart of the Bill. For me, one of the key issues is how we marry
the commercial success of individual companies and the resulting
benefits to, and growth and prosperity of, the economy, with
sustainability and social justice. Again, for me, that is a good
example of what lies at the core of what this Labour Government are
about: trying to see those two issues as part of a single whole and,
despite uncomfortable tensions, trying to integrate them as consistent
principles, rather than allow them to be competing ambitions with no
commonality.</div>
<a name="06071163000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000461"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> What the Minister has said is interesting. I
think that she is making it clear that actually that is codification
and that effectively the principle of enlightened shareholder value,
which was talked about separately, is in essence the codification of
statutory duties, rather than the introduction of brand new or extended
provisions. Effectively, we are bringing together those issues and
showing that they are
relevant.</div><a name="06071163000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071163000462"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Well, perhaps we agree; I pause to see whether that
is the case.</div> <a name="06071163000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
wanted to say was that, for me, the best businesses already do what the
legislation provides for&#151;I think that a number of Members have
said that. It will bring the behaviour of all businesses up to the
behaviour of the best. Our view&#151;I think that it is shared across
parties, and certainly by individual Members&#151;is that businesses
do best when they can operate on a clear, well defined and level
playing field and when they are not placed at a commercial disadvantage
by doing the right thing and promoting corporate social responsibility
objectives. Again, that is the purpose of the
provisions.</div><a name="06071163000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to
say to Opposition Members that that matter was discussed at length in
the House of Lords, and amendments were passed to clarify the primary
responsibilities of directors and the clause in a whole range of ways.
I shall go into the detail so that we are all clear: at the end of that
very long debate, the Opposition said that clause 158, as amended, is
the right way
forward.</div><a name="06071163000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
