<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I think that I was getting into my stride about the Government's lack of vision about the privatisation, about the excessive detail of the clause and about fees and costs. However, I do not wish to detain the Committee with too many flights of fancy about what might have been. We should now hear from the Minister a detailed account of the fees and costs of the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): We have had a most interesting debate, with touching contributions—I was touched to have been mentioned by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape). We should be grateful to his consultants, one permanent result of which is the splendid sartorial elegance that he displays every time he appears in Committee, and his fine moustache, which is a clever third way compromise between the new Labour ban on beards and his previous hirsute appearance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): Alas, it is merely a legacy of the 1960s.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> It is very nice to look at.
<P>
I would also like to thank the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) for his interesting contribution, which was, to me, not having worked as an accountant in my previous profession, illuminating.
<P>
What has been flushed out of the debate is where the idea came from; I have gleaned from my colleagues, that in previous privatisations, state entities were placed in the private sector. As I understood it, the Government of the time said that they wanted a complete, clear transfer of all the assets and shares to a private company, and they gave clear directions to the professionals involved.
<P>
With this privatisation, we seem to have a bit of a muddle and a botch, which may be contributing to the extra costs of £35 million. It is a more expensive and complicated solution than a straightforward privatisation. Will the Minister reply to my chicken and egg question? Did he give a clear brief to his professionals? Did he give them a clear target for which to aim; or, as the Opposition suspect, did he say that there were various political obstacles to overcome and ask them to find a way through that muddy minefield, promising to bear the cost if it were unnecessarily complicated?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> This has been a curious debate, which has made up in length what it lacked in acumen.
<P>
I shall respond to some of the key points that were made. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) optimistically hoped that he would win the support of the Tory Opposition for his independent publicly owned company. He continues to struggle with that concept. I suppose that Liberal Democrats are characteristically not just woolly-minded and woolly-hatted, but full of optimism—they believe in the perfectibility of man. We would like to believe that improvement is possible, but experience teaches us that that is, on the whole, unlikely. I wish the hon. Gentleman well, but do not hold out much hope for his project.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale was also engaging in one of those classic Liberal Democrat activities—trying to please all sides simultaneously. His mask slipped for a moment and he told us that his former colleagues from his time in business would be out to make as much as they could of the privatisation. As soon as he was reminded that he might want to join them if future election prospects were not quite as good as he would have hoped, he immediately moved back to a position of expressing great confidence in their propriety, integrity and sense of value for money. I enjoyed that very much.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) extraordinarily referred to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East as Dr. Faustus. I am not an expert on images of Dr. Faustus, but I read at least two versions of the myth in my youth and recollect that Faustus was a tortured, academic character who was locked away in a garret, led a pretty miserable life and occasionally hankered after beautiful women. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Ah!''] I shall not fall into the trap of commenting on whether any of those characteristics fit my hon. Friend, but they are not ones that I would first choose for him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> We are on a literary venture, so I ask if my hon. Friend the Minister recollects that Thomas Mann, who wrote a version of the Faustus myth, also wrote ``The Confessions of Felix Krull''? I think that its subtitle was ``Confessions of a Confidence Trickster'', which might apply to the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good riposte, and I shall not be tempted to mention another version of Faustus written by Christopher Marlowe, who almost became a resident of my constituency. His life ended in a tavern brawl there 400 years ago, and he is buried in a local church.
<P>
The key issue raised by many hon. Members concerned the history of the public-private partnership and how the Government set about the process. The hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) asked on several occasions what approach the Government had taken and about the various costs that have been and will be incurred. I shall try to answer him. The allegations about the unnecessary complexity of the procedures have also been highlighted, so I shall try to touch on them.
<P>
The Government set the broad objective for the future of NATS after a careful review. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) led on this issue at that time, and can probably better inform the Committee than I can of the thinking in the early months of this Parliament that led to the conclusion that we should proceed with the PPP that is now the basis of the legislation. The details were finalised after full consultation and with proper and detailed advice from experts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is not for me to defend the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh, but I think that it is wrong not to mention the fact that, by the time of finalisation, he had relinquished responsibility for the conclusions of that consultation. It would be unfair to suggest that he somehow compromised his position. He has been robustly consistent in his view, and I would not want the Minister to mislead the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was not misleading the Committee, but suggesting that my right hon. Friend is probably in a better position than I am to answer questions about the discussions that took place in the early months, when the move towards the current structure of the PPP was agreed.
<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): I shall confine myself to one point. It was significant that the announcement that we would go into a consultation was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the comprehensive spending review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My right hon. Friend rightly highlights the fact that we take a joined-up approach to government. We want to ensure that the whole venture is taken forward in a prudent way so as to ensure a good economic outcome that will guarantee the best possible future for our air traffic control system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman missed the point of the intervention of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh. There was a row and his Department was bounced into the botched privatisation scheme by the Treasury. We have it on the record that the scheme was hatched by the private finance initiative team in the Treasury with which the then Ministers in the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions had no sympathy whatever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not accept that for a moment, any more than I accept the hon. Gentleman's earlier disparaging remarks about the ability of politicians and civil servants to put policy into practice. His remarks may have been based on his experience at the time of the Railways Act 1993 under the previous Government. If any Opposition Members wish to challenge us about the complexity and phrasing of the legislation, I shall be only to happy to refer them to the relevant passages of that Act, which also included provision for transfer schemes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Where in that Act is the power of the Secretary of State to make a transfer scheme? Where in that Act does it provide for the assets of British Railways or its subsidiaries to be transferred to the Secretary of State? What was left was the power of the British Railways Board to make the scheme—a more simple scheme than the scheme to which the Bill refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman always shifts his ground quickly when he realises that he is on weak ground. He referred earlier to the complexity of legislation, which, as he can conclude from the Railways Act 1993, was unsatisfactory. Given the provisions under clause 84 and subsequent clauses in that Act, to accuse the Government of producing unduly complex legislation and transfer schemes is the pot calling the kettle black. We shall not take any criticism from the Opposition on the complexity of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex drew too wide a conclusion. I was saying that the decision to go for a PPP was driven by financial considerations rather than what was best for air traffic control. It could hardly have been for the capital receipts, because the Government were not prepared to allow it to borrow within the public sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My right hon. Friend has made known his view on the motive behind the original proposals but, as I have assured the Committee several times, the Government's objective is to ensure the best possible future for air traffic control systems. The Bill will enable access to private capital, which we believe is important for the development of the service. It will ensure a framework that separates out regulation from the operational function, which everyone agrees is sensible and right, and which the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs warmly endorses. It will ensure a proper framework of controls to guarantee the highest standards on safety, which is what we insist on at all times.
<P>
I undertook to say a little about financial arrangements. As with everything else, we have tried to give the Committee as much information as possible to assist it in its consideration. In the spirit of openness, we gave an estimate of £35 million in the explanatory notes. I hope that the Committee welcomes that. It is, of course, only an estimate, and it is certainly not a target for expenditure. People might have thought that we were seeking to reach that level of expenditure. On the contrary, the Government are determined to keep the costs to a minimum, while securing the advice and professional assistance that is crucial to the success of this extremely important and complex project.
<P>
Our current estimate is that total external advisory costs incurred on the National Air Traffic Services public-private partnership will be of the order of £20 million. To date, the Department has spent slightly more than £6 million on financial, legal and property advice, and we envisage spending up to an additional £7 million on similar advisory costs and technical advisers for the remainder of the project.
<P>
We understand that the Civil Aviation Authority is expecting to spend £1.2 million on advisers, and that NATS is expecting to spend £5.4 million in total. Not all that expenditure will be a charge on the taxpayer. Some will be properly recoverable as CAA and NATS user charges. We understand that the CAA and NATS currently expect to spend up to £14 million on reorganisation, which will include the cost of—

<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Yes, I welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee, and am happy to give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Minister will not be surprised to learn that I shall not ask him a complicated question, because I have only just arrived on the Committee. It is a great pleasure to serve on a Committee over which you preside, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The Minister says that some charges will be passed to users. He owes it to users to tell them how much of the bill for this public-private partnership they will have to pick up. Perhaps he could be slightly more explicit. As the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) knows, I am a private pilot myself. On behalf of private pilots I am anxious to know how much they may be required to pick up in fees from the CAA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am delighted to welcome the hon. Gentleman to the Committee, and we look forward to having the benefit of his expertise. He did not have the good fortune to be here earlier, when we debated matters relating to charging, especially charges that might be levied on small-scale users such as private independent flyers, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave a clear undertaking that no change was envisaged in the current arrangements. There is no question of any special charges or levies being raised as a result of the proposal. As the hon., Gentleman will know, the services provided by NATS and the CAA inevitably involve some cost recovery. We propose a reorganisation that will be designed to ensure that the most effective service is provided for the users of air traffic control systems. An element of cost recovery will be involved, but the particular processes used will not result in an additional burden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am extremely grateful for that answer, and acknowledge that I have not yet been able to catch up on my reading of the Committee's proceedings. The Minister said that the costs will be passed on. What will be the impact of the charges paid to the various consultants and advisers on airlines and other users of the services of the CAA and, in particular, NATS?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I tried to distinguish between costs spent on advisers and other costs incurred in the development of the systems necessary to operate the service. We are separating the CAA from NATS, and ensuring a proper separation of the regulatory and the operational functions. Computer and other systems will need to be changed to accommodate that, and all those costs will be incurred, too.
<P>
A distinction has been made between the costs of advisers and operational costs. I have tried to give some idea of the order of magnitude, but I had to preface my remarks with the comment that the figures are only estimates, not targets for expenditure. We shall do our utmost to keep expenditure to the minimum compatible with obtaining the best possible advice to ensure that the proposal is implemented in the best possible way. That is right, and I am sure that all hon. Members would welcome an arrangement under which we ensure that the procedures for air traffic control are properly constituted so that in future they deliver a service that is not only cost-effective but of the highest quality that we can rightly expect.
<P>
I am happy to write to the Committee in due course as the picture develops in order to bring hon. Members up to date with further changes. However, I believe that I have given a reasonable feel for how expenditure is developing, and I put it to Opposition Members—who seem more interested in having a private conversation than in my response to their questions—that the expenditure is extremely small in comparison with the expenditure incurred in the privatisation of the railways, for which they were responsible. If we have any lectures from them on the subject, we shall not hesitate to remind them and the world at large of the comparative figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Have I delivered any lectures?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman certainly taunted my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East by mentioning a figure whom I described as a tortured academic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> There is distinction between a lecture and a taunt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There is also a distinction between a lecture and a torture. I have experienced little of the latter on this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): The Committee is here to examine the Bill, to make it better and to save public money, if we can. Endlessly to say that the Conservatives made a mess of this Bill or that Bill when we were in power is a negative attitude: such petty point scoring infuriates the public. The Opposition's job is to test the Minister so that we have an efficient and economic Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I will take no lessons from the hon. Gentleman on this matter. I have given a full and detailed statement, far fuller and franker than Ministers normally give in Committee. I simply made the observation that our record on the subject will stand a fair comparison with that of the previous Government. He may not like that message, but we will not hesitate to pass it to the wider world if the Conservatives draw any inappropriate conclusions about how we proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> The Minister's generosity in giving way augurs well for the future conduct of the Committee. Is he telling us that the cost of some of the advisers in connection with the reorganisation will now be passed to Sir Richard Branson and Mr. Ayling and others whose companies have use of the services, or will it be recovered at the end of the proceedings when the entity is sold and the proceeds of sale are secured? Will the charges be recovered in the latter way rather than as an immediate cost to the operators of the system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has repeated the question that he asked earlier, so let me repeat the answer and hope that I will be more successful in convincing him. The total expenditure involves a range of items including fees to consultants and advisers and changes to administrative and operational systems to accomplish the separation between bodies. Some of that will involve expenditure that is properly recoverable in the normal course of events, in the same way as investment by NATS is recoverable from fees charged to users in other respects. I said clearly, and I repeat, that there is no question of users being forced to bear unusual and exceptional costs arising from the process. Only the charges that would properly and usually be made against users will be made against them rather than being absorbed by the Government or other bodies.
<P>
I was also asked whether the Government have a merchant bank. We do, but it is on a retainer, not a percentage agreement, so I hope that the anxiety expressed by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale is allayed.
<P>
I have dealt with all the questions that I was asked on financial issues, so I now come to the point in hand—the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Bath. I hope that you will pleased, Mr. Gale, to hear that I shall not cover them in detail. As the hon. Gentleman probably realises, they would make the transfer scheme provisions utterly meaningless.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Oh dear!
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> They would. The amendments would remove large chunks of the provision. I understand why the hon. Gentleman wants to do that. He does not support our proposals for a public-private partnership. He has an alternative vision. The Bill is designed to carry forward a public-private partnership, and it would be wrong to accept amendments that made it totally impracticable. The flexibility to transfer property, rights and liabilities to or from the various parties involved in the reorganisation of the industry is an important feature of the system. A reduction in its flexibility, which would be the result of the amendments, would severely hamper the operation of the transfer scheme provisions. That would be of benefit to no one, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister described the Committee's debate as curious. It has certainly been an entertaining, wide-ranging and informative debate, but it has focused strictly on the amendments and specifically amendment No. 83. Even you, Mr. Gale, look puzzled; you would have ruled out of order any contribution that had not been so focused.
<P>
Nevertheless, the fact that it was wide ranging enabled us to discover quite a lot about the previous business experiences of various members of the Committee. We even learned that the moustache currently worn by the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East is a historical piece from the 1960s. We discovered also that the Minister has at long last come to terms with Liberal democracy and our belief that there is such a thing as the perfectibility of man. That implies great optimism for the future—even optimism that the Minister will come to realise that his proposals for the future of NATS are not the best way forward and that an alternative would be preferable.
<P>
However, the Minister deserves a great deal of credit. I am sure that you, Mr. Gale, like members of the Committee, will have dipped into those wonderful stories ``Yes, Minister'' and ``Yes, Prime Minister''. I recall that in one episode of ``Yes, Prime Minister'' the Prime Minister, James Hacker, seeks to tell his parliamentary private secretary how not to answer questions. He suggests 10 ways in which to avoid answering questions.
<P>
It is to the Minister's eternal credit that he sought to use not a single one of those 10 devices. He has given us some detailed information, not least about how it is estimated—he made it clear that it was an estimate—that the £35 million is likely to be spent. Members should thank the Minister for giving the Committee what he called a real feel for the expenditure. Others might go further and say that it was a full and frank disclosure. We are grateful. My hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale would certainly have been grateful, because it was his universally acclaimed contribution to the debate that led us into that particular field.
<P>
Another issue was raised during the debate—on several occasions. That was the rather boastful approach of the hon. Member for North Essex, who kept pointing out how successful his protégé has been. The right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) is no longer a member of the Committee, but we welcome his replacement. In a few minutes, my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale will be leaving the Room because he has to meet my party leader. I do not know whether he will return. Only time will tell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are getting used to members of the smaller Opposition parties doing anything to imitate their elders and betters.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> One thing that I do not intend to do, when imitating my alleged elders and betters, is to detain the Committee for longer than is necessary. I made it clear that our amendments were tabled in relation to the IPOC proposals. I accept that that is not the current issue before us, but I hope that we shall discuss it again. That is particularly so bearing in mind that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh pointed out all too clearly from his inside knowledge of such affairs that the primary motivation for the Government's plan was financial and not the desire to determine the best future for National Air Traffic Services.
<P>
I spoke to the amendment in the spirit of simplifying the Government's proposals. The Minister will now have to table further amendments to the clause, amendments that we hope will give it greater simplicity. Given that we shall have an opportunity to debate such matters further, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have had two extremely wide debates on the clause. Members of the Committee will have noted that the next group of amendments relate specifically to pension provisions and I do not wish to have to rule anyone out of order for straying from that narrow path.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale that I may have misled the Committee. He has now informed me that his meeting with our leader has been deferred. I hope that the Committee will not draw any undue conclusions from that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am pleased to say that that is a matter over which the Chair has no control.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 358, in page 27, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8A) A scheme must not have an adverse effect on the pension entitlement of past or present employees of any of the undertakings involved in the scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 306, in clause 45, page 29 line 41, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including any liability to any relevant pension fund.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 315, in clause 51, page 33, line 9, after `liabilities', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, including the pension rights of employees whose employment may be subject to transfer under sections 40–47,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> The amendment would ensure that, when a transfer scheme comes into operation, it does not have an adverse effect on the pension entitlement of past or present employees. We are grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Housing and Planning who, with his usual clarity, explained precisely what was involved in the transfer scheme, a point that is fundamental to the pension provision. He said that the transfer would be from the CAA to the Secretaries of State. It will be a transfer within the public sector, after which time the Government will sell off 46 per cent. to a strategic partner and give 5 per cent. to the employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Is it the right hon. Gentleman's understanding then that the transfers under the clause that deals with the issue of shares are included within the meaning of transfer schemes set out in clause 40?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> As usual, the hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. My amendment deals with the transfer scheme in this clause. I am hoping and assuming that, by discussing the pension position, we will get more information from the Government on the pension provision of past, present and future employees as that is the practical issue. I acknowledge the narrow effect of my amendment. It relates simply to that transfer from one public sector body, the CAA, to the Secretary of State. I saw it as an opportunity to raise this issue. In theory, nothing might change—NATS may merely transfer from the CAA to the Secretary of State, with all the employees staying in the same pension fund and being paid the same salaries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is being unnecessarily modest because his amendment would protect the pension arrangements of the employees of the company to whomsoever its operations may be transferred. His amendment would also affect the provisions under clause 47, which is entitled ``Issue of securities'', and is in that part of Chapter II that is headed, ``Ownership of transferee companies'', and would protect the interests of the employees that he is seeking to protect.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm that that is the correct interpretation of the amendment. If the hon. Gentleman is correct, as I hope, then the amendment is more germane than I had thought. We are concerned about the long-term position of these employees. My hon. Friend the Minister said that the principle purpose of the transfer was to obtain a full separation of the regulatory role of the CAA and the service provision role of NATS. At that point I was encouraged. I thought that that was interesting since, if that were the primary role and purpose of the transfer, it would be easier than I had thought to dissuade the Government from going ahead with the subsidiary purpose, namely the public-private partnership.
<P>
However, my hon. Friend the Minister will recall that he indicated, disappointingly, that this transfer could be triggered in law and would be proper only if it was the precursor to the PPP. In other words, the Government could not transfer the operation to the Secretary of State and allow matters to remain as they were, as I had hoped, not merely for years but perhaps even decades. He is saying that, in practice, if the process is triggered the Secretary of State's ownership of this asset will be transitory. It will simply be a case of re-organising, choosing the strategic partner and, no doubt, agreeing terms on which shares will be made available to the staff—I think that I see my hon. Friend nodding his head. That still begs the question as to how long the process might take, but I am not asking my hon. Friend to respond to that now. Interestingly, there will be a period when the NATS is owned directly by the Government, rather than indirectly through the CAA. That will be an interesting period.
<P>
I come to the guts of the matter, which is the pension provision. I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Essex for saying that in his view, which I welcome, the amendment would encompass the position of those employees—those pensioners—after the second transfer, when the strategic partner was in place and there was a new NATS. That would be a company owned partly by the state, partly by the employees and partly by this new strategic partner—this private partner that Ministers have said will have to have complete commercial control to run the company. That accounts for some of our concerns, but it would not be in order to develop those concerns in the debate on this amendment.
<P>
The employees are naturally concerned about their pension position. They are dedicated public servants who play a key role in the aviation industry, an industry that is a great success story. We talk about being a leading player in Europe. We are the leading player in aviation in Europe. We have seen the huge growth in aviation and it is still growing faster than the economy, which is something that we all welcome. There is no question but that NATS is a very important element in that success. Pilots from almost every country in the world pay tribute to our air traffic control system. That is a service provided by these dedicated public servants. We seek an undertaking from the Government that their pension entitlement will not be adversely affected as a consequence of this partial privatisation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): One of the problems with previous privatisations has been the surpluses within pension funds. They will need to be looked at and the funds protected. Companies that have taken over public bodies following privatisations have tried to use surpluses to pay for redundancies or pay increases. That money is intended for employees and those who have retired; it does not belong to the company.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> That is an important point and, as my hon. Friend rightly points out, we have seen this time and time again—not just after privatisations. Even companies wholly in the private sector have sought to make illegitimate use of surpluses. The funds belong to the pensioners; they belong to the fund controlled by the trustees and should not be used for purposes other than pension provision for previous, present and future employees. That is the guts of this.
<P>
I understand—I use these words carefully—that it is envisaged that under the PPP the new NATS employees will still be members of the CAA pension scheme. However, that form of words can be misleading because it is envisaged that their fund will be separate. So although the expression used is that the employees will be part of the CAA pension scheme, there will be a separate pension fund, which the new partly-privatised NATS will pay into. The Minister will correct me if I am running too far ahead, but my understanding is that that is what is being considered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes an extremely important point that it is vital for the Committee to understand. If I were an employee and I was told that I would be in the CAA pension fund, I would assume that basically nothing would change and that my pension would eventually be paid from something called the CAA pension fund. That would be the same pension fund as the one for those who remain in the CAA's employment. Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that that is not so, and that if employees have understood that to be so they have at best misunderstood, and at worst been misled?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am certainly not suggesting that the Government have deliberately misled—trade union representatives—far from it. Constructive discussions on a range of issues have taken place, including those relating to safety. However, I understand that after the partial privatisation the new NATS employees will have a different pension fund from the CAA fund. The CAA will still exist, as will its staff. I understand that the CAA will have a pension fund, and so will the new NATS.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I make that point tentatively, but if I am right it raises a lot of important questions. NATS employees are obviously anxious that their pensions not be adversely affected by the changes. We want to ensure that the individual pension entitlement of the new NATS employees will be the same as that of the staff who remain at the CAA, and that they will not be disadvantaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The right hon. Gentleman used the term ``the new employees''. Does he suggest that we should guarantee the same pension rights as people would have had at the CAA, even if the new employees of NATS have never been employed by the CAA? Does he suggest that they should be given equivalent rights, as though NATS were still part of CAA and they had joined the CAA pension scheme?
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> When I said ``the new NATS employees'', I meant the current employees who will be employed by the new company. I was referring to existing air traffic controllers who will be employees of the new company. However, the hon. Gentleman makes a point that we have already discussed and to which we shall return. We are dealing with not only past employees—existing pensioners—who have given such dedicated service to this country, and existing employees—future pensioners—but future employees, too. When the new company is established it will, no doubt, have occasion to recruit new staff—indeed, one of its anxieties may be that so many staff will have to transfer to the CAA to provide a regulatory function that it might have to recruit quite a few new staff However, I say that rather cheekily, as an aside.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked, rightly, about the pension status of new staff. Their pension status should be protected, too. We should implement the proposal so as to ensure that all NATS employees, past, present and future, will participate in a pension fund and receive a pension that is as good as they would have received had they remained with the CAA in the public sector and which is not adversely affected by the partial privatisation. That should happen, and it is important for the employees that the Government give that assurance. I realise that employees—the same applies to workers in other sectors, such as farmers— sometimes do not consider future employees, but as Members of Parliament we should. It is not only a matter of past and existing employees, but future employees too. Their pensions should not be adversely affected by the introduction of the public-private partnership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): This is a useful debate. The Government have consulted widely on their proposals. The consultation document spelt out clearly that one of the major concerns of those involved in NATS and the CAA was what would happen to the pension fund. On 21 December, the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) tabled a written question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the current pension arrangements for NATS staff will be preserved under the proposed PPP.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``NATS staff employed by the company at the time the PPP is established will be entitled to remain in the Civil Aviation Pension Scheme.''—[Official Report, House of Commons, 21 December 1999; Vol. 341, c.539W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I draw the inference from the answer that, although those currently in the scheme will remain in it, a question mark hangs over what happens to future staff.
<P>
As we know, there is a shortage of air traffic controllers throughout the world, especially those who are trained to the standards of British air traffic controllers. In the United States, there is a shortage of approximately 2,500 and, recently, some British air traffic controllers were moved to Geneva. Pension arrangements are critical to ensure the retention of top-quality staff to provide a safe air traffic service, so the role of the pension fund is important. We are told that it will be a stand-alone fund. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh and the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) raised the question of surpluses, but they are not the sole issue: we must bear in mind that sometimes people take holidays from contributions. That is one way of not putting into a pension fund what should be put in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> In the majority of cases, pension holidays are introduced by the company, not requested by the employees. At such times, the company gains because it also stops putting money into the pension fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We are trying to give the Government the opportunity to reassure those who work for NATS about their pension arrangements. That is a perfectly legitimate action to take and I am sure that the Government and the civil service are considering such matters. At our first sitting, I raised the matter of pension funds and said that we need, if not a letter, at least an explanation of what the Government propose for the scheme. We need to know how it will operate as a stand-alone scheme and what its future relationship will be with the new company and the strategic partners. Those within the scheme must receive guarantees about their future.
<P>
If new employees are taken out of the scheme, it will become skewed, with principally older employees left in the scheme, that has implications. We are taking a public sector scheme and ensuring that most of the current employees will be in the private sector. What about the minority of employees in the CAA who still work for the public sector? We have discussed potential administration matters, but it is possible that a private company could end up with administrative problems, in which case the majority of the contributions to the pension fund would come from a company that is in difficulty; yet a minority of people in the scheme who were still in the CAA, fulfilling an important role of economic and safety regulation, might face problems. We must tease out what security there will be for those who remain working for the CAA and how they will fare as a minority under the new scheme.
<P>
We need to consider the scheme as a part of the overall proposal. Proper legal advice is important. I am sure that none of us would begrudge part of the £35 million that is to be spent on setting up the scheme being spent on sensible legal advice, to secure the future of those who work within the service.
<P>
It is also a management issue. New people who join the service will not be in the scheme and they will not have the same rights and entitlements. Two air traffic controllers could work together, but only one would be a member of the Civil Aviation Authority pension scheme, which I suspect might be superior to the private sector schemes that the new employees may join. That will put people on different terms and conditions, which is a management problem. For instance, people in the public sector who have a good pension should not receive the same salary increases as those in the private sector. Those people work in a team to ensure the safety of our skies. The new company should be managed in a way that does not discriminate.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to answer our questions on that important subject. It was interesting to note that one of the first Government amendments to be selected is about pensions. All hon. Members are aware of past problems, and none of us wishes to see it affect airspace safety.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> What is to stop the Chancellor of the Exchequer nicking that pension surplus? The Bill is extremely difficult to read. Such matters are not set out clearly, which is why employees are worried. The only reference that I can find to the pension fund is in clause 51(2), which provides that the Treasury or the Secretary of State can deal with it and that he can
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``guarantee the discharge of any financial obligation of the transferee''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The pension fund will be dealt with in the way that the Secretary of State decides he wants to deal with it. If, for the sake of argument, the pension scheme has a surplus, what is to stop the Chancellor saying that the scheme has enough money to meets its liabilities, which he has to do under later provisions, and that he will keep the rest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> That is indeed an important point. Would the hon. Gentleman agree that it is important that my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor do not follow the example of Conservative Chancellors? I think particularly of organisations such as the National Bus Company, a scandal revealed by my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton).
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I was going to mention the National Bus Company; I did not need an intervention to prompt me. The difference between the Bill and the Transport Act 1985, which dealt with the National Bus Company, is that the pension funds were clearly spelt out in the 1985 Act—[Interruption.] They were clearly spelt out, and everyone knew what they could do. Section 52 of the 1985 Act makes provision for the pension fund of National Bus Company employees and says how the money should be distributed. It is clear. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East can argue about the outcome, but there is no reason why the Bill cannot contain an equivalent clause. The Bill is full of provisions taken from the Railways Act 1993 and other legislation. Why could the Government not replicate those provisions from the Transport Act 1985?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The important point that my hon. Friend is making is that whatever the merits or demerits of the Transport Act, it had the consent of Parliament, and the conduct of the pension fund was bound by what Parliament laid down. Nothing in the Bill restricts what Ministers might or might not do with the pension fund. The matter is governed by the civil law, which I fully admit to the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Henderson) has developed considerably since the time of that Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I agree entirely. I have read the clauses to find a clue whether the pension matter is dealt with, but I cannot see anything about it. There seems to be a general power for the Secretary of State and the Treasury to do what they will with the pension fund. My hon. Friends will laugh, because I will give the Minister and his Government the benefit of the doubt. I am sure that the Minister does not intend to raid the pension fund or anything like that, but in a time of insecurity such as this, everything should be spelt out for the benefit of employees. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex points out, they are highly skilled people who are vulnerable—they could take their skills elsewhere, but we must retain them. Therefore, it seems essential that the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh be accepted, as it makes some effort to tie down the pensions of present and past employees.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex that this takes matters further than the first move from NATS to the Secretary of State. However, it does not relate to future employees. I suspect that one could not legislate for future schemes, as the strategic partner might be an organisation in its own right or a subsidiary of a large conglomerate and may have a better pension scheme than that of the CAA. The company might be a French water company, but I had better not say any more or I shall start my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex off again.
<P>
The other problem that arises is the concept, which is not in the Bill, of having two parallel pension schemes: a CAA scheme for CAA staff who remain in the public sector and a CAA scheme mark two for the employees of NATS. Would the employees of the strategic partner have to join the CAA (NATS) pension fund or could they retain pensions from other funds? Would they be free to choose where their pensions are placed?
<P>
Those are extremely important issues, and I do not see why the Government want to add problems to the operation. They should do what the previous Government did in 1985 and simply add a plain, simple clause to the Bill in as much plain, simple English as a lawyer can write. Then everyone would know what was going on, which would help considerably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I entirely support the wise observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). Given the experience of hon. Members, especially those of us who served on the Committee of what became the Transport Act 1985, we know that the issues are of great concern to the employees of the relevant organisations and the wider public.
<P>
I congratulate the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh on tabling the amendment. He will recognise the force of the argument made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) about the lack of provision in the Bill for a detailed arrangement for the handling of existing employees' pensions. That contrasts unsatisfactorily with the way in which the matter was dealt with on bus deregulation, even if that resulted in some difficulties over the past 15 years. [Interruption.] How much more difficulty will we have, given that there is nothing in the Bill to deal with pensioners' concerns?
<P>
The issue is important, as has been shown by the fallout from the bus privatisation, but Labour Members might be more familiar with the company run by a fellow called Robert Maxwell—the notorious bouncing Czech—who raided the pension fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): Tut, tut!
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am sorry, I thought that the hon. Gentleman might have read Private Eye, which called Robert Maxwell the bouncing Czech. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was a good friend of the former Member of Parliament and subsequent crook? It is common knowledge in this country—
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> My disapproval was only of speaking ill of the dead. Are the Opposition, as well as changing tack and making a U-turn on the minimum wage, now apologising for the scandal of having ripped off bus pensioners?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I think that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex is in a better position than I am to deal with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> It is interesting that Labour Members are going on about the National Bus Company and talking about scandal; if they are so concerned about the same thing happening to the NATS pensioners, why do they not press the Minister to include a clause to that effect, as we have suggested?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. That is an extremely forceful and logical argument.
<P>
Going back to Robert Maxwell, there was a man who raided the pension fund, apparently under the noses of, among others, members of the Government. I therefore think that it would be wise for the Government to take sensible precautions, bearing in mind the history of problems relating to pension funds, in both the private and public sectors.
<P>
I have several constituents who are air traffic controllers and I am familiar with the job that they do. I have spoken to them in the air and have visited them at the London air traffic control centre at West Drayton. I have also visited Swanwick, where we hope they will be able to work. I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Poole said about the nature of the job. Has the Minister visited the London air traffic control centre? He is not responding. It is not a trick question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He has not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I do not criticise him for that; I merely wanted to establish whether he had visited it. It might be beneficial for him to do so and to see the extremely pressurised conditions under which those guys operate. If they have problems on their minds, such as the future of their pension fund, it is likely to distract them and that is not good news. This is therefore an important issue that my constituents would expect us to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the pension fund of the National Bus Company. Back in 1985 when he was Member of Parliament for Cannock and Burntwood, did he have any bus driver constituents and did he consider them when he voted to filch their pension on behalf of the previous Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That was a very apposite intervention from the hon. Gentleman, whom I have known for a very long time. He is an old enough hand not to ask the question to which he already knows the answer: that Midland Red (North) Ltd was based in Cannock. I cannot remember the subsequent history in detail. All that I am saying is that given that we have all learned lessons—
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Answer the question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I cannot remember whether I was specifically pressed by that company at the time on the issue of pensions. It was a long time ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman? He was and he did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I would prefer to check the record. I do not regard the hon. Gentleman as a knave, and I shall therefore check whether he is right. If I am wrong, well we live and learn in this place. Surely, it should be clear to the Committee that, if problems arose because of the privatisation of the bus companies, we should ensure that my constituents and others who will be affected by the Bill will be in no doubt about what is proposed.
<P>
We must bear in mind the fact that people joined the air traffic control services knowing that it was a public sector organisation. Some people specifically joined such organisations because that was a culture and an environment in which they wished to be employed. At the time they joined, they probably did not think that there was much likelihood of privatisation or a PPP. It is important that they are reassured that the scheme will give them the same benefits as they currently enjoy and they are entitled to expect in the future.
<P>
As a result of the PPP, two schemes will be created. Those who are currently employed by NATS will remain in the public sector CAA scheme, although it will be a separate fund. Can the Minister tell us whether it is proposed that there will be two funds within the CAA fund, one that applies to CAA employees and one that is ring-fenced and applies to current NATS employees who will move into the new company, but who will retain their pension entitlement through the fund that is within the CAA fund? Will that be ring-fenced?
<P>
Paragraph 66 of the consultation document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``These arrangements will not necessarily apply to employees taken on by the PPP after it is established.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That goes to the heart of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole, which is that air traffic controllers who are beneficiaries of the CAA scheme will be sitting side by side with others who will be beneficiaries of a new scheme. It is reasonable that if the new company will be a stand-alone entity, new employees will come on board on the basis of the package that is offered to them. Part of that package will be a new pension scheme, which will not link into the old scheme. I have no quarrel with that. As long as people understand what they are being offered, they will not complain.
<P>
We need to flag up the fact that there will be two sets of people: those who are currently employed by NATS and who will stay with NATS and the old scheme, and those who join subsequent to the PPP and become part of a new scheme. I shall say a little more about that after I have given way to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman and the Conservative party suggesting that all companies should be giving their employees decent pension funds? Furthermore, is he saying that some of those companies that have already been privatised and that have separate pension schemes for new entrants should now give their staff the same pension rights as their employees had before the companies were privatised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> No, not at all. I am saying that those who join the new organisation subsequent to the new partner being admitted—let us call it D-day—will have to take into account the conditions offered by the scheme when they decide whether to join the organisation. They will know that those alongside whom they are sitting will be the beneficiaries of a different scheme.
<P>
<B><p5>Mr. Henderson:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman tell me the difference between air traffic controllers and their pension schemes, railway workers who do not enjoy those rights and Stena Line and Sealink employees, of whom I was one, who did not enjoy such rights? The funds were ring-fenced and the companies were allowed to offer new employees different pension funds. The Conservative Government at the time gave no protection to those employees, nor did they protect other employees of organisations that were privatised during their time in government.
<P>
<H5>3.45 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am sorry. As I told the hon. Gentleman, quite honestly, I am not aware of the conditions that applied to Sealink workers or the others I recognise, that, as he represents Harwich, he will know.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What we did in previous privatisations seems to be exactly the same as what the present Administration intend with this one, namely that the present employees should have their pension rights preserved, with regard to the present but that the new employer—the new privatised company—should be free to offer pension arrangements of its own choosing to new employees. I appreciate that that may well seem unfair. The parable of the labourers in the vineyard comes to mind. However, at no stage has any party suggested retrospective impositions on companies to provide pension arrangements that would have existed had the company remained in the public sector for employees who have joined subsequent to the privatisation. No one is suggesting that. It is disingenuous of the hon. Member for Harwich to suggest that that is what my hon. Friend is suggesting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, but may I go on to refer to something else that is apposite? I have constituents who work for British Airways. Some Labour Members I know—having signed an early-day motion—that employees have expressed concern about the original pension fund that was established prior to the privatisation of British Airways. Their pension fund, which has been entirely separate from the one offered to people joining the airline subsequent to privatisation, is to be amalgamated with the new pension fund that was created after 1984 Concerns have been expressed by pilots and others in my constituency who joined the airline when it was British European Airways—known in the trade as ``back every afternoon''—and BOAC—known as ``better on a camel''. When those two airlines were state-controlled and separate entities they nevertheless—I think—had one pension fund, which has remained separate. British Airways now wish to amalgamate that with the fund that was established post-privatisation.
<P>
Like many hon. Members I have had a lengthy letter from Mr Ayling, the chief executive of British Airways, explaining that there is no intention to dilute the pension fund of the pre-privatisation employees. However, it is incumbent on this Committee to explore the difficulties that could arise. I think we owe it to the people—I certainly do. I have joined this Committee at an opportune time for my constituents who work in air traffic control for NATS. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that we understand the risks. That is why the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh is so important. It gives us the opportunity to make it clear to the employees that we have recognised the difficulties. We are proposing that something should be put on the face of the Bill to ensure that the Government recognise that they have got to spell out a clear scheme, so that the pitfalls encountered in recent years do not apply to those who will be subject to the changes proposed by this Bill.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members will know that there is likely to be a Division in the House at about 4 pm, at the end of this piece of business. The Committee will be suspended at that time. Hon. Members may wish to know now that I intend to suspend the Committee for 30 minutes, or 15 minutes after the second Division, if there is one. In other words, hon. Members will have a half-hour break. We shall then sit until 7 pm, when I shall adjourn the sitting—unless any hon. Member chooses to move the adjournment before that. I call Mr. Snape.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh for moving the amendment. It is important, and the speeches made so far illustrate why that is. I may not have agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Aldershot said, but I certainly agreed with his concluding remarks. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will be looking to my hon. Friend the Minister for assurances.
<P>
It is a bit thick for Conservative Members to take the line that they have. The Conservative party has long been known as organised hypocrisy, and one is reminded of that when listening to speeches on matters such as this. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hexham. His was a remarkable speech. He justified the blatant daylight robbery of the National Bus Company pension scheme on the ground that it was in the relevant Bill and that the Tory Government had a big majority. One could argue that that is what parliamentary democracy is about, but I expected him to find a more suitable topic to which to attach the label of parliamentary democracy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aldershot seems to have suffered a convenient memory lapse. He has forgotten how the National Bus Company privatisation exercised the Standing Committee in 1985. I was not a member of that Committee, but I shall not say why, Mr. Gale, for fear of stretching your patience. The hon. Gentleman conveniently forgets that that debate was a central and defining moment. I cannot explain the hon. Gentleman's memory lapse. He does not strike me as prone to such lapses, but I can understand if it is not the episode of which he feels most proud after all these years. Indeed, most of us can understand that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> Clause 51 of the Transport Act 1985 is perfectly clear. It sets out the exact rights and responsibilities following the sale of the National Bus Company. The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises about the pension surplus is a question of law and I accept that many funds find themselves over-endowed so that they can meet the pension liabilities no matter how generously they pay money out or how many pensions holidays are taken. That is normal commercial practice. The hon. Gentleman may not like it, and I did not like it when it happened to me in a company that I once worked for, but companies are entitled to do that. Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that the law should be amended to prevent that? He will not be able to do that in this Bill. What the National Bus Company successors did was perfectly legal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Of course it was perfectly legal; I accept that. I did not mean to provoke the hon. Gentleman to red-faced indignation about what I thought was a relatively minor reprimand. It was perfectly legal at the time, but it was not proper. Many hon. Members felt that filching the pension surplus and pouring the money back into the Government's coffers was to the long-term detriment of those who worked in the bus industry.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): Does my hon. Friend agree that the pensions ombudsman took a dim view of the action taken by the previous Government? Indeed, he said that the money should be returned, which the Government have now done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> My hon. Friend is right to remind the Committee of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Let me reply to my hon. Friend first, and then I shall give way to the intellectual gadfly on the Opposition Front Bench. To paraphrase the hon. Member for Hexham, the ombudsman's words had no force in law. They carried great moral authority, which the Conservative Government flouted. Had the Conservatives won the last election, unlikely though that was, they would still be flouting it today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I understand that, despite the outrage that the Labour party expressed in opposition over the matter, nearly three years later the cheque has not been returned to the pension fund. [HON. MEMBERS: ``Yes, it has.''] I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East said, sotto voce, across the Floor a few moments ago. His words were ``The cheque's in the post'', a turn of phrase that increasingly suits the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Or, to paraphrase the old joke, ``I'm from the Opposition and I've come to help''. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right. We want an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister that those who are transferred from the public sector to the new joint company will have—to return to the reference to my own experience that I made this morning—a mirror image scheme that leaves them no better off than they would be had they continued to work for NATS in its present, publicly owned form.
<P>
I am not trying to tie my hon. Friends' hands or those of the future management of whatever the private company is called, but I am asking for some assurances that people who join the air traffic control service in future will not be worse off than they would have been had NATS continued in public ownership. That is fair and reasonable, and will distinguish this public-private partnership from the—again, I use the phrase without, I hope, sounding too emotional—daylight robbery that took place in the 1980s that has been the subject of the selective amnesia of the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth).

<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is such a gracious man. My memory genuinely fails me, and I shall confirm what he says. I invite him to regard me as having partly atoned for my sins, if sins they were, in so far as I was one of only two Members, the other being my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who opposed the Lloyds TSB Bill on the grounds that it failed to deal with the anxieties of poorer pensioners. Only when we were satisfied on that score did the Bill pass. Originally, not many Labour Members were involved; it was the Tories who were fighting for the interests of poorer pensioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> A sinner come to repentance should not be patronised in the Committee. It might be an unworthy thought—indeed, it probably is, but I shall express it nevertheless—but the hon. Gentleman's view may be that white-collar pensioners are more deserving of the benefit of his favours than blue-collar ones. However, I do not wish to provoke him to rise again. We are asking for assurances. The amendments are important, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh does the Committee a service in moving them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I find this rather surprising. I should have thought that the Committee would agree about the matter. The hon. Members for West Bromwich, East, for Doncaster, Central and for Harwich have all popped up and gone on about the case of bus company pensioners, citing it as a scandalum magnatum. On our side, almost like Pavlovian dogs, when anyone mentions pensions, we say ``Maxwell''.
<P>
I should have thought that we all agreed that pensions should be protected. I heartily congratulate the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh on the sheer clarity of his amendment. It uses simple language that is easy to understand. A non-lawyer and non-accountant such as me can read it and understand exactly what is intended. It goes to the heart of the matter, and I should have thought that all hon. Members would agree. We are discussing a major change. Whenever people compare the rights of private and public employees, the advantage that public employees have that is always cited is a solid pension. They may not be paid so much or have such an exciting job, but they have a gold-plated pension. Any doubt about the future of their pension must have a major impact on the morale and stability of those working, as it is basic to their financial package. That was clear in the response to public consultation. I shall quote paragraph 62.
