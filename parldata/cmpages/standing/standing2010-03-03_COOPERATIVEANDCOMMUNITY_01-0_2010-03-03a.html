Chairman:</b> I welcome you all, particularly the independent
side of the Committee as this is a Back-Bench Bill. I have a few
domestic announcements. Members of the Committee may, if they wish,
take off their jackets to ensure that they are comfortable; I have no
objection to that. Could hon. Members also ensure that mobile
telephones, electronic devices, pagers and so on are either turned off
or switched to silent mode during the
sitting?</div><a name="10030391000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are no amendments to the Bill. We will move straight to clause stand
part debates on each clause if the Committee wishes to debate them. May
I give a little piece of advice to the Committee? Another private
Member&#146;s Bill is being debated in an adjoining Committee Room,
so, if this Bill is to make progress, it would be helpful if we
finished before the other Committee. I give that advice merely because
I think that I am permitted to say from the Chair that this is an
uncontroversial Bill that has widespread support. I repeat that, if we
complete our deliberations quickly, this Bill will get the first Friday
slot. I understand that the right hon. Member for Croydon, North, who
is presenting the Bill, wishes to take it forward to the remaining
stages. May I also suggest that we have a general debate on clause 1? I
would be happy to allow it to range slightly wider than normal and
perhaps we can then agree that the other clauses should stand part of
the Bill without any
debate.</div><a name="10030391000006"></a><h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

Wicks</b> (Croydon, North) (Lab): May I first say, and not in
the merely conventional way, what a pleasure it is to serve under your
chairmanship, Sir Nicholas? You will be retiring at the next
general election, and I would like to thank you, on behalf of myself
and my colleagues, for your great service to the House. We understand
your advice on the need to dispose of the Bill relatively quickly. I
should add that I am also a member of the other private Member&#146;s
Bill Committee, but I do not know whether, logistically, I can rush
into that Committee Room and make a long speech as a filibuster. I
think it is better that I simply get on with this
speech.</div><a name="10030391000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Bill is an exemplar of the maxim that good things come to
those who wait. I originally introduced the Bill in the House on 21
January 2009. It went through the Commons stages without
amendment&#151;it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>was not controversial politically&#151;but was not able to complete
its passage through the Lords before Parliament was prorogued on 12
November 2009. Concerns were raised in relation to the Bill in another
place by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the
Constitution Committee, as well as by Baroness Noakes, who tabled
amendments at the Lords Committee stage that form the basis for some of
the changes to the
Bill.</div><a name="10030391000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill continues to have Government support and was re-introduced as a
private Member&#146;s Bill in the House of Lords on 19 November 2009,
thanks to Lord Tomlinson. It had its Second Reading in the Lords on 11
December 2009, and the order of commitment was discharged, with no
amendments having been tabled, on 7 January 2010. It had its Third
Reading and was passed by the Lords on 14 January 2010. The First and
Second Readings in the Commons took place on 14 and 29 January
respectively. The Bill is identical to that in the previous Session,
except for minor amendments to clauses 4(7)(b), 4(8) and 5(1),
which inserts new section 23A(3)(b) into the Credit Unions
Act
1979.</div><a name="10030391000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will now briefly explain those provisions further. As stated, during
the passage of the original Bill through the other place, concerns were
raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the
Constitution Committee, as well as by Baroness Noakes. In essence, the
concerns related to the powers granted to the Treasury under clause 4
to import measures from the Companies Act 2006 in relation to
industrial and provident societies, and under clause 5 to apply
building society law to credit unions. Specific concerns were expressed
in respect of the powers granted to the Treasury to create criminal
offences, and in respect of the fact that there was no express duty in
the Bill to consult before making regulations under clause 4.</div>
<a name="10030391000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addressing
those concerns, I draw right hon. and hon. Members&#146; attention to
clauses 4(7)(b) and 5(1), which ensure that the Government can only
create criminal offences, first, in circumstances corresponding to an
offence in the legislation being applied and, secondly, subject to a
maximum penalty no greater than is provided for in the corresponding
offence. Additionally, I refer Members to clause 4(8), which makes
explicit the requirement to consult before assimilating company law
measures into industrial and provident society legislation. Such a
requirement to consult on building society law and credit unions
already existed in the previous draft of the Bill and is in clause 5(6)
of the current Bill.</div>
<a name="10030391000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
briefly introduce clause 1. It provides that all new societies
registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 shall
be registered as co-operative societies or community benefit societies.
It sets out the basis on which societies may be registered. The
criteria are essentially those already in existing legislation and so
no major change is made to the qualifying criteria. Modernising the
name by changing it from &#147;industrial and provident
society&#148; to terms that are, in any case, in common usage, means
that we can help the sector to adopt a modern 21st-century persona. The
clause deals with other details, but I do not think that I need detain
the Committee with those at this stage.</div>

I have contributed to the expeditious way in which the Committee has
