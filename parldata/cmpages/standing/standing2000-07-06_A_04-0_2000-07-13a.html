<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): If my memory serves me right, I was about to demonstrate my non-partisan nature by supporting at least the first part of amendment No. 9, moved by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). However, I do not agree with the comments made by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson); that would run a coach and horses through the purpose of the Bill.
<P>
We support the new duties that the Bill imposes on local authorities, and we hope that the resources will follow those duties. I am somewhat concerned, however, that with those duties the local authorities are taking on some extraordinary powers. Because a local authority should continue to be available to the relevant young persons, I cannot go along with the tenor of the second part of amendment No. 9. The local authority should continue to keep an open register on relevant young persons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Does the hon. Gentleman draw a distinction between keeping an active file open and keeping a door open, in the sense that young persons should always be aware that they can return to the fold at any time?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I do not see the distinction. About 3,000 people are still registered with me; I hold their records, but I do not see them every day&#151;I am glad that I do not. However, I have a continuing responsibility for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If I, like the hon. Gentleman, were a general practitioner, I would be careful not to say in the presence of a Health Minister that I had a large number of open records on people whom I never see, because that costs the Exchequer money. I suggest that there is a difference between requiring an authority to keep a file up to date and make regular reviews and simply requiring it to be accessible to young persons should they wish to return.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Of course my patients are well looked after by my partners, one of whom is my wife. I have great faith in her abilities, which are significantly greater than mine.
<P>
I do not see the distinction suggested by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. It is right to have a review process, even if there is no active contact, to ensure that no extra intelligence has been found and to discover whether more active outreach needs to take place. The Bill seems to imply that young people and even adults should have the right to thank the local authority for what it had done. I expect that such thanks would be exceptional, but they should be able to say, ``Thanks, but no thanks. I do not want to continue with this sort of contact.'' That is why I appreciate the spirit of the amendment. It provides checks and balances between the duties of the local authority and the rights of the individual being cared for to refuse that care, a subject to which I shall return later. I hope that it was a probing amendment and I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Members for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) and for Runnymede and Weybridge. The amendment gives me the opportunity to state clearly precisely what the Bill does and does not do.
<P>
The debate was characterised by some uncertainty. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to concepts such as monitoring, surveillance and the keeping of files. The description that he conjured up was of an intrusive and almost fascistic local authority that was minded to follow those young people around the country in a covert, secret operation, compelling them to do things that they did not want to do. That may be a slight characterisation of what the hon. Gentleman said, but he showed that he misunderstands not only the nature of Bill but the nature of the situations that deals with and the relationships that we hope will be developed and enhanced by the provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the Minister accept that it was in anticipation of the tone that he now adopts that I tabled the two previous amendments? I tabled them to give him the opportunity to tell the Committee precisely what was meant in new section 23B(11) by a local authority having ``lost touch with'' a young person and by it ``taking reasonable steps'' to re-establish contact with that young person. He chose not do to so. I cannot be responsible for having to work in the dark. He clearly has the information, and is about to tell the Committee what interpretation he thinks I should put on those words, but he chose not do to so when he had the opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is a very convenient argument, but it does not bear scrutiny. I tried to make clear on Tuesday some of the restrictions placed on what I can say to the hon. Gentleman. We are talking about a wide spectrum of situations and circumstances. We would be here until Christmas if I were to go through every set of circumstances that might arise in the relationship between a young person leaving care and his or her young person's adviser in order that, in all circumstances, the duty to keep in touch was properly discharged.
<P>
I made it clear to the hon. Gentleman, I am sorry if he did not understand, that we would be setting out those details in guidance, which is the right place for them, and I extended an invitation to him to help us ensure that the guidance is correct. I do not take his chastisement seriously. He tabled the amendment at the same time as earlier amendments, so he should not feel under an obligation to take the matter further.
<P>
I was intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's description of ``effective election'' in the amendment; I thought that the last general election was particularly effective. I know that he is not talking about a general election, but we certainly look forward to a re-run.
<P>
On the substance of the amendment, as always, I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre, and he got pretty close to the nub of the matter. The present arrangements are unsatisfactory. The incentives&#151;they could be described as perverse incentives&#151;militate against local authorities developing sustainable long-term relationships with their looked-after children. The benefit system is a particularly unattractive feature of the present arrangements. That has led to some local authorities looking at the possibility of discharging young people from care far too early. We want to recast those relationships and to give them a better and more sustainable future. We want to put the interests of young people in care and those leaving care first and foremost on our list of priorities.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's concept of an effective election, which would allow local authorities to relinquish the new duties in the Bill would build in another set of perverse incentives. Local authorities might then try to persuade the young people in their 
<P>
care to make such an effective election in order to avoid some of the responsibilities and duties imposed on them under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I will not give way. That concept is not healthy or desirable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight, who usually speaks a lot of sense, failed to do so this morning. He and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge should speak to their noble Friends in another place who asked us to improve and strengthen the duties, not to provide loopholes and get-outs. In particular, Lord Clement-Jones, the noble Friend of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, was anxious to strengthen the duties so that children would get a better deal. I am sad that the hon. Gentleman is supporting aspects of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister has spoken of giving perverse incentives to local authorities. I acknowledge that risk, but how will local authorities be reimbursed for the costs incurred in performing their duties? Until we know how the system is to work&#151;whether per capita grants will be used, for example&#151;it is not possible to determine what will and will not send incentives or disincentives to local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not sure that it is true to say that the precise method by which we reimburse local authorities will determine whether there are perverse incentives. What matters more is whether sufficient resources are in the pot&#151;delivered by ring-fenced grants or standard spending assessments&#151;to ensure that local authorities are able to discharge their duties properly. I am not sure that the particular route through which the funding is translated to local authorities will make a huge difference. However, we are discussing with the Local Government Association and other interested bodies how we can support local authorities to deliver new duties. An announcement will be made when reach a conclusion.
<P>
At the heart of the difficulty that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has with the Bill is his understanding that the duties will amount to unwarranted interference in an individual's human rights as guaranteed by the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights. He believes that they would be obtrusive and compel young people to act against their will. That is not a fair description. We accept that the Bill will require local councils to keep in touch with young people, but it will not require them to interfere to the extent of breaching human rights.
<P>
We are anxious to develop a system that will accommodate the young person who needs and wants very little contact and for whom periodic contact with a local authority through the young person's adviser is sufficient. However, to safeguard the welfare of young people, the onus should be on the council to make contact. It is no good placing the burden on the young person&#151;as amendment No. 9 would&#151;to approach the local authority for help. The proposal would allow small problems easily to get out of hand for want of a little help or would allow a major crisis to arise because a young person was unwilling to admit to the local authority or the young person's adviser that he needed help.
<P>
If we were to introduce the opt-out clause proposed by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, it would be logical to water down a council's duty to maintain and review the pathway plan. I am sure that he would agree that there would be no point in not doing that for someone who had disappeared. I do not understand how the amendment would address that problem. However, I am convinced that the opt-out is not a good idea. Councils should have a continuing duty to keep their pathway plans under review.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am following the Minister's argument and I agree that the proposal should not be used as an opt-out by local authorities. Instead of giving local authorities an excuse, it should provide individuals with a right. However, what will happen if relationships break down&#151;and they will&#151;between a local authority and a relevant young person? Will a vigorous internal or external investigation take place to ascertain why that happened? I share the Minister's concerns about perverse incentives. Clearly, there must be a mechanism by which there can be an audit as to why relationships break down in particular circumstances.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Obviously, we expect the local authority to take its responsibilities seriously and to ensure that it discharges the duties that we are setting out. There might be a need for an external inquiry of the sort to which the hon. Gentleman alluded, depending on what happens in a particular case and the possible consequences of a failure to keep in touch with a young person.
<P>
<p>The hon. Member for Isle of Wight is clearly concerned about cases in which a young person is determined not to keep in touch. Let us be honest: such a case might arise. That would make it difficult for a local authority to discharge the duties. As I said in an earlier debate, every case will have to be considered on the basis of its facts and merits. If young people choose to have minimal contact with the local authority once they have reached the age of 18, I am sure that that will be reflected in the pathway plan. 
</P>
<P>
We all need to be clear that there is no suggestion that the local authority will act as a jailer or as an organisation that can compel young people. Of course we cannot do that. The circumstances that concern the hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Runnymede and Weybridge are not terribly realistic scenarios and deploying them will not justify the amendment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight rightly said that the amendment is about allowing the young person rather than the local authority to opt out. I am sure that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will say the same when he replies. However, if the young person opted out, it would have precisely the effect of relieving the local authority of its duties to support him or her. I do not have the confidence of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight that that would not create, indirectly or directly, a perverse incentive for young people to go down that path if they knew that the financial consequences were as obvious as the amendment implied.
<P>
I must correct one argument. I am sorry that I misconstrued amendment No. 9, tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. There would be, as I understand it, a duty to keep the pathway plan under review. I did not intend to misrepresent his amendment. For young people in those situations, there is likely to be minimal contact. The pathway plan might contain minimum detail as a result.
<P>
The guidance that we intend to issue under the legislation will certainly set out the options for exactly those situations and for ways in which to keep the pathway plan if someone disappears. I accept that such situations are difficult and that there is no panacea for those difficulties. The solution that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge offers the Committee is profoundly unattractive. I can understand his motives for wanting to ensure that we do not create a new legal framework that is obtrusive or contravenes the fundamental rights that individuals have under the European convention, which will be incorporated into domestic law on 2 October. We are absolutely sure that nothing in the Bill will do that. We have carefully studied the implications of the legislation in relation to the European convention to satisfy ourselves that that is the case.
<P>
I do not want to recommend to my hon. Friends that they agree with the amendment, which would build in the risk of a perverse incentive for councils to encourage care leavers to disappear at the age of 18. That is precisely the sort of thing that the Bill tries to prevent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thought that I heard the Minister say something about having checked the Bill with the European Commission. Did I mishear? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will correct me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We have not discussed the Bill with the European Commission, which has no responsibility for matters relating to the European convention on human rights. I said that we had considered carefully the implications of the Bill in relation to our treaty obligations under the European convention. We are satisfied that the Bill is fully compliant with the ECHR.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister: I misheard ``Commission'' for ``convention'' and a little antenna twitched somewhere in my mind.
<P>
I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, although I am not sure how far it extends. I am not sure either about the way in which one goes about supporting part of an amendment in this place. I intend to press the amendment to a Division, so the hon. Gentleman will have to decide whether on balance he is for it or against it.
<P>
I am sorry that the Minister, perhaps in trying to liven up our proceedings this evening&#151;I mean this morning; it tends to blur after a while&#151;might appear to have trivialised the discussion. The meaning of the term ``effective election'' is clear. The term is used in legislation and legal documentation, as I am sure the Minister knows. As he was slightly shy about his legal background during recent Committee proceedings, I was delighted to hear him last night in the House use the phrase ``we lawyers''. He has obviously decided to wear his talents on his sleeve, rather than hide his light under a bushel.
<P>
I was disappointed that the Minister used the term ``jailer'', characterising my argument as suggesting that local authorities would act in that way. As usual, I find that I am facing the Minister as he couches his argument in extreme terms&#151;I would call it posturing&#151;when, in fact, the difference between us is not that great. It comes down largely to the fact that I would like the matter to be dealt with in the Bill, but the Minister thinks that he can deal with it adequately by regulations and, perhaps more relevantly in this case, by guidance. As I said last night on another matter, his confidence in the ability of guidance to deal with all the issues is perhaps a reflection of the position that he occupies. My scepticism of that route is perhaps a reflection of the position that I occupy. Were the positions reversed, I might have more confidence in the use of guidance to deal with those matters.
<P>
If we accept that all members of the Committee are approaching the issue with good will, we must concede that a genuine concern has been raised. We have come to a point where there is clear blue water between members of the Committee. The stand taken by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight suggests realignment on an issue that essentially involves a balancing act&#151;the balancing of the rights of individuals with the rights and obligations of the state. I suspect that, although we can agree on much on this issue, Government Members are more inclined to come down on the side of the state and risk an erosion of individuals' rights. Opposition Members&#151;and I hope that that includes the Liberal Democrats&#151;have a particular fondness for defending individuals' rights. That might simply be a fundamental difference between us on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman wishes to press the amendment to a Division. I am frankly feeling all pink and fluffy after the outbreak of real consensus in the discussion on adoption last night. Can the hon. Gentleman not understand that the Government's proposal is about common sense? It is about not allowing young people, who might well want to be antagonistic to local authorities when they leave care, to erect barriers that will be detrimental in the longer term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have just said that there is clear blue water between us. I recognise the sincerity of the hon. Gentleman's views and his good intentions. However, he has just asked whether or not I recognise that the state sometimes knows best and that it should not allow an adult to do something that he wants to do but the state thinks would be detrimental to his interest. That displays a fundamental difference of approach between people who think like him and people who think like me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The issue is not state versus individual, but parenting&#151;mature adults who have an eye on the future and the care of young people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> However it is couched, there are statutory authorities and individuals. I do not doubt the hon. Gentleman's sincerity and I hope he does not doubt mine. We are discussing an agreed objective of how to ensure that individuals are best served by the Bill. The genuine difference of opinion surrounds how we achieve that and what balance should be struck between the rights of the individual and the role of the state in preventing the individual from, as the hon. Gentleman would see it, harming his own interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> If I recall the opening remarks of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge correctly, he suggested that there was little difference of substance between us on this issue, but now there appears to be a vast ocean of deep blue water between us. How did that happen in the space of a few minutes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry, but I do not entirely understand the Minister's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I will put it another way. The hon. Gentleman began his remarks by saying that there was little difference of substance between us. He has now identified a substantial issue of principle. How did we go from a position of no differences to a chasm?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I suspect that there is more water between me and the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre than there is between me and the Minister, but, with all due respect, the Minister is, once again, posturing. He has taken up a position and argued in extreme terms that my amendment would be extremely damaging and that the Bill appears in sharp juxtaposition. However, I suspect that he will take a pragmatic approach and I am sure he has a clear picture in his mind of the guidance that he will issue to avoid the problem that I foresee. That is why I doubted whether there was much distance between us. He simply thinks he can deal with my concerns in a different way.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> As someone who sails, I normally like deep blue water because I cannot hit any rocks, but I do not understand why the rights of the individual&#151;a matter on which I agree with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge&#151;would have to be matched by the withdrawal of a local authority's duty&#151;I do not agree that that is a necessary consequence. If someone elects not to be part of a local authority support structure, that should not give the local authority the right to withdraw. That is why I have such difficulty with the amendments. I would find it hard to support the hon. Gentleman if we divided on the amendments, although I would not vote in this instance because the argument will be clarified when we debate amendment No. 34.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I understand the instinct that urges him not to let the local authority off the hook, but the right that I am seeking to protect for the individual becomes meaningless if the local authority is required to pursue the duties that the Bill lays on it. The hon. Gentleman, you, Mrs. Michie, or I might reasonably object to a statutory authority actively maintaining a file on us&#151;indeed, members of the Government have made clear their objection to the fact that elements of the state bureaucracy have maintained files on them, which they find intrusive, unsupportable and unacceptable. That is self-evident and unremarkable, so it is odd that we are saying that a care leaver aged 18, 19 or 20 should not feel the same way about a distant bureaucracy maintaining an active file on them. That is precisely the nub of the issue.
<P>
I accept the spirit of the comments of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, and I accept, as I hope I made clear earlier, that the door should not be closed. I have thought carefully about the matter since Second Reading. The terminology that we have used in amendment No. 9 refers to an effective election being in force, but makes it clear that an election can be made and then withdrawn: it states that the Secretary of State would by regulation specify the procedure for both, including some form of exit counselling to establish that the young person genuinely understands what he is doing and what the implications are.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is for the Secretary of State to put in place the safety net arrangements that he considers appropriate, and it is appropriate for the door always to be open should the young person want to return to the fold, but we cannot duck the fundamental question of the human rights of a competent adult who may not want the state to maintain a file on him. He has committed no criminal offence, is fully mentally competent and is not regarded as an active threat to the security of the state&#151;an additional category that I have just thought of as a result of my earlier remarks. Is he not entitled to say that he does not want the state actively to monitor his life and to maintain an open file on him? I believe that he is.
<P>
The Minister may characterise my argument as based on an extreme presentation of what local authorities will do in pursuit of the duties placed on them under the clause. However, although he may have a clear view in his mind because he will be issuing the guidance to local authorities, that view is not at this stage clear to the rest of us. Perhaps when, at some point in the future, we see the guidance, we shall be greatly reassured; for now, however, I am afraid that we must proceed on the basis of the proposals before us. That is the trouble with primary legislation that depends heavily on regulations or guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want actively to prolong the debate, but the hon. Gentleman's anxieties clearly relate to the duty to keep in touch. How does he reconcile his comments with the views of his noble Friend Earl Howe, who said in the other place that he wanted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>something rather more substantial than whatever ideas are normally denoted by the phrase ``keep in touch''&#151;[Official Report, House of Lords, 9 March 2000; Vol. 610, c. 1256.]&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>to be specified in the Bill? The hon. Gentleman is taking a different&#151;indeed, totally opposite&#151;view from that expressed by his noble Friend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is not true. My noble Friend's remarks relate to the relationship that he would like between a local authority and a former relevant child&#151;a young person who has left care; they did not deal specifically with the question of a young person who wants to opt out of the system. To suggest that the local authority's obligations should go further, that the relationship with the young person should be deeper and more complex and that further obligations should be placed on the local authority is perfectly compatible with acknowledging that the young adult should have a right to opt out of the arrangement.
<P>
With respect to the Minister, I suspect that our noble Friends in the other place will adopt a typically robust view on the protection of individual rights when they have an opportunity to consider the matter. As I said on Tuesday, the clause has been substantially amended and extended in scope during&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It has been substantially amended and extended in scope during its passage in the other place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that an important amendment was made in the other place, but the duty to keep in touch has not been amended throughout the passage of the Bill, because it has been treated separately from the duties to assist 18 to 21-year-olds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> None the less, the scope of the activity that we are discussing within the clause has changed as a result of amendments that were tabled after debate in the other place. Their Lordships have not had a chance to see and debate the Bill in its final glory and whether they will have a further opportunity depends on what happens in Committee and on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I hate to pick the hon. Gentleman up, but their Lordships have, of course, seen the Bill in its final form: they sent it to this place in the form in which we have it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister knows what I am saying&#151;the Bill has been extensively amended during its passage in the House of Lords. He has referred to my noble Friend Earl Howe and to the noble Friend of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, Lord Clement-Jones. I would be surprised if those two noble Lords did not share the concern that the hon. Member for Isle of Wight and I have expressed this morning about the issue of individual rights of a young adult who wants to contract out of the system. I freely acknowledge that that issue was flagged first in this place and was not given any attention in the other place; instead, their Lordships focused on the extension of the scope of the clause. I do not know whether they will have another opportunity to consider the matter now that it has been discussed in the Committee but, given the way in which the other place works and the type of issue that is that is vigorously debated there, I would have thought that the issue would resonate with their Lordships.
<P>
The Minister mentioned perverse incentives for local authorities, implying that a loophole would be created, akin to the availability of benefits for 16 and 17-year-olds, and that local authorities would take the opportunity to line up their former relevant children, with a stack of elections on the desk and the appropriate person to rubber-stamp them, and file them through to sign them off.
<P>
When I asked the Minister about the financing regime for dealing with the obligations under this part of the Bill, he said that that would not be relevant to the debate. I disagree: how local authorities are financed for dealing with those additional obligations will determine whether there is a perverse financial incentive. If there is to be a per capita grant for each former relevant child, will that grant be withdrawn if the local authority fails in its duty to keep in contact? Will the authority be penalised or will it benefit from having an open case on its books but failing to fulfil the obligation placed upon it? That will have a significant practical impact on the behaviour of local authorities.
<P>
I hope that we do not have to descend into an acrimonious discussion. Everyone is anxious to ensure that we respect the rights of young adults and offer them the maximum possible support without closing any doors to them. Everyone also wants to ensure that we do not create unintended loopholes that local authorities, trying to avoid the spirit of the duty placed upon them, can slip through by some devious means. I do not necessarily suggest that our amendments are the perfect solution, but they would significantly improve the Bill.
<P>
There has been no chink of any concession from the Minister regarding our concern about young adults' human rights. In the absence of any meaningful response, I have no alternative but to press the amendment.

Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Personal advisers and pathway plans</center></H4>
<P>
Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden): I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page , line 34, leave out `children who are'.
<P>
Our amendment is simple and technical. It draws attention an issue of concern arising from the clause, which is about personal advisers and pathway plans. Proposed new section 23D(1)(a) of the Children Act 1989 uses the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>children who are relevant children,
<P>
</UL></FONT>which is rather long-winded. It would be simpler to delete the first three words, so that it read ``relevant children''.
<P>
The amendment enables me to raise an issue about the meaning of the proposed new subsection. To be clear as to what the Government have in mind, one has to read the Bill in conjunction with the explanatory notes, which state on page 10:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> By subsection (1), regulations may be made to allow other individuals aged between 16 and 21, such as children who have received respite care, to have personal advisers in addition to those children and young people listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) whom this Bill entitles to a personal adviser.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That important and helpful note set me thinking about the meaning, given that the clause tries to define other categories of children to whom personal advisers may be appointed and for whom pathway plans may be drawn up. Children who have received respite care may have been in care only for a brief time. As the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre said in the Chamber last night, when we debating the Care Standards Bill, many children are in care only temporarily and they return to their natural family after that period.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
 Will the Minister reassure us that the clause would not create additional work for social services departments, which, as we know from representations by the Local Government Association, are already worried about the resources needed to draw up the necessary arrangements under the Bill? We need to be a little careful about widening the provision of personal advisers and pathway plans to those who are in the care system only temporarily.
<P>
I have talked to social workers in my constituency and I have had experience of an interesting constituency case of a child who was placed briefly in foster care because relations between him and his mother had broken down, following the break-up of her marriage. At the outset of that unfolding family dilemma, the social worker understandably could not be sure how long the situation would last. When the child was placed in foster care, he protested strongly that he never wanted to go back home again, which is the sort of emotional outburst that young people make after a major breakdown in relations with the parent. I am pleased to say, however, that after a few months the situation was resolved by a good multi-agency approach involving the boy's headmaster, his form teacher, friends of the family and social workers. He has since returned to his birth mother and all seems to be well.
<P>
That case illustrates my point that a provision that extends the scope of personal advisers and pathway plans to children who have received respite care or who are in care only temporarily might burden social services departments with an additional heavy work load. I am making a commonsense point that the Government would expect a member of the Conservative party to make. It is informed by constituency experience, which is always good to bring to Committee because it is real. The amendment is technical, but it was tabled also as a mechanism to probe into the explanatory notes and to enable us better to understand what is in the Minister's mind.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady has raised several issues. The amendment has some attraction for me, because it uses a shorter form of words to achieve the same result. However, it is not necessarily any clearer than the form of words used in the clause; nor would it make any difference. The wording that the hon. Lady seeks to amend is already perfectly clear. I accept that it might not be the tidiest form of words, but it is not so obscure that it requires us to consider a change.
<P>
The hon. Lady raised concerns to do with money about the appointment of personal advisers for care leavers who fall into that group. We have explored the issue of money. We have made it clear to local authorities and in the House that we will not ask local authorities to undertake any duties until they are able properly to discharge them and meet the additional resource implications generated by the legislation. When the time comes to implement the legislation, we will make sure that local authorities are properly resourced to discharge it. I suspect that it will not satisfy the hon. Lady, but I have made it clear that we intend to issue clear guidance to local authorities on how best to discharge their new statutory responsibilities. The publication of the draft guidance will provide the best opportunity for the hon. Lady and me to have a conversation about the sort of circumstances that we are both concerned about. Of course the duty has to be applied practically and sensibly; the guidance will emphasise those qualities. The responsibilities are new ones for local authorities, especially in relation to the appointment of young person's advisers and we have to be perfectly satisfied that the legislation can be applied sensibly. We will make sure that the guidance enables that. We recommended in the ``Me, Survive, Out There?'' consultation document that young person's advisers should be available&#151;a desire that is reflected outside. That is what we have sought to do in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I welcome the Minister's offer of a conversation about the circumstances in which the clause would apply, and I look forward to it. I know that the simple response is that that will be in the guidance, but I would have liked an idea of what constitutes a reasonable length of time before social services are required to trigger the appointment of an independent adviser and the start of a pathway plan. I also expected the Minister to say something about every case being individual. A child could come into respite care or what seems likely to be temporary care because he or she needs to get out of a disastrous situation.
<P>
I am starting to have the conversation with the Minister now so that when we get round to our conversation outside the Committee, he will know what I am after. We wanted to tease out those practical points. It is not just about money; we are not so narrow-minded that we think that everything boils down to money in this situation. There is also the question of the skills and human resources required by social services in undertaking the wholly new task of reviewing the children in their care who are there on a relatively long-term basis and assessing what they need to do to put in place the structure of young person's advisers and pathway plans. I do not want the Minister just to think in terms of pounds&#151;we cannot say shillings today; that dates me&#151;and pence. We are looking at the matter practically, having listened to the social services departments that raise concerns about it.
<P>
I appreciated the responses to the points that I made. I expect that our amendment is merely technical, and means nothing different. It would have been slightly more elegant, but if the Minister is happy to leave the Bill in its less elegant form, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I shall be brief&#151;it is a relatively short Bill, so one has to grab every opportunity to raise the little matters that have been mentioned to us. My point is slightly wider than the previous one, and is about the appointment of an independent adviser to the categories of children referred to in the Bill.
<P>
Unlike those Labour Members who bring their professional experience to our proceedings, I have no background in social care. Therefore, I may be mistaken when I suggest that children to whom respite care is offered may include categories with considerable difficulties and problems, for some of whom it may be difficult to find an independent adviser who is a good match. I have seen some children who have left care and been placed with adopted families, and I am aware that the damage that they suffer before they go into care is often still with them when they leave. That means that a great deal has to be worked through. Respite sometimes has to be offered in such situations, because the new families find it difficult to cope with children still traumatised by the original circumstances that led to their being taken into care.
<P>
It is especially difficult to establish good relationships between such children and independent advisers. The charity First Key raised the question of what happens when the relationship breaks down. We must consider that at this point. It is unrealistic to assume that the match will be perfect in all cases. First Key feels strongly about independent advocacy for children leaving care, and the case for independent advocates is strong. I would like the Minister to consider what will happen if such a child fails to thrive with his first, second or even third independent adviser. Is there not a good case to suggest that the role of independent advocate would help in such a situation?
<P>
First Key makes a good point, which is the sort of detail on which the Bill will succeed or fail for children. As children are at the centre of our debate, and as we are trying to put their needs first, we could improve the Bill by including a provision about the breakdown of the difficult relationship between independent adviser and child.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. It is important that we have at least some understanding of how the subject that she raised will be tackled. She may have confused some issues in her closing remarks about advocacy and the role of a young person's adviser. We are currently consulting on how we can ensure that the complaints procedure in social services departments is substantially improved.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The issue of the young persons adviser is slightly different. We have made it clear that we want young people who are covered by the Bill to have access to proper independent advocacy. We are considering the best way of achieving that objective and are currently exploring the matter with local authorities. Furthermore, the quality protects programme identified access to independent advocacy as one of the priority targets for the grant. Exciting and interesting innovations are being produced throughout the country to provide additional advocacy for young people. If advocacy services are available, we expect them to be used when they are needed. For example, their role would be important in the event of a dispute with a local authority about the appointment of a young persons adviser. It is the advocate's role to speak up for the young person. If no young person's adviser is appointed, a young person could turn to an advocate if his or her negotiations with a local authority were proving difficult.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I was interested to hear the Minister's remarks about the fact that the consultation process is occurring in parallel with our consideration of the Bill. One of the difficulties with that approach is trying to see where the eventual results of the consultation will be reflected. I missed the Committee's first sitting, so I am sorry if the matter was discussed then, although I could find no mention of it in Hansard. Does the Bill contain other provisions on the independent advocate that refer back to the clause? I know that the Minister is well versed in the Bill's minutiae, so I am sure that he can help me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am very well versed in the minutiae of the Bill, which contains no provision that deals directly with the appointment of independent advocates. We will address the issue in the reforms that we intend to implement through the social services complaints procedure and in any other statutory guidance that we issue to local authorities. If we wanted to do so, we could conceivably use the Bill's regulation-making powers on complaints to deal with advocacy services. One way or another, we have the tools to do the job. We can use our regulation-making and statutory guidance powers to achieve the result that we all have in mind and to ensure that better advocacy services are available to young people in care on a consistent basis throughout the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): As I understand it, my hon. Friend is saying that advocacy will be available when a complaint is made. That certainly appears to be his intention in respect of the regulations. However, he has spoken positively about general access to advocacy services. Is he not a little uncomfortable with the idea that people who need constructive help will not gain access to an advocate, while those who complain and initiate a negative process will have such access?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> No. I am sorry if I have misled my hon. Friend. We are not saying that advocates will become available only after the triggering of a formal complaints procedure. Such an approach would be rather pointless. We want the young person to have access to an advocate in more informal settings as well. I hope that my hon. Friend is reassured about that. In essence, clause 3 is an enabling clause which allows us to make regulations detailing the provision of personal advisers and pathway plans.
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) is anxious to discuss what happens when the relationship between a young person and adviser breaks down. The guidance will cover that issue, and we want to consult as widely as possible on it with local authorities and other vested interests. Such consultation will also be conducted by the National Assembly for Wales. We are discussing an enabling provision that will trigger further activity when the Bill receives Royal Assent. That activity should involve all interested parties, to ensure that we can achieve a consensus on issues that unite a wide spectrum of opinion. The hon. Lady referred to First Key, with which we have been working closely to ensure that the provisions command the support of young people in care. I am happy to say that, by and large, they do command such support. They will significantly improve the outcome for those children, and I hope that they will contribute to a climate in which society has more ambition for children in care.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page  6, line 23, at end insert `or religious'.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will tell me that the amendment is superfluous and that ``religious'' will be included in the definition of voluntary.
<P>
I move the amendment for three reasons. First, the evolving Conservative policy is to contract out local authority, and especially social services functions, to Church or religious organisations. Now is not the time to expand on my views on that, but should it ever happen it is vital that individuals being looked after in such a way are protected by statute. It would therefore be helpful to have ministerial feedback on that issue.
<P>
Secondly, as a result of my involvement in the Health Committee's investigation on migrant children, I feel slight unease about the uncontrolled and unsupervised involvement of religious organisations in the care of children. It was clear to the Committee that the authorities thought that, because a Church body was looking after the children, nothing needed to be done except to visit it once a year to take tea with the principal&#151;the mother superior. It was thought that the work was being carried out by such respectable people, but it was clear from the evidence given to the Committee that many young people suffer can a lot of abuse as a result.
<P>
Thirdly, I am a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe, which has done much work on the involvement of young people with sects. I know that vulnerable groups of young people can be preyed upon by sects, which use brainwashing methods of indoctrination. That is clearly not in their interests.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will assure me that all organisations involved in the care of young people will be subject to the 1989 Act, whether secular or religious, and that the definition of ``voluntary'' will include the religious sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I have a great fondness for the hon. Gentleman, because he started by asking me to tell him that the amendment was superfluous. That was a kind offer, but I shall not put it as brutally as that. I will use the familiar expression and say that the amendment is unnecessary. I shall explain why.
<P>
Religious organisations accommodate children through their own voluntary organisations. For example, the Children's Society is a voluntary organisation of the Church of England. The same applies to diocesan Catholic children's societies, and there are many other such organisations. Voluntary organisations that accommodate children are subject to the statutory requirements of section 59 of the Children Act 1989. Voluntary organisations are defined for that purpose as bodies whose activities are not carried on for profit.
<P>
There is no need to add the word ``religious'' to the categories of organisations that accommodate children, as they are already covered. It would certainly be undesirable to place them outside the requirements that govern voluntary organisations. The present arrangements are robust and strong enough to avoid the sort of scary scenarios of cult organisations accommodating children that the hon. Gentleman suggested. That is not likely to happen. As for after-care support, children will qualify for advice and assistance on reaching the age of 16 under section 24 of the Children Act, which is restated in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I did not intervene earlier because I wanted to hear what the Minister would say in response to the hon. Gentleman's amendment. Will the Minister also tell us whether the term ``accommodating children'' is defined precisely, perhaps in the Children Act? Subsection (2)(b) is not terribly clear. I wonder whether a child accommodated by a voluntary organisation will qualify under subsection (1). Clearly, the subsection is intended to cover a child in a children's home, perhaps one run by the Children's Society. I am wondering on my feet whether children accommodated with their parents, for example, by other voluntary organisations might be so covered. The Minister would not want that situation to be caught. Is there a clear definition of ``accommodating children'' that excludes such a situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The definition of accommodation is contained in section 59 of the Children Act. It is extensive and includes provisions with regard to accommodating a child such as:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>maintaining him in a voluntary home. . .maintaining him in a community home. . .maintaining him in a registered children's home.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Some of the terms will be affected by the Care Standards Bill, of course. There is no question of the issue of accommodating a child with a voluntary organisation not being covered sufficiently for the definitional purposes in section 59. We are content.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas (Ceredigion):</B> A thought occurred to me while I listened to the Minister's reply to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. Some religious organisations do not achieve charitable status because of their nature&#151;hon. Members might refer to them as cults. Will the Minister confirm that the definition of a voluntary organisation is strong enough to ensure that organisations that do not have voluntary status but are quasi-voluntary also come within the ambit of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am pretty sure that they will; none of us would want to be complacent about the hazards that the hon. Gentleman is talking about. We would not for a second tolerate young people being put at risk by being placed with such organisations. We are alert to those issues. If the hon. Gentleman has further particular concerns, we would be happy to explore them with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. The Bill will insert new sections into the Children Act. The Minister has just drawn my attention to the fact that the definition of ``accommodation'' relevant to the clause is the one used in that Act. No copies of the Act are available in the Room; should there not be some?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that there probably should have been copies in the Room. We can only apologise for the fact that they are not here. I am sure that those responsible have listened to the hon. Gentleman's point of order.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am very happy that my amendment has proved to be superfluous, as I thought that it would be. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 7, line 35, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 38, in page 7, line 40, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> My intention is to explore further the assistance provided to young people leaving care with regard to their training and education, especially up to the age of 24. Attempts to explore that point were made in the other place. The Bill gives permissive powers to local authorities to extend assistance to such young people. It states:
<P>
The relevant local authority may give assistance to a person. . .by. . .contributing to expenses incurred by the person in question in living near the place he is, or will be, receiving education or training.
<P>
The amendments would change that permissive power and place a duty on local authorities. They are similar to an amendment moved in another place by Earl Howe which was supported by Lord Clement-Jones. What progress has been made since then? How do the Government intend to ensure that young people who leave care receive sufficient provision and support up to the age of, say, 24?
<P>
The background, as many Committee members know, is the lack of qualifications held by young people who leave care. That puts them at a tremendous disadvantage. Sadly, 75 per cent. of care leavers have no qualifications. The stark reality is that the national average of young people who leave education with no qualifications is 6 per cent. That is a huge gap. Young care leavers start their adult lives on the back foot and are for ever trying to catch up with the rest of society. We have discussed some of the related problems. They are not intrinsic qualities, but reflect a lack of opportunity and sufficient support.
<P>
We are releasing this group of young people into a world that does not in general support people who wish to study or advance themselves. The Committee is not the place to debate tuition fees or student loans, but they act as a disincentive for care leavers. Not only do they have to find their own way in the world without the parental support that many young people receive, but they have to face a complex system of funding for their future support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman noticed, because it is germane to the subject, that the original text of new section 24A(4) in subsection (5) of the Bill, as introduced in the other place, used the word ``must''? His amendment also relates to subsection (5). Not only did the new subsection place a local authority under a duty to advise and befriend a person, but it specified that it must give him assistance to the extent that his welfare required it. The Government changed that to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may also give him assistance.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That point is relevant to the argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I was not aware of that debate in another place and it is germane to my point, although my amendments relate to new section 24B(1) and (2). I did not know about those changes.
<P>
The first lobbying meeting that I attended after the by-election that put me in the House was on this matter. It was organised, I think, by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan). The message from young people at the ``Voices from Care: Children in Wales'' briefing was that they wanted support for education and training up to the age of 30. I understand that the Minister would blanch at the financial implications of that, but we should support young people when they try to take advantage of the educational opportunities and training that they need to build an independent and successful life.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that care leavers are behind the cohort of young people. They leave school with few educational qualifications and, because they do not have strong parental support, have many other problems to overcome. The Bill tries to make amends for those problems, but we need to move further to complete the circle.
<P>
When Lord Hunt replied on behalf of the Government in the Lords, the message came across strongly that the Government were saying ``when'' and not ``if'' with regard to the provisions. They seemed to intend to support young people in their education and training, but implied that finance was an obstacle to imposing that duty on local authorities. I hope that the Minister has had an opportunity to reconsider that matter in the intervening weeks, and that he will consider it today.
<P>
If 5,000 care leavers leave the care system every year, of whom 4,000 have no educational qualifications whatever, the number seeking support for further or higher education or training will be very small. I accept that, if the legislation has its proper effect, that number will increase, as will the financial burden on local authorities. However, I would have thought that the Government could budget for that in their comprehensive spending review.
<P>
The quality protects programme sets targets for educational outcomes for children in care. Before I left the local authority on whose social services committee I served, I remember that we considered the implications of that programme, and thought of ways in which the authority could ensure that the children attained those outcomes. That process took place in the context of a local authority with the best education results in Wales, so the gap to close was large for children leaving care.
<P>
The fact that those educational outcomes have not been realised means that 50 to 80 per cent. of children leaving care end up unemployed. Twenty-three per cent. of adult prisoners and 38 per cent. of young offenders were formerly in care. That is the result not of the intrinsic values of a person who has been in care but of a system that fails to give educational opportunities. In the course of their three-year programme, the Government have made clear the importance of education, education, education. Education and lifelong learning have been perceived as a way out of the benefit trap and the fourth option.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> During an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre told me that young people leaving care were no more or less likely to become wayward in their behaviour than others. The statistics given to us by the hon. Member for Ceredigion, which the Minister gave us on Second Reading, suggest otherwise. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those statistics are misleading, however, because they include young people who were in the care system, in local authority secure units, as offenders? They were there only because of offending behaviour, so the statistics may be a negative distortion of the likelihood of such young people becoming offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman would intervene when I read out those statistics, because I remember the debates that we had previously. I accept that the statistics may be somewhat skewed, but one cannot quibble with such large figures as 23 per cent. of adult prisoners and 38 per cent. of young offenders being in care. I do not think that offending and then going into care is the main route&#151;it generally happens the other way around. We may add to those figures the fact that 60 per cent. of young people who have been in care are illegal drug users. However, none of those statistics argues for an intrinsic quality in the cohort of young people in care.
<P>
When a young person enters care&#151;excepting the few examples given by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge&#151;he or she is, in the old-fashioned phrase, an innocent child. It is the system and the obstacles placed in such children's way that create the problems that manifest themselves in offending or unemployment. The Bill aims to overcome those problems and it would be improved if we placed a duty on local authorities to give the necessary assistance to young people who want to achieve their full potential, perhaps slightly later than most other young people.
<P>
The Minister said that he wanted more ambition for children in care. I agree with that sentiment; the amendments are an attempt to enable young people leaving care to realise that ambition. As this is the first Standing Committee on which I have sat, and these are the first amendments that I have tabled, any deficiencies in them&#151;which may be manifest and many&#151;are obviously my own. None the less, I hope that I have made their purpose clear. I believe that they are similar to those tabled in the other place and that the Government will respond similarly to them. I hope that we see movement on the provision of sufficient support for young people leaving care.
<P>
The Bill is a good one and it would be a pity to spoil it for the sake of a relatively small amount of finance. The Minister will no doubt feel that that is not a fair point and that Governments must protect all resources. If the Bill were improved along those lines, it would provide young people with a complete support system at every stage up to the age of 24. They could be assured of that support system, which would go a long way towards addressing the long-term costs of a failing system as it manifests itself in offending and drug use. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Member responsible will turn off the pager.
<P>
<B>Ms Julie Morgan </B>(Cardiff, North): I have great sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas). I made similar remarks on Second Reading. I said then that I was concerned that local authorities should use the discretionary power in the Bill. For many years, they have had discretionary power and not used it. I used the example of a local authority in Wales that has 200 care leavers but no budget for helping any of them in that situation.
<P>
I hope that the Minister can reassure us that care leavers will be given help and support when they need it for the courses that they need to go on. We need to change the appalling statistics to which the hon. Member for Ceredigion referred. I appreciate that there is a financial aspect to the issue, but I hope that the Minister will confirm that we can give those young people opportunities to help them to fulfil their potential. They have ended up in a situation in which the local authority has had to act as a parent and they should receive the advantages that all good parents give.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion for introducing the amendment and giving us the opportunity to explore aspects of the Bill. I agree with him and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North that he has raised important issues. The Government are determined to help care leavers into employment, education or training and to give local authorities the proper responsibility to ensure that that happens.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will know that the amendments would place a local authority under a duty to assist with employment, education or training in respect of any care leaver who had been in care for any period after the age of 16. In theory, such duties would apply to a young person who was in care for only one night. I accept that that scenario would be unlikely and do not want to labour the point, but I want to draw attention to a difficult judgment that must be made. We must be sure who we want to help, how we want to help such people and analyse what is wrong with the present system, and that is the motivation behind the Bill.
<P>
The purpose of section 24 is to act more as a safety net for young people who may need further help. Councils will have an opportunity to assist if they agree that it is needed. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would require them to provide that help regardless of whether the young person's welfare needs required that support to be provided. I have much sympathy with his argument and I listened to the worries expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North, who referred to the inadequacies of the power, rather than the duty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> On the point made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, North, how does the Minister foresee overcoming the difficulty when a local authority with discretionary or permissive powers does not allocate any funds to the group of people? I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the group does need support, but how will remiss local authorities be dealt with under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That raises the fundamental issue of the relationship between central and local government and their traditional responsibilities. Where the lines have been drawn is probably right. The Government will allocate the resource envelope to local authorities either through the standard spending assessment route or ring-fenced special grants. It will then be up to the local authority and its elected members to make local preferences and decide on what those resources are spent. The Bill is not trying to disturb the fundamental settlement between local authorities and central Government. Of course, the power of a local authority in respect of the group of care leavers is discretionary, so the statutory guidance powers under section 7 cannot fetter that discretion in a substantial way. They could be used to advise how the discretion could be exercised.
<P>
Although I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, I must say that we have made a difficult decision. We were pressed on the matter last night when we debated the Care Standards Bill. Being in government is about making decisions. I do not share the hon. Gentleman's view that, if we do not accept the amendment, the Bill will be spoiled. Nor do I believe that the issue is about resources. We want to make sufficient funds available to local authorities to allow them to improve substantially the services that they provide for care leavers and that might well include the opportunity for them to provide more effective support to the group of care leavers under section 24 of the Children Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister started his response to the hon. Member for Ceredigion by saying that the present system is that central Government define the resource envelope available to local authorities, either through SSA or special grants, and that the local authorities then determine how they will spend the money. The Minister will recognise that that is slightly disingenuous, as local authorities do not determine how they will spend special grants. In order to receive the money, they normally have to present a detailed analysis of what they intend to do with it.
<P>
That returns us to a point that I have raised with the Minister before. Will he give us a clue as to whether local authorities are to be resourced by special grant for the activities that they will undertake under the Bill or as a part of the general SSA? Specific reimbursement will have a bearing on the willingness and ability of local authorities, especially reluctant ones, to undertake the activities that have been discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Dealing specifically with that point, we made it clear in ``Me, Survive, Out There?&#151;New Arrangements for Young People Living in and Leaving Care'' and subsequent announcements that we envisaged providing local authorities with the resources necessary to implement the Bill through a ring-fenced grant. We are discussing the precise methods to calculate the formula for that and for how much individual local authorities will receive. It is a fine judgment call. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he would prefer the money to be distributed through the SSA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am pointing out that, when we talk about perverse incentives and whether reluctant local authorities will undertake something for which there is a permissive power in the Bill, the methodology of payment will be critical in determining behaviour. Even a reluctant local authority is more likely to undertake those activities if it can recover the money through a ring-fenced special grant, rather than receive the money through the SSA; in the latter case, the reluctant authority could do something else with that money.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. That is why we expressed a preference for a ring-fenced grant. Without being picky, I believe that the ring-fenced special grant is a more directed approach, which is why it stands apart from the SSA. Even with such a grant, it is not true to say that local authorities have no discretion. They do, as is shown clearly in relation to the quality protects programme. Local authorities can choose what they want to spend the grant on, within the priority areas that we have identified. We are trying to ride several different horses at the same time. We want to resource local authorities properly, but we are trying to avoid the mistake that may have been evident in the past of imposing too rigid a straitjacket on them. That mistake would mean that there was no local flexibility to respond to appropriate need. There is little point in forcing people to take action, so it is not strictly necessary.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ceredigion. I also want to make it clear to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North that there will be opportunities in future to allow local authorities to support care leavers from such groups more proactively, and so enable them to deal with the relevant problems.
<P>
I should correct the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, as the wording of proposed new section 24A(4) of the Children Act 1989 has not been changed from ``must'' to ``may''. It has used ``may'' all along, which reflects section 24(6) of the 1989 Act. The wording has become ``must'' to the extent that the welfare needs of former relevant children require it, via new section 23C(4)(c).
<P>
Given those concluding remarks, I hope that the hon. Member for Ceredigion will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> The Minister gave me the response that I expected, given the debate in the other place as well. I thought that there was a small chink in the Government's armour, as he said that the matter was not fundamentally about resources. That implies that he believes that the Bill, as constructed, will do the job, and so there is no need for amendments to improve it, however slightly. The Government will be judged on whether the Bill does its job.
<P>
The Minister sees no need for the amendments. I draw his attention to the recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation report entitled ``Having someone who cares? Barriers to change in the social care of children''. One of the barriers identified as needing to be overcome for looked-after children was ensuring that looked-after children get the most out of the education system. A quote from the education policy officer of the Local Government Association, Barbara Fletcher, sums up my anxieties on the matter:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Deciding to do a lot about education is probably the most worthwhile investment social services can make for looked after children. It is something which is going to last and go with that young person.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Minister assures me that he believes that the Bill will achieve that. Time will tell, and we may revisit the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Mrs. Spelman: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 8, line 12, after `education', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`vocational training or further education'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am pleased that the amendment has been selected, because it would make a helpful addition to the Bill. It deals with a point that I made on Second Reading that was not answered. Our major anxiety is that, although the Bill represents progress for children in care who are trying to gain qualifications and who require accommodation during their studies in order to complete them, provision is made only for those in higher education. We are not criticising that extremely important element of progress, but our proposal, to extend the provision to cover further education, would introduce an element of common sense.
<P>
Children who are in care often have great difficulty with the first stage of their education&#151;compulsory education&#151;and many fail to complete it: statistics show that, at present, 75 per cent. obtain no qualifications. The number of children who leave care to enter higher education must, therefore, be extremely small. In trying to research that information, I could not find the percentage who do so; perhaps the Minister will tell us. Given the resources at his disposal, he might compare that with the percentage who enter further education, as it would be interesting to contrast and compare those figures.
<P>
More vocational opportunities are available to children leaving care, and many prefer to take them, but they face exactly the same problem as faces children leaving care to enter higher education&#151;great difficulty confronts them when the vacation arrives. On the whole, further education colleges operate on a trimester system, with vacations in a 12-month period. For someone who has no parental home to which he can go, as so many young people do&#151;usually penniless, with a large bag of washing&#151;the circumstances can be extremely difficult. As the Bill places us in the role of a corporate parent, our suggestion that the provision should be extended to further education is right.
<P>
The charities that are most involved with children leaving care and their qualifications were at pains to point out the difficulties that care leavers experience that would not be resolved by the Bill. For example, a case study was given to us by First Key, which was recently contacted by a social worker about a young woman approaching her 18th birthday. She has been in foster care since she was five, and the local authority has full parental responsibility for her; her younger brother is also fostered locally. She recently obtained a place on a course, although not, of course, in higher education. Unfortunately, the local housing department proposes that she should move some miles away due to the lack of suitable single person accommodation in the local area. Her social worker believes that it is critical that she is provided with the assistance she needs. The proposed move has aroused considerable fears, as, understandably, the girl wishes to remain near her brother, her friends and her training opportunity. We therefore feel strongly that including further education colleges in the Bill might resolve such situations.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not want to take up time by detailing a catalogue of problems, so I shall refer only to two good case studies. The second illustrates the need to change the Bill. First Key recently spoke to a foster carer of 25 years' experience, Avril McGowan, in relation to a girl called Melanie, whom she had fostered since the age of 12. The girl had been in care, or under a care order, since she was 10 years old. When the girl was 17, Avril fought unsuccessfully for the local authority to allow Melanie to stay with her for an extra year while she finished her foundation course in health and social care. Melanie had previously been picked on and bullied at school, but despite those bad experiences she took up a place at the local further education college last year. According to the foster carer, it is the best thing to have happened to Melanie. She loves the course, which gives her a lot of confidence. She has never missed a day, and has received numerous credits for her work. However, the local social services department not only refused to let Melanie stay on with Avril, but rang to ask
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for a date when she would be leaving.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Social services cut all financial support when Melanie turned 18 last September, and no support was provided by social services to help Melanie find alternative accommodation. The foster parent is extremely concerned that, given Melanie's vulnerability, she is likely to be bullied in the hostel that the social services department recommended. Avril found Melanie a flat near to herself, her daughter and the FE college, and paid the deposit out of her own money. All credit should go to the foster carer for the charity that she showed towards a young girl who wanted only to complete training that would give her a passport to an area of work in which she had genuine interest. I give that example to show what needs to be done to address such a gap.
<P>
We have received representations, as has the Minister, from the Association of Colleges for Further and Higher Education. The association notes that the Bill does not make allowances for further education colleges and highlights the discrepancy whereby proposed new section 24B makes the provision of assistance with living expenses mandatory in circumstances in which the individual concerned is in full-time higher education and needs accommodation during a vacation, but fails to make provision mandatory in the same circumstances for an individual in full-time further education. That anomaly needs to be addressed.
<P>
It is difficult enough for children who have been parted from their birth family and entered care to overcome the considerable obstacles to completing their statutory education and moving on to vocational training or higher education. In many cases, the barriers to study for those young people extend into their early twenties, and I suspect that only a handful surmount those barriers and progress to higher education. In further education, without access to substantial grants or loans from public funds to assist with the costs of study, many care leavers will give up in the face of such difficulty. Obtaining accommodation during vacation periods is acutely difficult for many&#151;it is difficult enough for those of slender means who are in higher education. For such vulnerable children, access to sources of funding can make the difference between completing vocational training and giving it up. We do not expect the Minister to deal with all the discrepancies in the provisions for higher and further education, but we believe that a case can be made for including further education in the clause, which would remove the potential deterrent of the costs of vacation accommodation not being supported.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that Dr. John Brennan, the director of the further education department of the Association of Colleges, wrote to the Minister on 1 June about the anomaly; the association has received no reply, although a reply might have been sent today. We know that promised replies are often sent as we are about to debate an issue, and we are then able to incorporate the answer into the legislation. I apologise if the reply is in the post, but I am unaware of it.
<P>
A strong case can be made for the amendment. Only a small percentage of care leavers go into higher education. I would like to know what that percentage is, and I would also like it to increase. We hope that more and more care leavers will obtain higher education qualifications, because a wider range of more suitable opportunities would be open to those children, which could lead on to employment. We want to give them every opportunity to pursue such courses, and we should do whatever we can to remove the barriers that deter them from obtaining such qualifications. We have to do something about that dreadful statistic of only 75 per cent. of care leavers obtaining educational qualifications, because they need such qualifications for the next stage of their lives. The amendment would allow us to make even more progress.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I support the amendment. It is disgraceful that we still differentiate in all sorts of ways between further and higher education. I expect that it is a hang over from a class-based view of what constitutes proper education. Until the Government get their act together on the education front, especially in respect of funding, and institute equality of access and opportunity between higher and further education, it is essential that a Bill that is supposed to be about not discriminating against care leavers should not itself discriminate between those care leavers who find it more appropriate to go into further education than higher education.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the cogent and well-reasoned arguments made by the hon. Member for Meriden. It would be a travesty if, for financial reasons, only applicants for higher education were supported. Real support needs to be available also to those applying for further education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> I, too, support the amendment. I thank the hon. Member for Meriden for moving it, as it allows the Committee to test the Government's views. It surely cannot be true that the Government want to extend such vocational assistance only to full-time higher education. Further education has vacation periods, as do many vocational courses. The Minister might say that new section 24B(6), which states that the Secretary of State
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may prescribe the meaning of ``full-time higher education'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>is a catch-all provision that covers everything that goes before, but it would be better if the Bill dealt specifically with vocational training and further education. For the foreseeable future, most care leavers who go into training or education will take one of those options, so the Bill would speak more directly to such people and to social services departments if it dealt specifically with them.
<P>
We all know how prescriptions made in regulations can be lost in the back of cupboards. People who look to the Bill for policy on such matters will receive a very narrow impression of full-time higher education. That is why the amendment has considerable merit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has tabled an important and useful amendment. We had an outbreak of the usual consensus early on, as all of us want more care leavers to enter further and higher education and to be supported in doing so. That is one of the key purposes of the Bill, so I am sympathetic to the concerns that the amendment raises.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden asked how many care leavers went into higher education. I am afraid that the statistics are fairly depressing: our data from 1994 and the national child development survey reveal that only 1.1 per cent. of young people who had been in care had a degree at the age of 23. That is a completely unacceptable state of affairs. In the population as a whole, the proportion of people who go into higher and further education is nearer the 40 per cent. mark. I do not have the precise figures to hand; they may be even higher, or the figure I gave might relate only to higher education. The sheer disparity, however, highlights the purpose and rationale of the Bill. These children have not had a fair deal in the past and we are determined to ensure that they get one in future.
<P>
The amendment relates to the duty to provide vacation accommodation for those taking further education courses. I am sure that the hon. Member for Meriden is aware that the duty to provide vacation accommodation for higher education is dealt with in the Bill; the issue regularly arises because the pattern of higher education often means that people move away from home to attend a college or university. However, the issue of vacation accommodation is less likely to arise in the case of people who pursue further education, which is the subject of the amendment, because further education usually occurs closer to home, in places such as the local school, sixth-form college or further education college. Local authorities will have a duty to assist the education of those who are aged 18 and over and who qualify under the Bill. That assistance will obviously involve vacation as well as term-time support.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I recognise that the norm is to attend colleges that are close to home. Does the Minister accept, however, that different circumstances apply in isolated communities such as that which I represent? My area has an excellent college, but its courses are limited and it is inevitable that some young people have to go to the mainland and have to be accommodated there, even when they are going only to college.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I have to say immediately that I have no information on the further education problems in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. Perhaps he and I should consider them in more detail if he is concerned about how they relate to care leavers.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The point that I am making is that a significant number of young people have to travel away from home, even to go into further education, not higher education. I cannot understand why the Bill contains such as divisive framework.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not often disagree with the hon. Gentleman, to whom I might be able to supply more detailed information either this afternoon or in correspondence, but I do not think that he is right to say that having to live away from home to attend further education courses is a significant problem for students. I accept that it might be a problem in parts of the country, where there are geographical obstacles to be surmounted. but it is not such a problem in the mainstream.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Thomas:</B> I am afraid that I must tell the Minister that he is wrong. We in west Wales have a pattern of small further education colleges, and only limited sixth form teaching takes place in local schools, although the situation is improving. I am aware of young people in my constituency who regularly have to travel nearly 70 miles to Carmarthen or Llanelli to attend the courses they want. The likelihood of young people in rural areas owning their own transport is limited&#151;I will not go on about the cost of petrol. Those young people often live away from home, at least during the week, and also have vacation requirements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We will need to explore that issue in more detail. I am advised that, in relation to the country as a whole, the requirement to live away from home to attend a further education college or a sixth form college is not a significant problem, but I accept that there might be an issue in parts of the country. The only argument that I am trying to make to the hon. Gentleman is that it would be a mistake to conclude that the numbers with which we are dealing are substantial. We are, of course, aware that some further education courses, especially at agricultural colleges, require students to live away from home. We want to ensure that those are covered in the guidance issued under the legislation.
<P>
There is already a specific duty in the Bill to provide accommodation for young people aged 16 and 17. The amendment would cover section 24 provisions for a slightly wider group of care leavers who would otherwise not be covered by the new duties. As with an earlier amendment, we are trying to ensure that support is properly targeted where it is needed. Section 24 has always been construed as a safety net provision, giving councils powers to assist care leavers in education and training. My strong view is that those powers should be used when a care leaver not covered by provisions in section 23C would otherwise be debarred from taking up an educational opportunity solely by the lack of somewhere to live during vacations. I hope that that information is beneficial to the hon. Member for Meriden. I am happy to re-emphasise that point in the guidance that we will issue to local authorities for the obvious reason. New express duties are not required.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ceredigion referred to the regulation-making powers in the Bill to define higher education. The definition for these purposes will follow that used by the Department for Education and Employment. That might assist the hon. Member for Meriden, because vocational training, including training for teaching qualifications, would be included. Her amendment referred to vocational training, which might be covered under the existing definitions. Councils have powers to assist with education, which they can use to cover the costs of further education courses both in term time and during the holiday period if they think that that is required. My strong view is that those powers should be used where the young person would otherwise be debarred from taking up a course of further education.
<P>
This is one of those occasions on which I probably have not been able to satisfy any of the hon. Members who have spoken. I can tell that from the look on their faces. I do not envisage the issue on which the hon. Member for Ceredigion has alighted being a significant problem. I am sure that local authorities will be able to sort such problems out by using the powers that they currently have and with which we will assist them through additional guidance.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I recognise that the problem might not be significant from the Minister's point of view, in that it will affect only a small proportion of care leavers, but I put it to him that it is extremely significant for the individuals involved. The Minister's words of comfort go back to the current system, whereby such assistance is discretionary; moreover, it is exercised by local authorities, which have found all sorts of ways of not meeting the requirements, for example, by suggesting cheaper alternatives to care leavers, so that they do not have to provide that assistance. It is clearly discriminatory between university and college students.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I would not cast the issue entirely in those terms. Some of the concerns about vocational training identified by the hon. Member for Meriden can be addressed through our regulation-making power to define higher education. I am sure, for instance, that they will be able to cover the acquisition of teaching qualifications.
<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight was quite right about individuals. I am not sure how many people would be affected, but I am advised that very few care leavers will be caught, although it will certainly be a problem for some. We shall carefully consider ways of ensuring that young care leavers in that situation are not debarred from taking places at colleges of further education if residential attendance is required. We do not want it to happen, and I am confident that in the few cases when it might arise we can find a way to solve the problem.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for finding out the percentage of care leavers who find their way into higher education. It is enlightening but depressing to hear that things have not changed dramatically since 1994, especially as many young people are deterred by the cost of higher education. The figure of 1.1 per cent. is indeed low, and the contrast with the overall figure of 40 per cent. entering further education makes our case on how much more attractive the further education option can be for care leavers.
<P>
I urge the Minister to look again at the question of rural further education colleges. Opposition Members have spoken for rural parts of the United Kingdom. The large education college at Moreton Morrell in my part of the country is in the middle of nowhere, but it is frequented by many further education students because it runs courses for those wishing to take up equestrian studies, farrier work, the management of equine sports and many others. It attracts many students and is national Mecca for those who want to take up such studies, but accommodation in the locality is necessary. People wanting to take up such courses have to consider how to live during the vacations. It may be more of a problem than the Minister realises.
<P>
I hear what the Minister says about the existing powers, but, as in the two case studies I mentioned, local authorities often do not exercise them. We would like to return to that important subject on Report. We all have the same motivation, which is to help care leavers, who had such a difficult start to life, obtain qualifications with which they can gain subsequent employment and set out on a good path. We want to take away any barriers that prevent care leavers from obtaining that happy result. We would do well to spend a little more time on the subject on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 8, leave out lines 20 to 29.
<P>
I hope that the Minister agrees that the lines that my amendment would remove are unnecessary. I understand the importance of the provision in new section 24C(2): when someone leaves an institution, the information should be shared and, presumably, the individual will be informed that the information is shared. However, I cannot understand why there should be a statutory duty on a local authority to inform another local authority when, for instance, a care leaver attends a college. If the home authority and the young person have a good relationship, it is intrusive to require the authority to inform the social services department in the place to which that young person is going to college. No normal parent would take that sort of action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the clause again, because it clearly refers to where the young person intends to live and not simply to where he or she intends to attend college.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> That is splitting hairs. If the young person is accommodated in the place in which he or she attends college, he or she may have shifted his or her domicile to a place outside the original home area. If there is a good relationship between the original sponsoring authority and the individual, it is intrusive to hand a watching brief to the new authority, with which the individual has no relationship. I would have objected strongly if my parents had informed people in my university town that I was around and asked them to keep an eye on me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Not even your Great-Aunt Nellie, who might have taken an interest in your well-being?
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> My Great-Aunt Nellie did not live there but, if she had done, I would have informed her. The Bill creates a structure in which the exchange of information becomes a mandatory duty, rather than a sensible use of resources in the exercise of the local authority's powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the sentiment that the hon. Gentleman is outlining, but does he not perceive a distinction between the children caught under the subsection by virtue of the local authority's duty to keep in touch under new section 23B, and the adults caught by new section 23C or 24? Although I agree with him about new section 23C or 24, I am not so sure about new section 23B. Therefore, I am in a similar position to the one in which he found himself earlier, in that I only partially support his amendment.

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Easy amendments tend to make for complicated arguments. Lines 20 to 29 are of an all-inclusive nature, as is illustrated by the hon. Gentleman's intervention. There may be occasions when the only way in which a responsible local authority can carry out its function is to inform the local authority that is better placed to provide hands-on help or, when appropriate, surveillance. It is important that someone ensures that support is given, as I suggested in my earlier comments about vulnerable young people getting lost in the world of sects. The Bill does not prevent local authorities from exercising its functions through a third party, and that third party could easily be another local authority. However, there seems to be a presumption that some tracking mechanism should follow individuals around the country simply because they are care leavers. That is demeaning to young people and totally unnecessary for the majority who, if the system works, will have a good relationship with their personal adviser and and will work with the local authority on the pathway plan. I see no need to introduce another big brother&#151;because that is how it will be seen&#151;to exercise a function that is probably unnecessary.

<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The hon. Member for Isle of Wight came incredibly close to making the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge when moving amendment No. 12. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but I was listening carefully.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> The real difference between us is that under the Bill the duty of care remains with the original home local authority; to do so, it may use a third party, which may be the current local authority, but I cannot see the need to make that a statutory rule.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Unless I am mistaken, the hon. Gentleman used the phrase ``big brother'' which comes close to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
The official Opposition have a different point to make on the amendment. Unlike the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, we would not endeavour to delete those lines of the clause. The Bill recognises the need for local authorities to communicate. At present, local authorities have no statutory duty to inform other authorities that children leaving their care are now in their area. Exceptions to that rule are if the child has special needs or if a child who might otherwise move back near to an abuser needs to be protected; in such cases, local authorities have to communicate. The Bill makes it clear that the authority from which the child has just come continues to have that responsibility and we agree that that is needed. Many children leaving care gravitate toward London or another major city, but corporate parental responsibility will remain with the local authority from which the child has come. There will be a lot of traffic in one direction, because children leaving care tend to gravitate towards our cities.
<P>
I took soundings from the Local Government Association on the matter. There is no question that there are variations in the organisation of provision for care leavers among local authorities in our large cities, therefore a heavy onus lies on making the communication work effectively. The briefing document prepared for the Bill by the Action on Aftercare Consortium gives the example of a child leaving care in Hull and coming to London; the Hull authority would continue to have responsibility to provide support, advice and so on.
<P>
It is clear that lines of communication between the local authority from which a child has come and the local authority in which he or she lands up needs to be very good. That is why the amendment is not a good idea. There will still be a category of children leaving care who, as outlined in the explanatory notes, want to exercise their rights. There should be no compulsion for the local authority to heavy-handedly keep in touch with them, which is why we wanted amendment No. 12 to be accepted.
<P>
Our position is slightly different from that of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, but the issue is important. The question of allocated resources is at the base of the debate on the success or otherwise of communication between an authority from whom a child comes and one to which he moves. Local authorities will not be able to carry out the communication, which may not necessarily be easy, without the resources. Good new information technology may make it much easier for local authorities to talk to each other, and they will immediately say that they need resources to carry out the new duty properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This is one of the rare occasions on which the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has taken leave of his common sense. He is making a huge mountain out of a molehill. I shall correct him and the hon. Member for Meriden, who said that the duty to inform was new and that there was no equivalent provision. She needs to read section 24(11) of the Children Act 1989, which contains such a provision. Whoever advised her gave duff advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It would have helped my hon. Friend if that legislation had been available in the Room, as it should have been.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, that is nothing to do with me. I am not responsible for providing copies of legislation. We drafted the Bill eight or nine months ago, so I am sure that Opposition spokesmen&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I understood that it was a departmental responsibility to ensure that members of Committees had the relevant documentation available. Am I wrong?

<B>The Chairman:</B> As I understand it, previous legislation is a matter for the House authorities, not for the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful for that clarification, Mrs. Michie. We want to ensure that members of the Committee are fully able to do their jobs properly. The non-availability of a copy of the 1989 Act today should not have led the hon. Lady to make such a mistake.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am not now concerned about what is in the 1989 Act, but I am clear about the fact that the Bill extends the responsibilities of local authorities in the Act. The Act describes circumstances in which there is a duty of care. It is sad that many local authorities do not stick to their duty to inform other local authorities&#151;people are often in a place for months before we know about it. We are extending the role of the local authority, which is a new issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Oh dear. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would not allow us to do precisely what he said that it was a shame that local authorities had not done for many years. We are extending the duties to new categories of care leavers, in relation to whom we shall clearly need to extend the duty to inform. That is common sense. However, it is not logical or accurate to say that there is no precedent for the duty, as there clearly is. His amendment would mean that local authorities would be under no duty to share information with other authorities&#151;that it would not be possible for them to do so even in relation to that category of care leavers whose relationship with the local authority would not be changed by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am interested in the Minister's use of words. He said that it would not be possible for a local authority to be able to inform another authority, which raises an interesting question. Is there a restriction on local authorities not to involve third parties to help them exercise their duties under the Bill without the consent of individuals concerned? If so, my amendment would provide an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Perhaps I used the wrong word, so I apologise. It is important that the local authority should be under a duty to inform, and the hon. Gentleman's amendment would remove the obligation to share information with a neighbouring authority. That would be profoundly unwise. We know that care leavers are often a mobile group. The Bill has several provisions to account for that, notably the definition of the responsible authority as
