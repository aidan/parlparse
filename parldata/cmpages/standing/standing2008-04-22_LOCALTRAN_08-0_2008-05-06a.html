Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): I beg to move amendment No. 258, in
clause 41, page 36, line 20, after
&#145;area&#146;, insert</div>
					<a name="08050729000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including actions to ease
congestion on a highway
network.&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805078000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
afternoon to you, Mr. Taylor. I am happy to move the
amendment. Before the break, we heard about the enthusiasm for
voluntary partnerships, which I am happy to tell the hon. Member for
Wimbledon I share. They are indeed a useful way forward. If they can be
made to work, they are preferable to quality contracts&#151;although
they too have a role. The amendment would make them as attractive as
possible by making it explicitly clear that a voluntary partnership
arrangement can cover</div>
					<a name="0805078000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;actions to ease congestion on a
highway
network&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805078000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would write that definition of a voluntary partnership
agreement into clause 41(2). The Minister might say that such matters
can certainly be taken into account by a voluntary partnership
agreement. If she says that, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment
in due course. However, it is important to put on the record that a
voluntary partnership agreement should cover such matters, not least
because there is reluctance among some local highway or transport
authorities to recognise that they too have a role to play in
delivering better bus services. It is not simply a question of
encouraging bus companies to put on more or better buses. If there is a
problem with the highway network, it can lead to congestion and delays,
which in turn is a significant disincentive for people who wish to
travel by bus.</div>
					<a name="0805078000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example in my constituency is Brighton and Hove Bus and Coach Company,
which has been successful with a voluntary agreement with the local
councils. It has put on extra buses through Lewes to Ringmer and almost
as far Tunbridge Wells, and to Brighton in the other direction. That
has been successful, but there is a major problem with the junction at
Earwig Corner, which is out of Lewes on the way to Ringmer. There has
been complete inaction from the local county council in dealing with
the junction, and the consequence has been a knock-on effect on
punctuality all along the network from Brighton to Tunbridge Wells. Bus
passengers all along that route are being severely disadvantaged. A
voluntary partnership in that area, and more generally, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>ought to pick up such problems. That should be a key part of dealing
with any agreement between bus companies and local councils. I would
welcome the Minister telling me whether that is the case. In
parenthesis, if she can put any pressure on East Sussex county council
to sort out that junction, it would be even more
welcome.</div>
					<a name="0805078000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000447"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Transport (Ms Rosie
Winterton):
						</b> Welcome back to the chair, Mr.
Taylor.</div>
					<a name="0805078000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Lewes has noted, the definition of a voluntary partnership
agreement requires the local authority to undertake to provide
facilities that might include bus lanes, new bus shelters and so on, or
do anything else for the purpose of bringing benefits to bus
passengers. We have deliberately cast that definition quite widely
because of comments that we received during the consultation process
from the Passenger Transport Executive Group and others.</div>
					<a name="0805078000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
it seems likely that if a local authority agrees to take action to help
address traffic congestion, it should deliver benefits to bus
passengers in the form of reduced and more predictable journey times.
As long as passengers are expected to benefit in that way, the existing
definition of a voluntary partnership agreement in the Bill already
delivers the effect that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would
have. I understand the point that he is making, but I think the matter
is covered in the Bill. I hope that provides the reassurance that he is
seeking and enables him to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000448"></a>Norman

those sorts of measure are included in the wider definition. I thought

						<a name="0805078000449"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Hammond</b> (Wimbledon) (Con): Good afternoon, Mr.
Taylor. I want to register some other issues about competition and to
get some comments from the Minister.</div>
					<a name="0805078000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister said earlier, the Government are working closely on this part
of the Bill with the Campaign for Better Transport and she has rightly
acknowledged the input of that organisation. I would like to raise an
issue that has not been tackled and which concerns the
organisation&#151;that the changes made by the clause and by schedule
2 affect the way in which agreements between operators and local
authorities are deemed to be in the public interest or not. In effect,
they allow competition law to be relaxed so that bus companies can
discuss how best to work in partnership.</div>
					<a name="0805078000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">What has not yet been discussed
is how that competition law might relate to the integration of other
modes of transport. Although bus companies compete with one another,
they also compete with other modes of transport, most commonly the car
and the tram.</div>
					<a name="0805078000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">What can
the Minister tell us about how the market might be defined? For
example, a merger between two bus companies to create a dominant
operator in a given area could be seen as anti-competitive if looking
at the bus market alone and it might fall foul of competition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>law while actually enhancing bus patronage. If the product of the merger
were to improve the attractiveness of buses overall, there might be a
switch from car to bus, something I am sure the Minister would seek to
encourage. In what circumstances might she be prepared to look again at
how we might define the market? What consultation has the Office of
Fair Trading had with the Department about the bigger picture? Buses do
not just compete with themselves, they compete with other modes of
transport as
well.</div>
					<a name="0805078000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000450"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> That is an interesting contribution from the hon.
Member for Wimbledon. There is also the question of what happens when
the bus competes with the train and whether that should be taken into
account, particularly if the bus company and the train company are run
by the same parent, which does happen. Companies such as First run
buses and trains, sometimes in competition with each other. How do we
deal with that situation?</div>
					<a name="0805078000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000451"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The point is that what we are trying to achieve
here is limited to the competition between bus services. We are talking
about voluntary partnership agreements between local authorities and
bus operators. I take the point that there might be times when it is
important to take into account that a railway service might be running
along the same route but we are talking about the specific situation
where bus operators are allowed to run along particular routes as and
when they want, if it is a commercial service. In other areas a subsidy
can be given by the local authority.</div>
					<a name="0805078000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to get over the
fact that it has been difficult for one or more bus operators to sit
down with the local authority and work out, for example, what might be
appropriate in terms of the frequency of patterns of
service&#151;that is definitely between the bus operators themselves.
We have discussed at other points in the Bill whether it would be a
good idea, when considering overall integrated transport plans, to look
at how bus services fitted in with rail services, for example. However,
in this case, we are talking specifically about the issues of bus
operators, because they would be talking about running along particular
routes&#151;the local authority would like to sit down with them and
organise such things as the patterns of service. I take on board the
comments made by the hon. Member for Wimbledon, but that would fit into
another part of how the local authority or integrated transport
authority would want to look at other services in its overall transport
plan.</div>

							<a name="0805078000454"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I am speaking to a series of amendments dealing
with one particular theme, which we discussed when we looked at the
quality partnerships part of the Bill. Local authorities have some
powers to impose restrictions on bus services that operate in an area
where a quality partnership is also in operation. Clause 43 looks at
the issue from the other side&#151;that of the prospective traffic
commissioner. My amendments are motivated by a concern that some
unnecessary and inappropriate restrictions are being placed on traffic
commissioners carrying out their functions. Under the provisions of the
clause, when the traffic commissioner receives an application for a
registration in an area where a quality partnership is in operation, he
must first give notice to the authority and the operator or operators
party to the new quality contracts scheme. The authority or the
operator may make representations to the traffic commissioner, which he
must consider in making his
decision.</div>
					<a name="0805078000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to see why that provision is necessary. When traffic
commissioners decide whether to accept the registration applications
made by the operators, they already take into account all local
circumstances that might be affected by such a registration. The
traffic commissioner will know about the quality partnership in the
area, and will bear in mind the impact that he believes additional
registrations would have. I am not clear why he needs to be placed
under the obligation to take into account additional representations.
It seems to me that an element of the clause is telling the traffic
commissioner how to do his job, which is neither necessary nor
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0805078000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000455"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The clause will give traffic commissioners
powers to determine whether applications to register new services, or
to modify or withdraw existing ones, would be detrimental to a quality
partnership scheme. That is linked to measures in clause 13, which
would allow a local transport authority to include registration
restrictions in a scheme. When making such decisions, the traffic
commissioner must apply the registration criteria contained in the
scheme. The clause sets out the procedure to be followed when an
application to which such restrictions apply is received. If the
traffic commissioner decides that an application would be detrimental
to the quality partnership scheme, he may turn it down, he may require
the applicant to amend it or he may require them to undertake that they
would provide services to the standards specified in the scheme. The
clause also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>provides a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal against decisions
of the traffic
commissioner.</div>
					<a name="0805078000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
included the provisions in response to concerns that a successful
quality partnership scheme could be undermined by disruptive
competition&#151;by competitors not prepared to meet the standards
specified in the scheme. The purpose is to protect operators and
authorities that might have made significant investment in facilities
or standards of service. The provisions also provide protection for the
passengers who benefit from the improvements in service that a scheme
should
bring.</div>
				
					<a name="0805078000412"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="0805078000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would prevent the traffic commissioner from making an
assessment as to whether a registration application would be
detrimental to services provided under a quality partnership scheme. He
would instead be limited to basing his decision on the registration
criteria and the representations and evidence put before him. He would
obviously have to consider representations from operators and
authorities as part of the decision-making process. Indeed, if no such
representations are made, the legislation stipulates that he must
accept the application.</div>
					<a name="0805078000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the changes are necessary. It is important that the traffic
commissioner should be able to make such assessments, as that will
ensure that quality partnership schemes cannot be undermined in the
ways that I outlined earlier. We included the provision for
registration restrictions to help prevent destabilising
competition&#151;it is often seen in so-called bus wars&#151;which
can affect operators that have invested in quality partnership schemes
and the passengers who need the services. We believe that limiting the
assessment strictly to the relevant representations with authorities
and operators would diminish the commissioner&#146;s ability to make
an informed decision. That is why I urge the hon. Member for Wimbledon
to withdraw the amendment.</div>

is a quality contract scheme in operation, subject to certain
qualifications. Clause 44 re-examines the issue and makes some
modifications to the rules that govern the registration of services in
areas where a quality contract scheme is operational.</div>
					<a name="0805078000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">My belief that the clause
requires some change stems from a number of concerns. That will be no
surprise to the Committee. First, is it right to restrict free
competition, let alone in an area with a quality contract? Should other
operators not be able to run services alongside the quality contract if
they see a demand? Last week, the Minister put it on record that if a
service was not detrimental to the quality contract she would regard it
as acceptable. The services provided under a quality contract may or
may not suffice in providing the services that locals require. It is
possible that the network of services could be improved.</div>
					<a name="0805078000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly&#151;I return to my
fear that the traffic commissioners will end up being
micro-managed&#151;the provisions of the Bill and of previous
legislation are designed to ensure that traffic commissioners are given
certain functions and that they have the appropriate proficiency,
resources and independence to carry out those functions. Beyond that,
it should not be necessary to interfere in their work. One of the most
important functions of traffic commissioners is the registration of
buses. They receive the registration application and, having weighed
all the pros and cons, they have to decide whether to accept or reject
it. Under the clause, they will be told who to consult and how to reach
that decision, but that calls into question the very independence of
the traffic commissioner.</div>
					<a name="0805078000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
removes from the traffic commissioner the function of accepting
registrations It does so by placing an obligation on the traffic
commissioner to invite representations from the relevant local
authority. If he receives a clearance certificate, he has no choice but
to accept the application. If he does not receive a clearance
certificate he has no choice but to reject the application. All he is
at that point is a thoroughly pointless middleman who does nothing but
pass the application on to the local authority to be approved, or not.
I am not sure that that was what the Government intended the traffic
commissioner to do at that point. One wonders why he becomes just a
pointless
middleman.</div>
					<a name="0805078000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment would work in two ways. First, it would put an obligation on
the traffic commissioner to consult not only the local authority
running the quality contract scheme but the approvals board that
approved it. That is important, as the board will consist of
independent, qualified individuals with an intimate knowledge of the
arrangements of the quality contract scheme and its impact on the
registration of additional services. Secondly, the amendment would
remove from the clause the subsections that require the traffic
commissioner to comply with the issuance or non-issuance of a clearance
certificate. A traffic commissioner should not need to be told by
anyone how to do his job. His job is to decide on the registration of
bus services, but the clause takes that
away.</div>
					<a name="0805078000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000460"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments
would place decisions as to whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>additional services could be operated in an area covered by a quality
contracts scheme with the traffic commissioner, rather than the local
authority that made the scheme. Perhaps I could briefly explain the
purpose behind the clause. It provides an exception to the general rule
that in an area where a quality contracts scheme is in place, all
services must be provided under quality contracts. That means that no
other services can be registered with the traffic commissioner to
operate in the area. There is already a power for the authority to
exclude certain services or types of service from the scheme, and they
may be registered with the traffic commissioner in the usual way. For
example, long-distance services with only one or two stops in the
scheme area might be excluded, or services for a niche market such as
tour buses or works
buses.</div>
					<a name="0805078000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">A need or demand
may arise, however, during the lifetime of a scheme for services that
were not anticipated when the scheme was developed, and which might be
advantageous, or further niche services might be identified that would
not particularly affect the viability of the scheme one way or another.
It would be very unsatisfactory if there were no way of allowing those
services to be provided other than by formally amending the scheme. The
clause would give the local transport authority the discretion to allow
operators to run additional services that were not detrimental to the
scheme, and those services would be registered with the traffic
commissioner in the normal
way.</div>
					<a name="0805078000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
normal circumstances, traffic commissioners do not have the power to
reject applications to register, provided the operator is licensed. It
is right that the local transport authority that made the scheme in the
first place should decide whether a proposed new service is compatible
with the quality contracts scheme. The amendments would take that
function away from the local authority and give it to the traffic
commissioner. He would apparently have total discretion as to what to
allow and what to reject. Although the local transport authority would
be consulted, the decision would be entirely out of its hands. That
would make it possible, for example, for an operator to register a
service that would compete with one provided under a quality contract,
possibly undermining the financial basis of the
contract.</div>
					<a name="0805078000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
providing flexibility is to allow the local authority to say that it
accepts that a particular service will not undermine the quality
contracts scheme, and that it is happy for it to go ahead and for it to
be registered with the traffic commissioner. We believe that the local
authority that made the scheme should have the discretion to do so, and
we do not believe that the decision should be handed over to the
traffic commissioner. I hope that that explanation is useful and that
the hon. Member for Wimbledon will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="0805078000461"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> That was helpful in some ways, but not entirely.
I was trying to explore why the traffic commissioner becomes just a
middleman at this point. What is his function if he simply passes round
pieces of paper? It is right that the local authority should be
consulted, but ultimately the traffic commissioner should have the
chance to look at the application.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000462"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It would just mean that a service would be
registered with the traffic commissioner in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>normal way. As I have said, in normal circumstances, if an operator is
licensed, it simply registers with the traffic commissioner. The point
is that that would happen during a quality contracts scheme. In normal
circumstances, it would not be allowed to register, but if the local
authority agrees that it can do so, it would register in the normal
way.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): For the benefit of the
Committee, will the Minister put this clause into context and tell us
what eventuality will be covered by it that escapes the scope of
current legislation? Will the clause be used to deal with transient
problems or only where there is a persistent and permanent problem or
an anticipated persistent and permanent

							<a name="0805078000465"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The clause will extend the circumstances in
which a traffic authority may ask the traffic commissioner to impose
traffic regulation conditions on bus operators to include situations in
which the authority foresees a likely traffic problem. Under current
legislation, a traffic commissioner can impose traffic regulation
conditions on operators of local bus services following a request by
the traffic authority in response to a traffic problem in a particular
area. Traffic regulation conditions may be imposed only to prevent
danger to road users, to reduce severe traffic congestion or to reduce
or limit noise or air pollution. The conditions are attached to the
public service vehicle operator&#146;s licence of the bus operators
providing services in the area where the conditions apply. For example,
they may prevent certain operators from using certain routes, or
stipulate that operators may stop at certain places for no longer than
a given time. They may also restrict the use of noisy tourist
commentaries or specify minimum emissions standards.</div>
					<a name="0805078000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to consultation on
the draft Bill, a number of people told us that the problem with those
provisions was that they could be used only where a problem had already
arisen, resulting in a delay before the conditions could be imposed,
during which time serious problems might arise, such as severe
congestion and danger to road users arising from so-called bus wars. We
appreciate that difficulty, so provisions in this clause mean that a
traffic authority can make a request to the traffic commissioner for
traffic regulation conditions to be imposed in anticipation of a
problem, rather than after it has arisen, which will help
traffic  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>authorities to be proactive in dealing with potential problems. I
believe that that will help reduce congestion and provide a quicker,
safer and more reliable service for passengers. I hope that the

Mr. Taylor. Will the provision be used to deal with
transient problems? For example, the borough of Sandwell has an annual
transport weekend on which it takes over a large field and has a
display of vehicles going through the town centre. Will the provision
be used to deal with such occasions, which perhaps occur only once a
year, but when they do are massive, change the pattern of congestion in
a town or city and clearly need to be

tell us whether the regulations, because they refer to the safety of
passengers, will deal with the situation that arose in the north of
Greater Manchester where the wheels kept falling off
FirstGroup&#146;s buses? This is not a joke; it was a serious danger
to passengers. An inquiry found FirstGroup in Rochdale in north Greater
Manchester not fit and proper to be running that route. It registered a
wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstGroup to run exactly the same routes.
The traffic commissioner was just applying the law. The passenger
transport authority, which had instigated this inquiry, was incensed,

					<a name="0805078000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of this probing
amendment is to encourage the Minister to explain to the Committee why
a bus operator should be required to pay a fee for cancelling the
registration of one of its services, if that fee is beyond that which
covers the administration. A fee is already payable when a service is
registered under the provisions of the Transport Act 1985. The
circumstances in which a fee is payable are extended by this clause so
that a fee can also be incurred when a service is continued or
cancelled.</div>
					<a name="0805078000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to be reassured by the Minister that the only purpose of charging a fee
is for recovering administrative costs. If so, could she give us some
indication of how she intends to give guidance on how these costs will
be calculated and how the traffic commissioners are going to set these
fees? Can she reassure us that they are set only at a level that covers
administrative costs. I am sure that in the interests of maximum
patronage, in certain areas operators must be given flexibility to
respond to the demands of the travelling public. If it were a punitive
fee, there would be some serious issues about what was being provided.
I understand that costs must be covered, but I seek a guarantee from
the Minister that the purpose of the clause is to cover administrative
costs only. What guidance does she intend to give on how those
administrative costs might be
assessed?</div>

							<a name="0805078000471"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> It might help if I put it in the context of
what we are trying to achieve in clause 47, which will allow the
Secretary of State to update the range of fees payable by the operators
of local bus services. I stress that any new fees would be set out in
regulations and subject to further consultation.</div>
					<a name="0805078000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regime covering the fees
paid by the operators of local buses has remained unchanged for the
past 20 years. Before an operator can start running a bus service, he
must register the particulars of that service with the local traffic
commissioner, and a fee is payable then. If he wants to vary the
details of the scheme&#151;for example, by introducing a new
timetable or changing the number of services&#151;a further fee is
payable. However, he does not have to pay a fee if he cancels the
service altogether, which carries a transaction charge, or if he simply
leaves it as it is.</div>
					<a name="0805078000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause will allow the
Secretary of State to make regulations to provide for fees to be
payable in additional situations. For example, a fee could be charged
for the cancellation of a local service. What is known as a
continuation fee could also be charged&#151;perhaps an annual fee
where registration particulars are unchanged. Holders of a bus
operator&#146;s licence already pay a fee in order for their licence
to continue in force. A number of right hon. and hon. Members have
pointed out that we need to ensure that the traffic commissioners are
properly resourced. They are at the heart of ensuring that bus
operators deliver good services and will play an important role in
enforcing the new punctuality regime. I stress that no decision has
been taken to increase the fees burden on operators at this stage, but
it is important to think ahead. That is why we have taken the powers. I
hope that the hon. Member for Wimbledon will understand why we
have done so and withdraw his amendment.

declare an interest as chairman of the all-party historic vehicles

						</b> The amendment is to a clause that was inserted
into the Bill in another place in response to a very well-argued
proposal made by Baroness Chapman, who is certainly a doughty
campaigner on this issue. The clause, in conjunction with clause 50,
will place certain duties on the drivers of wheelchair-accessible taxi
buses&#151;that is, taxis and private hire vehicles used to provide
local bus services&#151;when carrying passengers in wheelchairs. The
provisions will make it optional for local authorities to maintain a
list of such wheelchair-accessible vehicles. Once such a list was in
place, the duties in section 36 of the 1995 Act would apply to the
drivers of taxi buses designated as wheelchair accessible. Those duties
include helping a person in a wheelchair to get in and out of a taxi,
carrying them in safety and comfort and not making an additional charge
for doing so. Failure to observe the duties could lead to a criminal
prosecution and
fine.</div>

would place an obligation on all local licensing authorities to
maintain a list of vehicles being used to provide wheelchair accessible
taxi buses. However, we do not think that that is either necessary or
desirable. As I have said, the Bill allows local licensing authorities
the option of maintaining the list if they have wheelchair accessible
taxi buses that provide services in their area and they decide to
designate them. That is in line with the Government&#146;s general
policy on taxis.</div>
					<a name="0805078000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
licensing authorities are normally given particular powers, but they
are able to use their own discretion about whether to use them. There
are about only 200 taxi buses that provide local bus services, although
we hope that that figure will rise as a result of other provisions in
the Bill. Only some of those taxi buses will be wheelchair accessible.
Also, not all local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>licensing authorities will have taxi buses operating in their area, so
there will be no need either to designate wheelchair accessible taxi
buses or to maintain a

						</b> I rise to ask the Minister to clarify the
intention of the clause. The Transport Act 1985 enables permits to be
granted to educational, religious, social, welfare and other bodies so
that they do not need a public service vehicle operator licence. Is it
the purpose of the clause to take that to a new level? I understand
that the 1985 Act covers all possible vehicles, so does the clause mean
that if a vehicle carries fewer than nine passengers no permit will be
required, and that therefore an educational body that operates a
vehicle with fewer than nine seats will not require a permit as per the
1985
Act?</div>

						</b> Clause 53 will make amendments that are
consequential to the provision in clause 52, which extends the scope of
section 19 permits to cover vehicles with fewer than nine seats. Such
vehicles are not what most of us would consider a bus. That will allow
educational and other bodies to provide transport services for their

keep records to aid better
enforcement.</div>
					<a name="0805078000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 52

whose annual turnover is more than &#163;150,000 per annum, or such
higher amount as the Secretary of State may by order
define.&#148;&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0805078000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said on Second Reading, any proposals with the consequence of helping
community transport will certainly enjoy my support, and the clause
will do that by allowing larger vehicles to be used for community
transport and by removing the prohibition on paying drivers of
community transport
vehicles.</div>
					<a name="0805078000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
very welcome, but not perfect. I have two major concerns, which are
reflected in my proposals. The first proposal is important, because it
goes to the question of safety. We want to introduce words that would
ensure that community transport drivers were adequately trained. Later
this year, a new certificate of professional competence will
be introduced for drivers of other buses and coaches. The CPC will be
issued on behalf of the Department for Transport, in accordance with
the law, and will be a requirement for all professional bus drivers, in
addition to a driving
licence.</div>
					<a name="0805078000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rightly in my
opinion, the CPC is not a requirement for drivers of community
vehicles&#151;we want to establish greater community transport.
However, there is specialist community transport training available in
the form of MIDAS&#151;the minibus driver awareness scheme.
Therefore, although community transport drivers do not face the higher
test, the lower test would help to ensure safety. MIDAS addresses
issues such as driver confidence and passenger safety and comfort. That
is a useful way forward and something that the Secretary of State could
define by order: community transport drivers would get the specialist
training required for their vehicles, giving reassurance to those using
that transport but without having to fulfil the much higher
test.</div>
					<a name="0805078000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another proposal
looks at what we might call the social businesses or the
not-for-dividend sector. A number of community transport schemes
provide an excellent service, but I am concerned at the scope for some
non-professional bus operators to take advantage  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>of a loophole in the legislation. There are a number of operators who
turn over large amounts and who, potentially, would not require a
licence.</div>
					<a name="0805078000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
ensure that cowboy operations do not take advantage of the rules for
community transport providers. The amendment relates to those community
transport organisations, which are clearly focused on being not for
dividend, although they follow some commercial strictures. For example,
we all know that Ealing Community Transport provides an excellent
service across the country and it decidedly could not be called a
cowboy. However, unless there is a turnover test&#151;I am not sure
that I have got the turnover level right&#151;the clause could become
a loophole for cowboys to provide a service under the guise of
community transport, which is a term that should describe organisations
that provide transport in communities for those who have difficulty
getting around or that provide a service in excess of the norm. Perhaps
a number of charities and others would use
it.</div>
					<a name="0805078000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">These proposals are
important. Will the Minister give reassurance that the turnover test is
not necessary? If it is not necessary, will she explain how cowboy bus
operators will be prevented from using the clause? Will she also us why
the lower level of driver training cannot be put in place relatively
cheaply to provide some reassurance to those people who will use
community
transport?</div>
					<a name="0805078000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000483"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> The measure is extremely popular and it has
been widely welcomed by the community transport sector for two reasons:
it will allow community bus services to use larger buses and remove the
restriction that prevents drivers of those services from being paid.
That welcome from the community transport sector is one reason why I
was surprised that Opposition Front Benchers voted against the Bill on
Second Reading. We will all have received representations from our
constituents who have tried to run those excellent services but have
been constrained in how they can do
so.</div>
					<a name="0805078000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause relates
to the section 22 permits that are available to the operators of
community bus services. The services we discussed before were the
section 19 aspect of community service. Section 22 permits allow a
non-profit-making voluntary body that is concerned with the social and
welfare needs of a community to provide local bus services for the
general public. Unlike section 19 permits, they can be issued only by
the traffic commissioners, who must be satisfied that the body using
the permit has adequate maintenance
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="0805078000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, operators who provide services under the permits are restricted
to using vehicles that can carry between nine and 16 passengers. The
clause will enable buses with more than 16 passenger seats to be used
to provide community transport services under section 22
permits.</div>
					<a name="0805078000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also under
current legislation, drivers of such services cannot be paid, as I
said. However, many people, particularly from the community transport
sector, told the Government that that places an unnecessary restriction
on the provision of the services, because it is often not possible for
community groups to find enough volunteer drivers to run them. The
clause will remove that restriction.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> I refer back to the point that I made in
response to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, which
referenced his new clause, which would require operators of community
transport services to check that everybody driving a vehicle on their
behalf is not registered on the sex offenders register. I want to make
it clear that the Bill does not provide for that, but I emphasise the
existing safeguards and checks on community transport drivers. Much of
the work of community transport organisations will be done under a
contract to a local authority or other public body, which can make it a
condition of contract that the drivers used have all been subject to a
criminal record check. Where necessary, that check can be to the
enhanced level of enclosure to provide all the information to the
Criminal Records Bureau.</div>
					<a name="0805078000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the Government are now implementing the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups
Act 2006, which obtained Royal Assent in November 2006, and which was
introduced specifically in response to recommendation 19 of the Bichard
inquiry report. The Act provides the legal framework for the new
independent safeguarding authority scheme. Under the SVG Act, those who
exclusively transport children and/or vulnerable adults are subject to
the requirements of the new scheme. The ISA&#146;s role will be to
consider all relevant information relating to the risk of harm posed by
persons seeking to work with children or vulnerable adults in either a
paid or voluntary capacity, and to bar those considered unsuitable for
such work. The scheme will be launched in October 2009; that will allow
systems to be developed and legislation laid, and it will give
organisations time to prepare for the introduction of the most robust
and thorough vetting and barring scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805078000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will ensure that the Home
Office is aware of the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
Manchester, Blackley about drivers of community 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>transport. As I said, new clause 1 is not included in our debate, but I
shall ensure that the Home Office is aware of what has been
said.</div>
					<a name="0805078000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for amendment
No. 243, moved by the hon. Member for Wimbledon, I can tell him that
safety is obviously an important consideration in the operation of
community transport. However, we have to consider whether there is a
problem and if so whether what he proposes is the right solution.
Section 22 operators are a relatively rare breed, and we obviously
cannot draw many conclusions about their safety record from that small
sample. When we consider the much larger body of community transport
that operates under section 19 permits, which includes both paid and
unpaid volunteer drivers, there is no evidence that volunteer drivers
are unsafe compared to those driving similar vehicles
commercially.</div>
					<a name="0805078000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Road
accident statistics are generally based on vehicle type rather than
usage. The minibus category is split three ways&#151;between purely
private use, the voluntary sector and the commercial sector. The safety
record is pretty high across the board. Only recently did it become a
legal requirement for commercial bus drivers to undergo formal
training, as distinct from passing the appropriate driving test,
although the requirement does not come into force until September. At
the moment, therefore, we do not have much evidence about its effect on
road safety.</div>
					<a name="0805078000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that the amendment would not require the full rigours of the commercial
training regime to be imposed on voluntary drivers, although that would
be the logical outcome of the arguments being put forward. The
voluntary sector itself provides a great deal of training. For good
reasons, it has always done so. Apart from the question of public
safety, it would not be sensible to put rather expensive vehicles into
the hands of incompetent drivers.</div>
					<a name="0805078000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not opposed to training,
but the question is one of proportionality. We have to bear in mind
that if we were to require the community transport sector to undertake
what could be fairly rigorous training, it would place quite a burden
on it. We must put that in the context of the later part of the
amendment, which is about a scheme being not for
profit.</div>
					<a name="0805078000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing
regulation-making power could be used to impose a training requirement
on the drivers of vehicles used under section 22 permits. That is
already in the Bill, so that part of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is unnecessary for technical reasons. Although I am rejecting
the amendment, I assure him that I do not rule out the introduction of
a driver training requirement if a real need for it is identified in
future.</div>

							<a name="0805078000492"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I turn to the second part of the amendment,
which would place a limit on the annual turnover of a community bus
operator. It has always been a requirement of the permit regimes for
the voluntary sector that buses are not operated with a view to profit,
either directly or indirectly. I understand that the bodies that
currently operate under section 22 permits are very small, and that the
services that they operate are, almost by definition, ones that would
not be of interest to a commercial operator.</div>
					<a name="0805078000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hope that such services will
expand; members of the Committee have already made points about the
rural bus sector. Such services provide the community transport sector
with a lot of opportunities to expand, but I do not imagine that it
will be in a position to compete with commercial operators, nor do I
believe that it would want to. That part of the amendment is,
therefore, not necessary either, because it is already covered in the
permit regime. I hope that has answered the questions asked by the hon.
Member for
Wimbledon.</div>
					<a name="0805078000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about cowboys, and I draw his attention to section

maintaining in a fit and serviceable condition any vehicle used under
the permit.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805078000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have illustrated that although I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points about safety and not-for-profit restrictions, those matters are
adequately covered under the current
system.</div>

foresight to bring in measures that she believes I do not need to
insert into the Bill. I think that she would none the less
agree&#151;this is one reason why I wished to explore the
matter&#151;that the clause potentially allows a larger number of
drivers in the community transport field, in some cases driving bigger
vehicles than they have driven before. The whole matter of safety must
be considered, and I hope that the Minister will think again. My
amendment does not specify what has to be done, but it gives the
Secretary of State the chance to define safety training by order at
some stage. That is extremely important, as my concern is that the Bill
will widen the field of people who operate the vehicles in
question.</div>

those operating them as a commercial route and not following all the

transport route. I hear what the Minister had to say, but that is not
the representation I have received from various parts of the industry.
There is real concern that rogue&#151;rather than

will require traffic commissioners to keep records of community
transport permits granted by them and copies of permits submitted to
them by designated bodies. It is important that we have a better record
than we do at the moment of what community transport services operate.
The existing legislation does not place an obligation on the traffic
commissioners to keep records of permits, although we understand that
records are held by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency on their
behalf. As I said, we believed that it was important to improve our
record keeping of community transport operators and that it was right

be retained while the permit was in force. Other provisions in the Bill
will introduce time-limited permits. One of the issues that has come up
is that some permits were given out that had perhaps expired a long
time before. For the community transport sector as a whole, it is
important to have not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>only good records, but up-to-date records and to know exactly what is in
operation at a particular time. Some difficulties had arisen previously
where permits had been given out, the service had completely stopped
operating, but nobody had any idea about it. As to who will be able to
see the records, I shall have to write to the hon. Member for Wimbledon
about that. I cannot see that there would be any problem with there
being a public record of what permits were available. However, I would
like to take the opportunity to check that and ensure that in any
consultation we have done with the community transport world we have
explored the options, so I shall come back to the Committee on that.

Knight:
						</b> I do not want to make a meal of this. I think that
the Minister has been helpful, but may I make two points? First, would
she write to all members of the Committee and not just to my hon.
Friend the Member for Wimbledon on that particular point? Secondly,
would she be prepared to reflect on the length of time these records
should be kept? For example, there did not use to be a legal duty on
lawyers in the United Kingdom to keep the papers when they had finished
a case, but most lawyers now keep the papers for about seven years in
case an issue arises after the matter is finalised, where the papers
can be of help. I realise that this situation is not entirely on all
fours with what lawyers do with case paperwork, but an issue may arise
after a permit expires for which it would be helpful to see the
document itself, to see if any conditions were imposed in it and so
on.</div>
					<a name="0805078000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister could reflect on that and tell us on Report whether she
feels&#151;I am not suggesting that it should go into the Bill, but
perhaps it should be in practice directions&#151;that it is something
on which she would want to advise the traffic

be circumstances where retaining the paperwork was appropriate, and the
reasons for doing so. I would not like to ask the traffic commissioners
to maintain excessive amounts of information, but I am prepared to ask
the community transport sector whether that is something that would be
helpful. I do not think that that would be a matter for the face of the
Bill, but it might be something that we could talk to the traffic

							<a name="0805078000503"></a>Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> This string of amendments relates to the power of
the traffic commissioner to attach conditions to operator licences.
These conditions can be attached if the operator in question has failed
to comply with the requirements and specifications of his licence. Such
conditions can relate to the specific vehicles that can or cannot be
used by the offending operator. Broadly, that is something that
everybody will support, but the detail of clause 57 contains a much
wider extension to the power of the traffic commissioner and I am not
sure whether the Government meant that
intentionally.</div>
					<a name="0805078000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
looking for some reassurance from the Minister regarding the
Government&#146;s intention, for the clause will enable the traffic
commissioner to attach conditions not only to the licence of which the
requirements have been breached, but to other licences held by that
operator, and even to licences held by other operators connected with
the offending operator. I am worried that those powers are excessive in
the extreme, and that the punishment would be worse than the
crime.</div>
					<a name="0805078000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems wholly
inappropriate that if an operator breaches the rules of its licence,
another operator, even a related or subsidiary company, can be punished
for the same offence, unless the traffic commissioner were going to
attach conditions to all those licences as well. I cannot think of
similar circumstances where such wide and varied penalties have been
proposed.</div>
					<a name="0805078000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
if an operator holds several licences and one of them is breached, is
it fair that every other licence could have conditions attached to it?
The licences could relate to different types of service, for
instance.</div>
					<a name="0805078000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
the traffic commissioner needs the function to attach conditions to a
licence if the licence is breached by the operator, but the powers that
clause 57 gives him are much wider than that. Was that the
Government&#146;s intention, and, if so, in what circumstances does
the Minister envisage those wide and excessive powers being
used?</div>
					<a name="0805078000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000504"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments
would, in effect, negate the purpose of clause 57, which is to extend
the powers of traffic commissioners to take enforcement action against
operators who fail to provide services of a satisfactory standard. It
is the first of three clauses that will give traffic commissioners new
or enhanced powers.</div>
					<a name="0805078000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, traffic commissioners have at their disposal several powers
that they can use to take action against operators who are not
delivering a reliable service, who are not delivering the services that
they said they would deliver, or who are using vehicles that do not
meet the necessary safety standards. One of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>those powers is that the traffic commissioner can attach conditions to
an operator&#146;s licence. The conditions can be used to prevent the
operator from providing certain services, and can even go so far as to
prohibit an operator from operating any bus services at all in a
particular area.</div>
					<a name="0805078000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an effective tool, but there are several difficulties with it. When
we debated part 1 of the Bill, I referred to the fact that Great
Britain is divided into eight traffic areas. When an operator applies
for a public service vehicle operator&#146;s licence, he must apply
to the traffic commissioner for the traffic area in which the vehicles
are based. Those vehicles may then be used anywhere in Great Britain.
But a large operator with vehicles based in more than one traffic area
will have separate licences for different traffic
areas.</div>
					<a name="0805078000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current legislation, it is generally accepted that there is no power
for a traffic commissioner to attach conditions to a licence held by an
operator in another traffic area. This means that even if conditions
are imposed, an operator can continue to provide services under a
licence held in a different traffic area unless and until the
appropriate traffic commissioner takes action against
him.</div>
					<a name="0805078000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also no
power for a traffic commissioner to prevent operators from
circumventing the effect of licence conditions by transferring the
operation of services to a subsidiary of the same holding group of
companies. Such potential loopholes weaken the powers of the traffic
commissioner to take action if operators are
failing.</div>
					<a name="0805078000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will give traffic commissioners the option, where conditions have been
attached to an operator&#146;s licence, to direct a traffic
commissioner in a different traffic area to attach conditions to other
licences held by the company. The other traffic commissioner could
refuse only if there were good reason to do
so.</div>
					<a name="0805078000418"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="0805078000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause will
also give traffic commissioners powers to attach conditions to licences
held by operators connected with the original, defaulting operator,
such as subsidiaries of the same holding company. I hope that the
Committee will agree that it is only right that a bus operator should
not be able to use the current limitations on the imposition of
conditions on licences to circumvent enforcement action and, by doing
so, to continue to operate bad services. That is exactly why clause 57
is in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="0805078000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments would undo those important changes,
leaving operators the opportunity to continue to circumvent enforcement
action. Moreover, amendments Nos. 245 and 246 would go even further,
watering down existing powers so that traffic commissioners would no
longer be able to impose a licence condition preventing a licence
holder from operating any services in a particular area. Because the
group of amendments would undermine the whole purpose of clause 57 and
leave traffic commissioners with even weaker enforcement powers than
they have at the moment, I cannot accept them, and I urge the Committee
to reject them. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw
them.</div>

right. I am still not convinced that she has addressed the point about
the traffic commissioner&#146;s greatly increased powers under the

must be sent to the local traffic authority only if it must implement
any of the recommended remedial measures. The explanatory notes give an
example where the local traffic authority might be expected to make
changes to help with bus punctuality. There will be occasions on which
the local traffic authority is not expected to take any remedial
action, but we believe that it should be informed about what action bus

						</b> Clause 58 is extremely important. In response
to consultation and discussions on the Bill, many people told us that
poor punctuality sometimes occurs when the local traffic authority is
failing in its duties, perhaps because it is not taking appropriate
action against parking or bus lane contraventions, or because poorly
planned road works are disrupting bus routes. The clause will give
traffic commissioners the power to hold traffic authorities to account

figure? That is an important matter, because part of the large bus

not having the right engineering facilities or drivers

agree with the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley: most of the time
the operators are at fault. The amendment would ensure that local

of whether they have to take remedial action. That is not to suggest

						</b> I accept that point; I was simply explaining
the background to clause 58 and why it is important. The approach taken
in the clause is the right one. The traffic commissioner should send a
copy of any report to the relevant operator and, if any of the remedial
measures are for implementation by a local traffic authority, to that
authority. However, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would require
a copy of every report to be sent to the local traffic authority
regardless of whether any of the measures were for implementation by
the authority.</div>
					<a name="0805078000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that the local authority might have an interest occasionally, and it
would be possible for the local traffic commissioner to send a copy to
the local authority if that were the case. However, I feel that the
approach in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would be too
burdensome. We believe that it is better for the local traffic
commissioner to have discretion over which authorities should receive
particular reports, rather than to be prescriptive in the Bill. In view

Hammond:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 247, in clause 59,
page 53, line 5, leave out from
&#145;money&#146; to end of line
7.</div>
					<a name="0805078000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment deals
with a very specific power of the traffic commissioner. I welcome and
support the general thrust of clause 59, which states that, when an
operator is fined by the traffic commissioner, the money must be
invested either in the provision of local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>services or used to compensate passengers on such services. That is
clearly sensible and laudable. If passengers suffer as a result of poor
services, it is only right that the fines should be used to improve the
services or directly compensate passengers.</div>
					<a name="0805078000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can think of other areas of
transport in which such an approach might be welcomed. When Network
Rail was fined by the regulator for disruption to passengers over new
year, the money went straight to the Exchequer and not back into rail
improvements. Perhaps the Minister could impress it on her colleague
the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, the hon. Member for
Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris), that a similar approach in that
field would be welcomed as
well.</div>
					<a name="0805078000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to my amendment and compensating bus passengers, the clause says
that the compensation can take the form of payments of money or such
form, including the provision of free travel or travel at a reduced
price, as is specified. That raises a number of questions about whether
or not the latter part is tightly defined or clear enough. For example,
does it mean that only passengers previously affected by the poor
provision of service will be offered free or reduced travel? Or does it
mean that travel on the offending routes will be free or reduced for a
period of time, which would benefit people who had not previously been
caught up? Therefore, if an operator was obliged to offer the
latter&#151;the free or reduced travel for a period&#151;it could
result in some unintended consequences.</div>
					<a name="0805078000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am in favour of fining the
operators if they fail to provide the right service and of reinvesting
the money or giving it to those who need to be compensated. The best
way for that to happen and to ensure that there is no
ambiguity&#151;unless the Minister wishes to add some other words to
the clause&#151;is to make a direct monetary payment to the
passengers.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000514"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>What we want to achieve is to give a
traffic commissioner more choice in the sanctions that can be imposed
against operators in such circumstances. The hon. Gentleman is right to
say that a traffic commissioner can fine an operator up to &#163;550
for every vehicle operated under the licence. That penalty is paid into
the general fund. The problem is that that could worsen the position
for passengers, because the operator may simply pass on the cost of
that fine through higher fares without making any improvement to the
services. When an operator provides a bad service, there should be a
way in which sanctions can be used to bring direct benefit to those
passengers who have been affected. Ideas, such as offering free or
reduced travel, were developed in collective discussions in the Bus
Partnership Forum, which is a collective of industry, local authorities
and others, including the senior traffic commissioner.</div>
					<a name="0805078000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">By giving traffic commissioners
a range of options, they will be able to assess what is right on a
case-by-case basis, taking into account local circumstances. Sometimes,
it might be appropriate to give some free or reduced fare travel.
Having that flexibility can only add value to the work of the traffic
commissioners. If the operator was not happy with the sanction that had
been taken, it has the right to appeal to the Transport Tribunal. I
hope that the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>will agree that these are sensible additions to the tools available to
traffic commissioners and that the hon. Member for Wimbledon can be

wish to direct free travel or whatever, but the question remains that
there may be an unintended consequence of people trying to use that
free travel even though he did not intend them to do so. None the less,
we will not go to the stake on this one. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

have agreed the principle that the traffic commissioner should have the

the amendment, any fines payable under the clause would be payable to
the local authority and not, as the clause is currently drafted, to the
Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers. That is appropriate: it fits in
with the nature of the bus industry, which is a very local industry. As
we have stressed throughout proceedings on the Bill, the local
authority should have a key role in determining the provision of bus
services in the area. That function is carried out by local transport
authorities and local operators, so having any proceeds of fines paid
to national Government is an anomaly in comparison with the rest of the
Bill. I strongly believe that the proceeds of fines should be
reinvested in the bus services, and that that should be done by the
appropriate local authority, not by moneys going to the Secretary of

						</b> I would not like to raise expectations unduly,
but the amendment does raise some interesting points. I am not sure,
however, that it would work. It does not, for example, talk about
ring-fencing, and there are difficulties with the suggestion, but I am
prepared to have a look at the points that the hon. Member for
Wimbledon has made. As I said, there are difficulties. I am not sure
whether the proposal fits in with other cases, as we would require
local authorities to spend money on a particular area, which carries
with it certain considerations. However, I am prepared to look further
at whether there would be benefits for passengers. Discussion would be
required with a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>number of other Departments, particularly the Treasury, with regard to
directing funds to a particular area. I cannot promise the hon.
Gentleman that it will be possible to introduce an amendment, but I
will certainly give the proposal careful
consideration.</div>

						</b> In my quest to make the Whips&#146; lives that
much easier, I thought that it would be worthwhile to ask some
questions and make some statements on this clause to save us having a
debate on new clause 10. The purpose of the previous three or four
clauses that we have debate is to increase the enforcement powers of
the traffic commissioners and to help them to deal with bus services
that do not comply with registration requirements. Clause 60 deals with
the prevention of the misuse of records and the need to make them
available for inspection. It seems to me that both aims are quite
worthy; I agree with them and support the
clause.</div>
					<a name="0805078000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">If,
however, we really want to check rogue and cowboy operators, both large
and small, it would be worth while ensuring that bus companies have
real-time, global positioning system information available, and
requiring them to keep that information on a historical basis. We have
only to talk to drivers, certainly of the larger bus companies in
Greater Manchester, such as Stagecoach and FirstGroup, and they will
explain very quickly that if they are running behind schedule, they
will either miss out stops or take 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>shortcuts, and that they will not comply with their registration.
However, the records will show that they left on time and arrived on
time. They will not show that they did not travel along the right
route.</div>
					<a name="0805078000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only way
for commissioners or any inspection body ever to get that right is for
accurate GPS information to be made available in real time and kept for
historical inspection purposes. That is the purpose of new clause 10,
but it might save time if, in considering clause 60, my right hon.
Friend would recognise that problem and agree that there are more
effective forms of record
keeping.</div>
					<a name="0805078000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000523"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As my hon. Friend said, the clause will enable
traffic commissioners to impose sanctions on operators who fail to meet
statutory requirements to provide bus punctuality. It is important that
we ensure that traffic commissioners have access to regular and
accurate information on the punctuality of bus services, enabling them
to pinpoint areas of consistent underperformance. That will enable them
to investigate the underlying
causes.</div>
					<a name="0805078000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend made a good point about GPS systems and ensuring that, as
far as possible, bus operators use them. However, we should seek to
achieve that in other ways. When we talk about quality partnership
schemes and quality contracts, the thrust of the Bill enables local
authorities to have greater discussions with bus operators about the
use of such equipment to ensure that proper records are kept. That is
not something that we want covered under primary legislation, but it is
an extremely important point. There are areas in the country where, for
example, local authorities have invested with bus operators in
installing GPS to enable them to have joint information about
punctuality and important real-time information. When local authorities
want to say that the next bus arrives in 10 minutes and so on, they
often need the support that comes with GPS to be able to do
so.</div>
					<a name="0805078000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I take my
hon. Friend&#146;s point about supporting the idea of giving more
power to traffic commissioners to request information about bus
punctuality, it means that local authorities will be able to work with
bus operators and that, in some cases, reaching agreement about the
fact that they would like buses operating with the GPS if that were
appropriate in their area. However, we can address such issues in other
ways rather than through primary legislation. I have especially in mind
the fact that, as he is aware, technology can move on. I am sure that
we want not want to be restricted to one type of technology under the
Bill when other types might become available in
future.</div>

of section 9A) to display within any vehicle or premises used for

fit.&#148;&#146;.</div>
					<a name="0805078000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is fairly self-explanatory. It would require bus operators to
display information in their vehicles and bus stations that detail how
a customer can make a suggestion or a complaint about the services that
they operate to the relevant passenger transport executive. It would
also mean that the PTE could use the suggestions and complaints to
inform any recommendations that it might wish to make about bus
services. For example, it might want to inform the revamped Passenger
Focus or the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="0805078000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that much of the time people do not know to whom to make a
complaint. Passengers get on buses and inevitably the person to whom
they complain is the bus driver. I&#151;and I am sure that this is
the case for other hon. Members, too&#151;have been told by numerous
constituents who, having followed through their complaint or suggestion
about the service to a bus driver, were told that the operator of the
service knew nothing about it. That is mainly because the bus driver is
too busy and forgets that a complaint or a suggestion was made or that
such matters just never filter back to those who should handle such
matters. The amendment would give people clear information about whom
they can contact or speak to, and to whom they can make a complaint or
suggestion. It is eminently sensible, and I hope that that the
Government will take it on
board.</div>

Winterton:
						</b> I certainly agree that there should be clear
information available to bus and coach passengers about how and to whom
they can make comments or complaints about the service they are using.
That issue came up time and again in consultation. In response to the
debate on the matter in the other place, the Government amended the
Bill on Report to insert what is now clause 70. That clause will give
powers to the Secretary of State to make regulations to require certain
persons to display particular information in appropriate places. That
could go wider than just information about complaints. What we have in
mind is local authorities, bus companies and scheduled coach operators
being required to display on passenger vehicles, at bus stops and bus
stations or in timetable leaflets the contact information for customer
service and passenger representation. Those notices might also be used
to raise awareness of the new bus passenger champion and to ensure that
passengers have appropriate customer service contact
details.</div>
					<a name="0805078000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is more
appropriate to have the powers as laid out in clause 70 than to give
powers to PTEs, which would be the effect of the amendment. First, the
suggested powers would help only passengers who lived and travelled in
PTE areas; they would not help to address issues in other parts of the
country. Secondly, we want to ensure consistency throughout England in
the information available to passengers. That will be more effectively
achieved by the appropriate power being with the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>
					<a name="0805078000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a sense, the amendment would
also address complaints against the operator, but there might be
instances where passengers wish to complain about a local
authority&#151;for example, if it is not enforcing bus lanes
properly. The powers in clause 70 will allow the appropriate
information to be provided to passengers who want to make such
complaints.</div>
					<a name="0805078000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have reassured the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington that I take
the issue of information about complaints seriously. We feel that the

although the Government&#146;s arguments for not accepting it were
quite weak.</div>
					<a name="0805078000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would allow passenger transport executives or integrated
transport authorities to be the operator of last resort if a bus
company decided to move its fleet out if it went bankrupt or for some
other reason could no longer operate services. It may be that no other
bus operators in the area could come in and immediately replace the
existing operator. The Government&#146;s argument against is that the
PTE&#151;the integrated transport authority&#151;would have to
comply with EU regulations, be competent in the PTE operational scheme,
and have managerial competences and
certification.</div>
					<a name="0805078000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
a lot of words, but when we consider some bus companies, which in
effect are run by a couple of men and their dog&#151;the purpose of
the 1985 Act was to allow small bus companies to compete with large
ones, among others&#151;those words do not seem to carry much
weight.</div>
					<a name="0805078000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
expected that operator of last resort will be used on many occasions.
In fact, it will probably be used very infrequently. Not for the first
time in this debate, we can look for similar situations elsewhere. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>With rail franchises, we find that Network Rail&#151;previously
Railtrack, I believe&#151;has the power to be the operator of last
resort. In fact, in the south-east, it became the operator of last
resort for a time. In the London system, Transport for London has the
authority to be the operator of last resort, although I think that
London is probably one of the last places where that power would need
to be taken up.</div>
					<a name="0805078000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems slightly unreasonable not to have something in the Bill that may
be used only occasionally&#151;in an emergency. If it were used, it
could be useful as a benchmarking exercise to see how a locally run,
publicly initiated bus company operated against many of the private
operators.</div>
					<a name="0805078000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
unlikely that this section of the Bill will be used, but we have the
opportunity to include a measure that may be used occasionally, or
hardly ever, and it seems unreasonable not to take it. At some future
time, somewhere in the country, somebody might regret it if we do not
do
so.</div>

							<b class="B">Ian
Stewart</b> (Eccles) (Lab): It is good to see you in the
Chair, Mr. Taylor. Earlier today, I highlighted instances
where I felt there would be the need to allow transport authorities to
be the operator of last resort, and I hope that the Minister heard as
well as listened. I know that she listened, but I hope that she heard
the example that I gave of a quality contracts scheme being awarded and
an operator walking away from an existing contract that it provides. In
such circumstances, residents, passengers and workers would be left in
an insecure
situation.</div>
					<a name="0805078000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the
past 10 years, I have argued in the House that it would be sensible to
allow passenger transport authorities to be an operator of last resort
for all sorts of different reasons. If the Government were to accept
that there will be unusual circumstances in which no provider is left,
a local transport authority could make provision almost as a stop-gap
until such time as a private operator was found to deliver the
service.</div>
					<a name="0805078000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, I
would like to go further and say that that should be encouraged in a
wider sense, so that transport authorities could provide a service but
on a temporary basis. I hope that the Minister will listen and hear
what hon. Members have
said.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000531"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As my hon. Friends know, the main purpose of
clause 61 is to put PTEs on equal footing with other local transport
authorities. While those other authorities do not have a specific power
to lease buses to operators, they do so by using their general
well-being powers under local government legislation. The PTEs are in a
different position&#151;first, because they have no well-being powers
and, secondly, their explicit power under the Transport Act 1968 to
lease out buses was disapplied by secondary legislation following
deregulation.</div>
					<a name="0805078000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
will give the renamed integrated transport authorities well-being
powers, but those powers will still not allow them to do anything
specifically prohibited under other legislation. The other
disapplication of the appropriate legislation amounts to a prohibition
on them leasing buses. Clause 61 will restore the power to do so, but
only in specified circumstances consistent with their current statutory
functions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>
					<a name="0805078000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments aim at a partial
restoration of the power of PTEs to operate buses, which, as my hon.
Friends said, was their primary function before the implementation of
the 1985 Act. One problem with that suggestion is that I am not sure
whether the Committee is aware of the commitment needed for a PTE to
play the role of operator of last
resort.</div>
					<a name="0805078000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">For such powers
to be of any use, it would have to be possible for the PTE to exercise
them at a moment&#146;s notice. Otherwise, it might as well let an
emergency contract, which it can do. The PTE would certainly need a
public service vehicle operator&#146;s licence, the necessary
financial standing and a professionally competent transport manager
available any time the emergency might arise. The requirements of the
licensing system need to be satisfied at all times while the licence is
in force, not just on the rare occasions when an emergency arises. The
PTE would also need vehicles and drivers to operate the services.
Arguably, those of the failed company would be available, but they
would not necessarily fall into the PTE&#146;s
lap.</div>
					<a name="0805078000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar
problems arise with the operator-of-last-resort powers in rail
franchising legislation, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Manchester, Blackley referred to. There are few undertakings qualified
to step in and run a railway at short notice, so there is no
alternative to those powers. The letting of emergency bus contracts,
however, is quite a commonplace occurrence, particularly with school
bus services, for example. That seldom causes serious
problems.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000533"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I will come to that. My point is that, taking
the issue of quality contracts, local authorities already have powers
to enter into emergency subsidy arrangements with an operator. We have
a power in the Bill to disapply the usual tendering requirements in
certain
circumstances.</div>

						<b class="B">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000535"></a>Ms

						</b> I do not accept that. The hon. Gentleman has to
balance what he is saying. A PTE could bring in a private operator
under a contract to the local authority more quickly than an authority
could get hold of enough drivers, vehicles and so on to operate a
service of its
own.</div>
					<a name="0805078000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that PTEs would be concerned about the consequences of a
large operator suddenly pulling out or falling on hard times and being
unable to carry out its contractual duties. It is also true that in
those circumstance receivers or administrators would be called in to
continue to run the company&#146;s affairs as best they could until a
buyer was found. In particular, they would want to keep services going,
as they would bring in
revenue.</div>

want to look 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>again at the quality contracts system&#151;could be more at risk than
those provided on a purely commercial basis. While I understand the
point being made about being the operator of last resort, the problem
for PTEs would be that requirements would have to be in place the whole
time to fulfil that and we believe that the ability to allow emergency
contracts, which we have powers to do, is available under existing
legislation.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Clive Betts</b> (Sheffield, Attercliffe) (Lab): May I put a
possible scenario to my right hon. Friend? She is indicating that the
clause gives new powers to PTEs to enable them to purchase vehicles
that they can hire out to operators on a contractual basis, which may
fit this particular requirement. Would it be possible for a local
authority under its well-being powers to tender for such a
contract?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000537"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I understand it, that was disapplied under
the Transport Act 1968. If I mistaken in that, I will write to the
Committee. In terms of emergency powers, we believe that it is possible
for local authorities to have adequate facilities in place to ensure
that if a contractor failed the local authority could put the contract
out very quickly and the usual tendering process would not have to be
undergone. For that reason, we do not believe that it would be
reasonable to expect PTEs to have some of the large operators&#146;
licences that could be possible for 200 or 300 vehicles and be able to
fall back on trying to get them up and running with drivers and people
running them. Frankly, it is more likely that that would be more
effectively achieved by actually going through the emergency tendering
process that we have in place. With that reassurance and clarification,
I hope that my hon. Friends will withdraw their
amendments.</div>

in a way it will be in spite of my right hon. Friend&#146;s arguments

I do not think she dealt with, although she went through a number of
scenarios. In a sense, I agree with her because, as both my hon. Friend

powers are held in London and not the rest of England.</div>
					<a name="0805078000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point has run through a lot of our arguments. Let me say clearly
that some very decent people own and run bus companies. There are good
bus companies that run services with integrity and that are good for
passengers, but there are also absolute rascals out there who will use
anything they can to get one over on the public sector and get subsidy.
They threaten and they push. We have mentioned Brian Souter and
Stagecoach. During the so-called bus wars in Manchester, that company
did not behave reasonably but said, &#147;We will close this city
down. We will park buses on all the roads in the city centre if you
don&#146;t do what we want.&#148; That part of the atmosphere in
which towns such as Preston and cities such as Manchester have had to
operate. To deny even relatively small powers such as the amendment
proposes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>is to give the rascals a benefit. The powers will not do down or harm
the decent bus
companies.</div>
					<a name="0805078000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what
my right hon. Friend says. All the other available powers might well be
able to deal with an emergency, but they might not. I have been in a
number of situations in local government where companies have gone
bankrupt or other things have happened, and the lawyers have searched
through the law books to see what they can do. In such situations, it
is important to have as many powers and alternatives as possible to
deal with something damaging to the communities we represent.</div>
					<a name="0805078000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may come back to the
amendment. It is not the most important amendment moved, but the
Government&#146;s case seems particularly weak.</div>

(2) repeals the provisions set out in the Transport Act 1985, which
state that when a local authority votes on matters relating to the
activities of a transport company owned by the council, any councillors
who are directors of that company are not allowed to vote without the
Secretary of State&#146;s permission. When I read the explanatory
note saying that that obligation would be dispensed with, I was
slightly at a loss. It seems a perfectly sensible and logical provision
that preserves independence of decision making, so I am surprised that
the Government want to delete
it.</div>

						</b> It may or it may not&#151;the code of conduct
certainly requires them to declare an interest&#151;but saying so
explicitly on the face of the Bill would add weight to what should
happen. I see no reason why the Government should want to repeal that
provision. I am sure that in a moment the Minister will use her
extraordinary powers of persuasion to tell me why I am wrong, but she
will have to go a long way in this

							<a name="0805078000542"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> If enacted, clause 66 will remove two forms of
central Government control over bus companies that are owned wholly or
partly by local authorities. If those companies include elected members
on their boards, which I believe they all do, they must be unpaid,
non-executive directors. Current legislation, which goes back to 1985,
requires those elected members to obtain a dispensation from the
Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers before speaking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>or voting on matters affecting their company. That was intended to
prevent possible conflicts of interest between their roles as
councillors and as directors.</div>
					<a name="0805078000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course that
is still important, but local government has changed. Under more recent
local government legislation, the conduct regime for councillors allows
such dispensations to be granted by local standards committees. The
role of the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers is no longer needed,
and the clause will fulfil a long-standing commitment to remove it.
That is fully supported by the Department for Communities and Local
Government and by Welsh
Ministers.</div>
					<a name="0805078000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would retain the dispensation provisions in the 1985 Act,
meaning that councillors would effectively need two sets of
dispensation, one from their local standards committee and one from
central Government. The Bill provides an opportunity to get rid of an
unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, and I am afraid that the amendment
would deprive us of that opportunity. I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw
it.</div>

						</b> Amendment No. 232 would enable the functions of the

not favour the establishment of a large regional structure or a
regional committee structure for the new watchdog, it should have a
regional dimension.</div>
					<a name="0805078000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bus travel is local in
character, and multiple operators are involved in its provision,
including a host of very small local operators. It is far less easy for
a single national organisation to have a good grasp of all the local
variations than it is in the case of rail, where there are a limited
number of players, and information on them and their performance is
readily available and easily assimilated. In addition, key changes to
services, for instance fares and frequencies, do not happen at the same
time and with ample warning, as they do in rail. Again unlike rail,
there is no guiding hand in Whitehall that influences the extent and
quality of service provision, other than by indirect measures such as
grant and subsidy regimes, vehicle regulations and so
on.</div>

					<a name="0805078000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of the key decision makers on the quality of service that bus
passengers receive are regionally based, and thus the influence and
credibility of a purely national watchdog&#151;especially if it is
London based&#151;is arguable. Given that, there is a strong case for
the bus watchdog to have a limited regional dimension, especially if it
will eventually take on an appeals role for complaints, liaise
effectively with the main actors on bus services in each region, and
act as a credible voice for passengers in the deregulated regions,
whenever major problems or issues arise.</div>

announced that subject to further consultation on the details, it is
proposed to confer additional functions on the Rail Passengers Council,
Passenger Focus, to enable it to represent the interests of bus
passengers. Amendments to the clause will not, therefore, have any
immediate effect. I assure the hon. Gentleman that were we to set up a
committee in that way, the powers in the Bill would be wide enough to
enable a regional sub-committee network to be established if that was
thought desirable. As I have indicated, those are matters for the

will not be surprised to learn that the amendment does not require much
in the way of introduction. It continues the theme that I have followed
throughout about consultation and accountability. The new bus passenger
watchdog should make an annual report in which it describes its
activities during the year and the state of its finances. We should
state in the Bill exactly where that report should go. It should go to
the Secretary of State and all local transport authorities and it
should be available to both Houses of Parliament and&#151;in the

include a provision about such a report in the order that she makes,
for the purpose of establishing the Public Transport Users&#146;
Committee for England. It should not be controversial. If we are to
create that body and put it on a statutory basis, we must ensure that
it is accountable and does the job it was set up to do. All other
organisations produce similar annual reports, which generally prove a
relatively effective way of reviewing their work. I hope that the
Minister will be persuaded to accept my entirely sensible
amendment.</div>

as the Secretary of State announced on 8 April, it is now proposed to
confer additional functions on the Rail Passengers Council, Passenger
Focus, to represent the interests of passengers, so in a sense the
amendment is not relevant to the body that we will establish. I assure
the hon. Gentleman that we probably will require the new body to

arrangements for rail passengers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>everywhere and for all transport users in London. For rail passengers,
the system is that complaints are made first to operators and can then

user of any transport mode complains first to Transport for London and
can appeal to the statutory watchdog, London TravelWatch. We would like

public transport users&#146; committee and so would not have an

any secondary legislation, on which we shill consult before bringing it

interested to know in exactly what circumstances the Minster thinks
that that is likely to occur. I cannot think of any circumstances in
which it would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to transfer
the functions of the committee to themselves and thereby act as the bus
passenger champion. For instance, does the same provision exist when
the committee acts as the rail passenger watchdog and, if so, has it
ever been used?</div>
					<a name="0805078000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I would like to probe
subsection 9 of proposed new section 125B, which states:</div>
					<a name="0805078000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Committee may do
anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or
incidental to, the discharge of any of its
functions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805078000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems
like a wide remit, and I wonder what the committee might do in
practice. There are well-stated powers, obligations and
responsibilities, so what is the &#147;anything&#148; that the
committee may do? We are obviously in favour of giving powers to
Passenger Focus to become the bus passenger watchdog, but I am looking
for reassurance that the body will have the appropriate
powers.</div>
					<a name="0805078000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805078000574"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> As I have said before, and as I think the hon.
Gentleman understands, it has now been decided that Passenger Focus
will be the new bus passenger champion, so we have no immediate plans
to use the powers to establish a new Public Transport Users&#146;
Committee for England. However, if we decided to use the provisions in
the future, we would want the flexibility to confer additional
functions on that body and perhaps transfer functions to another
body.</div>
					<a name="0805078000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall explain
a little more about that. First, the Bill specifies only two functions
for any future PTUC&#151;it is important to distinguish it from
Passenger Focus, which we propose to establish as the bus passenger
champion. The first function is to consider and make recommendations or
representations to the Secretary of State about public transport
services. The second function is to consider and make recommendations
about matters that are referred to the committee by the Secretary of
State. It is possible that the PTUC might usefully undertake other
functions as well. It might want to make representations to someone
other than the Secretary of State, such as bus operators, local
authorities or traffic commissioners. If amendment No. 268 were
accepted, it would not be possible to give the committee such
functions.</div>
					<a name="0805078000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
one might decide after a period of time that a function being carried
out by the PTUC could usefully be performed in the future by someone
else. Had the PTUC been given a remit to consider bus
passengers&#146; complaints, for example, in the light of experience
one might conclude that in the area of quality contracts schemes it
would be better for the local authority to take on that remit. Again,
if amendment No. 269 were accepted, there would be no power to transfer
that function.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>
					<a name="0805078000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, there
are many actions that the PTUC might wish to take in order to carry out
its functions, but it would not be sensible to list them on the face of
the legislation. That is why we have included the catch-all power that
commits the committee to undertake tasks that allow it to do its job of
representing passengers. For example, the PTUC might be asked by the
Secretary of State to consider and make recommendations about bus
performance in a particular area. The committee might feel that without
outside help it would not have the right expertise to do that. It might
want to hire a team of people to carry out a survey of passengers or
distribute questionnaires to households and then employ consultants to
analyse them. Amendment No. 272 would prevent it from doing
so.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0805078000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said,
at present, we are looking to Passenger Focus to take on those powers,
but if we wanted to establish a PTUC in the future, we would want to
have the flexibility that the amendments would remove. I hope that,
with that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>As I have explained, although there are
powers in the Bill to set up the committee, the Government announced on
8 April that, in fact, we would use Passenger Focus as the bus

powers, although we propose to retain them.</div>
					<a name="0805078000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, when we consulted on the draft Bill last
year, many people told us that passengers needed better representation
nationally by a body with statutory powers, which is why we are
introducing them. In crafting the powers, we recognise that future
consultation will be necessary to ensure that we set up the type of
body that meets the actual needs of passengers. At the same time, we
want to ensure that we do not create duplication between different
bodies. We wanted the maximum flexibility for the passenger transport
users committee to take on functions that are currently carried out by
another body, and vice
versa.</div>
					<a name="0805078000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is likely
that any such transfer of functions would be between bodies with an
interest in consumer representation, but they might not be directly
representative of public transport users. If the PTUC were established,
we might want to transfer functions to it from the National Consumer
Council or vice versa. That group represents consumers, including those
of transport services, but it is not directly representative of public
transport users.</div>
					<a name="0805078000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would reduce the flexibility of the committee to take on, or
to give to another body, functions that, with hindsight, might have
been best carried out elsewhere. It is therefore contrary to the idea
behind the clause, and I hope that what I have said gives the hon.

Winterton:
						</b> There is just one small point that I would like
to make about clause 69. Our consultation on strengthening the
representation of bus passengers raised the issue of other public
transport modes. A number of respondents to the consultation, including
the Campaign for Better Transport, highlighted the importance of
ensuring a statutory voice for light rail and tram passengers, as well
as for bus users, and they suggested that any public transport watchdog
should 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>be able to look across modes of transport, so that passengers&#146;
end-to-end journeys were looked at as a whole. We need to examine the
issue a little further, but I should like to give the Committee notice
that it is one that the Government may wish to return to on Report,
specifically in relation to light rail and tram
passengers.</div>

						</b> To clarify the situation, one of the issues
that came up over and over again in consultation was that passengers
felt that they did not know who they should complain to when a service
was bad, and the idea behind the clause is to ensure consistency in the
information that is available. With regard to the England versus Wales
match, we are trying to ensure that passengers using services that
cross between England and Wales have access to the correct
information.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>
					<a name="0805078000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power is worded such that
operators would be required to display information relevant to
passengers in whichever jurisdiction. So buses used on cross-border
services would need to display information about the procedures in both
England and Wales. I recognise that that might mean a little
duplication for operators, but it will mean that passengers have access
at all times to the information that they need. It would be for Welsh
Ministers to make any regulations in Wales under clause 70.</div>
