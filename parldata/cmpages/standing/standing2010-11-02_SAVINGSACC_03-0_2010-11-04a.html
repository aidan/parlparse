Phipps:</strong>
                           </em> The grant is important because it puts money
into pregnancy at a crucial time, so we support putting that money into
pregnancy. Even late on, it can have beneficial effects. It depends
what you think you are trying to do with it. If you are setting out
primarily to improve the nutrition of the mother to improve the health
of the baby, it needs to be earlier. If you are setting out to use it
to support her education as a parent, it is okay where it is. But if
you really want to change the future of the baby, it needs to be as
early as possible. It is not possible easily to do it pre-conception,
but the earlier in pregnancy you can do it, the
better.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is strong evidence that quite a number of women suffer from low levels
of micronutrients early in pregnancy. Providing them with a small
amount of extra income enables them to feed themselves properly, which
has a huge knock-on effect for the health of the baby. It primarily
reduces premature births, which gives you a good return on investment,
because every time you reduce a premature birth you save an awful lot
of money. We know that premature births cost the health

                           </div>service at least one and a half times the cost of a normal term birth.
We absolutely support the grant and the need for it, but if we had a
magic wand, we would provide it much
earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000017">&#160;</a>

approach to how women make decisions. We do not give unemployment
benefit and support to people on the basis of what they are going to
spend their money on. If you think about the name of the health in
pregnancy grant, were it to be tied in to women accessing antenatal
care before the end of the 12th week of pregnancy, which is the time
recommended by this Government and by the previous Government for women
to access antenatal care, you would significantly improve outcomes. At
that time, you would allow midwives to give advice on nutrition and
healthy
living.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000019">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is called the health in pregnancy grant, so the money could be spent on
nutrition or on women accessing exercise classes—we know that
aquaaerobics is very good for women towards the end of pregnancy. I
feel very annoyed about that patronising approach. It is an expensive
time—you reach the end of pregnancy and you start to want to get
equipment and other things for your baby, even by buying second-hand
cots and baby equipment. That time is an ideal opportunity to give what
is essentially advance child benefit, which is what it is and what it
was planned to be, to assist parents to get ready for having their
child. If we want to support young parents and to encourage them in
parenting, this is a really good way of doing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000020">&#160;</a>

business of what this money is spent on—I am with her 100%. Our
evidence is that when we talk to women who are becoming mothers, they
say, irrespective of how they got to be pregnant, that now that they
are pregnant they want to do the very best for their child, and that is
what they aim to do. They are not always in the best position to know
what the best is—that is a matter of education—but they
do the best they can for the child. Because the grant is paid when it
is, it is less likely to be used for food and more likely to be used
for those one-off expenditures on things they need to buy. Although we
can do an awful lot with NCT nearly new sales, it clearly still costs a
lot of money to set up for having a
baby.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000022">&#160;</a>

the constraints on being able to get money to mothers—for the

Another way would be to link the money to the Healthy Start programme,

                           </em> I want to use this as an opportunity to make a
broader point about the reality of family life, especially when
somebody is facing the birth of a new baby. That is not a point in
family life at which people are looking at luxuries; most families are
struggling to make ends meet. The cuts that we are talking about today
have to be put in the broader context of the announcements made before
the comprehensive spending review and in that review. Families with
small children are on the front line of many of those cuts. It is not
the case that we are withdrawing universal benefits, but maintaining
means-tested benefits. For example, the Sure Start maternity grant will
be abolished for second and subsequent children, so no simple trade-off
is being made. All families are being affected by the range of proposed
cuts, and poorest families are being affected particularly harshly.
Combined with the changes to child tax credit and the freezing of child
benefit, which applies to all families and not just to the better-off
ones, we are seeing an across-the-board targeting of families with
small children through those
cuts.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000025">&#160;</a>

need to think about the reality of family life, because for many women
the switch to motherhood is actually a route into poverty. The Prime
Minister has declared his very laudable ambition to make the UK one of
the most family-friendly societies in Europe. The way we should do that
is actively to support that transition. I am afraid that we are the
very poor cousin of our European neighbours in the generosity we show
to families with small children. I fear that the package of reforms in
front of us has made us an even poorer cousin, with all the consequent
impacts on the family, the couple in the relationship and the
child—and on the child’s ability to realise their
ambitions. We need a reality check about where we are sitting. We are
talking not about a simple trade-off between universal mean-tested
benefits; all benefits are being affected, and some of the poorest

do it, but it would probably work out at £6 or £7 a week,
depending on what parameters were used. It depends on whose figures you
believe. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation believes that it costs about
£44 a week to feed yourself adequately, but other people say
that it is £30 a week. At the moment, people who are in that
situation are spending about £18 a week, so there is at least a
£10 gap in what they need to feed themselves. That is the sort
of money that would help to make the

you are setting out to do. At the moment, parents struggle in both
respects. If you want to think about the economic climate, we are now
seeing the end effects of a lot of poor nutrition early in pregnancy.
We have a high level of prematurity, which leads to all sorts of
expensive problems in children later and to devastating problems for
the families. If we want to make a difference to the health of the
public, the place to start is in pregnancy. Although we would like to
see the £190 left as a lump sum because there are very good uses
for it, such as paying for antenatal education to prepare people for
being parents, it is even more important to ensure that an adequate
diet is being eaten by everybody, because that will knock on into
savings that can be reinvested to make the other

                           </em> The evidence on that is more difficult
because it is paid in the last trimester of pregnancy. It does have an
effect, as far as we can tell, but it does not have as much of an
effect as it would earlier on. What it does have an effect on
though—enormously—is the stress that parents feel when
they are having a baby. Often when you start out, you really have
absolutely no understanding of the real financial impact of pregnancy,
imagining yourself not being able to work, not having the time to do
the things that you do, and that becomes very real as the pregnancy
proceeds. The relief people feel to have a lump sum of money that
allows them to spend on those things that are essential for when you
are having a new baby is enormous. We know that being stressed is also
very bad for you personally, your ability to look after a baby and for
the baby itself, so we absolutely support the payment of that money. We
believe it does good. We would love to see it stay. If it were possible
to put something in earlier as well, or even instead of that, that
would be even more
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000043">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The point that I would make about the health in
pregnancy grant—I understand that it applies also to the child
trust fund—is that some of the ambitions behind those policies
were very long term and very large. They are ambitions about changing
eating habits at an early stage, with a knock-on positive impact on the
baby and on that family’s behaviour. Likewise with the child
trust fund, the ambitions were to create a savings habit. What was
recognised was that basically it is the nudge principle that inertia is
the death of behavioural change. Inertia is what stops us from doing
what we know we should. There are points in people’s lives where
people re-evaluate and pregnancy is one of those points. When you are
expecting your first or subsequent child, it is a point at which you
re-evaluate your eating behaviour, your savings behaviour and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000045">&#160;</a>

had recognised that that was a point at which you could begin to nudge
people in the right direction. Our concern is that the overall issues
of obesity and poor eating and the overall issues of a low savings rate
will be with us three, four or five years down the road. All the
evidence is that those are going to get worse rather than get better,
so we need to think, if these mechanisms are being abolished, at what
point in the return to better economic times, which we are all hoping
for, will they come back into play, because we have to change that
underlying behaviour. The Government have to use the opportunities that
they do, and pregnancy is one of those opportunities in order to nudge
people
along.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000046">&#160;</a>

simple answer to your question is that we had barely got out our
notebooks and pencils, and the thing is being abolished. So we do not
know the real evidence of impact, but for both of those policies some
of the impacts should have been felt in the much longer term and be
intergenerational.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000047">&#160;</a>

about when to start pre-conception care. The proportion of pregnancies
that are actually planned is relatively low. That does not mean that
these are not wanted pregnancies, but depending on which research you
look at, the proportion of actual planned pregnancies can be as low as
a third. Now a further third are definitely wanted, but may be not
quite now, and then the other third are the ones where people think,
“Don’t want it at all,” or they come round to the
idea of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000050">&#160;</a>

we are able to look at here. Certainly, however, encouraging women to

that the grant was being developed about whether that should be done.
We had some discussion about the French model, under which you have to
have had a series of antenatal checks for that to take place. It was
felt to be extremely bureaucratic and quite difficult to

			Column number: 85<a class="bkMark" name="Column85">&#160;</a>
                           </div>do. However, if the initiation point for being able to access the start
of this grant was tied in to having your first assessment from your
midwife or obstetrician before the end of the 12th week of pregnancy,
that could be done. Subsequent payments would be relative to receiving
antenatal checks. We do not want that to result in women appearing for
antenatal assessment when they do not need it, because the number of
visits that women in the UK need, and that many have experienced, has
been reduced in the guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000054">&#160;</a>

with a midwife. As well as providing the vouchers, that has the
advantage of giving the midwife the opportunity to provide some
education, which works very well indeed. It is also synergistic with
the need to get women to come for their antenatal care early so that
they can get the information that they need to make decisions about
screening, and so on. There is benefit to tying that in, so long as it
is an early tie-in and that is when you are going to start providing
the money. Later on, as Louise says, it can be more of a hindrance than
a help.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000055">&#160;</a>

follow up on some of the things that Belinda has discussed about
Healthy Start. That seems to have been a good programme, which is
starting to tackle a lot of the issues to which you referred about
pre-conception—right from the earliest stage of
conception—and ensuring that mums-to-be, especially those on low
incomes, are supported through a range of services. As you have said,
that has to be linked to some sort of health professional, be it a
community midwife, a health visitor, or somebody at a Sure Start
centre. A whole range of services must support mums, and their partners
and families, who are on low incomes, giving them benefit advice, for
example. Much of that care goes on for years after the baby has been
born.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000057">&#160;</a>

the objectives that were identified, but in a different way.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000058">&#160;</a>

important thing would be to put child benefit in early, starting at,
say, 12 weeks. That would reach the greatest number of people who need
it. It is not only very poor women who have poor nutrition; it is the
next level up—those who are not on the poorest benefits. That
measure would give women about £6 or £7 a week.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The next best
option would be to extend Healthy Start. It would be extremely helpful
to add between £10 and £12 to that. The
infrastructure is already in place to make that work and we know that
it works well. Although it is a benefit that has to be claimed, there
are a lot of points at which that claim can be made, and a lot of
attention is given to getting the claim done.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly, to
address the point that Louise has made: how do you deal with
pre-conception care? It is extremely difficult for the first child and
it requires whole society change. By extending the benefits to the
mother for a good couple of years after her baby is born, you can
improve her nutrition and, essentially, provide preconception
nutritional care, which benefits the second baby. There has been some
work in America that has shown that a programme, which started in
pregnancy and supported the mother’s nutrition, extending into
the two years after the baby was born, gave a major benefit to the
second baby born. They had better birth weights, with fewer problems
and were therefore much less costly in terms of care. That is the other
thing that we would like to see
done.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000061">&#160;</a>

aspiration, which I absolutely share, about making sure that the
poorest families have the most, but I also want to raise some issues
around targeting versus universality. I would say that poverty is a
dynamic phenomenon; it does not have a fixed population. Often,
Westminster people think, “As long as we can get that in our
sights, we will be able to sort out poverty.” One of the things
that creates poverty, however, is pregnancy and the entrance into
motherhood. You cannot necessarily predict, pre-pregnancy, who is going
to end up in your at risk population. It is also sometimes hidden,
because, in wealthier households, each partner does not necessarily
have equal access to the income. Poor behaviour is not only a
phenomenon of households in poverty—it stretches across the
income bands and we need to recognise that. On appearance, targeting
saves you money, but universality is incredibly cheap to administer and
much loved by those who receive it, because the process from the
recipient’s end is so simple and you do not have that problem of
non-take up. Those are my general points about what appears to be a
very attractive proposal, but which is actually, in reality, much more
complex and costlier than one might
imagine.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000064">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There are two costs associated with pregnancy
and parenthood. One is the physical cost of purchases. We estimate
that, between the ages of nought and 18, you are looking at
£200,000 to £220,000 to raise the average child. The
other cost, which is more hidden, is forgone earnings. Because we are
not a family-friendly society and we do not have family-shaped jobs in
the labour market, the reality for many families is that somebody has
to exit the labour market to look after those
children. I did some work that is now 10 to 12 years old,
which looked at the average cost to a woman of forgone earnings because
of motherhood. Those came out as another £250,000, and that was
back in 1999. You are looking at very substantial sums, and that
relates to my earlier point that once we recognise that, there is a
strong argument for the state to do more to support families at what
can be a very positive, but also incredibly vulnerable, point, not only
because they have more up-front costs, but because they are losing a
wage.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000067">&#160;</a>

French model, and I do not know whether it is still current. It used to
be the case that you needed to have had a certain number of antenatal
assessments in order to get your benefits, and if you fell short, you
did not receive them. But we can have a trawl round and send you what
we find on European models. It is worth saying that we have a
particularly unequal population in the UK. The gap between the poorest
and wealthiest is quite wide. Scandinavian countries, which have a more
even population mix, do not seem to have the issues that we

us. You get a whole year of paid leave in countries such as Norway. It
recognises that the baby’s brain is still developing in its
first year of life, and it particularly recognises the crunch that
Katherine referred to, which is that when you have a baby, you are torn
between earning money to keep your head above water and spending time
with your child. Your child needs both—you and financial
support. Many families find that they cannot cope because they are
working opposite shifts to be able to bring in the money. They are
shattered, and that feeds through into not having the time to cook and
shop and do all those things that you would want to do well. If we
could relieve that huge pressure on families struggling with the
emotional journey of being a parent, we would see fantastic, much
improved results further down the line, and we would make big
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000069">&#160;</a>

Phipps:</strong>
                           </em> It is hard to get across how having a baby
impacts on everybody. When you have a baby, your chance of being
poor—as measured on a poverty index—dramatically
increases, but everybody takes a step down. By
“everybody”, I mean other than the extremely rich CEOs
who run banks. Everybody suffers from the time-money dilemma and
struggles to keep their life together. We know that universal benefits
have the enormous advantage of being easy—everybody gets them
and you do not feel stigmatised by getting them, so the first-line
preference overall is to do things
universally.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not only the very poor who suffer from bad nutrition in pregnancy. A
surprisingly large proportion of the female population is not fully and
properly provided for nutritionally. That has a knock-on effect for a
big range of babies, so we would much rather see a universal benefit.
However, if that is not possible, Healthy Start would be a good way to
do it in the short term. In terms of paying for it, this is a true
investment that has returns—according to some of the studies
that we have looked at—of two, three, four, five, perhaps even
17 times what you put in in pregnancy. It has a multiplier
effect. A baby whose brain development is effective during the
pregnancy and first year of life will not at a later stage be treated
for depression and mental health issues and end up in prison. There is
an absolute link and it makes so much sense to do it now, even though
it requires spend and we are in a recession, because it will make the
future much
cheaper.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000073">&#160;</a>

that we are unpicking the principle of universality. Families are
looking for a strong signal from the Government about their offer in

the other side. From current Government policy, I do not understand

done and dusted at that point. Perhaps it is not just about the money.

spend our limited public resources on. What other interventions might
make a difference? Are health visitors the best people to deliver this
advice, and should we be supporting them to get access to the poorest

far too late. You have to focus primarily on midwives, and ensure that
women have enough time with them, and that there are targeted
approaches to bring into care women who tend to exclude themselves from
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000087">&#160;</a>

                           </em> One of the things I would flag is that you risk
missing a trick if you try to boil this down to base nutrients, because
what we want is a change in long-term behaviour. It is not a question
of a poor diet that should be supplemented by nutrients packaged for
the individual. This should be seen as a time at which to nudge people
into the right behaviour. That has all sorts of knock-on consequences
for their own health, but we also know that good eating is catching and
that it catches across generations. Given what we know about the tide
of obesity that we are facing in this country, which is an enormous
behavioural issue to have to face, we must take every opportunity to
change behaviour. One risk is that if you try to boil this down to a
set of micronutrients that will somehow be issued to pregnant women,
you miss that much bigger goal of shifting behaviour. I concur
absolutely with the point about health visitors. Increasing the number
of them and increasing access to them are essential, but that fulfils a
different
function.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000088">&#160;</a>

only just been introduced, with the women who first received it only
now having given birth. There has been no time to assess what broader
impact it has had, although we know about child benefit and what women
do with that. For many years, the argument was made about child benefit
that it was frittered away on unnecessary luxuries, which is absolutely
not upheld by the evidence. Child benefit is one of the most effective
ways of ensuring that spending goes in the right direction—on
the child and their future. We do not have the evidence and we will

week, when people receive the £190, is often the point at which
they will come to a National Childbirth Trust nearly-new sale and have
a lump sum of money to spend on goods. That means that they are not
having to put an amount aside each week from their small income

items, which relieves the pressure on their daily income. As Katherine
said, it is too early to know, because the grant has only been there a
little while, but that is what we think is actually happening. It is
likely that the grant is having an effect, so it is a good thing to
have, but that effect happens quite late in
pregnancy.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000091">&#160;</a>

Silverton:</strong>
                           </em> The short answer is probably no. However,
over the past few years, alongside the introduction of the grant, there
has been a reduction in the amount of time that midwives have been able
to spend with women. Since 2002, there has been a 19% increase in the
birth rate, and in London it has gone up by more than 25%. The
complexity and make-up of the child-bearing population has increased,
with there being more women for whom English is their second language,
women with pre-existing health conditions and women in very poor social
circumstances. The number of midwives has not kept pace with the number
of births, so midwives have less time to spend with women.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000094">&#160;</a>

interesting that the Liberal Democrats said at their party conference
that they would remove the grant and put the money towards the
additional 3,000 midwives that were needed. I am not here to say that
we are going to take the food out of the mouths of pregnant women, but
we need to look at both sides of the equation. We need to facilitate
midwives to be able to do much more than simply the mechanics of blood
pressure and urine testing and abdominal examination. Midwives must be
able to have time to sit down with women, talk to them, relate to them,
possibly engage interpreters, and show good behaviours. There are
hugely good examples of midwives who have run cookery classes and
shopping classes to teach young women how to make the best of a limited
income, and how to cook and provide nutritious
food.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000095">&#160;</a>

say to women: “When I see you next time, at 25 weeks,

controlled experiment. The child trust fund was of universal access so
we do not know what would have happened to people’s savings
behaviour otherwise. But those rates would have been very unexpected,
given the overall rates of savings for children. One of the reasons
behind the success of the child trust fund is that it was a very
successful nudge for people, with regard to the inertia over
people’ savings.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000111">&#160;</a>

that we should exercise more, and we all know that inertia wins 99% of

conversation about the benefits of going to the gym, but it is only
actually when you are in the gym and you begin to see the benefits that
you reinforce that behaviour. Likewise with savings, we all have
information. Many people know that they are not saving adequately for
their retirement, or that they are not saving adequately for their
children, but to have a mechanism that puts them in a saving pattern
means that they change their behaviour and can gain more

many families in poverty want to save for their children. There is not
a lack of will on their part; it is a lack of means, and the fact that
the Government were making that contribution enabled those

introduce a junior ISA, which

you have any understanding yet of what the junior ISA

detail yet as to what that junior ISA will look like. Can I table one
concern? If it is part of the ISA family, the ISA family is
tax-incentivised, so it will only incentivise those who are actually
paying income tax. As we know, many of the poorest families are not
actually going to receive that benefit. If it is tax-incentivised in
the way that other ISAs are—in other words, the more tax you
pay, the more benefit you get by saving in the ISA—I would fear
that, if it is a strict part of that ISA family, you end up rewarding
the richer families more, because they are paying a higher tax rate
than the lower-income families. That is also assuming that we have a
mechanism to enrol people into
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000116">&#160;</a>

are a number of factors that made the child trust fund successful. One
was that you were given an entitlement; you were given that account.
Even if you did not actively subscribe, the Government gave it to you.
That was the initial hand over the barrier of inertia that enabled
those families to start saving. I wonder whether there is going to be
an equivalent hand over that barrier, and I also wonder, if the junior
ISA is truly part of the ISA family, whether we will actually end up
with a regressive rather than a progressive
vehicle.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000117">&#160;</a>

child trust fund was the way that it was received by families—it
was a way of valuing what they were doing and it was a way of
triggering families to think long term. When you are not that well off,
you have a tendency to have short time horizons, because you are
thinking about getting through the next week. It was a way of getting
families to recognise that their child has a future—18 years, 30
years hence. It helped to trigger not only savings behaviour, but other
behaviours that took into account the long-term nature of that family.

Silverton:</strong>
                           </em> The very existence of the child trust fund
has allowed midwives to open the conversation about financial planning
with prospective mothers and fathers. Midwives are not advisers in
financial planning, although many of them are very good at helping
women to negotiate the benefit systems. But what we have done, and what
came out at the same time through the financial education initiatives,
was the parents’ guide to money, produced at that time by the
Financial Services Authority, now by its hived-off education arm. That
has been a huge guide for and a help to pregnant women in working their
way through the changes and in starting the thinking. The child trust
fund has been something on to which you have able to hook this advice
and say, “When your baby is born you will get this. Think about
saving, think about speaking to relatives and about the whole issue of
financial planning.” Across the nation we are quite poor at
that, and the level of financial understanding is poor. We are talking,
in many cases, about poor families who are the victims of loan sharks
because they do not understand the implications of their actions. That
will sound horribly patronising, but if they were more financially
aware it would be blindingly obvious to them that they should not go
there.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000134">&#160;</a>

by the IFS, and specifically to direct it at you, Katherine. It was
asserted that the child trust fund was not the most beneficial policy
for the Government to have, because in the circumstances of having a
low income the most rational thing to do is not to save. But you seem
to be saying, “Well, hang on a minute, that’s not
necessarily the case, because saving, like exercise, is habit
forming,” and that the best policy for the Government might be
to encourage low-income families to save. What evidence do we have of
the effectiveness of the child trust fund policy? Is the IFS right that
what the Government ought to do to support low-income families is to
improve services rather than to promote saving, which, it asserts, is
“irrational behaviour” in those
circumstances?<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000136">&#160;</a>

                           </em> One thing to make clear about the child trust
fund is that no one was forced to save into it. If those families made
that choice, that was absolutely sustainable within the child trust
fund model. A lump-sum contribution was made by the Government, and you
could access that regardless of your own saving behaviour. It also
extended over a very long period, over which one would hope that
welfare-to-work policies would activate so that families on very low
incomes could start to make that contribution and would have, in the
back of their mind, that that was a potential for when they were no
longer on low income. So, I contest the point on that basis, in the
sense that those families were able to make those decisions for
themselves; no one was forcing them to make savings that they felt were
inappropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000137">&#160;</a>

“economic irrationality”—the fact that that money

wanted to make an investment that they could not touch. Yes, there is a

micronutrients and omegas in their diet to produce a healthy baby. That

term, looking to the future, planning, saving, and expecting the future
to be bright. That is what families need. They need to see a bright
future and work towards it, instead of living day to day on an income

a large proportion of that quarter are probably those families who need

in four looks like a poor rate, but when you compare that with other
savings products and their take-up, it is incredibly effective. It
depends on your point of comparison. One of the things about the child
trust fund market was that the providers were effectively able to do
some cross subsidisation and chase after a broader range of clients,
not necessarily just the richer clients who would be able to make a
contribution. With the new proposals, and without a Government
contribution, one wonders whether the market will be appropriately
incentivised in order to attract what are, as you say, very difficult
groups to reach.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000144">&#160;</a>

that it was universal. However, it was a progressive form of
universalism in that poorer people got more, and disabled children also
received a higher payment from the Government. There has been

that a lump sum could be delivered to looked-after children, who
obviously have no family of their own to save for them.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000151">&#160;</a>

Given the straitened financial times we are in, I would favour a system
of keeping the structure of the child trust fund. When we are not in
such straitened financial times, since we know that it worked, we can
restart it and work on it. As you say, choices could be made within
that about looked-after children, where the state is the parent and
wants to make some contribution for children with disabilities. That
contribution could be continued during the interim period, and the
universal elements could be brought back in later down the line once

                           </strong> I thank Mr Hanson for his point of order. As he
probably knows, attendance at these sessions is for individual Members
to decide, as long as we are quorate, and we have been quorate
throughout. He has put his point on the record. My advice is that it is
not something for me to take up with Mr Speaker. He might want to find
other ways of raising the point in this place. However, I am grateful
to him for placing his point on the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="10110442000159">&#160;</a>

after business questions or in a letter to Mr
