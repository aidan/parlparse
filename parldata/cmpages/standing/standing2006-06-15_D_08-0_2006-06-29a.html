<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000286"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause relates to the particulars of
secretaries that are to be registered, and amendments Nos. 198 and 199
are largely probing amendments designed to obtain clarification on the
names to be provided to the registrar. Subsection (2) says
that</div><a name="06062962000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this section &#145;name&#146; means a
person&#146;s Christian name (or other forename) and surname, except
in that in the case
of&#151;</div><a name="06062962000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) a peer,
or</div><a name="06062962000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) an individual
usually known by a
title,</div><a name="06062962000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">the
title may be stated instead of his Christian name (or other forename)
and surname or in addition to either or both of
them.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My question is
about certainty, more than anything else. If a title is used, should
not it be provided in addition to the Christian name or surname, rather
than instead of them? That would facilitate due diligence and checking
of company secretaries to identify whether they were previously a
company secretary or similar officer, and would permit that
investigation still to be undertaken even if they had changed their
name.</div><a name="06062962000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 200 concerns consistency. Under the proposals in the Bill, it is
now possible to standardise registration of particulars for names that
have not been used for 20 years. That is in subsection (4): if somebody
has changed their name or if the name has been disused for 20 years,
the previous details need not be provided on the register. However, my
question is whether, for the purposes of checking and due diligence, a
disused name should still be provided even though it may have been
disused for 20 years. Obviously that is a significant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 292</div>period, but there may still be a need to check for bankruptcy orders or
the like&#151;matters that may be relevant in the context of good
corporate
governance.</div><a name="06062962000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note
that if a name
is</div><a name="06062962000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;changed or disused
before the person attained the age of
18&#148;</div><a name="06062962000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">the name need not be
provided. Directors can now be appointed at the age of 16, and the
amendment would harmonise the age at 16, for the sake of consistency.
If, during the two years between the ages of 16 and 18, a person uses a
name and is the director of a company that goes bust or suffers some
other unfortunate occurrence, but can then disuse their name on
reaching 18, that hardly provides for the good corporate governance and
due diligence to which I have alluded in relation to the other
amendments. My approach is one of transparency and good corporate
governance and I am testing why the Bill has been drafted as it has.
</div><a name="06062962000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062962000287"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): I have just a short point on
amendment No. 201. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it might be
relevant if a person had committed some sort of fraud 20 years ago. Is
it not the case that, in that situation, the period in which such
offences could have been mentioned would have expired? We would know
the person&#146;s name but we would not know about minor financial
offences that they had committed 25 years
ago.</div><a name="06062962000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000288"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman alludes to the
fact that there is a time limit after which offences effectively expire
for employment purposes. It is a fair point, but when, for example,
there is about to be a flotation or suchlike, questions are often asked
as to whether a director or potential director of a listed company has
committed any offence in the past. Clearly, in that greater public
exposure environment, it would be damaging to a company if that
information were to be provided at a later date, once a company was on
the market. That is why those due diligence investigations are
undertaken and why, in these probing amendments, I am attempting to see
whether we will have sufficient clarity for those types of
investigations after the introduction of the
Bill.</div><a name="06062962000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000289"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O&#146;Brien):</b> The hon.
Gentleman pointed out that these were probing amendments. He made some
sensible, arguable points. The approach that we have taken to the
provision is largely to maintain the current situation. We could have
gone for a different kind of consistency. At this stage, we thought
that there was no need to change it.</div>
<a name="06062962000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach taken to both
directors and secretaries in the early part of the clause is
long-standing. It has not caused problems so we decided to leave it as
it is. We feel that that is the better approach but do not feel
particularly strongly about
it.</div><a name="06062962000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as peers
are concerned, this reflects the long-standing arrangements. The right
hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) is an interesting
example, if I may use his name for illustrative purposes. He comes
within subsection (2)(b), because Ancram is a courtesy title. His
title, as I understand it, is now Lothian. However, his family name has
always been Kerr. Everyone knows him by a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 293</div>particular title, so no one would think it inappropriate for him to use
the title by which he is commonly known. That approach is allowed for
in subsection (2)(b). It would then be up to him as to which title he
chose to be known by, providing that there was nothing misleading in
the way in which it was done.</div>
<a name="06062962000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 200 and 201
relate to the requirements on former names. The Bill retains the
requirement in the current Act only for former names back to the age of
18, rather than the lower age of 16 that applies to directors and
authorised signatories.</div>
<a name="06062962000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view was that one could go
for consistency either with the old Bill or with directors and
authorised signatories. There is an argument for either. It is a matter
of taking a choice. For secretaries of public companies, the
qualification requirements in clause 256 mean that there is little need
for a minimum age. I cannot imagine that many of the people achieving
that qualification are likely to be 16, so it seems unnecessary to
change the arrangements for the age and information about former
names.</div> <a name="06062962000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 290 of
the Companies Act 1985 requires a former name for a secretary. In that
it differs from the rule for directors in section 289 of excluding a
former name that has been changed or disused for 20 years or more. We
do not see any reason for applying a longer period to
secretaries&#146; former names than to directors&#146;.</div>
<a name="06062962000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are broadly the reasons.
If the hon. Gentleman feels particularly strongly&#151;I suspect that
he does not&#151;that the requirements need to be changed, we will be
happy to consider that, but that is the approach we have
taken.</div><a name="06062962000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000290"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments. As I said in my opening remarks,
these were largely probing amendments, to help us understand the basis
on which these approaches had been developed.</div>
<a name="06062962000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The situation for company
secretaries is at a less heightened level than that of directors, where
there has traditionally been greater sensitivity about the information.
Indeed, the information about company secretaries has been less full
than the information provided by directors on the public record under
section 288 of the 1985 Act. I take on board what the Solicitor-General
said about the longstop of 20 years on former names and the approach
taken on whether to specify an age of 18 or 16.</div>
<a name="06062962000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Solicitor-General
helpfully pointed out, there is an issue of consistency on which we
might reflect a little further. It is not likely that there will be
huge numbers of directors aged 16 and 17, but in this increasingly
entrepreneurial world in which young people are rightly encouraged to
take a healthy interest in business and perhaps set up their own
companies, this might become more important, so some further reflection
on that point would be helpful as the Bill
proceeds.</div><a name="06062962000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000291"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. We
are certainly happy to reflect on the matter. If he has strong views on
it, I am happy for him to come back to
me.</div><a name="06062962000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have reflected
on another matter that the hon. Gentleman raised in our last sitting.
He mentioned his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 294</div>concerns that people might seek to increase the fee to restrict access
to the register of secretaries. I asked for some work to be done on the
matter, and it seems that the fee is &#163;2.50 for each hour during
which the right of inspection is exercised. The making of that fee is
enabled by the Companies (Inspection and Copying of Registers, Indices
and Documents) Regulations 1991 and therefore set by the Secretary of
State. If somebody wants to go along and have a look at a name it does
not cost much, and there is no option to put up the price
unnecessarily. That rule will be introduced through regulations and
therefore promulgated by the Secretary of State. It would be useful if
the registrar made clear the situation on the Companies House
website.</div><a name="06062962000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
reflect on the point that the hon. Gentleman just raised, which is a
matter of preference. I do not think that it will make much difference,
because the work of company secretaries means that they are likely to
have to comply with certain requirements. I doubt that they will be 16
years old, because of the nature of the
work.</div><a name="06062962000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000292"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that further clarification,
in particular on the point that we discussed about fees, which is
helpful in terms of transparency. I am grateful also for the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments on making the information more
visibly accessible on the Companies House website. That would be
helpful, so that everybody can be clear precisely what the situation is
when exercising their rights and that they are not in any way fobbed
off or given a false impression. On the basis of his comments, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062962000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000297"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We now move on to part 13 of the Bill, which
deals with the procedures for convening meetings and for passing
resolutions. Clause 264 incorporates general provisions regarding the
ways in which private limited companies and public companies are
permitted to pass resolutions. The clause makes it clear that while
private companies are permitted to pass resolutions of shareholders by
means of either general meetings of shareholders or through the
mechanism of written resolution, public companies are not. The
distinction reflects the approach taken in section 381A of the
Companies Act
1985.</div><a name="06062962000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
this approach provides a clear dividing line between companies that are
permitted to use the written resolution route and those that are
not,the purpose of the amendment is to question whether the
written resolution route could have wider application beyond private
limited companies. This is particularly so as a number of public
companies may have a small number of shareholders who are not listed.
It would therefore seem more practical andless bureaucratic to
extend the written resolution mechanism for these types of companies. I
acknowledge that quoted plcs are likely to have a considerable number
of shareholders. It may not be practicable, even if they wished to do
so, for them to adopt the written resolution approach, certainly in a
timely fashion. The general meeting approach may well be more
appropriate to them.</div>
<a name="06062962000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a public company
perspective, and in order to ensure transparency, the ability for
shareholders to attend a general meeting and to ask questions as
appropriate is clearly important. I therefore understand the
distinction drawn between the written resolution approach for private
limited companies and the restriction to general meetings for public
companies. However, it is worth examining that further in a
deregulatory framework to see whether for non-quoted public companies
the regime of written resolutions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 296</div>might be extended. Under the amendment, quoted public companies would
still not have the option of using the written resolution approach
while non-quoted public companies would. The amendment is intended to
reflect the intent to promote more flexible and efficient decision
making within the
companies.</div><a name="06062962000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 328, 329, and 332 to 334 are consequential amendments to further
clauses as a result of this proposed
change.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000298"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b> I
understand the motivations behind the amendments, and it is true that
the company law review recommended that public companies should be able
to opt out of holding AGMs. However, the review was not clear about how
such public companies were to take decisions. Its recommendations
relating to written resolutions specifically concerned making it easier
for private companies, so the focus was on think small first.</div>
<a name="06062962000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposals are framed in the
way that they are primarily because of EC regulations and EC
law&#151;specifically, the second company law directive, which
requires a number of resolutions in relation to public companies and
the maintenance and alteration of capital to be taken in general
meetings. In addition, as for private companies, resolutions to remove
a director or an auditor must be taken at general meetings. Some
remaining resolutions could therefore be taken in other ways, but our
view is that that would make things slightly more complex and difficult
for companies to
understand.</div><a name="06062962000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
consulted on the company law review, in both the 2002 and the 2005
White Paper, it is fair to say that there was not much appetite for
enabling public companies to opt out of holding AGMs. The general view
was that meetings continue to serve a useful purpose for most public
companies. For those reasons, we took the view that the written
resolution procedure should continue, as under the 1985 Act, to be
available for private companies only.</div>
<a name="06062962000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that, in view of that
explanation, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000299"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comments, although they perhaps underline the debate that we had
earlier in the week about the distinction between large and small, and
how that is defined. The Department&#146;s view is that the
distinction is drawn between a public company and a private company.
That is the dividing line that is adhered to, whereas we have advocated
examining that rigid view more closely, to see whether it provides the
think small first-type approach that the Minister mentioned. Hence my
attempt in the amendments to distinguish a quoted company&#151;a
company whose shares are listed on a stock exchanges, for which the
issues that the Minister highlighted, such as the need for meetings,
transparency and the ability of shareholders to hold directors to
account and ask questions, are proper and valid&#151;from a
non-quoted one.</div> <a name="06062962000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
disappointed that the Minister does not feel that there is sufficient
appetite to examine the possibility of extending written resolutions to
non-quoted plcs, with a smaller group of shareholders, or of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 297</div>such companies&#146; processes and procedures being adhered to more

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000302"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause makes general provisions in
relation to the manner in which votes are to be conducted, in the
context of a written resolution, a resolution on a show of hands at a
general meeting of shareholders and a resolution taken on a poll at a
meeting of shareholders.</div>
<a name="06062962000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2) makes it clear
that, on a vote on a show of hands at a general meeting, each member
and validly appointed proxy present has one vote. However, subsection
(3) states that, on a vote on a
poll,</div><a name="06062962000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every member has
one vote.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That wording
could be construed as limiting the operation of subsection (3) to
members only, rather than including proxies as well. I do not believe
that that is the intention and I think it would be helpful to put this
beyond doubt by stating that every member, whether voting in person or
by proxy at a general meeting, has one vote in respect of each share or
&#163;10 of stock held. Amendments Nos. 223 and 224 would make
consequential
changes.</div><a name="06062962000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000303"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Clause 267 sets out
the general rules relating to votes and members. The specific
requirements are set out in clause 268 and cannot be overridden by the
articles. Our view is that the Opposition&#146;s amendments make no
improvement to the operation of these two clauses. I draw his attention
to clause 307, which entitles a member to appoint one or more proxies
to exercise the voting rights attached to a member&#146;s shares.
When a poll on the resolution is called it is the votes conferred by
each share that are counted. At that point it is irrelevant whether the
member is voting in person or by proxy and nothing is added to the
provision by stating that explicitly in clauses 267 and 268. I hope
that after that explanation the hon. Gentleman will feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062962000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000304"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The reason for tabling the amendments was to
seek clarification that the phrase &#147;every member&#148; in

<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 298</div>mean every member voting in person or by proxy. In the light of the
Minister&#146;s confirmation of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000305"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Subsection (2)(b) states that on a vote on a
resolution on a show of hands at a
meeting:</div><a name="06062962000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;every proxy
present who has been duly appointed by a member entitled to vote on the
resolution has one
vote.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could the Minister
confirm the intention behind this wording in the context of a
member&#146;s ability to appoint multiple proxies? Surely the
intention should not be that a member is entitled to appoint more than
one proxy, each of whom would be entitled to vote, as a member voting
by proxy in these circumstances would have more votes than a member
voting in person at the meeting, which cannot be right. I am sure that
there is some explanation, as that is clearly not the intention behind
the drafting.</div> <a name="06062962000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
268(2) makes specific provision in circumstances where the articles of
association of the company seek to differentiate between the rights of
members and the rights of proxies in a negative way. The language
appears to apply only to clause 268(1). These are technical comments,
but it would be helpful to have some
clarification.</div><a name="06062962000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000306"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This is complicated stuff. I am trying to come to
grips with it. I hope that I can help the hon. Gentleman here. If there
are multiple proxies attending a meeting where the voting is on a show
of hands there is a common law duty on the chairman to demand a poll on
a vote if he considers the outcome would be different from that reached
by a show of hands. Many companies, particularly quoted
companies, count all votes on a poll as a matter of practice, and an
appropriate requirement is usually set out in their articles. Some
companies still allow participants, whether members voting in person or
by proxy, to demonstrate&#151;I am not sure that this helps
much&#151;</div><a name="06062962000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000307"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Perhaps this is something for later
on.</div><a name="06062962000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000308"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Yes. The problem with votes on a show of hands is
that members may appoint several proxies. I accept the point that the
hon. Gentleman has made. The Bill deliberately facilitates that,
because it is a mechanism for allowing pool nominees, of the kind we
will discuss when we come to part 9, to give the underlying owners of
shares the right to turn up to meetings. However, if the proxies
between them have the same rights on a show of hands as the member,
they should have one vote between them. Owing to the policy on
underlying shareholders, we prefer the default position to be that
proxies have one vote each on a show of hands. Consequently, we need to
refer specifically to proxies in clause 267(2), because we are
departing from the general rule. I accept that that is complex. Perhaps
the quicker companies come to proper polls the easier life will
get.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000309"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am not sure that I necessarily did get the
clarification that I was hoping for. I understood that the fundamental
issue on multiple proxies and proxies having one vote was about what
happens if a member appoints more than one proxy. I appreciate the
flexibility arguments on that. For example, if a shareholder has 10
shares and can therefore appoint, say, 10 proxies, it would not be
desirable for that person to have 10 votes on a show of hands when
someone with 10 shares who attends in person would only have one vote.
That was the approach that I want to deal with, because it is clearly
not fair or appropriate and could lead to absurd situations.</div>
<a name="06062962000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that that is
what the Minister was setting out. I take it that a member appointing
proxies cannot effectively usurp their position and, by virtue of the
mechanism in question, get more votes than they would have been
entitled to had they turned up at the meeting, but that is what
concerns
me.</div><a name="06062962000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000310"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The issue is complicated, which is why I said that
we hope that more companies move to proper polling of their members.
The problem relates to proxies for pool nominees, where there are
multiple underlying interests. We want to reflect that, which is why a
show of hands would be allowed in those circumstances. I accept that it
is a difficult matter. I am advised that there could not be a
challenge, but presumably if a member were unhappy in some way, the
matter might presumably be subject to a challenge by the
chairman.</div>
<a name="06062962000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000311"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful for that clarification. The
question of pool nominees is a valid one, and we will debate in more
detail how it is possible for nominee shareholders to gain their rights
and enforce them effectively at a general meeting. That is a wider
debate and I do not want to stray on to it now.</div>
<a name="06062962000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a dispute, it is
open to someone to seek a poll in the relevant circumstances to even
out the situation, because voting would then be tied to the individual
holding of shares. We need to keep the issue under review. I understand
what the Minister said, and the complexities of always proceeding on a
poll may not necessarily be desirable and may add cost. I think she is
right about public companies. In essence, the information is provided
because of the proxy information that comes from institutional
shareholders who appoint the chairman as their proxy. It is possible,
with reference to the number of shares, to see how many votes were cast
for and against and how many abstentions there were. However, I am
thinking about smaller or medium-sized companies that could fall
between the two. However, I hear what the Minister
says.</div>
<a name="06062962000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062962000312"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): In a general
meeting, it is now best practice in corporate governance&#151;I think
it is also a combined code requirement&#151;that the chairman reads
out the proxy situation. Typically, that would be done after the show
of hands. However, in circumstances where the vote might be tight or
complicated, there is no reason why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 300</div>the chairman should not read out the proxy situation before the show of
hands. In that case, members would have an idea which way the wind was
blowing, so in practice I think the problem would sort itself
out.</div><a name="06062962000103"></a>

comments, which relate to quoted companies. However, some of my

situation in which the provision is misused. That would not be so much
of an issue for quoted companies. We might reflect on the clause, but

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000314"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause makes provision for joint holders
of shares. In particular, it
states:</div><a name="06062962000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only the vote of
the senior holder who votes (and any proxies duly authorised by him)
may be counted by the

register&#148;.</div><a name="06062962000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">That could be
read in two ways: first, that only the senior holder&#151;the person
named first in the register of members&#151;is entitled to vote, or,
secondly, that the vote of the most senior named shareholder who votes
should be counted. In other words, if the first named person does not
vote, but the second and third named ones do, the second named person
takes priority. That is the understood way in which joint shareholdings
have operated up until now, and it would be helpful if it could be
confirmed that no change is
contemplated.</div><a name="06062962000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
separate matter, was any contemplation given to limiting the maximum
number of joint holders who may hold a single share, as that
requirement is commonly inserted into many companies&#146; articles
of association? From my brief review of the draft model table A
articles, inserted in the large bundle of documents that I received
recently, it appears that it contains no such specific provision. Was
any thought given to streamlining the approach or will companies still
have to reserve on a case-by-case basis such a provision in their

putting on a statutory footing what was a default regulation under
table A. There is no change on the issue of the senior holder. We did
not look at limiting that. Our view was that limiting the number of

put into their articles. They will be able to do that after the Bill is

Brokenshire:</b> The clause is an entirely new provision. It
states that if a person is not entitled to vote on a resolution, but
does so, and if the articles of association of that company provide a
mechanism for objecting to an improper vote, and if an objection is
made and rejected, or if no objection is made within the relevant time
period, the unauthorised voter</div>
<a name="06062962000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is deemed to have been entitled

deemed to have been entitled
to&#148;</div><a name="06062962000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">do so in such
circumstances. Even if it could be shown that a chairman erred in law,
was negligent, made a manifest error or was fraudulent, the clause
seems to protect him. That is the sort of thing on which I am trying to
glean
clarification.</div><a name="06062962000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
also unclear how statutory minority shareholder protection might
operate in such situations because not only is the decision of the
chairman treated as being upheld, but, from my reading of the clause,
any errors are deemed to be corrected. How will the rights of minority
and other shareholders who have a grievance about that decision be
treated?</div><a name="06062962000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the need for certainty in the context of decisions taken at meetings
and the need for that to be done efficiently, effectively and quickly,
but it would be extraordinary if shareholders could be prejudiced
without any apparent method of challenging a decision that is
irrational, unreasonable or even unlawful. Amendments Nos. 330 and 331
seek to clarify the Government&#146;s intention. If
shareholders&#146; rights are undermined by the clause, the balance
of convenience should be weighed in favour of shareholders whose rights
might be
prejudiced.</div><a name="06062962000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000319"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a difficult point and his
amendment gave me cause for thought. The conflict is that we want to
provide commercial certainty for the company. The ability constantly to
question decisions taken after a meeting would undermine that
commercial certainty. We also want to ensure that those who take
decisions have a legitimate role and an appropriate locus. I am sure he
agrees that, in the interests of the company, it is better that
objections are dealt with at a meeting and that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 302</div>chairman takes a view on whether people are entitled to vote so that the
matter is settled there and then. If things go badly wrong, other
remedies should be open to members if they feel that the chairman was
in breach of his duties in public law. If they believe that they
suffered unfair prejudice, they should be able to challenge that and
the court has discretion to make a wide range of orders.</div>
<a name="06062962000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we think we have got
it right. We may be able to tweak this at the edges. Perhaps the hon.
Gentleman will allow us to consider his amendments and return to the
matter on Report to ensure that we have the proper balance between
certainty for members and ensuring that the right people vote at
meetings.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000320"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to
reflect on the provision in greater detail. It is a sensitive issue and
needs to be examined carefully. My fundamental concern is the need for
commercial certainty and the desire to have things settled quickly and
effectively by the chairman in accordance with the articles of
association.</div> <a name="06062962000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern relates to the latter point that the Minister highlighted on
remedies that might be available to shareholders. The phrase:</div>
<a name="06062962000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;deemed to have been entitled to
vote as he did&#148;,</div><a name="06062962000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
subsection (2) gave me cause for thought, hence my amendments, and
should not in any way invalidate or undermine the remedies that might
otherwise lie open to a particular shareholder. If there is deemed to
be prejudice, the company or directors could say, &#147;Even if there
was prejudice, on the face of it and by virtue of allowing someone to
vote who should not have been allowed to vote, that is remedied and
cured as a consequence of clause 270(2).&#148;</div>
<a name="06062962000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of the
Minister&#146;s agreement to reflect on those thoughts and to return
to the matter on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000321"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Clause 271(5) refers to the effectiveness of
written resolutions, and states
that</div><a name="06062962000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;references in
enactments passed or made before this section comes into
force...at which a resolution is passed or to members voting in
favour of a resolution shall be construed
accordingly.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
recognise the use of the clause to allow shareholders in companies with
articles of association predating the new Bill to have the benefit of
its written resolution provisions, if a company had deliberately opted
for meetings to approve resolutions, for whatever reason, what impact
would the provision have in that
context?</div><a name="06062962000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 283
suggests that that cannot be done, but I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s confirmation, as it seems to me that a company, for
whatever reason, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 303</div>might wish to entrench something in its articles to ensure that a
general meeting is held, rather than relying on a written resolution
provision. I would appreciate clarification and perhaps some thoughts
about why that particular approach has been
taken.</div>
<a name="06062962000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000322"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000323"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Clause 283
states:</div><a name="06062962000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
provision of the articles of a private company is void in so far as it
would have the effect that a resolution that is required by or
otherwise provided for in an enactment could not be proposed and passed
as a written
resolution.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
take it that if the article said that something had to be passed at a
general meeting, clause 283 would override it. I raise the
matter in the context of clause 271 because it makes provision in
respect of written resolutions of private companies. I want to be sure
that my reading of the proposal is correct in terms of how clause
271(5) will apply to the moving of written resolutions and what
protection might be afforded to companies in that respect. I hope the
Minister can clarify the
point.</div><a name="06062962000138"></a>

look at clause 283 when we consider transition arrangements and we may
wish to return to the matter then. Clause 271(5) applies only to
enactments, so in relation to Acts, regulations and so on, existing

that deals with the point, but I hope it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000325"></a>James

already mentioned statutory provisions in relation to the removal of
directors and auditors. My point is about what will happen if a company
wants to entrench within its articles a particular issue&#151;for
example, the right to deal with something in a general meeting rather
than a written resolution. Will it be entitled to do so in those
circumstances?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000328"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> During discussions in Grand Committee in the

the time of the

of the last of the written notices to shareholders or the first, when
notification of written resolutions is sent out at different

clause 340, page 152, line 4, leave out subsections (3) and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000333"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> We move on to clause 274, which deals with
the circulation of written resolutions proposed by directors and, in
particular, the sanctions and provisions that might apply in those
circumstances. Subsection (7) refers clearly to what happens in the
event of a
defect:</div><a name="06062962000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
validity of the resolution, if passed, is not affected by a failure to
comply with this
section.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
notwithstanding the defect and the fact that a shareholder has not been
notified of the written resolutions, if a resolution is still passed by
the appropriate majority, it will
stand.</div><a name="06062962000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many
respects, we have in this subsection a codification of the errors and
omissions-type provisions that have been common in the articles of
association of companies up to now in respect of general meetings or
general written resolutions to provide the certainty in the outcome of
resolutions that we have discussed more generally today. However, there
is a criminal sanction on directors for failure to comply, even though
a minor issue, an error or an oversight might be involved and there was
no deliberate intention to arrive at that situation.</div>
<a name="06062962000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is interesting that in
clause 270, which we have discussed in relation to the
chairman&#146;s role in determining the outcome of meetings, there is
no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 305</div>specific sanction on the chairman if the chairman gets it wrong. I am
highlighting a consistency
argument.</div><a name="06062962000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
other relevant provision to consider in that context is clause 296,
which in some ways reflects a similar approach. It talks
about</div><a name="06062962000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;accidental failure
to give notice&#148;</div> <a name="06062962000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">of a
resolution or meeting, and says that such an accidental
failure</div><a name="06062962000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall be
disregarded for the purpose of determining whether notice of the
meeting or the resolution...is duly
given.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways, it
reflects the approach of the written resolution route. However, there
is no criminal sanction in that context, so that if there is a general
meeting and failure to give notice to a shareholder, the resolution is
ultimately still held to be valid, although there is no criminal
sanction for failing to give notice. However, if there is a failure to
give a copy of a written resolution to a shareholder, there is a
criminal sanction. This is a question whether that is the right
approach.</div>
<a name="06062962000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000334"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend is making an important point. The
fact of the matter is that if a written resolution is not circulated to
one of 50 shareholders, it might simply be a mistake. These things
happen in real life. On the other hand, it might be a serious attempt
at fraud, and an effective one in terms of disrupting the business of
the company. As things stand, the clause does not provide for that
balance to be taken into account.</div>
<a name="06062962000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000335"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes the right point about
fraud. In tabling the amendments, I was not in any way seeking to
downplay the need for compliance and ensuring that shareholders receive
proper notification in such circumstances. This is about genuine
error.</div> <a name="06062962000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Written
resolutions, as we have discussed this morning, are limited to private
companies, not public. However, it is still possible for private
companies to have a considerable number of shareholders. In many
respects, it is possible to have a private offering that is not on
offer to the public and still gain a large number of
shareholders.</div><a name="06062962000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
experience, I have encountered private companies that surprisingly have
100 members. An administrative error might occur under such
circumstances in relation to ensuring that all shareholders are given
proper notification of meetings or written
resolutions.</div><a name="06062962000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
matter of how to strike the right balance. Interestingly, in other
contexts&#151;for example, under the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000&#151;there is the concept of a civil penalty, which is
almost like a civil fine. With that sanction, it is possible to bring
some financial penalty against a person for failing to comply with the
regulation without giving them the criminal record that the clause
refers to.</div><a name="06062962000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 344 makes a similar point in the context of disclosing the results
of a poll under clause 324, and amendment No. 347 makes it about the
records of decisions by a sole member for the purposes of clause 340.
In that last case, it is difficult to see whom the provision is trying
to protect, as the sole member is the person who has taken the decision
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 306</div>that decision can affect only his or her interests. It is therefore
interesting to wonder who needs to be protected by the criminal
sanctions.</div><a name="06062962000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">How do we
ensure compliance? How do we ensure that shareholders are properly
protected, that there is no fraud and that companies are administered
appropriately, effectively and in accordance with the law, without at
the same time unduly penalising directors who make a genuine and minor
mistake resulting in failure to
notify?</div><a name="06062962000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I question
whether the approach to written resolutions and notification of general
meetings strikes the right balance. What factors underlie the
Government&#146;s decision to treat written resolutions differently
from general meetings of
shareholders?</div><a name="06062962000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000336"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised several issues.
First, he mentioned the fact that whatever happens and whatever
sanctions exist, the resolution remains valid if passed. That relates
to the point that we discussed earlier: the company must have certainty
to be able to pursue its business effectively and efficiently. That is
why that part of clause 276 has been
included.</div><a name="06062962000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s second issue was that our approach to sanctions is
inconsistent. During debate on an earlier clause, we talked about the
possibility of taking action if it is felt that the chairman has abused
his powers in considering the company&#146;s business and
resolutions. Members can take action in that context. The chairman
could be in breach of his duties under common law, or a member could
claim to have suffered unfair prejudice. In such circumstances, the
courts have a wide range of orders, so there is some
consistency.</div><a name="06062962000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s third issue dealt with giving notice. I say to him
simply that there is a sanction. It is a civil sanction, not a criminal
sanction, and I accept the
difference.</div><a name="06062962000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s view is that resolutions are particularly important
because of their potential impact on how the company proceeds in
running its affairs, and it is therefore right that there should be a
tougher sanction for that. It would be slightly excessive to assume
that simply failing to give a notice, which may or may not be
deliberate, requires the same sort of criminal sanction to be attached
to
it.</div><a name="06062962000257"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06062962000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth
issue that the hon. Gentleman raised was sole members, but of course if
a resolution is not circulated to a sole member, it will not happen, so
there is no need for us to cover that
case.</div><a name="06062962000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me talk
about the sanctions generally. This issue was discussed in the context
of the work undertaken by the company law review, and the hon.
Gentleman may have read the report arising from that. The review
suggested that it was better to bring into the legal provision a clear,
accessible and consistent approach. The CLR recommended that, in
future, company law should as a general principle state clearly in
relation to every rule what the consequences of a breach should be.
When we reviewed the minor criminal offences used to enforce regulatory
requirements in current law, the CLR concluded that those were
justified by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 307</div>cost-effectiveness achieved, compared with the relative inefficiency of
any alternative
approach.</div><a name="06062962000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In clauses
274, 324 and 340, we set out the consequences of failing to comply with
the requirements of those clauses. We consider that the offences
represent proportionate and effective sanctions and appropriate
enforcement. I hope that, with that explanation and the response to the
various issues that he raised, the hon. Gentleman will feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062962000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000337"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am not happy with the Minister&#146;s
response on this issue. It is interesting that she drew a distinction
between resolutions and notices and suggested that a default in
relation to the provision of a notice was considered perhaps a slightly
lesser issue than one in relation to providing a copy of the written
resolution. That misses the point. The purpose of a notice to a
shareholder is to inform them of a general meeting at which a
resolution is to be passed. Therefore, if they do not receive such a
notice, they will be unable to exercise their vote on the resolution
and have their say. In the same way, if a shareholder does not receive
a copy of the written resolution, they are unable to cast their vote on
the resolution. They are two means of achieving exactly the same
thing.</div><a name="06062962000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is peculiar
to draw a distinction between not supplying a notice of a general
meeting and not receiving a copy of the written resolution, because the
result is exactly the same for the shareholder. In both circumstances,
the shareholder is denied their right to vote, whether by putting their
squiggle on the bottom of a piece of paper, by physically attending a
meeting, putting their hand up and voting, or by voting by
proxy.</div><a name="06062962000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not accept
that distinction. I do not see why one action is treated as a criminal
offence, with everything that that entails, and the other is treated as
a civil offence. I do not see the fundamental distinction drawn between
the two. There should be broad equivalence. Either both should be
criminal offences, or both should be subject to civil sanction. The
fact that minority shareholder protection rights are available in
relation to a breach of the notice provisions is fine, but we are still
talking about a civil sanction, not a criminal
sanction.</div><a name="06062962000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
noting that directors and officers may seek to rely on third parties,
whether they be solicitors, agents or registrars, in sending out
notices of meetings or written resolutions. If there is a default in
one case, the director is potentially criminally liable, but in the
other case, they are not. Circumstances may be outside the control of
the director. A minor error may occur. It therefore seems strange, to
say the least, that the director should be criminally liable in one set
of circumstances, but not the other. That is why I feel discomfort at
the approach taken in the Bill.</div>
<a name="06062962000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">In making those comments,
however, I should re-emphasise that I in no way wish to indicate that
there should not be compliance&#151;there clearly should be. We have
talked about a situation in which there might be fraud, and it is
absolutely right that protections should be adopted. All that I am
saying is that we need greater consistency in the treatment of the two
routes for passing a resolution. They both have the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 308</div>same end result, and I am trying to test the inconsistency in their
treatment through the amendment.</div>

see that it relates to a different set of circumstances. It talks about
the</div>
<a name="06062962000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Accidental failure to
give notice of resolution or
meeting&#148;,</div><a name="06062962000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">not the
deliberate or fraudulent failure to which he alluded. If the failure is
accidental, it is much more appropriate to have a civil, not a criminal
remedy. I cannot remember whether the hon. Gentleman is a lawyer or an
accountant, but let me simply give him the legal advice that I have
received: there can be no equivalent civil remedy with written
resolutions; otherwise, the mechanism does not work. That is the legal
advice, and it is another reason for going down the route proposed in
the Bill. The hon. Gentleman looks puzzled, but all I can say is that
that is the legal advice I have received.</div>
<a name="06062962000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000339"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
intervention, but as my furrowed brow suggested, I did not quite follow
the legal argument. If she could write to me with that legal advice on
the written resolution route, that would certainly help to provide
clarification as to why that route has been adopted.</div>
<a name="06062962000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister makes an
interesting distinction in relation to clause 296. She says that it
relates to</div>

give notice of resolution or
meeting&#148;,</div><a name="06062962000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that is
perhaps the right way to address the issue. There might be an
accidental failure to give a shareholder a written resolution
notification, and it seems strange and inconsistent that such a
provision could not be adopted for use with a written resolution
approach. The Government seem to accept that a mistake could be made in
one set of circumstances, but not in the circumstances that we are
discussing.</div> <a name="06062962000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
be appropriate for the Minister to reflect on my comments, and I
genuinely look forward to seeing the legal statements that she has
received on the legal basis for the provisions. It would be helpful to
reflect further because, although she might not be entirely persuaded
now, this is a serious issue. A minor error could result in a director
suffering a significant criminal penalty, and I find it strange that
that is the intention.</div>

that she will provide the legal advice, and in the context of what she
so eloquently described as my musings&#151;I hope that they were more
substantive and cogent than mere musings&#151;I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000344"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The clause deals with the members&#146;
power to require the circulation of a statement or written resolution,
particularly the requirement in clause
275(3):</div><a name="06062962000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
the members require a company to circulate a resolution they may
require the company to circulate with it a statement of not more than
1,000 words on the subject matter of the
resolution.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to probe the protection of the company. If the
statements that the members seek to include in the 1,000-word document
that goes out with the written resolution are defamatory, what
happens?</div><a name="06062962000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a member
requires a company to circulate such a written resolution, that would
suggest that something has gone wrong, that there has been some sort of
breakdown within the company and some significant issue has arisen that
necessitates the member insisting that the company of which they are a
member circulates a written resolution. The mechanism is intended to
provide for and to protect in that sort of circumstance, so that a
shareholder or group of shareholders is able to require that the
company is at least bound to consider a particular course of
action.</div> <a name="06062962000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against that
backdrop, the situation is likely to be tense and difficult. There are
various allegations that may or may not be asserted in such
circumstances to justify the fact that a written resolution is sought.
Against that backdrop, it is important that the statements that are
contained in any accompanying document are not defamatory. The company,
in receiving those statements and circulating them to a wider audience,
could be putting itself in a difficult legal position. By that method
the company could be exposing itself to an action for
defamation.</div><a name="06062962000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek merely to clarify. I note that the Minister is flicking
through the Bill at the moment&#151;I know that there are certain
provisions that allow court challenges and so on and so forth. However,
in speaking to the amendments I am seeking to ensure that there is
clarity in the Bill and that the company has the ability, where
something clearly is defamatory, not to have to circulate the
statement. It would clearly be damaging to the interests of the company
as a whole if in doing so the company exposed itself to liability for
defamation action from a third party, even if that was not something
that the company itself was advocating. However, by publishing that
defamatory statement the company itself would incur a liability.
Therefore, the amendment would allow a company to reject a statement if
it was
defamatory.</div><a name="06062962000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 341 makes the same point about clause 297 and the ability of
shareholders to require 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 310</div>that the company circulate a statement in connection with a resolution
proposed to be dealt with at a general meeting. It is the same point as
in the circulation of notices, information and statements to
shareholders more generally, whether they be in the context of the
written resolution or of a resolution proposed to be taken at a general
meeting.</div>
<a name="06062962000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000345"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the
circumstances in which one might want to circulate such a statement are
likely to be pretty tense and contentious. Equally, what we have to do
is to balance the right of shareholders to put their point of view and
to have that discussed in relation to particular resolutions at the
meetings. That right is what we are trying to
protect.</div><a name="06062962000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
problem with the company itself determining whether a resolution is
defamatory. As the hon. Gentleman was speaking, I was thinking of the
times that I have thought that the press has defamed me, only to be
told by eminent lawyers that I am completely and utterly wrong and that
I just have to take it as perfectly valid criticism. There is a
tendency for the injured party to think that a statement is defamatory
when it is not.</div>
<a name="06062962000258"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06062962000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult
for us to provide directors or the company itself with the authority to
determine whether to circulate a statement in those circumstances. That
is why clause 278(1) provides for a company to apply to the court not
to circulate a statement if it feels that the statement is defamatory.
We must enhance shareholder engagement. The hon. Gentleman has raised a
difficult issue, but if an individual shareholder wishes to have a
statement distributed, the appropriate way of determining whether it is
defamatory is through the courts rather than through those who feel
defamed.</div>
<a name="06062962000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000346"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister has raised two points about the
amendment. First, the company itself could take the view that something
was defamatory; that is a fair point. In the situations under
discussion, allegation and counter-allegation would probably prompt a
challenge to the statement, which might be about the running of the
company and a shareholder&#146;s belief that the directors were being
negligent and not fulfilling their duties appropriately. I have some
sympathy with the Minister&#146;s argument. For that reason, the
amendment was drafted so that it was objective, not subjective. It
says, provided that the</div>
<a name="06062962000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;statement is not defamatory of
any person&#148;,</div> <a name="06062962000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
provided that &#147;in the view of the company, the statement is
defamatory.&#148; That was the rationale behind drafting the
amendment in that way. The Minister raised a fair point, and for the
company to assert and rely on that, there would at least need to be the
appropriate legal back-up, which in all likelihood would be by way of a
legal opinion to justify the claim that a statement was defamatory. By
tabling the amendment, I did not seek to ride roughshod over the valid
and important perspective that the Minister adopted, nor override a
shareholder&#146;s freedom of speech. The point has been considered
in the context of the amendment.</div>
<a name="06062962000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000347"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> If that is the case, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point is covered by clause 278(1).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 311</div><a name="06062962000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000348"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My second point relates to clause
278(1). The Minister adopts the argument that it would cover the
circumstances of a defamatory statement, but I did not read that
approach into it. It says that</div>
<a name="06062962000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court is satisfied that the
rights conferred by section 275 and that section are being
abused.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not say
that the statement being circulated is incorrect; it says that the
section is being abused. That somewhat unclear language prompted me to
table the amendments, because in talking about the section being
abused, it was not clear to me that the language in clause 278(1) would
cover the circumstances under discussion.</div>
<a name="06062962000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 275, which the
subsection specifically refers to, provides for the requirement to
circulate a written resolution. I think that the provision is getting
at the idea that the statement might be frivolous or an abuse of the
process&#151;in other words, that a shareholder might merely use it
as a method of being abusive to the company directors.</div>
<a name="06062962000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I entirely understand how
clause 278(1) is intended to cover a vexatious use of the provision,
but I am concerned that such usage could be perfectly valid in relation
to clause 275. A shareholder might have a legitimate complaint about
the company&#146;s operations, and therefore a legitimate right to
require the circulation of a written resolution, but in the statement
that is adopted with it, they overstate their case in some way and it
becomes defamatory, injurious or capableof causing some other
loss. The amendments were tabled because of my uncertainty as to the
ambit of clause 278(1) by virtue of the reference to:</div>
<a name="06062962000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the rights conferred by section
275 and that section are being
abused.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a question of whether they are being abused
here.</div><a name="06062962000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000349"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I think we are slightly dancing on the head of a
pin. I accept that this is in relation to the resolution not the
statement, but clause 275
states:</div><a name="06062962000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
resolution may properly be moved as a written resolution unless...
it is defamatory of any person, or... it is frivolous or
vexatious.&#148;</div><a name="06062962000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I genuinely
believe that we have covered the point, in how we articulate it in
clause 275, in how we set it out in clause 276 and in how we give the
power in clause 278 to go to the
courts.</div><a name="06062962000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000350"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> Perhaps it is the caveat on that issue which
causes me the problem&#151;it refers only to the written resolution.
Perhaps the Minister will reflect on that point and on the fact that
the extension is not also applied to the statement itself. I do not
think that that is the intention. I take on board what the Minister has
said. It is one of those legal points that we need to get right. That
is what the Committee is here to do.</div>
<a name="06062962000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister would reflect
on that issue in the context of the statement and give it some further
consideration that would address my concerns. I do not know whether she
is prepared to do that. She rightly pointed out the distinction between
the written resolution and the statement that goes alongside it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>That is the point at issue. I would be prepared to seek the
Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw the amendment in those
circumstances.</div><a name="06062962000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062962000351"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am a really willing person. I genuinely think on
this one that there is not a point to be pursued; otherwise I would
pursue it. The hon. Gentleman has not convinced me this morning. I
think that we have covered the point. I am conscious of not wanting to
overburden myself and my officials, but if he wishes to write to me I
undertake to look at the matter seriously.</div>

Brokenshire:</b> The clause relates to the cost of circulating
a written resolution requisitioned by shareholders. A company is not
bound to comply unless there is deposited or tendered a sum reasonably
sufficient to meet its expenses in so doing. Protection for
shareholders is therefore provided in respect of this issue. What is
the cost likely to be? The company appears to have an upper hand in
negotiation. It is not bound to comply unless it has received the
requisite sum. The amendment seeks to ensure that there is some sort of
audit protection of the amount. The company should not be able to abuse
its position by stating that it needs a certain sum to comply with the
relevant requirements and in so doing prevents the shareholders from
exercising their rights.</div>
