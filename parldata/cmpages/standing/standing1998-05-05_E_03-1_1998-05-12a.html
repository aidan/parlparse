<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Before I return to clause 8, I should like to ask your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, for hon. Members to remove their jackets because it is warm in here.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If hon. Members wish, they may remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Financial Secretary said this morning that she would make available in good time for the debate on clauses 28 and 29 draft regulations relating to those clauses. I have not received a copy of those draft regulations and I was not able to understand from the exchange this morning what the Financial Secretary meant by "in good time". I once again ask you, Mrs. Dunwoody, to establish when members of the Committee might expect to receive the draft regulations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Luckily, it is not a matter for the Chair whether Members of Parliament understand what Ministers say. However, the reality is that the Financial Secretary will have heard the hon. Gentleman. The Committee knows that the Chair is not responsible for the provision of individual papers.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This morning we established that one set of the draft regulations was placed in the Library on 24 April. The remaining set, which will be on the board for members tomorrow morning, should be collected before it goes into their internal post.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot have too many hon. Members wandering around the Committee.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I draw hon. Members' attention to this because the set of draft regulations could be sent on to their constituency before they manage to intercept it. I hope that that finally deals with 
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) rose 
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Obviously it does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Will the Financial Secretary confirm whether just one set will be placed on the board? Will there also be a set relating to schedule 4 and clause 32?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I undertook to make available the two sets of regulations that we discussed this morning. One is available. The second will be on the board tomorrow so that the clauses can be debated. The previous Government did not circulate draft regulations in advance. We are doing all we can to assist members of the Committee.
<P>
As for clause 8 and this morning's debate on ultra-low sulphur diesel, I want to conclude my remarks on the recent updating of the European programme for emissions of fuel from engine technology equations. Recent trials involving London Transport buses and London taxis have shown significant reductions in particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions. The reductions in particulates, including those emitted by heavy duty vehicles using city diesel, were larger than the equation indicated. That deals with the points made on vehicle emissions.
<P>
Hon. Members asked whether increased refinery emissions would result from the production of ultra-low sulphur diesel and the environmental benefits be lost. In considering the impact on carbon dioxide emissions, we should allow for the fact that the cleaner diesel will be less dense. Therefore, even if fuel consumption does increase, there may still be a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, reflecting the lower carbon content of a litre of the cleaner, ultra-low sulphur, diesel.
<P>
Users have generally experienced a negligible impact on fuel consumption from use of the cleaner diesel, so there will be improvements in carbon dioxide emissions. However, in some cases I refer again to the taxi trials there was a significant improvement in fuel consumption of 5 per cent. to 10 per cent., despite the lower density fuel, from the cleansing effect of city diesel on engines and the resulting improvement to the combustion process. Low sulphur fuels are also needed in order to allow more efficient combustion processes while meeting nitrogen dioxide emissions standards. The new specifications, together with lower density, will mean that 1 litre of ultra-low sulphur diesel will produce less CO2, thus offsetting any greater production emissions.
<P>
Hon. Members asked about timing in relation to the specifications. The underlying point is about consultation with the industry. Conservative Members will not be surprised to learn because this was also their practice when their party was in Government that not every taxation measure can be the subject of full and open consultation. There will be instances, such as this, when Ministers choose to reserve the right not to consult in the light of circumstances relating to a particular proposal. The code of practice on consultation, to which hon. Members referred, specifically identifies tax measures as unsuitable for consultation where there is a significant risk of forestalling. Those principles apply in this case. It is also important to remember that the changes were accompanied by an increase in the duty incentive. It is[Dawn Primarolo]
up to the industry to choose whether it reacts to this incentive or not.
<P>
I have dealt with consultation, specification and definition, particularly the questions of density and distillation, alignment, or lack of it, with the auto oil standards, the impact on vehicle emissions, the evidence on which the Government based their decision the studies and information about the industry a response to the suggestion that there would be increased emissions and the issue of timing.
<P>
Several other general points were raised about the proposals. The first related to the lack of a green book with the Budget. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the measures specifically identified as environmental measures are included in the Red Book, along with their contribution to air quality or CO2 emission targets. The question whether the green book should be separate or integrated into the Red Book has been discussed by the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs and by many environmental groups. The general view is that environmental matters should be integrated into the Red Book and not separated from economics.
<P>
As Committee members have pointed out, the Treasury Select Committee and the Select Committee on Environmental Audit expressed views about that development, and when I gave evidence during the public hearing of the transport sub-committee of the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs you chair that sub-committee, Mrs. Dunwoody the same point was made to me.
<P>
Those Committee members who said that the Government's policy lacks direction and specific objectives are wrong. In the Red Book, road fuels are mentioned in paragraph 3.30 on page 72. Paragraph 5.2 on page 74 sets out the Government's objectives for the structure of duties on road fuel over time. Paragraph 4.3 contains targets for the local air pollution and national air quality strategy, and table C1, item 38 on page 153 refers to the relationship between ultra-low sulphur diesel and diesel. We intend over the next few years to use incentives in the tax system to encourage people to use ultra-low sulphur diesel and to encourage refineries to produce it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): A green book was promised before the election, and when the Financial Secretary appeared before the Select Committee on Environmental Audit she gave the impression that all future Budgets would be accompanied by a full green book that contained all environmental Treasury considerations. There is a world of difference between that green book and a few page references in the Red Book. Is the Financial Secretary going back on the green book per se, and will she report that through the Select Committee on Environmental Audit?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, Mrs. Dunwoody. If the hon. Gentleman reads the evidence that was submitted and reconsiders my comments, he will realise that the Government are not pulling back from including an environmental assessment in the Budget. This is the first time that any Government have sought to make the environmental impact clear in the Red Book. As we discussed in relation to clause 8, it is important to assess whether a measure is targeted, what its objectives are and whether it will reach them, and we are committed to making such an assessment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said that the Government are anti-car or perhaps he said that we give the impression of being anti-car. He also made the important point, with which I agree, that the Government support responsible use of the car and we believe that it is important to recognise the environmental consequencs of the use of cars. We concentrate on the use of the car rather than on ownership. When we discuss vehicle excise duty, we shall highlight that matter. Transport is the fastest growing sector that produces CO2 emissions, but it is not the only sector. As the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will know, a climate change consultation will take place following the Kyoto decisions and the agreements reached in New York by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A transport White Paper will shortly be published. Air quality targets are being refined. Sir Colin Marshall has been asked to review the possible use of an industrial energy tax. Moreover, the Bill's proposals on vehicle excise duty and on road fuel gases are bearing down on those matters. The Government are seeking to construct a full strategy, and to establish the targets that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly says are necessary. The Government are also consulting on an aggregates tax and on water pollution. Moreover, the Bill contains proposals on landfill.
<P>
I shall not discuss the Government's environmental agenda further, Mrs. Dunwoody, for fear of stretching your tolerance too far. However, I remind the Committee that the 50 parts per million standard for ultra-low sulphur did not deliver sufficient emissions benefits to justify a duty advantage of 1p per litre, particularly if used without a particulate trap, as the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) noted. In such circumstances little benefit was gained in particulate emissions, and an approximate saving on nitrogen oxides of only four per cent. was achieved.
<P>
The Government are anxious to see real benefits. Although the new standard for ultra-low sulphur diesel is tougher, an extra 1p per litre has been added to the differential. That should help to ensure that a fuel is produced that delivers real emission benefits. The table to which I drew the Committee's attention lays out the Government's intentions in subsequent years.
<P>
The criteria of density and distillation were decided after consultation with the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, and with the Department of Trade and Industry. Those criteria took into account pre-Budget representations by other Ministers and by the trade. Other criteria such as aromatics content and cetane were considered, but density and distillation were thought to give the best balance between emissions benefits and cost of production. That balance is exactly the one that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge implored us to strike.
<P>
As I have said, not everything in the tax sphere can sensibly be the subject of consultation. Nevertheless, the Government have conducted a great deal of relevant research, and have drawn on information and pre-Budget submissions.
<P>
The Budget measure is not about auto-oil and possible fuel standards in seven years' time. It is about a fuel for today that delivers real benefits in our congested and polluted urban areas. It is too easy to focus on the clause's technical aspects at the expense of an increased duty incentive that will be increased further in the next Budget. We are anxious to obtain the maximum emission benefits balanced against the duty incentive. We will therefore keep the specification under review.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I appreciate the Financial Secretary's sincere remarks about the improvements that the increased specification for ultra-low sulphur diesel will bring to the environment. If what she says is right, will the Government discontinue the trend set by the previous Administration of increasing the duty on diesel rather than petrol? The differential between diesel and petrol was widened as diesel was perceived to be more environmentally unfriendly.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With the greatest respect, I must point out that interventions must be brief. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make a speech, he may be called if he catches my eye.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> When I referred to the Red Book I made the Government's position clear: the relationship between diesel, leaded petrol, unleaded petrol and ultra-low sulphur diesel must reflect their contributions to improving air quality and minimising emissions. We must increase the incentive for the production of ultra-low sulphur diesel if its use is to grow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am afraid that I am not entirely sure that the Financial Secretary has answered some of the points raised. A confusing exchange took place at the beginning of her speech, when she appeared to suggest that the British refinery industry had not been placed at a disadvantage by the surprise announcement of the change of specification. For the sake of clarity and to help the Financial Secretary to be certain that she has not misled the Committee in any way I shall outline my understanding of what occurred on Budget day, which I have checked with representatives of the industry since lunch time.
<P>
At 3pm on Budget day, stocks of ultra-low sulphur diesel, which United Kingdom refiners had refined to the previous specification at a cost of approximately31/2p more per litre than standard diesel, were in the pipeline. Those manufacturers reasonably expected to receive a duty rebate of 1p per litre as it then was or 2p following the introduction of the Budget measures. At 6 pm on Budget day, that product became, at a stroke, unsaleable as ultra-low sulphur diesel, and ineligible for the duty rebate. The industry was left with no option but to deliver that product to retail as standard diesel, at a considerable loss.
<P>
It is not only the Financial Secretary who has had representations from the industry association about the unprecedented way in which such a change of specification, occasioning financial loss to an industry, was made without any prior consultation. Customs and Excise also received direct representations from one of the UK's major refiners, which found itself especially affected by the structure of its stocks in the pipeline on that afternoon.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary now confirm that that is what happened? Will she explain why the industry was not consulted? It is not sufficient to say that sometimes tax-related measures cannot be the subject of prior consultation we all understand that. The proposal to change the specification of ultra-low sulphur diesel was not likely to be market-sensitive in the same way as other Budget measures.
<P>
The Government have given an example of how not to foster co-operation between Government and industry, and the Financial Secretary owes the UK refining industry an apology which I hope that she will give for the way in which the measure was introduced.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have made the position with regard to consultation, and the basis on which the Government consult on tax issues, clear to the Committee. The hon. Gentleman wants the added incentive, which was also introduced at 6 pm on Budget day, without the added specification that delivers the standards required to meet the Government's emissions targets. I repeat what I said to the hon. Gentleman this morning, and I urge him to ask the industry again whether the ultra-low sulphur diesel in stock at 6 pm on Budget day would have been sold as diesel, regardless of the changes to the specification. That is the issue. When the Government give a tax incentive to obtain a change in specification and to deliver a higher standard, that is what they expect to happen. That is the answer that I gave the hon. Gentleman this morning and it is the one that I give him this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): This has been an important debate. Indeed, the longer it has gone on, the more justified the Committee has been in devoting time to it. We have been hoping for a more robust defence of clause 8 than the Financial Secretary has been able to provide, but let us concentrate first on what she has said.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has confirmed to the Committee that Labour is now breaking its promise to produce a green book. That is the second broken promise in a single day. This morning it was confirmed, Mrs. Dunwoody, when, regrettably, you were not with us, that Labour was breaking its promise to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"initiate an urgent, independent and comprehensive study"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of excise fraud.
<P>
The debate on clause 8 has turned on three key issues the consultation that the industry expected, the origin of the specification that it chose and its alignment with British and European standards.
<P>
On alignment, the Financial Secretary certainly confused the Committee. At one stage she said that the new specification was not aligned with any long-term British or European specification because, she said, this was "not about fuel standards as such". A few minutes later she said that the specification was "about fuel standards today". Then she said that the Budget was[Mr. Michael Fallon]
about "measures now". The plain fact is that this specification has been plucked out of the air out of the air inside Whitehall.
<P>
The second point is the origin of the specification. It now emerges that it was drawn up entirely internally, inside Whitehall, in consultation not with the industries concerned, not with the experts, but with the other Departments involved, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>
The third point is the failure to consult more widely. You were not, unfortunately, with us, Mrs. Dunwoody, when the Financial Secretary read out this morning a letter written to herself, indeed praising herself. It is only reasonable that we keep redressing the balance. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) read out the letter from the Petroleum Industry Association to her on 7 April, because it deals with precisely the point that she raised. She said that not everything could be consulted on, because of Budget secrecy and so on, but the Petroleum Industry Association specifically criticises her for making changes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in areas normally pre-discussed with the oil industry ... we were extremely surprised to be suddenly at the sharp end of exactly the opposite happening."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what it said to her on 7 April, so in this instance the consultation has been lacking.
<P>
We can see now why the Financial Secretary would have done better to consult. At the end of the debate, she suddenly chucked in I am sure that we did not miss it an undertaking to keep the specification under review. She does not have much confidence in it either. There is one way out. First, she should have apologised to the industry she was given the opportunity to do so for the lack of consultation on the specification. I think that it would be better if she undertook to recommit the clause. There would be no shame in that. New Governments make mistakes, and this Government have made several on foreign income dividends, individual savings accounts and so on. It would be to the Financial Secretary's credit if she admitted that the Government did not consult properly on the clause, and took it away, consulted the industry again and redrafted it. If she gives us that undertaking, I shall give her an undertaking that the Opposition will ensure that the redrafted clause is handled without delay. If she is not prepared to do that, I urge the Committee to reject the clause because of its sudden introduction and the Government's failure to consult on the detail.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I should like to point out to the hon. Gentleman that it is a good specification. We consulted on it in the same way as his Government did when they introduced the original specification for ultra-low sulphur diesel. That was not pre-discussed with the industry. Perhaps the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) can explain why.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): The Financial Secretary is contradicting the letter sent by the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association. She is effectively accusing it of lying. The UKPIA made it clear my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) and I both quoted it that previous Governments pre-discussed the matter with the oil industry. I can also confirm, from my experience as a junior Minister in the Department of the Environment and in the Treasury, that we discussed the matter with the industry.
<P>
I am not asking the Financial Secretary to believe me. I am asking her to take seriously the letter from a respected trade organisation which has stated that it has not received from this Government the courtesy of consultation about highly technical matters which, with the best will in the world, officials and Ministers do not understand. That is the clear message. I ask her to withdraw her comment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is this an intervention?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will not withdraw my comment. I have explained the position to the Committee. The right hon. Gentleman's crocodile tears can continue to flow, but I have made the Government's strategy clear. I ask members of the Committee to endorse the clause.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The clause establishes revenue safeguards against mixing ultra-low sulphur with other less environmentally friendly heavy oils after duty has been paid at the differing rates. The emissions savings of ultra-low sulphur diesel can be reduced by such mixing, which can result in a loss to the Exchequer through tax avoidance. The clause protects the Revenue from that loss and I ask the Committee to support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is there any evidence to suggest that such losses occur? I am a rather elementary mathematician, but it seems to me that if ultra-low sulphur diesel and standard diesel have the same pump price, the incentive to mix the two in order to defraud the Revenue is rather limited. Why is this an issue at all?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The answer is that the problem does occur, and the difference in duty paid and the added incentives provide additional pressures. Once ultra-low sulphur diesel has been produced we should ensure that that is what is delivered to the consumer at the pump.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Since I did not manage to catch your eye, Mrs. Dunwoody, during our debate on the previous clause, I shall make the points that I would have made then in relation to clause 9 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will make points that are relevant to clause 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Indeed. Their relevance will become clear in a moment. I refer to the offence that took place on Budget day and to the Financial Secretary's comments today about the duty that could or could not be reclaimed by diesel manufacturers.
<P>
This morning, the Financial Secretary denied that any stocks of ultra-low sulphur diesel existed at the time of the Budget; when she was challenged on that she said, "Yes, of course those stocks existed," and she explained that somehow the diesel manufacturers were able to trade those stocks in in order to reclaim the then 1p duty that was available. This afternoon, she changed her mind again and said that it was not possible to trade those stocks in 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> This is relevant, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I hope that you will allow me a second to explain why.
<P>
The Financial Secretary said this afternoon that it was not possible to reclaim duty on those stocks and that they had to be sold as ordinary diesel rather than as ultra-low sulphur diesel. If those stocks were available, would manufacturers be able to mix them with ultra-low sulphur diesel, under the clause's provisions? That is why the Financial Secretary needs to explain precisely what the position was on Budget day and say whether it will be possible to use those stocks in accordance with clause 9 and not with clause 8.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We will not go back over the debate on the previous clause, but that part of the hon. Gentleman's speech that is relevant is, of course, acceptable.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The added incentive was introduced from 6 pm on Budget day. It is right, therefore, that the specification should be tightened at the same time, so that producers have the option to access the reduced incentive by producing in accordance with the specification in clause 8. Clause 9 prevents mixing of ultra-low sulphur diesel at the new specification with diesel because that would reduce our emission savings, and it would not persuade the consumer to switch to cleaner fuels. That is a clear incentive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> We now move on from the world of refineries and low-sulphur diesel to a rather different world of gaming and amusement machine licence duties. Clause 11 has already been discussed on the Floor of the House, although the Government have now undertaken to change the banding structure, so we expect that clause to be recommitted.
<P>
The amendments relate to clause 12 and to the huge increases that have been proposed in the duty on amusement machine licences. It is important to bear in mind that the clause covers not only machines in large casinos, or even in the more successful bingo clubs, but machines in small premises, in arcades on sea fronts and in working-men's clubs working-men's Conservative clubs or, indeed, working men's old Labour clubs. I shall produce some evidence from each in a moment.
<P>
The increases proposed in the Budget were enormous. For a 5p machine, the licence was to be[Mr. Fallon]
increased from £535 to £645, an increase of 20.5 per cent. For a 10p stake, the licence was increased from £1,375 to £1,815, an increase of 32 per cent. In many cases, the purpose of the machine is to assist the club, which may be a non-profit making organisation, to compete against the pub next door, and to help the club play its social role in the community. The increases are enormous; they will make the lives of such clubs much more difficult, or even threaten their viability.
<P>
That argument is not just relevant today; it is an argument that the Financial Secretary herself put forward in 1995 when she addressed a previous Finance Bill Committee. Indeed, she did not simply speak in favour of, but moved amendments, not to increase duty, as she has done in this Bill, but to reduce it. Four years ago, she spoke of an industry distraught at the Government's proposals distraught at a level of duty that she is now increasing by 32 per cent. If the industry was distraught in 1995, we can imagine how much more unhappy it must be now. On that occasion she criticised the Government; she said that they had:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"incorrectly assessed the ability of the industry to sustain the proposed taxation regime." [Official Report, Standing Committee D, 31 January 1995; c. 12.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, she thought that the duties that she wants to increase today were unsustainable at their 1995 level. I would be interested to know how she has revised her opinion.
<P>
There is another increase to which I should draw the Committee's attention the so-called seasonal

On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I was speaking of the savage increase proposed under the clause. I want to draw the Committee's attention to the increase in what is colloquially known as the seasonal charge, which is the six-monthly license.
<P>
The six-monthly licence used to cost approximately 55 per cent. of the 12-monthly total, but now it costs 62 per cent. of that total. In other words, it has increased by 35 per cent., whereas the 12-month license has increased by only 20 per cent. That is a big increase, which was all the more offensive to the industry because it was not mentioned on Budget day, either in the Treasury announcements or in any of the supporting material. The Government have introduced big increases, and I promise the Committee a little evidence of their effect.
<P>
I am not sure at which end of the country the Committee would like me to start or, indeed, at which end of the spectrum. I shall quote four examples of the effect that the increases will have. I shall begin with a letter that I received from Sherborne Conservative club. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"changes introduced in the recent Budget" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is a serious point 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"will have a devastating effect on the future of our clubs ... I can not believe the Chancellor realised what he was doing ... We are told that the reason for the increase was that we had benefited from deregulation by being allowed to install a third machine. But most clubs have not been able to afford this third machine. Now we can't even afford the first two.
<P>
Whatever the politics, please help us to overturn this decision by persuading the Chancellor and members of the Finance Committee to reconsider".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If I may move briefly round the coast to the seafront at Folkestone a letter from Dreamland Leisure tells us:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The recourse of my business operations will be two-fold; firstly to cut down the number of machines available ... and more importantly, to reduce staffing levels will mean some full time jobs becoming seasonal and fewer seasonal jobs available.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would ask you to take this matter up as quickly as possible so the Finance Committee can reconsider it before it is ratified within that Committee".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To redress the geographical balance, I shall move the Committee's attention further north. Boldon Leisure Ltd., of South Shields, writes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The decision to increase the duty ... is an outrage. This is over a 20 per cent. increase in duty ... For a small arcade of say 30 machines this increases the duty payable from £16,050 to £19,350 bearing in mind that this has to be found after paying VAT on the takings and is an intolerable burden on the industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With VAT on the takings this duty is a tax on tax".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is evidence of the kind of clubs that will be affected by this increase. The industry as a whole protested, and I shall quote yet another letter that the Financial Secretary will not have read to the Committee. It does not praise what she has done. Indeed, the letter from the British Amusement Catering Trades Association says that the Budget changes were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"surprising and in our view both unfair and inequitable."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was written on 26 March. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We made the point in our Budget Submission that many clubs have not put in the third machine to which they were entitled under a recent Deregulation Order, because of the high rate of AMLD on club machines. The Government's response has been to increase duty by 32 per cent. What is the logic underlying this decision?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally this is the delicate matter raised earlier this afternoon the association says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we are not aware of any consultation carried out by Customs and Excise before these significant changes to AMLD were decided and implemented."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Here is a direct question for the Financial Secretary: Why did she not consult the industry about the new bands? If she tells us that consultation was undesirable, or not normal, perhaps I could refer her to her own words in the House on 4 april 1995. In criticising our modest increases, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is a good lesson for the Government to learn from this sorry episode: it is always better to consult and to listen to the industry before drafting legislation." [Official Report, 4 April 1995; Vol. 257, c. 1577.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what she said exactly four years ago. Why has she not consulted on the changes today?
<P>
We have consulted with the industry, and the amendments that I have tabled reflect its wishes. Amendment No. 5 would replace the table in the Finance Bill with a new table, which would limit the increase in club machine duty to 20.5 per cent. It would increase the monthly charges by a straight 20.5 per cent., and reflects the exemptions from licence duty of 5p-stake club machines and 10p-stake amusement-with-prizes machines that are contained in amendments Nos. 6 and 7. It would also reduce the licence duty for 10p-stake club machines.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 would extend the price of play exemption that is currently available on 2p-stake club machines and 5p-stake AWPs to 5p and 10p respectively.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 is a consequential amendment. It would introduce to the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981 a new definition that would reflect the new exemption for 10p-stake machines that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 would introduce.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I rise in support of my hon. Friend's amendment. In considering this issue I am reminded of the four years that I served on the environment committee of Westminster city council during the early 1980s. We had a great deal of difficulty with amusement machines.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Hanson </B>(Delyn): And cemeteries.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman's history is way out of date.
<P>
Indeed, we formed an amusement arcade action group when we discovered that 20 per cent. of those whose addiction had led them to contact Gamblers Anonymous were aged between 12 and 17.
<P>
It is a reflection on the modern Labour party that the plight of child fruit-machine addicts does not worry Treasury Ministers who see instead large pound notes and the opportunity to garner revenue. As far as taxation policy is concerned, the Methodist faction of the Labour party has been overruled by the Mandelson faction. In days gone by, many Labour Members would have opposed an increase in duty on sound ethical grounds. However, ethical grounds seem to be a perilous area for the Government at the moment.
<P>
We must consider the location of gaming machines when deciding whether arcades and other amusement areas can bear the extra duty. My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks mentioned the plight of non-profit making clubs in particular. However, the 1997 Gaming Board report says that only 8 per cent. of gaming machines are located in clubs. The largest proportion, 40 per cent., are located in pubs. Eighteen per cent. are located in inland amusement arcades; 15 per cent. are located in seaside arcades; 15 per cent. are located in bingo clubs; and four per cent. are located in what are termed single sites.
<P>
The machines in question are amusement-with-prizes machines, which is the largest category of machines and will be subjected to an annual charge of £645.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Can the hon. Gentleman clarify amendment No. 5? He just said that the 12-month period involved a charge of £645. He should re-examine his amendment, because in that respect it is exactly the same as the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman was too hasty in rising to his feet. When we come to the stand part debate we can consider whether £645 is a fair increase, but my hon. Friend has made sure that the increases are pro rata over the year and will not be higher for shorter periods. I very much welcome that.
<P>
What is interesting is the contrast between the £645 for the AWPs and the proposed £1,800 for the jackpot machines. Let us look at the change in the number of machines in the country over the past 50 years, over the period since I had an interest in this area. The interesting thing is that in 1983 there were 40,200 jackpot machines. Currently, according to the Gaming Board, there are 42,000. Therefore, there is virtually no change in the number of jackpot machines suffering the much higher rate of duty. However, the number of AWP machines has risen from just under 20,000 in 1983 to the Gaming Board's latest estimate of 220,000 machines nearly a doubling of the number. Therefore, a significantly higher level of duty has a significant impact on the number of machines. What will drive the club's inclination when it puts in the machine is not whether it will get large prizes but whether it will have large standing charges.
<P>
The problem with the proposed rate of duty is that it will impose a much higher standing charge on the clubs and other premises where the machines are located. That may well have the consequence, as suggested in the correspondence that my hon. Friend has received, that the number of machines around the country will fall, so the Government will not even get the extra cash that their greedy mitts are hoping for. Therefore, we must ask ourselves what other experience we have in this regard.
<P>
To go back to the evidence from 1983, in that year the number of jackpot machines fell by 6 per cent. The number of amusement-with-prizes machines fell by a similar amount, when operators switched over to what were then the tuppeny machines, which became free from duty during that financial year. With the Government's proposal there is also the proposal that quiz machines costing 35p or less to play will become exempt from April 1998. Widening the category of machines that are completely exempt from duty, together with the massive increase in the scale of duty imposed on AWPs and jackpot machines, will lead to a significant change in the number of machines to which duty is attached. Therefore, the Government would do well to reconsider.
<P>
The problem is that the Government are not clear what their revenue is from these machines. I did a simple calculation, taking the 40,000 jackpot machines, on which the duty will be £1,800 and the 220,000 AWPs, on which the duty will be £650. I calculated that the duty in a year should be about £210 million. We know that last year, according to the figures given by the Financial Secretary in a written answer on 23 February, the revenue from amusement machines licence duty was £133 million. The increases are expected to yield not another £90 million but an extra £20 million. Will the Financial Secretary tell us whether the figures that she gave in February were incorrect or whether she expects that, as a result of the increased charges, the number of machines to which they apply will fall significantly, as a result of the overall package that she is putting forward?
<P>
It is worth reflecting that, again according to the Gaming Board, the gross revenue from AWPs and jackpot machines in 1993 the last year for which we have figures was around £9 billion, of which £7.2 billion was paid out to players as prizes. Those operators' gross profit was only £1.8 billion, and out of[Mr. St. Aubyn]
that the operators have to pay the cost of running the machines and of changing them when customers tire of one machine, it has to be sent back and replaced with another. That involves significant costs to the operator, who may have bought the machine, or he will face increased rental payments to suppliers, who know all about the fast turnover.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should perhaps mention, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I may have a conflict of interests. I am a lifelong member of the Truro Conservative club, of which I was president for a period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Honorary life member.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Yes, honorary life member. It is a very fine club in the best traditions of non-profit-making clubs. For many years it has benefited from having two jackpot machines on its premises. There is at the back of my mind the thought that such clubs will be particularly hard hit by the proposed changes. Those clubs face high standing charges for such machines, which have to be taken into account when deciding whether to renew a licence and to continue with a machine for another year. The Financial Secretary should clarify that matter.
<P>
What anticipated drop in revenue will there be? I ask that question somewhat nervously, because last year I asked the Financial Secretary what she thought would be the financial effect of the abolition of tax relief from health insurance premiums, and she said that the effect would be nil. Now we know that there was a significant impact, and housing waiting lists have shot up in some areas, including my constituency, as a result. I take her estimates of the effect on gaming revenue from the increases with a pinch of salt. I believe that she has I hope she will not mind my saying so a somewhat naive view of the economics of higher taxation and the effects of the Government's proposals.
<P>
Lastly, why have the Financial Secretary and her colleagues rushed in with such a significant increase in duty when we have not yet assessed the effect of the June 1996 parliamentary order, which provided for the introduction of the all-cash AWP machine. My information again, it is derived from the Gaming Board is that the all-cash machines have proved to be very popular, and they are expected to take over 90 per cent. of the AWP machines around the country. There has not been enough time to assess the impact of that change or of how much additional profit or turnover has been generated for clubs.
<P>
It is extremely rash for the Government to charge ahead with a significant increase in duty. They may well be banking on the fact perhaps the Financial Secretary could enlighten us about this that somehow in the less regulated environment that resulted from the 1996 order, each machine will generate much more profit. The revenue from those machines is subject to gaming duty and VAT and, in the case of most public houses, which are businesses run for profit, any residual profits will be subject to corporation tax. Do the Government understand what they are doing to the industry? Would it not be wise to accept the stiff increase that the Opposition have proposed? We should not go over the top in the way that the Government have suggested.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I should like to speak in support of the amendments. An amendment tabled by my colleagues and me covers much of the same ground, and it would be helpful to integrate the debate. We may decide not to move our amendment because the greater detail of the amendments before us now deals with many of our concerns.
<P>
We want to highlight the specific problem of the clubs. There is a distinction between the club problem and the amusement arcade problem. We heard some statistics about different machines. Non-profit-making clubs are dominated by the jackpot machines the large, 10p-plus machines. The figures that I have been shown suggest that of about 32,000 such machines in the country, more than 31,000 are in non-profit-making clubs. That is where the incidence of the tax increase will be the greatest.
<P>
We need to reflect a little on who owns the non-profit-making clubs. Reference was made to our party political clubs. I am not sure how many Liberal Democrat clubs there are. I fear that the Gladstonian tradition has prevailed and that there are not many of them. We heard about the Truro Conservative club and others. I suspect, knowing a little about the Truro constituency, that it probably has more active members than the Conservatives have voters.
<P>
Such clubs perform an important social and political function, but what has not been mentioned is probably the largest category the British Legion clubs. We all have one in our constituency. They are non-political and, by bringing ex-service men and women together, they preserve an important social function. Many of them also perform an important charitable role in using their surpluses to support families of ex-servicemen and women who are in difficulty. Anything that undermines their viability would be regrettable.
<P>
In pursuing this argument, we should reflect on the motives of Customs and Excise and the Treasury in trying to increase the taxes to such a large extent. We must refer to the deregulation order of two years ago, which attempted to create new opportunities for the gaming industry. We can see the effect of that in our constituencies. Ladbroke and Coral have taken advantage of the opportunities to increase the number of machines in their high-street betting shops. Betting shops are gradually becoming amusement centres. I suspect that to claim a share of the golden egg which Customs and Excise thinks has been laid by that deregulation, it has imposed a swingeing tax on the whole industry, regardless of which sector is affected.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) made some telling points about the trends over time and the way in which they have been affected by the rates of duty. My information is that since the 1996 order, the number of machines in the club sector has fallen, not risen. It is not surprising that clubs have been unable to take advantage of the deregulation opportunities because the rates of duty are already extremely high.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us some provisional figures, which must now be available, about what has happened since the deregulation order. How many machines are there? Can that figure be broken down between the club and commercial sectors, in particular the casinos and bingo houses? The more information we have, the better we will be able to make a rational decision on whether the Government are making a sound move or, I suspect, an imprudent one which will greatly damage the club sector.
<P>
To summarise, although there is an issue of consultation, which has been well made, our primary concern is that a singeing increase in tax is being imposed on a sector of the economy which is non-profit-making and often in difficulty. The consequences of the change were obviously not thought through. Substantial amendment of the excise duties is required to remedy some of the damage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I, too, rise in support of the amendments tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends. I represent not one, but two seaside towns Bognor Regis and Littlehampton both small seaside towns founded in Victorian times. Bognor Regis was founded in the reign of George III, but both places evolved into seaside towns during the Victorian era. They have retained their Victorian charm without becoming gaudy seaside towns like those that we see in some parts of Britain. In addition, they both have the advantage of easy access to the beautiful south downs and to a stretch of unspoilt west Sussex coastline between the two towns.
<P>
Both towns have small and tasteful amusement arcades. [Interruption.] They are not the huge amusement arcades that we see in some large cities. For example, there are small arcades on Bognor Regis pier and small shops on Bognor Regis and Littlehampton seafronts. The machines that they have are not gambling machines, but those that are known as lower stake novelty machines, such as the pusher.
<P>
I am sure that you will remember from your early years, Mrs. Dunwoody, what a pusher is, as I do.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think the hon. Gentleman has a problem with my generation pushers were not widely known.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. In that case, I shall explain to the Committee what a pusher is. It is a machine that has a ledge containing what used to be old pennies. The player would put a coin into the machine in the hope that his or her coin would land between the moving pusher and the layer of coins and push a cascade of pennies into the trough. Since those days, there has been a change in coinage and most pushers today use a 10p coin. If they could use a 5p coin, they would fall outside the scope of tax, but 5p coins are very small and cannot be used. The 2p coin is too valueless to make its use worthwhile, so the 10p coin is used and the machines fall within the amusement machine licence duty provisions.
<P>
There is concern about why the machines are now subject to a 20.5 per cent. increase in the rate of duty. BACTA called it a very substantial increase, which, at seven times the rate of inflation, it is. It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary could explain the reason behind such a swingeing increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Slightly along the coast, we have similar tasteful amusement arcades on Worthing pier and at Lancing in my constituency. Is my hon. Friend aware that amusement arcade operators cannot recoup the cost of the tax by changing the coins to higher value denominations because 20p and 50p pieces are heptagonal, and the principal of pusher machines and the skill in playing them is to put the spin on the 10p or the old penny, as it used to be to get it into the correct position to push over the cascade of coins. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that anyone who comes into Committee with an electronic toy will turn it off. Hon. Members should read the monitors and decide for themselves when they have to do things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) for his intervention. He makes an important point. The machines take 10p pieces and is difficult for them to be adapted to take any other coin. According to BACTA, the consequence will be that machine numbers will drop, capital investment programmes will be cancelled and staff will be made redundant in order to cover the extra costs of the duty, which cannot be passed on to the customer, as they could in any other business. Pushers will suffer disproportionately. The Committee may not be aware that the duty does not apply to the machine as a whole but to every slot in the machine. A typical machine with six slots will carry with it six amounts of annual duty. Therefore, one machine alone will cost an operator an extra £660 a year, an enormous sum of money. That is why, with the very low margins that are recovered on these machines, there will be a drop in the number of machines used, a reduction in the amount of capital invested and a reduction in jobs.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
BACTA was also disappointed, as other Opposition Members have said, that no mention was made of these increases, especially the pro rata increases. It is very much a theme of the Government that the Budget statement is used to announce good news, but all the bad news is left out. But is is the immediate bad news that people need to hear about urgently, rather than the hype and the announcement of measures that do not even appear in the Bill, such as the working families tax credit and the national insurance changes.
<P>
BACTA believes that the provision is unacceptable. The monthly AWP licence fee used to represent 55 per cent. of the total 12 months. It is reasonable for a monthly licence to cost more than one 12th of the annual licence, and to charge 55 per cent. of a 12-month fee for a six-month licence appears to be reasonable, but now the six-month licence represents 62 per cent.

</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> When we were interrupted by the Division I was talking about the injustice of the Government's decision to change the monthly apportionment of the annual fee. It seems an odd decision. It would be helpful to hear from the Financial Secretary when she winds up an explanation of why the measure was changed. If she does not have a good explanation, the Government should accept the amendment in the names of my right hon. and hon. Friends.
<P>
The British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions is deeply concerned about the measure. It says that the increase is £105 for a six-month period, a rise of 35 per cent., which, and this is the damning point, equates to 95 per cent. of the proposed annual rate. It is an odd decision, which discriminates against seaside resorts such as the two that I represent.
<P>
The lack of consultation on this measure has been staggering. In a letter to Customs and Excise, the head of BACTA says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Your own best practice guidance notes talk of the criteria for pre-budget consultation. I cannot see how we failed the tests it contains. Important changes both to the rates and to the way they have been implemented and decided upon warranted pre consultation with BACTA."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not easy to see how early notice of the changes could have led to tax-avoidance planning. The machines are heavy and involve large amounts of capital investment. They are not something that one can whisk across borders or make overnight decisions about. It would have been courteous and consistent with the Government's own guidelines if they had consulted.
<P>
Indeed, the cost of the measure to the industry is about £30 million in extra amusement duty. To put it another way, every employee in the industry will have to earn another £1,200 a year net just to cover the increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is my hon. Friend also aware that there is a disproportionate effect on tourist vacation or amusement parks, such as I have in my constituency and in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which are not open for 12 months of the year? The disproportionate cost of shorter-term licences means that they will be hit for the part of the year when they are open in the tourist season.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, a point also made by the British Resort Association, which represents district councils in seaside resorts in this country, including my own Arun district council. It says that the increases are structured in such a way that they will have a disproportionately severe effect on seaside arcades that operate large numbers of low-stake novelty and entertainment-based amusement-with-prize machines.
<P>
Many of the machines kept in such arcades provide the atmosphere of Victorian and early and mid-20th century seaside towns. They do not make vast sums of money. It will be devastating to many seaside towns, which are already under enormous strains due to severe competition with seaside locations abroad that can guarantee hot weather. With the strength of sterling, British seaside towns are finding it difficult. The British Resort Association goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Arcade owners may be forced to consider abandoning many of the non-viable lower stake novelty machines and take on more adult only AWPs in extended designated adult only areas, thus significantly changing the nature and style of the seaside arcade."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the policy is based on antipathy towards amusement arcades, the measure will not be of help. Instead of a plethora of machines for the amusement of families on wet, rainy days in seaside towns, more high-stake gambling machines will be installed to attract people to arcades for different reasons. It is a great pity that the Government did not enter into a little more consultation before taking the draconian measure of increasing the rates to such an extent.
<P>
The British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions Ltd. states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The viability of operating 10p play AWP machines in our seaside family environment would without doubt be destroyed by the implementation of the proposed 20.5 per cent. increase in AMLD".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not just my view; it is the view of all the representative organisations. The viability of such machines in seaside arcades is under severe threat from this swingeing increase in duty.
<P>
In Littlehampton, there is an attractive leisure park on the edge of the River Arun and the sea. It is owned by Gary Smart, who is a member of the famous Smart circus family. The company's name is Harbour Park Ltd., and it has told me that it may have to shut four or five pusher machines as a result of the measure. Those machines as was mentioned earlier have six slots each, and 6 times £634 means more than £3,800 a year for one machine that deals only with 10p coins. That is not viable, and the Government should think again about the measure and the effect that it is having on the traditional seaside resort in this country. If they are not prepared to think again, perhaps they could adopt the amendment tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to what my hon. Friends have said and, indeed, what the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) said before he had to leave to bury his mobile phone apparently, it cannot be switched off. I would commend to the Committee the amendment tabled by my right hon. and hon. Friends.
<P>
We are not entirely surprised to discover the Government's hostility to these machines, for which swingeing increases are proposed. During the debate in Standing Committee D in 1995, the Financial Secretary said that she perceived a slight snobbery emerging in the Committee in the attitude to gaming machines. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I may be guilty of that as I am not a fan of them." [Official Report, Standing Committee D, 31 January 1995; c. 28.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are perhaps not entirely surprised, therefore, to detect a certain antipathy on the Financial Secretary's part.
<P>
Most of the important points have been made, but I want to raise one or two issues that have not been discussed so far. First, the operators, suppliers and servicers of these machines tend to be small businesses; they are not on the whole large conglomerates. Even where the site is owned by a large organisation, the machines are often supplied by small businesses. The implications of the disproportionate increase in the short-period licence fees are therefore quite significant in cash flow terms. Some operators have used short-term licences to smooth the cash flow implications of paying the licence duty up front. The Committee should take that on board.
<P>
I want also to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the industry as a whole has absorbed costs of approximately £15 million in preparing for the launch of the £2 coin, which, as we now know, was an abortive exercise. The industry incurred those costs in good faith. My hon. Friends referred to the problem of pushers, and the inability of operators of pushers to substitute different coinage of different values. I want to extend that point; it applies to all machines operated by coinage, whose operators are unable to adjust the prices charged to the public to reflect changes in duty. If the duty on a litre of petrol goes up, the price for that litre can be adjusted by 2p, 3p, 3.1p or whatever. However, if the duty rises on an amusement machine licence, the operator has to decide between offering a 10p play or a 20p play.
<P>
Those are discrete steps, and it is difficult for operators to decide on the appropriate action. Invariably, marginal increases in the fixed overhead costs involved in operating the machines have to be absorbed through a reduction in the take over a period of years. Eventually, the industry has to take the bull by the horns and make the leap to the next size of coin or the next multiple unit of play.
<P>
My third point has not been aired before. The British Amusement Catering Trades Association has commissioned the Henley centre for forecasting to run the amendments through its economic model to discern their impact on Government revenues. Taking into account the effects of VAT and corporation tax, the Henley centre forecast that the effects of the amendments would be almost negligible. In either case with or without the amendments the projected revenue was estimated at about £140 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the House of Commons Library assessed the cost of amendment No. 5 at £5 million? How would he fill that hole in public finances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is an interesting question. I have not seen the Library's assessment, but I will. I wonder whether it takes account of VAT and corporation tax effects. The Henley model is quite complex and takes account of effects across the whole of the economy on employment, and so on and not just the direct impact of amusement machine licensing duty.
<P>
I know that the Financial Secretary is not a great lover of amusement machines, and not a great player of them. She told the Committee in 1995 that she had had a sheltered upbringing and was very reserved about the games in which she consented to take part. I am sure that that will reassure all hon. Members. However, at the same time the hon. Lady asked a series of perceptive questions about the research that had been done into the impact of changes proposed in that year's Budget to amusement machine licence duty.
<P>
In 1995 the Financial Secretary wanted to find out how it had been calculated that the machines could tolerate the proposed levels of taxation, and what assessments had been made of the total annual take by the machines. She also asked what samples had been taken, and what market research there had been to discover how much a machine took in a year, and thus what a reasonable level of taxation would be.
<P>
I could not have framed those questions better. I hope that the Financial Secretary, who is now on the Government side of the Committee Room, will be able to give us some answers in relation to the proposals before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I support the amendments, but it is a matter for lingering regret that there are no pushers in my constituency nor any amusement arcades, tasteful or otherwise. However, there are social clubs. They do not exist to make a profit, but British Legion and Conservative clubs thrive in Conservative constituencies. They will undoubtedly be badly hit. Conservative Members are surprised to have heard no contributions of any kind from Labour Members about their British Legion clubs in their constituencies or about their new Labour clubs as they are now probably titled. What effect will the measures in the clause have on their constituents? I hope that not only the right hon. Lady but some of her hon. Friends will give us a contribution on that point before the debate is over.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are talking about a point of social interest. The clubs to which Conservative Members have referred the British Legion, Conservative clubs and similar social clubs are part of the rich fabric of many communities and not necessarily those in seaside communities. [Interruption.] Hon. Members might laugh. If they think that the British Legion is an association that deserves mockery, I would be happy to take an intervention.
<P>
The fact remains that Labour Members have made no serious attempt to respond to the points that Conservative Members have made about the grievous impact of the measures on such non-profit-making clubs. I hope that the Financial Secretary will address that deficiency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does not the response to my hon. Friend's comments about the importance of British Legion clubs as part of the community reveal that Labour Members do not understand what community is even though they talk ad nauseam about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a typically lucid and astute political point. The clause will result in an increased cost for amusement-with-prizes machines and jackpot machines that cost less than 5p per play. The increase will be 20.5 per cent. In respect of jackpot machines that cost more than 5p per play, the increase will be 32 per cent.
<P>
The jackpot machine is very much the staple profit-generator for many of the social clubs to which I have alluded. Those clubs will be disproportionately hit. According to figures from the British Amusement[Mr. Ruffley]
Catering Trades Association, so-called jackpot club machines number 31,100. The number in casinos is in the region of 700; in bingo halls it is in the region of 200. Those figures clearly show that the changes will hit social clubs proportionately harder than casino and bingo halls.
<P>
There is a further distinction between the bingo halls and casinos and the social clubs with the club machines the casinos and bingo halls are profit-making organisations. Conservative Members who have considered the issue in detail will understand the real annoyance and frustration on the part of social clubs that are not-for-profit organisations about the way in whcih they have been discriminated against and about the fact that the casinos and bingo halls, which have a relatively small number of the machines that we are discussing, will not suffer in the same way.
<P>
The social clubs rely to a large extent on their income to survive. Many of them, including one in my constituency, operate on small margins. They reject the reasons that Ministers and officials adduced for the increase after the Budget. The reason adduced was that a 1996 deregulation order would enable such clubs to increase the numbr of machines to three and enable bingo halls and casinos to increase the number of machines to four and six.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7, not amendment No. 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful for that, Mrs. Dunwoody. I intended to draw attention to the impact of clause 12 on one particular type of gaming machine, the club jackpot machine. I stand corrected but will, if I may, proceed down the same path for just one or two seconds longer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The point that I was making, so as to help the hon. Gentleman, was that the Committee is not discussing amendment No. 2, which has not yet been moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall now move on to an important point, already touched on by other Conservative Members, regarding the arithmetic in which the Treasury has been engaged so as to decide at what level to pitch the rates that are covered by amendment No. 5.
<P>
Labour Members have not yet presented any evidence to us about the number of machines that have been granted licences since 1996. We do not know whether deregulation has led to a growth in the number of club machines, or whether it has enabled clubs to increase their profitability. Did the Financial Secretary to the Treasury or her officials receive any evidence regarding the cashbox taxes of such clubs over the past year before deciding to pitch the rates at the levels that are set out in the clause? Furthermore, have more sites been licensed following the deregulation order? If we are to arrive at an understanding of the levels at which the rates have been set, we shall need some evidence from the hon. Lady about the number of licences that have been granted and whether they are declining in number. Have some licences been revoked, or lapsed and not been renewed? If we had those figures, we could form sensible conclusions about the effects on these important, non-profit-making organisations in the clubs. That issue relates very much to the amendments that we are discussing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the subject of arithmetic on other machines, will he look at his amendment No. 5 again? He appears to be trying, in contrast to the Government's proposals, disproportionately to benefit those who require a licence for 11 months, who would get a £165 differential. Those who require a 10-month licence would get a £145 differential and those who require a 12-month licence would get a £155 differential. That would be a curious spread in terms of duty implementation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I see no problem in the way that the amendment has been drafted. I am unsure as to the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make.
<P>
On the question of arithmetic, I should like to take up the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in his references to the Henley study. That gave rise to some swapping of statistics with the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), who quoted House of Commons Library figures. I should like to see the Treasury figures in respect of two particular items. What calculations has the hon. Lady made about the loss of VAT revenue to the Exchequer that will result from the swingeing increases, which get up to one third 32 per cent. as set out in the clause? I fail to understand how the numbers have been derived without a better understanding of what the impact on the VAT take of the Treasury will be.
<P>
My second question, which I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would specifically answer, was touched upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. It relates to the Bill's impact on small business. In the Standing Committee which considered the 1995 Finance Bill, the Financial Secretary drew attention to the potential plight of small business men and women involved in industry servicing or maintenance. My hon. Friend made a similar point.
<P>
The impact on small business will be considerable. In 1995, the Financial Secretary asked how many jobs would be lost and what impact that loss would have on the social security budget. That question was sensible then, and it is sensible now. I should be grateful if she would turn her mind to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I intend to make only a brief contribution. My hon. Friends have already spoken eloquently on behalf of a number of organisations that the clause will affect. I support the amendments strongly, and I shall say a brief word about another group of organisations and businesses that will be hit very badly if the Government's proposed licence duty increase goes ahead. That group is the licensed trade. There are about 190,000 machines throughout the licensed trade. They represent a significant part of turnover. Many pubs have as many as three machines. I am told that such machines can contribute up to 30 per cent. of those pubs' net profit.
<P>
Public houses are already under considerable pressure. My hon. Friends have spoken about various organisations in their constituencies that are affected. My constituency is rural. It consists of a lot of scattered villages, in which pubs are often a focal point and a central part of village community. Without those pubs, such communities may well die. Rural pubs are already under threat because of Government proposals  especially the proposed change to the legal drink-driving limit. That change will have a very severe impact.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the amendments are very specific, and relate in one case to a table and in another to a specific tax. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I shall, of course, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I was speaking about one way in which rural pubs are under threat. The licence duty increase will also dramatically increase pressure on rural pubs. The clause is yet another aspect of the Government's relentless attack on the countryside. I hope that the Minister will think seriously about that before proceeding with the increases.
<P>
As I said, I do not wish to add to what my hon. Friends have said. I shall leave the Minister with one quotation. I suspect that she is unlikely to be persuaded, despite the power of the Opposition's arguments. I should like to quote Mr. Jerry Russell, the treasurer of the Acre Gate lane Labour club in Preston, to whom I hope that she might pay a little more attention. Mr. Russell says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The beer money's not enough. If we didn't have the money from machines, we couldn't do all this and it helps us keep the beer at £1 a pint instead of £2. Without the machines, 99 per cent. of the clubs would go to the wall within a year, I reckon."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reflect on that before she comes to a conclusion on the amendment.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is always amusing to hear one's quotes thrown back, particularly when they are out of context. They add to the flavour and sharpness of our debate.
<P>
I remember well the debate in 1995 I remember the right hon. Member for Wells describing his youth as being misspent on the pinball and pool machines and in amusement arcades. Many hon. Members told similar tales. That was not my experience, but I thought that I should ensure that I knew what I had said in 1995, just in case it was quoted back to me. The same points were made today by the current Opposition. I have no complaints about that that is what opposition is about.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I referred in 1995 to advice from leading accountants and said that there would be a terrible effect on the industry a point that has been echoed today as a result of the then Government's proposals for changing the structure of this tax. Indeed, Pannell Kerr Forster estimated that 3,000 jobs and almost £50 million would be lost as a result of the previous Government's policy to increase duty. Naturally, as I said that, I thought that I had better check what actually happened. I suspected that the same argument might be used again today by the current Opposition against the current Government. In fact, my comments did not bear fruit. [Hon. Members: "You were wrong".] I was indeed wrong. I caution Opposition Members on that. When one is in opposition, one makes arguments; when one is in government, one is able then to check their accuracy.
<P>
The fact is that revenues from amusement machines at this range of duty rates over the past three calendar years have consistently increased, from £113 million to £130 million to £133 million. That is not the Armageddon that professionals advised the then Opposition would happen. I caution current Opposition Members against making the same argument.
<P>
Several proposals were made about bands and the possible emergence of £15 machines, which did not subsequently happen. That was on the basis of many of the comments that I made, which hon. Members quoted back. Then there was the relief sought for skill-with-prizes machines, which the Government have given under clause 13.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) asked for information about the number of licences issued. I refer him to a parliamentary answer given on 11 May 1998, but I note that receipts show a steady increase in the number of licences being issued. I am happy to read those figures into the record if the hon. Gentleman wants me to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Does that parliamentary answer refer specifically to jackpot prize machines in clubs? That is what I asked about. Can the Minister disaggregate those numbers?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The question asked for details on club machines and, separately, amusement-with-prizes machines, and for an estimate of how much would be raised in each category as a result of the Budget announcement. Far from showing a decline in revenue and in the number of machines, the figures illustrate that the reverse is happening.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also made a point about VAT. As he will probably know from his period as an adviser in the Treasury, the duty rates take account of the likely impact on VAT. Clearly, when introducing a change the Government would not seek to undermine the revenue that we were bringing in.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford wanted to know about forecast yields, how we based the projections of the yields, and the likely impact of the Budget. Again, Opposition Members will know that Customs and Excise use an economic model that takes account of published industry data on the number and type of machines and historic duty receipts. We stand by our estimates that the likely impact would be an increase in revenue.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford also asked about the problem of young people gambling. The Government have not increased amusement machine licences, but we have increased gaming machine licences. In doing that, we took note of the relevant Oflot report. The hon. Gentleman compared figures from the Gaming Board for Great Britain with those that we are getting from the industry. His figures also confirm that there is an increase in both AWPs and club jackpot machines. The[Dawn Primarolo]
figures from BACTA for 1995 were that there were 110,800 AWPs. The hon. Gentleman quoted a figure of 220,000. I will not go on to the figures for club jackpot machines, but there is an increase there, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Can the Minister tell us how many clubs have taken advantage of the opportunity since deregulation to instal a third machine? I believe that the benefits of deregulation and the opportunities that it represented were a significant part of the reasoning of Customs and Excise in seeking to raise the duty level.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The licencing regime works on the basis not of the club but of the machine. I do not have the specific information on the increase and locations, but there has been an increase in the number of licences and in revenue coming to the Government.
<P>
As I explained, we base our calculations on information from the industry and from our records, which use the Treasury model to calculate the likely impact on the industry and its ability to sustain and increase revenue. This is the first increase since 1994. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said that that came as a total surprise to BACTA. The Budget notice that was available when the Chancellor sat down on Budget day contained all the new rates. In addition, at the time of the Budget announcement BACTA was sent full details in an explanatory note outlining the changes. Included in the information pack was a table detailing the new part-year licences. As hon. Members will know, the industry can now buy part-year licences. The calculation of the cost of those licences also reflects the administration charge for the Exchequer and the cash flow issues.
<P>
I shall turn briefly to amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7, and to why I shall ask the Committee to reject them. Amendment No. 5 would introduce four changes to Budget measures in this category. It seeks to reduce the increase for all club jackpot machines in the highest duty band, and to extend the existing exemption from 2p to 5p per play. It would extend the current exemption for amusement with prize machines from 5p to 10p. It would reduce the increase in short-term periodic licences.
<P>
I should point out that Budget changes to amusement machine licences were carefully constructed to take account as far as possible of the profitability of specific types of machines and of their ability to bear the extra burden. Broadly speaking, the most profitable machines are club jackpot machines that fall into the highest duty bands.
<P>
Most significantly, no increase was made to the lowest duty band, which encompasses most of the least profitable machines. That policy specifically recognises the concerns expressed with regard to the arcade sector, as more than 30 per cent. of machines fall in this sector and in this band.
<P>
The Budget changes that I have outlined are based on information provided by the industry about the numbers, distribution and profitability of various machines. The Committee will debate those changes further in a clause stand part debate. They also take account of the significant deregulation that has occurred. The changes reflect the machines' ability to pay the extra tax. All the Government's information clearly demonstrates that it can be afforded.
<P>
As I said with regard to the specific issue of duty and periodic licences, the duty structure reflects front-end costs to the Exchequer, both of administering short-term licences and of the additional burden imposed when traders use the facility as a means of supporting their cash flow. I am not decrying that, but it should be recognised that the Treasury needs to be compensated.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> If I have understood the Financial Secretary correctly, she just said that the proposed duty increases were assessed by the Treasury as being affordable by the operators. What methodology did the Treasury use for assessing the viability of members clubs that the duty increases will hit, given that we know that two members clubs are closing every week? That rate is bound to accelerate because of the duty increases.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting for a moment that the use of such machines is the only factor likely to impact on whether those clubs close. I say to him again that the Government made an assessment of the machines, based on information from the industry about their current profitability and about whether it could be sustained. Opposition Members have not suggested that the industry cannot afford the increase. The industry does not want to pay it simply because it would rather pay the lower rates.
<P>
I shall turn to questions about the industry's representations. There is continuing discussion with officials regarding the duty rates. However, notwithstanding those discussions, the Treasury used its own information in arriving at its decision to recommend the increase in these rates.
<P>
Amendment No. 6 would extend the exemption for the traditional AWPs, which are used in family amusement centres and seaside arcades, but the Committee needs to know two things. First, in making the changes to amusement machine licence duty, the Government thought carefully about the impact of the duty increase on different types of machine, and based conclusions on information from the industry that is not disputed. We ensured that the genuine amusement machines in the lowest duty band suffered no increase, and that duty would rise only on machines in the middle and upper bands. We accept that some AWPs in the middle band are primarily for amusement rather than gambling, but there is no evidence that those machines are uneconomic at present.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Government are mindful of the recent Oflot report highlighting concerns about young people gambling. We have a clear responsibility not to encourage such gambling and the tax system is one way in which we can deter it.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 would provide a new definition for the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981 to extend the exemption for amusement with prizes machines. The changes proposed in the Bill are constructed to reflect as far as possible the existing duty structure and the ability of different types of machine to bear the increase.
<P>
The question of consultation was raised. I repeat that the Chancellor does not normally consult on Budget changes to tax rates, for a variety of reasons familiar to hon. Members. As the code of practice on consultation published in December 1997 makes clear, that is especially true of measures that may carry a significant risk to the Revenue.
<P>
I understand that the industry would prefer not to pay more tax, but the Government's assessment is that the middle and upper range of machines can bear the duty that is being levied. I ask the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I sense that the Committee wants to come to a conclusion on this matter. We have had a very one-sided debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> No, I am not giving way. The hon. Gentleman has had plenty of time to contribute to the debate.
<P>
Conservative Members have given the Committee a glimpse of the real world of sea fronts and leisure parks, of non-profit making social clubs, Royal British Legion clubs, Conservative clubs and even of Labour clubs. It is to the shame of the Government that the case for a Labour club had to be made by my hon. Friendthe Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford(Mr. Whittingdale).
