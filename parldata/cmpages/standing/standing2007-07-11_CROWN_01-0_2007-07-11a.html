							<b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Dismore</b> (Hendon) (Lab): Good morning,
Mrs. Humble. I welcome you to the Chair. This is the first
time that I have served in Committee under your chairmanship, and I am
sure that it will be a good
experience.</div>
					<a name="07071192000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
wishing to repeat my remarks on Second Reading and on many occasions in
the House, clause 1 is the meat of the Bill. Its purpose is to open up
employment under the Crown to all nationalities outside the existing
restrictions, while empowering Ministers to introduce restrictions to
reserve certain numbers of jobs for United Kingdom
nationals&#151;about 5 per cent. of the overall
total.</div>
					<a name="07071192000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071192000290"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Christopher Chope</b> (Christchurch) (Con): What will happen
if the Bill passes through Committee today? It will obviously be
discussed on Report, but how will it get on to the statute book during
this Session, particularly bearing in mind the constraints in the other
place?</div>
					<a name="07071192000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000291"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> If we complete the
Bill&#146;s Committee stage this morning, we shall have a good slot
on 19 October&#151;all being well. Those in the other place try to
act expeditiously in respect of Bills that start here, so we will have
a reasonable shot at it, depending on the views that are expressed
today and on Report.</div>
					<a name="07071192000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
couple of years ago, the Bill managed to reach discussion on Report, so
we shall wait to see how we get on now. Obviously, a lot depends on the
view of the Opposition. I understand that they support it, as do the
Liberal Democrats. However, no doubt we shall hear from them in due
course.</div>
					<a name="07071192000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071192000292"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Knight</b> (East Yorkshire) (Con): Does the hon.
Gentleman have hard case evidence that the existing law is causing
problems?</div>
					<a name="07071192000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000293"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> As the right hon. Gentleman
knows, this is not my first attempt with the Bill. I have received
e-mails from people throughout the country explaining how the law
affects them. In particular, I recall someone who e-mailed me from
Portsmouth or Southampton because they were concerned about the
position of their spouse. I think that the right hon. Gentleman was
present at the debate on Second Reading, so he will remember our
discussing the anomalous position of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>spouse. We debated circumstances in which the spouse of an European
economic area national could be employed, but the spouse of a British
national could not, if the spouse in each case was not
qualified.</div>
					<a name="07071192000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071192000294"></a>
							<b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): I
assure my hon. Friend that I have had cases in my constituency of
spouses and children of people with joint American citizenship. In one
case, a young man was turned away from the new deal programme. He was
turned away from working on the front desk of the Employment Service,
because he did not fulfil the
criteria.</div>
					<a name="07071192000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000295"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> My hon. Friend has made an important point. A
Canadian citizen can be employed, but an American citizen cannot,
because one is from a Commonwealth country while the other is not. I
outlined a bizarre scenario on Second Reading concerning a terrorist
suspect with United Kingdom nationality. For example, Abu Hamza is now
in prison, but theoretically he is entitled to apply for any job in the
civil service, but the widow of a 9/11 victim would not be allowed to
do so, if she were an American national, which cannot be
right.</div>
					<a name="07071192000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071192000296"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): The hon. Gentleman has
moved on to a slightly worrying subject. The country is currently
concerned about terrorist cells infiltrating organisations, as has
recently happened in the NHS. Is now therefore a time to be more
careful rather than more liberal on such
issues?</div>
					<a name="07071192000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000297"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> My Bill will, in fact, achieve
that objective. At the moment, we have a range of anomalies that
introduces some unjustified restrictions without imposing others that
might be justified. We must ensure that people who work in the UK are
entitled properly to do so through the work permit system, the new
points-based system or whatever. The Bill will not affect immigration
or asylum law. People who want to work in the UK, whether for a
commercial operation or the civil service, must have the appropriate
certificates.</div>
					<a name="07071192000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue is the checks to establish whether a person is whom they purport
to be and whether they have the right qualifications or security
clearance. The Bill would not affect the security clearance
arrangements for existing posts, but it would enable a Minister to say
that a particular job is so important that it must be reserved for a UK
national. As I mentioned on Second Reading, about 5 per cent. of the
total are jobs in defence, the Foreign Office and security. Originally,
when we started the campaign several years ago, it was thought that
such jobs made up 10 per cent. of the total but, following detailed
consideration, the number has been whittled down to 5 per cent.,
particularly because jobs in Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
do not now need to be
excluded.</div>
					<a name="07071192000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
particular shortage in Northern Ireland because some 25 per cent. of
the population were effectively excluded because they had Irish rather
than UK nationality. That was resolved earlier this year by order as
part of the St. Andrews agreement. There has been some movement, but
the basic principles still apply, and they create a capacity for huge
anomalies, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>which the Bill could resolve relatively easily. The Bill would ensure
that we end up with a civil service that reflects the society that it
serves, which is particularly important in London, while providing the
necessary protection for sensitive
jobs.</div>
					<a name="07071192000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071192000298"></a>
							<b class="B">Philip
Davies</b> (Shipley) (Con): May I return to the point raised
by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire? Is the hon.
Member for Hendon saying that there is a shortage of applicants for
positions in the civil service, because I am not aware of any such
situation in West Yorkshire? Alternatively, is he saying that the
calibre of applicants is so low that widening the pool is necessary? Is
the Bill a solution in search of a
problem?</div>
					<a name="07071192000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000299"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> No. I cannot comment on the position in
Yorkshire, but in London, the civil service has a recruitment problem
because, regrettably, the pay is not competitive in the London market.
The figures show that 7 per cent. of the working-age population are
entirely excluded from applying for jobs in the civil service, which
amounts to some 330,000 people. That means that we end up with a civil
service that does not recruit from the best talent and that has
difficulty in recruiting.</div>
					<a name="07071192000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important in London for
the civil service to reflect the communities that it serves, as the
police have found. It makes sense, for example, for a social security
office in the east end to employ some staff who can speak the minority
languages that their customers are likely to speak&#151;apart from
anything else, that makes such offices more
efficient.</div>
					<a name="07071192000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000300"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> Is not the answer to move many of the civil
service posts out of overcrowded, overpaid London and into the
beautiful areas of, for example, East Yorkshire or West
Yorkshire?</div>
					<a name="07071192000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000301"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> The right hon. Gentleman has made a fair point. A
large number of civil service jobs have been moved, but their offices
must still service the population of London. We must ensure that the
diversity of London is reflected in those offices. Some of the offices
that have been moved out do not relate to the circumstances of their
London customers and do not understand London, the languages spoken by
Londoners and the cultures in London. Social security matters, such as
pensions, are now administered in Glasgow, and it may be difficult for
people there to relate to others who speak with, for example, a strong
Yorkshire accent. I have been in London for more than 30 years, and my
Yorkshire accent has lost some of its edge. I imagine that some would
find it difficult to understand civil servants with a broad Glaswegian
or West Yorkshire
accent.</div>
					<a name="07071192000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000302"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Does my hon. Friend
recognise that there are areas, such as wards in my constituency, in
which 83 per cent. of children live in workless households? We
have a serious problem of concentrated unemployment in London. In fact,
we have more unemployed than in the whole of Scotland and Wales put
together. However, there is a mismatch between our unemployed and the
jobs available. It is clearly ludicrous that the very people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>who are unemployed and who would provide a high quality service to their
own communities are excluded from front-line jobs, such as working on
the front desk of a jobcentre or the Employment
Service.</div>
					<a name="07071192000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000303"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>My hon. Friend has made her point very
well. If we look at unemployment levels, we see that six out of the 10
areas with the highest levels of children living in poverty are in
London. People think that the streets are paved with gold in London.
When hon. Members come to London, all they see are the environs of
Westminster, the airports and the railway stations. They do not see
what a lot of us see in our constituencies, which is deprivation and
poverty, and they do not experience the huge, amorphous size of London
with its different communities. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that
there are high levels of unemployment in some areas of my constituency,
which are masked by those who are in work. If one looks at some of the
east end wards, one sees high levels of
unemployment.</div>
					<a name="07071192000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000304"></a>Mr.
Chope:
						</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s desire for the civil
service to reflect society as a whole, we know that society, sadly,
incorporates jihadists, terrorists, drug dealers and so on. Why does
the hon. Gentleman think it desirable that they should be
proportionately represented in the civil service, which is what his
Bill would
achieve?</div>
					<a name="07071192000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000305"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> That is a silly comment. If people from minority
communities, from which some of those jihadists come, were able to get
jobs that they are not now able to get, particularly in our orbit of
Government, they would feel more included in our society and there
would be far less incentive for them to get involved in some of those
activities. I think the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point works entirely in
the opposite
direction.</div>
					<a name="07071192000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000306"></a>Mr.
Bone:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>What is the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view on
Government policy? There seems to be a contradiction. I thought that
the Government wanted people who come to this country&#151;immigrants
and migrants&#151;to learn English. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposal is that there must be people who speak other languages in
social security offices. That seems to be a
contradiction.</div>
					<a name="07071192000247"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000307"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I do not think that there is any
contradiction at all. The fact remains that we deal with society as it
is as well as how we would like it to be. It is of great benefit if
people who come to the United Kingdom learn English, but many do not do
so. For example, my constituency contains the second biggest Chinese
community in Britain, and there is no prospect of Chinese elders
learning English. They feel excluded, and they find it very difficult
to interface with organs of the state. If we had civil servants who
came from Hong Kong or China, for example, they would be able to relate
to Chinese elders in Cantonese or Mandarin. That is being realistic
about the society in which we live. We can have an aspiration about
everyone knowing the language, but we have to service society as it
stands.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000308"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> Will my hon. Friend confirm that language is a very
small part of the issue of representation? While it is significant, it
is generally important in the delivery of public services from policing
through to front-line employment and Government service that there are
role models, mentors and representatives of our diverse society. Will
he put on record that it is absolutely outrageous to imply that any
action that improves the representation of minority communities in our
services is in some way giving an opportunity to the tiny minority of
people who are involved in terrorist and criminal activities and that
it is effectively besmirching those minority communities to do
so?</div>

							<a name="07071192000309"></a>Mr.

					<a name="07071192000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Hendon has said, clause 1 goes to the heart of the Bill. I
had an open mind about the Bill, but in the light of recent events and
the entryism that we have seen by enemies of our state into, for
example, the national health service, we should be on high alert
against relaxing the
controls.</div>

						<a name="07071192000311"></a>
							<b class="B">Norman
Baker</b> (Lewes) (LD): I understand the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s direction of travel, but the logic of his
position is surely that there ought to be tighter controls on, for
example, Commonwealth countries? There is no suggestion that
Commonwealth countries necessarily produce people who are less inclined
to those particular activities than non-Commonwealth
countries.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000312"></a>Mr.

						</b> There are all sorts of problems with the existing
level of controls, and the hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing for
tighter controls. If he wishes to table amendments to suggest that we
should have tighter controls, I might support them on
Report.</div>
					<a name="07071192000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
thought that relaxing the controls is a move in the wrong direction,
unless and until we establish proper border security systems in this
country and know who is coming in and who is leaving. In the trial that
finished earlier this week, which went on for the best part of six
months, it was only in the last few days that the true identity of one
of the defendants was
discovered.</div>

						</b> I think the point that the hon. Member for Hendon
was making was that if people felt more involved in our society and had
access to jobs, they would not feel the need to commit terrorist
offences. Does my hon. Friend agree that a number of people involved in
the recent attempted atrocities were doctors, who were heavily involved
in the local community and who had been given access to jobs within the
public sector? Given that, does he agree that there is no evidence that
the Bill will do what the hon. Member for Hendon has

absolutely. It is a sad fact, but we have to accept it, that we are at
war. We are at war with the jihadists&#151;we are at war with the
enemies of our country, our way of living and our society. During the
second world war, we put restrictions on people of foreign nationality
whom we thought were potential enemies of the state. We did that for
state security reasons. I am not suggesting that we should do that in
the present circumstances, but I suggest that the existing rules
relating to Crown employment and nationality should not be relaxed at
this time. We know that there is a group&#151;a small one,
admittedly&#151;of determined people who are keen to undermine our
society and destroy lots of innocent
lives.</div>
					<a name="07071192000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should not
treat the Bill with the levity displayed by the hon. Member for Hendon.
As a good lawyer, he has been driven to draw up the Bill on the basis
that there are a lot of interesting anomalies. We could have a
jurisprudential discussion about whether the existing law is integrally
consistent and whether it should be amended. His fascination with the
minutiae and inconsistencies in the existing legislation had led
him to propose a radical Bill, which would completely undermine
the security of this country.</div>

make the people who work there redundant. Leaving that on one side, the
responsibility for contracts relating to air-side security is that of
the contractors and the British Airports Authority, which must make
their own checks and take responsibility for them. There is cause for
concern about entryism by enemies of the state into those sorts of
jobs, but my point is that we should not make it any

in favour of Nigerian Airway&#146;s more senior employee, which was
the sole ground on which he delivered his judgment. That is a bit of an
aside, and I do not have a similar story from my experience in the

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>
					<a name="07071192000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also concerned that the
hon. Member for Hendon, who promoted the Bill, was not singing in tune
with the new leadership of his party when he said that we need greater
use of minority languages in places such as jobcentres and health
centres. I thought that the new Prime Minister was absolutely insistent
on the idea that those who come to this country from overseas and do
not speak the English language should be encouraged to do so, and that
one way of doing that was to ensure that access to services,
particularly benefits advice, should not be provided in 100 different
languages, but in the primary language,
English.</div>
					<a name="07071192000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the hon. Member for Hendon spoke in support of clause 1, I understood
him to say that he thought that we should bring more employees who
speak minority languages into the civil service, which would achieve
the reverse effect of the new Prime Minister&#146;s
objective.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000327"></a>Ms

a masters degree in English from one of our top universities and still
be completely incapable of understanding the benefits system?</div>
					<a name="07071192000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely the
issue is that there is a proportion of people, particularly elders, for
whom it will remain difficult to achieve the level of English necessary
to negotiate oneself through the benefits system. That is not affected
by the fact that the overwhelming majority of migrants entering the
country speak English or are learning English.</div>
					<a name="07071192000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue,
however, is not only about the English language, and to harp on about
minority languages is to pursue a red herring, if that is the right
analogy. Surely we want a broad representation of people from different
communities in our public services, who can occasionally provide
language support and who are also culturally understanding and
sympathetic to the wide range of experiences of our communities, which
is important for the quality of services and those communities. That
will help us because we face a particular challenge with regard to
recruitment and retention in front-line services in many of our cities.
People who have lived in this country for many years and have leave to
remain are barred from applying for those
jobs.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000329"></a>Mr.
Chope:
						</b> I do not disagree with all that
the hon. Lady has said. At the moment, however, people who have
culturally different backgrounds or different languages can become UK
nationals, once they have spent the required time in the country.
Having become UK nationals, it is open to them to join the civil
service and take up the role that she has commended. In recent years,
the number of people who have come from overseas with what we would
describe as minority languages and who have become UK nationals has
increased enormously. There is, therefore, a much larger pool of people
who have those qualifications, as the hon. Lady would describe them,
and who are now UK nationals and can be recruited to the civil service,
should that be the wish of employers. The Bill is, in a sense, made
less relevant by that large increase in the number of people who have
settled in this country and gained UK nationality. In staying here for
five or more years to achieve that objective, they have indicated that
their desire to use the UK as their primary place of residence is
probably genuine and that this country is the focus of their
loyalty.</div>

					<a name="07071192000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
disagree with the hon. Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington,
North. However, the solution is to be found not in relaxing the laws,
but in ensuring that people who have become UK nationals can provide
the sort of services to which she referred. I take her point that many
elderly people in the Asian community find it difficult to communicate
and that they rely on their families and friends to do so for them. I
am not sure that the availability of multilingual personnel in
jobcentres and benefit offices, for example, will necessarily be a
solution because the Government policy seems to be closing down what
one might describe as the face-to-face interview part of the civil
service.</div>
					<a name="07071192000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
constituency it is proposed that the jobcentre and more post offices
will close. Those are the sort of places where people can go and have a
face-to-face interview with somebody, either in English or an
alternative language. Such opportunities are reducing as a result of
Government policy and people are expected to go online or contact
remote call centres. It is then much more difficult for such people to
be understood and for them to understand what is going
on.</div>
					<a name="07071192000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that my
right hon. Friend the leader of the Conservative party will adopt a
policy to help the more vulnerable people in society by ensuring that
we keep such offices open. People who do not find it easy to articulate
themselves on the telephone or on the internet should be able to have
face-to-face interviews to discuss their problems that they have with
representatives of the civil service. That is the way that we should be
going, but the Government are closing down the offices where people can
meet bureaucrats with faces rather than deal with faceless
bureaucrats.</div>

Members.</div>
					<a name="07071192000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last
point in my jottings is that the Bill does not deal with immigration or
work permits. That point was made by the hon. Member for Hendon and is
set out in the summary of the explanatory notes. Although the Bill does
not deal with them, we know that there are real problems with
immigration and work permits. We need to take that into account in
considering whether the law should be relaxed in the way that he
suggests.</div>
					<a name="07071192000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I had
confidence that our immigration and work permit systems would remove
potential enemies of the state under their systems of vetting, I would
have a lot more confidence in the Bill. However, one reads articles in
newspapers every day that lead one to have greater concern that our
borders are porous, that people are coming and going without any
control over them, and that there is an enormous amount of identity
fraud and identity theft. There are no checks on those who have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>work permit and the system is being abused. In those circumstances, I
think that it would be reckless to relax further the rules relating to
Crown employment. That is why I am very concerned about the
clause.</div>
					<a name="07071192000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea that
we might tighten up the rules, which was raised by the hon. Member for
Lewes, is an interesting one. If he catches your eye, Mrs.

improve the Bill on

							<a name="07071192000333"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Humble,
and congratulate the hon. Member for Hendon on getting his Bill this
far. It is rare for a presentation Bill to make such progress. The last
one to do so was the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, with
which he is associated as the bovver boy for the Labour Whips, a role
that he performs assiduously, if somewhat transparently on
occasion.</div>
					<a name="07071192000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
leave aside my consideration of that and focus on the logic of this
Bill. The current rules are inconsistent and, to use the word used by
Labour Members, illogical. From the point of view of logicality, there
are two directions of travel: the direction of the Bill is towards
loosening the rules and applying the controls only of the normal
immigration process and the vetting process that rightly applies to
certain jobs; the other direction is towards a rather insular, second
world war approach, which is to say that we are so frightened of
society at large that we can trust only British nationals.</div>
					<a name="07071192000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no logic in saying
that someone from a Commonwealth country is any less of a risk than
someone from a non-Commonwealth country. With due respect to the
Commonwealth, that is not a proposition that can be sustained in any
logical argument. We are faced with a choice between moving to the more
liberal regime proposed in the Bill, or battening down the hatches,
shutting the doors and relating such jobs only to British nationals, so
far as we can.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000335"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I have not taken any view yet. I shall come on to
say which view I take. Sadly, as we know from terrorist problems that
have occurred in this country, many of those problems are related to UK
nationals who were born here. We need to examine the reasons for that
as a society. Even the batten-down-the-hatches, world war two approach,
which some advocate, would not prevent those nationals from securing
jobs in sensitive areas because of their nationality, although security
checks and vetting processes are quite properly carried out. For those
who are rightly concerned about security, as I am, the issue is to
ensure that the vetting process and the security clearance are
appropriate for each individual. That relates not to nationality, but
to whether the individual is trustworthy in a particular position. I
would like the Government to do more on that, rather than worry about
whether someone comes from a Commonwealth
country.</div>

Gentleman&#146;s point about having a secure vetting process. Does he
accept that, for quite a lot of aliens from non-Commonwealth countries,
basic things such as birth certificates do not
exist?</div>

						</b> I was not aware that, these days, there are many
societies where birth certificates do not exist or where basic rules of
how society is structured do not apply. I am not sure which countries
the hon. Gentleman has in mind. Those rules apply in America, for
example. I would be surprised if there were not birth certificates in
America, Brazil, Argentina or any other country that would qualify for
membership of the civilised world, so that is rather a red
herring.</div>
					<a name="07071192000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
arguments relating to the shortage of applicants for particular civil
service posts that the hon. Member for Hendon made, and those of the
hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North about the
juxtaposition of Nigerians and Somalis, there is no logical reason for
maintaining the current situation. There would be no advantage in
moving to a second world war approach, with the hatches battened
down.</div>

							<a name="07071192000339"></a>Norman

						</b> Yes, indeed. Some might argue that some Americans
have terrorist inclinations themselves, although they tend to be those
who are elected rather than those who are not&#151;that was not very
well expressed, but the basic point is there. The logic for the current
situation is not maintained. The logic for a tighter regime is not
maintained.</div>
					<a name="07071192000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
final point: how will we deal with people who are in our society today
if there is a concern about what individuals might or might not do?
Will we try to isolate ourselves and say, &#147;You must keep these
elements out of what we are doing&#148; and &#147;Only we can be
inside the castle. You must be outside.&#148;? What will be the
consequence for society if we adopt that approach? Or should we lessen
the threat that exists by having a more open, objective, welcoming
approach where people can be treated on their merits individually,
irrespective of their origins or their history? Is that not more likely
in due course to lead to better community relations and lessen the
sorts of problems that we
have?</div>
					<a name="07071192000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having analysed
the Bill in that way I would be happy to support it, as is my party,
but that is subject to assurances from the Minister or whoever that
proper security and vetting checks will be in place to ensure that any
individuals, from wherever they come, whether they are UK nationals or
from anywhere else, can be picked up and are not allowed to get into
positions where we would not wish to find
them.</div>

only under a certificate to people who have very special skills that
cannot be provided by a UK national. They are very few indeed and they
have to have exceptional qualifications or experience to do the job.
That is why the number is small and primarily in the Ministry of

undercut the labour rate of civil servants in London. That is the

not want to send jobs up to Yorkshire: it is too far away and people
cannot be asked to do that. However, let us consider a short 50-minute
ride on Midland Mainline down to Wellingborough, which has higher
unemployment now than at the end of 1997 and &#163;2,000 per person
less public expenditure than Scotland. Surely, the solution is to move
organisations to Wellingborough, thereby relieving the pressure on jobs
in London and creating employment in the east midlands&#151;and
everybody is
satisfied.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con):
My hon. Friend is making a sensible, practical point.
The same argument could apply to King&#146;s Lynn, where the
Government are closing jobcentres. They have moved the Pension Service
away from Norfolk completely and are downgrading and closing some of
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs operations. Far from
encouraging Government jobs, they are doing the reverse and closing
them down.</div>

						</b> I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#146;s

an example of a problem that has arisen so far from someone who is not
a UK national but is presently able to occupy one of those
positions&#151;in other words, someone from a Commonwealth country?
If he can do that, the logic is that the vetting procedures are already
in place and are working properly. If that is so, there should be no
problem extending the boundaries, unless he is arguing that people from
Commonwealth countries are inherently less of a threat than people from
outside.</div>

because he asks whether I can point out this or that. However, he could
not point to great hordes of people marching around the cities of our
nation saying that this is an unjust law. There just is not that amount
of support. In all seriousness&#151;this is an important
issue&#151;that might be the right way to go, but because of the real

in the area. Will he acknowledge that some of the people involved
worked in the public sector in the US, but are excluded from
employment, simply because a spouse is relocating to the UK&#151;and
this country loses that
talent?</div>

Americans. I was worried because the hon. Member for Lewes implied that

							<a name="07071192000355"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> Listening to the debate, what is emerging is that
the hon. Member for Hendon, who is presenting the Bill, has logic on
his side. I congratulate him for getting this far with this measure,
because the aspect of our existing law that troubles me is that the
Chinese wife of a French national could be employed here as a civil
servant and yet the Chinese wife of a British citizen could not. I
understand that that is the legal position. That has caused many of my
hon. Friends and, indeed, many Members from all parts of the House to
conclude that we should have this Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071192000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure that allows a
French national&#146;s wife to be employed here is the European
Community (Employment in the Civil Service) Order 1991, which amended
an earlier Act to allow nationals of member states of the European
Community and their spouses, as well as certain children, to take up
civil employment under the Crown. So I can understand why many members
of the Committee are saying that we should support the Bill, because of
this powerful and logical argument. But of course, there is another way
forward, and it is the way forward that my hon. Friend the Member for
Shipley would no doubt support. We could discard the Bill and seek to
put in place arrangements to pull out of the European Union, thereby
bringing logic back to the existing situation. I hope that my hon.
Friend, whom I believe is a member of the Better Off Out campaign, will
tell us how that could be done.</div>
					<a name="07071192000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, in my very brief
contribution to this debate, I should like to say that the hon. Member
for Hendon may have logic on his side, but that does not mean that we
should support the Bill.</div>

							<a name="07071192000356"></a>The
Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Gillian
Merron):
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I should like first to echo the warm words
of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, expressed nearly an hour ago,
in welcoming you, Mrs. Humble, to the Chair. I am sure that
you have found this morning&#146;s sitting an interesting experience,
and we look forward to continuing in the Committee with you in your
role.</div>
					<a name="07071192000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate
my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon on obtaining what was originally
the support of all parts of the House when we last debated this matter
in the Chamber and on showing such determination in bringing the Bill
to this stage.</div>
					<a name="07071192000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government support the clause, and I hope that I can inject a note of
calmness into the debate this morning, which I feel is necessary. My
hon. Friend has already pointed out that the effect of the clause is to
remove the existing legislative restrictions on eligibility on
nationality grounds for employment or the holding of office in a civil
capacity under the Crown. I certainly share my hon. Friend&#146;s
view that we are committed to a civil service that reflects the
diversity of the public that it serves. The clause provides an
opportunity for the Government to remove what are very outdated
restrictions that have no place in a modern democracy, and we are
certainly committed to improving diversity and
opportunity.</div>

							<a name="07071192000357"></a>Mr.

						</b> In that case, when the Prime Minister makes his
statement to the House this afternoon about next year&#146;s
legislative programme, will he include a commitment to legislate if the
Bill fails to receive Royal Assent in this
Session?</div>

							<a name="07071192000358"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> Perhaps it would be wise of me to say that the
hon. Gentleman may wish to wait until the appropriate time, as we all
must, because of course, the Prime Minister comes to Parliament before
he goes elsewhere in making his intentions
known.</div>
					<a name="07071192000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Security is the
area that I should like to bring a little logic and calmness to,
perhaps bringing us down to reality. In my view, the Bill would have no
effect on national security. I hope that all parts of the House are
committed to ensuring that national security comes first. I assure hon.
Members that all persons, regardless of nationality, taking up
employment or holding office in a civil capacity under the Crown
continue to be subject to the usual stringent pre-appointment security
checks.</div>
					<a name="07071192000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">To highlight
what those checks are for the benefit of the Committee, they involve
checks on criminal records, residency for the previous five years,
previous employment, references and more stringent vetting in
particular posts that involve national security. I put it to the
Committee that we already have those provisions in place, and I assure
hon. Members that the Departments involved in national security, such
as the security and intelligence services, the diplomatic service, the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home
Office are able to reserve posts for UK nationals where necessary and
appropriate. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon welcomes
that
reassurance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000359"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> Will the Minister indicate the range of positions
that are to be retained only for UK nationals and whether the
Government have any intention of narrowing or widening
that?</div>
					<a name="07071192000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000360"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> The Bill would allow the appropriate Minister of
the Crown, or anybody else to whom that power was delegated, to make
the rules restricting certain categories. To give a general answer,
across the civil service, we would expect that the rules will be needed
to prohibit employment of non-UK nationals in the posts to which I have
referred. Currently, about 5 per cent. of posts are reserved on that
basis. It is intended that that approach, which was adopted in the
European Communities (Employment in the Civil Service) Order 2007, will
be mirrored in the rules under clause 2, which we will come on
to.</div>
					<a name="07071192000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000361"></a>Mr.
Dismore:
						</b> My hon. Friend will be aware that the European
Communities (Employment in the Civil Service) Order 2007 sets out the
restrictions that apply. My understanding that those
restrictions&#151;the generic departmental restrictions and those
that involve the nature of the work&#151;are set out in that order
and will apply under the rules created by the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071192000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000362"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> Indeed, that is the case. I hope that my comments
and those of my hon. Friend are helpful to the hon. Member for
Lewes.</div>
					<a name="07071192000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000363"></a>Mr.

						</b> Is there any legal definition of what is a civil
servant?</div>
					<a name="07071192000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000364"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> I am waiting for inspiration on that one and will
return to it. Perhaps I can make a few points about the Bill before
coming back to it. It is important to remember the points made by my
hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>Friend: the primary purpose of the Bill is to amend or repeal
legislation that goes back to the Act of Settlement 1700, which
prevents the employment
of</div>
					<a name="07071192000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aliens in any civil
employment under the Crown, including the civil
service.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071192000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
legislative position has eased over the years, it remains the case and
is worth restating that, other than UK nationals, only Commonwealth,
EEA, Swiss and Turkish nationals and certain family members of EEA, EU,
Swiss and Turkish nationals may be employed in the UK civil service,
irrespective of their
nationality.</div>
					<a name="07071192000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has
also come through in the debate on the clause, the Bill would also
ensure that we do not have in the civil service a present alien spouse
anomaly caused by the interaction of UK and EC law. I heard the call
from a number of Opposition Members to withdraw from the European
Union. I am sure that that will be of immense interest to the leaders
of the Opposition parties, as well as to Labour Members. However, at
present, certain non-EEA spouses and dependants of non-UK EEA nationals
are eligible for non-reserved civil service posts, whereas the non-EEA
spouses and dependants of UK nationals are not. Therefore, for example,
the American husband of a French national living in the UK would be
eligible for employment in the civil service, whereas the American
husband of a UK national would not. That does not seem to be
particularly useful.</div>
					<a name="07071192000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the legal definition of a
civil servant, I should be delighted to write to the right hon. Member
for East Yorkshire. It is very complex legally, so it would be
appropriate for me to set that out for him.</div>
					<a name="07071192000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000365"></a>Mr.
Bone:
						</b> On the Minister&#146;s earlier remarks about how
the Bill would have no effect on security by changing the law, have the
Government consulted the security services and, if so, what was their
opinion?</div>
					<a name="07071192000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000366"></a>Gillian
Merron:
						</b> Of course we have, and the security services are
quite content with the arrangements. The Bill is not about weakening
our security checks. They will remain as they are, and they will be
improved as and when we need to do so, for all people. That is the
important
point.</div>
				
					<a name="07071192000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

						</b> The short answer is that that would be wrong in
respect of decisions about individuals. As I mentioned earlier, such
jobs are set out in the European Communities (Employment in the Civil
Service) Order 2007. They include jobs in certain departments of the
security and intelligence services, including the Security Service, the
Secret Intelligence Service, Government Communications Headquarters,
the diplomatic service, the Foreign Office and the Defence Intelligence
Staff. The order specifically refers to</div>

immigration&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071192000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">and so on.
The order gives a detailed list, and I understand that those sorts of

does he agree that Parliament should always have the final say and that
one glaring omission from the Bill is that there is no provision for
any parliamentary confirmation of the rules in force? If he is lucky
enough to get his Bill through Committee, will he at least reflect on
Report on whether we need a system of parliamentary scrutiny of the

not go as far as saying that about his earlier comments on the European
Union. I shall certainly reflect on what he has said.</div>
					<a name="07071192000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given how the Bill is
constructed, it would provide the flexibility that the existing

arrangements is that they have layered Acts of Parliament on orders on
Acts of Parliament on other rules. That has created a complex tangle.
If we have a simple system that can be tweaked, amended and brought up
to date relatively easily, it will be an advantage. However, I take the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, on which we will be able to
reflect as the Bill proceeds&#151;if it does&#151;to

						</b> That effectively gives a counterpart to our
current arrangements in respect of the Aliens&#146; Employment Act
1955, which was mentioned earlier. As I said, the 1955 Act deals
primarily with MOD jobs. We shall have rules that will make all sorts
of exclusions. I shall give a hypothetical example. Let us suppose that
the intelligence services wanted to employ&#151;subject to all the
appropriate checks and balances, obviously&#151;somebody from the
United States Department of Homeland Security, or somebody equivalent
from Israel, which has enormous experience of counter-terrorism. We
might need to make an exemption, as we could now under the 1955 Act,
for the very small number of individuals whom it could be to our
advantage to employ in what would otherwise be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>reserved jobs. We are talking about a belt-and-braces approach that
would provide an exemption in such
circumstances.</div>

for his intervention, which makes it clear, certainly in respect of
delegation, that the proposal reflects the existing arrangements pretty
accurately and gives effect to the restrictions, which we debated
extensively in clause
1.</div>
					<a name="07071192000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only serious
objection relates to terrorism. My answer to the question on terrorism
is that the 7/7 bombers were UK nationals. The real answer was given by
my hon. Friend earlier: we must ensure that the proper security checks
are in place irrespective of nationality, which we do. The most
important argument is that we are trying to create an inclusive civil
service, which does not have unnecessary restrictions but nevertheless
has restrictions that are relevant and needed to preserve those jobs in
which our security is essential, and the Bill provides for
that.</div>
					<a name="07071192000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, there are a large number of Israeli people in my constituency.
To suggest that Israelis are involved in such activities would be
barking mad, but they are excluded, as are Americans, Japanese people
and those from all sorts of countries around the world who are
absolutely committed to the fight against terrorism. Yet there have
been problems in the existing arrangements&#151;I do not mean that in
a generic way&#151;with Pakistani nationals, who are entitled to join
the civil service, as are UK nationals, who have been involved in
terrorist activity. The argument about nationality and terrorism is a
complete red herring in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="07071192000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead mentioned Nepalese people
who were employed as Gurkha soldiers. To suggest that they should be
excluded on security grounds is
nonsense.</div>
					<a name="07071192000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
would give effect to the recommendations of the Public
Administration Committee, which considered the issue some time ago, and
it has the widespread support of organisations such as the civil
service unions and the Commission for Racial Equality. I will not
repeat the arguments advanced in clause 1, but I hope that the
Committee will support clause stand
part.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000398"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I wonder whether the Minister, when she responds,
could deal with a point that relates to holding office in a civil
capacity under the Crown in clause 2(1). Sensitive jobs that used to be
done within 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>the civil service are increasingly being outsourced. However, we still
want the people who do those jobs to be subject to proper vetting and
security checks. As parts of Porton Down, for example, have been sent
into the private sector, the people who work there may not technically
be civil servants, but their work nevertheless requires security checks
to be carried out. Can the Minister reassure the Committee that that
will somehow be wrapped up in the clause and in the Government&#146;s
response to the
matter?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000399"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> This clause is the most important part of the
Bill. We cannot argue with its title &#147;Power to impose new
nationality requirements&#148;, because if the House accepts the
Bill, power will be needed to introduce new requirements. However, the
drafting of the clause seems to flow against the tide of what the
Government are trying to achieve.</div>
					<a name="07071192000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State for
Justice and Lord Chancellor, who until recently was Leader of the
House, played a very prominent role as Chairman of the Modernisation
Committee and said that he wanted enhanced parliamentary scrutiny. That
theme has been repeated by the new Prime Minister in his statements
about giving greater power to Parliament and removing power from the
Executive, which is to be applauded. Conservative Members wait to see
whether he delivers what he promises&#151;the jury is out in that
respect&#151;but at least he is making the right noises. The theme
has been taken up by the new Leader of the House. I support the thrust
that more power should be given to Parliament and that power held by
others should be subject to scrutiny in this place, but the clause goes
off completely in the other
direction.</div>
				
					<a name="07071192000268"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div>
					<a name="07071192000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Hendon, who is normally a powerful advocate, said that the reason
behind the drafting of the clause is flexibility. He appeared to argue
that we need to sacrifice scrutiny for the benefit of flexibility. I
hope that I made it clear that logic is indeed on his side, but I am
afraid that the argument is not. I take the opposite view&#151;I
would rather sacrifice complete flexibility for moderate, reasonable
scrutiny. Scrutiny is needed whenever we give powers to change our
law.</div>
					<a name="07071192000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are being
asked to approve a framework that someone else will be able to tamper
with and change beyond all recognition, and that someone includes not
only this Minister, but others. Clause 2(3)(b) states that the rules
may be made</div>
					<a name="07071192000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by any
person or body to whom that power has been delegated by a Minister of
the Crown.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071192000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even the
power of delegation will not be subject to scrutiny by Parliament. That
would give to a Minister the power to nominate anybody. It could be
someone whose views are radical even by the standards of the hon.
Member for Lewes and who takes an even more extreme view of the United
States of America than him. There would be no mechanism by which that
person&#146;s decision could be subject to parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07071192000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
gets worse. Subsection (4)(b) would allow the Minister or any other
person appointed under subsection (3)(b) to grant exemptions, which
will also not be subject to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>parliamentary scrutiny. I have real concern that the Bill goes too far
in the direction of flexibility and sacrifices necessary parliamentary
scrutiny.</div>

							<a name="07071192000400"></a>Mr.

clause would enable retrospective changes to be made in respect of
existing employees without parliamentary
scrutiny?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000401"></a>Mr.
Knight:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is no
indication in the clause that any rule changes or exemptions must be
effective from a future date. They could indeed be backdated. I have
real concerns about allowing others to make rules without proper
scrutiny. I shall give an example from a totally different area, but
the principle is nevertheless relevant to explaining my
concerns.</div>
					<a name="07071192000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Transport
for London and the Mayor of London have the power under existing
legislation to introduce a low-emission zone. Those who are concerned
about clean air want to see that introduced, but TfL and the Mayor can
choose whatever rules they like for bringing in the zone. They are
talking about having a high threshold for commercial vehicles. As I
understand it, until recently no one realised that that would prevent
the use of vintage commercial vehicles, which are used in charity
fundraising events throughout the Greater London area throughout the
year, where they raise many hundreds of thousands of pounds for
charity. Old fire engines, steam-powered commercial vehicles and others
may be hit by the rules, because those who seek to impose them are not
subject to the scrutiny of this place. I have no confidence that good
law will result when unfettered power is given and is not subject to
ongoing scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07071192000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the promoter of the Bill&#146;s point. He does not want
the situation to be completely rigid and wants an element of
flexibility. However, that could be achieved by a periodic review of
the rules. The clause does not even contain a requirement that there
should be parliamentary scrutiny after a certain period&#151;for
example, every 12 or 24 months. If he is going to insist on including
the clause, I hope that he will seriously consider introducing an
amendment at a later stage to address those serious concerns.</div>
					<a name="07071192000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not a debating society,
although it often seems that we are. We approve, or withhold our
approval to, a change in the law, which affects all citizens in this
country. We therefore all have a duty to get it right. We all have a
duty not to say that the Minister knows best, although we have
currently have a particularly good Minister. My concern is not with the
Minister, but with what happens when she is moved on and we have
another Minister,

I always trust myself. Trust is not needed, if there is proper

be made by a Minister, because even if the Minister is outwith scrutiny
on a narrow decision, under our system, unlike the American system,
Ministers have to answer to this House every single day.</div>

there is no such requirement. The Minister is given the powers to make
the rules or, even worse, to allow someone else to make the rules and
the exemptions without any requirement for us to have any further say
in the matter. My hon. Friend, astute as ever, has put his finger right
on the weakness that there is no requirement for us to re-examine how
the rules have been drafted, implemented and applied and the range of

						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I remember
many years ago when I was a law student speaking to a colourful and
flamboyant Member of this House, the late Sir Gerald Nabarro. He
explained to me that in his day, which was the 1950s and 1960s, all
matters that reached the statute book were subject to scrutiny by this
place. It is a rather modern development that those who draft Bills
include a provision that regulations can be made later by the Minister.
That is something that we did not have for 700 years, as in the case of
the Act of Settlement. It is a modern development, which, I regret to
say, started at the tail of the last Conservative Government. I am not
making a party political
point.</div>
					<a name="07071192000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the civil service saw a way of having flexibility without having to
bother to get a time slot for the Minister to introduce legislation.
Civil servants will have said, &#147;Why don&#146;t we put an
order-making power in the Bill, Minister, then we will not have to come
back to the House? Why don&#146;t we give you a power to do this,
Minister, then we don&#146;t have to find another slot further down
the line?&#148; I can see why, for administrative reasons, it has
been done, and I make no criticism of those whose responsibility it is
to administer their Department. They are doing their best in the area

speech&#151;no matter how powerful&#151;and someone stands up to
say that they buy the point and will bring forward an amendment
accordingly. It has happened to me only once before. On the Licensing
Act 1988, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and
North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) was the Home Office Minister. I
moved an amendment to increase drinking-up time in public houses, which
was then only 10 minutes. I argued that it caused big rows at closing
time, because there were pubs full of rugby players who came in wanting
a couple of pints, but staff were trying to throw them out after 10
minutes. I thought that I was on a hiding to nothing, but my right hon.
and learned Friend stood up and said, &#147;My civil service brief
says &#145;resist&#146;.&#148; He then threw the brief on the
floor and said, &#147;I accept the amendment.&#148; The one thing
that I have achieved in my political career&#151;I hope that it is

drinking-up time.</div>

concession out of the promoter of the Bill on subsection (3). I will
begin by saying that I am concerned that we might be at cross purposes.
We have a situation where, as my right hon. Friend has said, the rules
should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, but the Bill suggests that
they need not be and that they can be made by a Minister of the
Crown.</div>
					<a name="07071192000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill goes
further, stating in subsection (3) that those rules do not even need to

talking about people who are in employment or who want to go into
employment, so it is important, if we are to change the rules, that
they are subject to parliamentary scrutiny in advance of the changes
being made, rather than being subject to a rubber-stamping exercise
after the event. Someone might be employed based on a change in the
rules, only for the annual report to be produced and Parliament to say,
&#147;We don&#146;t approve that change, as it happens&#148;.
That would put that person in a pretty difficult situation. I hope that
when we have that discussion with the promoter of the Bill, we have a
little more scrutiny of subsection (3)(b).</div>
					<a name="07071192000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be that the provision
has been introduced because the Government or the promoter of the Bill
want to give a discretion relating to the making of rules to the royal
household, because the Bill extends to the royal household and
effectively removes its ability to set its own rules for the employment
of staff. I am not sure that that is desirable, and the Minister
effectively said on Second Reading that she has some concerns. She did
not say so expressly, but reading between the lines, I got the
impression that she would rather that the royal household was not
included and that it could maintain its own employment practices. It
does not need much imagination to recognise we cannot get much more
serious security issues than those that involve people who have direct
access to the Head of State. I would prefer to leave the royal
household out, but if it is to be included, we should be able to have
some oversight of any rules that are brought forward.</div>
					<a name="07071192000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2(1) talks about rules
being made</div>
					<a name="07071192000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;imposing
requirements as to nationality which must be satisfied by a person
employed or holding office in a civil capacity under the Crown
specified in the rules.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>
					<a name="07071192000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not say,
&#147;about to be appointed to hold such office or be
employed,&#148; or &#147;on the date of the appointment.&#148; It
means that the rules can be changed after somebody has already gone
into employment. That means that if the present Minister&#151;and
Parliament, if our argument is accepted&#151;were to agree to a
change in the rules, the change would apply to all people working in
the civil service. On the basis of that change in the rules, people
might move into positions in the civil service. There might then be a
change in the Government, security system or political approach. We
might even leave the European Union&#151;I hope that that comes
about&#151;and need to rethink our relationships, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley is promoting.</div>
					<a name="07071192000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of those
changes might come about, putting in jeopardy the position of someone
who was employed or holding office in a civil capacity under the Crown.
Effectively, they would be retrospectively removed from that job. Would
that be right, and is it what the promoter of the Bill intended when he
drafted clause 2(1)? Would it not be better if the rules applied when
the person was appointed and could not be changed after they were
appointed&#151;in other words, through the duration of that
appointment?</div>
					<a name="07071192000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fell
out for a time with my own Front Bench over the retrospective element
of the air passenger duty increase imposed earlier this year. This
measure is potentially a power to make a retrospective change in the
rules, because the person in an employed position would find themselves
unable to carry on in that position. Would they be entitled to
compensation, and would they be subject to immediate dismissal? We need
that clarified.</div>
					<a name="07071192000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need more precision in subsection (2). Currently, it
specifies:</div>
					<a name="07071192000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
rules may also impose requirements as to nationality which must be
satisfied by persons of a description specified in the rules who are
related to, or living with, such a person.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071192000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the subsection refers to persons
&#147;related to&#148;, I presume it means a blood relative,
although it is not spelled out. Such a relationship cannot
change&#151;once a blood relative always a blood relative, for better
or worse. However, when it comes to a person living with someone else,
that is a relationship that can change from one moment to
another.</div>
					<a name="07071192000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a recent
case, somebody who was already married entered a civil partnership and
then, much to my delight, realised the error of their ways and reverted
to their marriage, thereby demonstrating that civil partnerships are
not necessarily all that they are cracked up to be. That is an example
of a rapidly changing scenario, relating to persons living with each
other or with somebody
else.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Like my right hon. Friend the Member for
East Yorkshire, my hon. Friend is making a powerful case against the
flaws in the clause. Will he comment on a contradiction between clause
2 and clause 1? It seems that the purpose of the Bill, as set out by
the hon. Member for Hendon, is to ensure that all and sundry have the
opportunity to work in the civil service. In clause 2, however, he
seems happy to give the power not only to prevent that from happening,
but further to restrict entry into the civil
service.</div>

							<a name="07071192000418"></a>Mr.
Chope:
						</b> My hon. Friend has made a
powerful point. Effectively&#151;I suppose this conforms to the old
doctrine of spin&#151;the hon. Member for Hendon is saying that he
does not like the existing rule-driven arrangements, because there are
certain anomalies that either do or could result in perverse outcomes,
which we all accept. However, he wishes to remove the rule-prescribed
arrangement and introduce arrangements that will not be subject to
scrutiny by this House. Those arrangements will include as yet
unspecified rules that may be more draconian than the existing rules
or, if we have heard him correctly, more liberal. Although they may not
be wholly satisfactory, we know what the existing provisions are, but
the Bill takes us to a point at which we would not know what is set out
in the rules.</div>
					<a name="07071192000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend is right in saying that clause 1 would be beneficial to the
people identified by the hon. Member for Hendon and others, but clause
2 could well take away from such people more than they have, depending
on how it is implemented. My hon. Friend has reinforced my concerns and
those of my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire about
clause 2.</div>
					<a name="07071192000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) should spell out &#147;the rules&#148; not only on blood
relationships, which obviously do not change, but on past
relationships. Who a person has lived with in the past is relevant, but
the Bill would deem cohabitation relevant only if it were current at
the time of employment. I feel that that is the wrong way forward; it
would be better if the words &#147;are related to&#148; were
followed by the words &#147;or are or
were&#148;</div>

							<a name="07071192000419"></a>Norman
Baker:
						</b> I do not wish to go further up the garden path, to
use an earlier metaphor, but it strikes me that the phrase
&#147;living with&#148; is open to interpretation. The hon.
Gentleman takes &#147;living with&#148; to imply cohabitation of a
sexual nature. Of course, it could simply mean sharing a flat, as I did
with my best friend when I left university. I was not &#147;living
with&#148; him in any sense other than that we were living in the
same flat, but, legally, we might be classified as living together.
&#147;Living with&#148; is a loose phrase unless&#151;the
Minister may tell us&#151;it has a specific legal
meaning.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071192000420"></a>Mr.
Chope:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a
good point. The only way to sort out the matter is to ensure that the
clause is amended to clarify the meaning of the loose expression
&#147;living with&#148; on Report. Obviously, when we discussed the
Civil Partnership Act 2004, there was concern that a particular type of
relationship was being given recognition by the law, but other
relationships were not&#151;for example, the relationship between two
elderly spinsters who live together. The issue also relates to
inheritance tax legislation. The hon. Gentleman is right to draw
attention to another instance of loose and imprecise drafting. I hope
that the Minister will be able to help us, because the measure will
probably commend itself to a Government
amendment.</div>

						</b> One of the terms of the St. Andrews agreement, as
the hon. Gentleman would know if he had been present on Second Reading,
was that the Government would legislate to correct the anomaly as it
particularly applied to Irish nationals, but in doing so the Government
corrected anomalies relating to the European Union generally. That is
why there is this other anomaly, which we cannot correct, about
spouses. However, if the hon. Gentleman looked at the measure, I think
it would all become relatively clear to
him.</div>

					<a name="07071192000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, I am still a
little confused because the St. Andrews agreement, as

because it is always meddling in things in which it has no need to
meddle. Given that so many powers have been delegated&#151;given
away&#151;from this country to the European Union, if the European

					<a name="07071192000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can see in

think&#151;my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire has
made this point&#151;that subsections (4)(a) and (b) go far too far
in giving unfettered power to exempt a person of one description from
the rules. Returning to my earlier point, that reinforces the fact that
unless a rule change were to introduce an exemption for existing
employees, they would not be protected against the retrospective loss
of their jobs and their right to be employed in a particular position.
Rather than having the exemption clause in subsection (4)(a), it would
be better to alter subsection (1) in the way in which I suggested
earlier to make it clear that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>such changes could apply only at the beginning of somebody&#146;s
employment, and that it could not be used to remove them from
employment after the event. I would have thought that that would be

against the amendment for one minute. That process can be more
elongated than the process in our House, where we try to have proper
scrutiny. I am confident that asking these questions and hoping for a
