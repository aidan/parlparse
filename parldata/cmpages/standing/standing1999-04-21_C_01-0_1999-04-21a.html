<P>
<H5>10.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Breeding and Sale of Dogs  (Welfare) Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past  Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a great pleasure to serve under you on this  Committee, Mr. Cunningham. The Bill has been a while  coming and many people deserve credit for its genesis.  Now that it is here, we hope to make progress with  fulfilling its aim, which is to improve the welfare of dogs  kept, and puppies bred, in commercial breeding  establishments.  
<P>
It is well known that some establishments not all, by  any means fall well short of the standards that should  appertain for bitches and puppies. Such cases have come  to light all too often when members of the public have  had occasion to buy puppies. The Bill is a step towards  addressing those problems.  
<P>
I want to pay tribute to the role of some people in the  Bill. First and foremost, I pay tribute to Baroness Wharton  for her indefatigable work. I also thank the group of 11  organisations representing animal welfare, dog breeders,  local authorities, the veterinary profession and the pet care  industry that have worked together to prepare the Bill.  They are the Blue Cross, the British Dog Breeders  Council, the British Veterinary Association, the Chartered  Institute of Environmental Health, Justice for Dogs, the  Kennel Club, the National Canine Defence League, the  National Dog Wardens Association, the Pet Care Trust,  ProDogs, and the Royal Society for the Prevention of  Cruelty to Animals. I mention especially the work of  Barry Huckle of the Pet Care Trust.  
<P>
I pay tribute to the work of the all-party group on animal  welfare. I am grateful to the Minister for the personal  interest that he has taken in the Bill, for the support of  members of his office, and for the Government's support.  
<P>
Mr. Maxton, I [Interruption.] I am sorry, Mr. Cunningham. I have had 24 hours of addressing  Mr. Maxton, so I hope that you will forgive one slip.  I commend the motion.  
<P>
Question put and agreed to.     
<H4><center>Clause 1 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Inspection and report before grant of licence </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in  page 1, line 6, leave out from `In' to end of line 2 on  page 2 and insert `the Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 ("the  1973 Act"), after subsection (2 of section 1 insert   
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A) On receipt of an application by a person to a local authority  for the grant of a licence under this Act in respect of any premises  
<P>
(a) if a licence under this Act has not previously been granted  to the person in respect of the premises, the authority shall  arrange for the inspection of the premises by a veterinary  surgeon or veterinary practitioner and by an officer of the  authority; and  
<P>
(b) in any other case, the authority may arrange for the  inspection of the premises by a veterinary surgeon or  veterinary practitioner or by an officer of the authority (or  by both).  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2B) Where an inspection is arranged under subsection (2A) of  this section, the local authority shall arrange for the making of a  report about the premises, the applicant and any other relevant  matter; and the authority shall consider the report before determining  whether to grant a licence.".'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to  consider amendment No. 10, in clause 6, page 5, line 19,  leave out `and (2B)'.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> These are largely technical  amendments to give effect to the original intention of the  working group. They provide that before a licence is  granted, breeding establishment premises must be  inspected by a veterinary surgeon or practitioner and a  local authority officer. For subsequent inspections, the  local authority is given the flexibility to send a vet, an  officer or both. That will often save costs, but it will not  weaken inspection. The Bill will improve existing  inspection arrangements and, therefore, the welfare of  dogs and pups.  
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the  Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I support  the amendment and the Bill and I congratulate the hon.  Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) on his good  fortune in drawing a place in the ballot. I associate myself  with his praise of a number of people and organisations.  Modesty forbids me from joining in with the compliments  that the paid to me.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)  introduced such a Bill some 12 months ago. Unfortunately,  it failed to complete its parliamentary procedure and make  the statute book. I know that he has been supportive to the  hon. Member for Hertsmere in moving the issue forward.  
<P>
I should pay a compliment to you, Mr. Cunningham. I  know form previous experience that your Scottish sense  of fair play, coupled with your midlands sense of getting  the business done efficiently, will stand us in good stead.  It would not be wise to detain the Committee  unnecessarily, so I will not. I am reminded by two  members of the Committee of a related issue and with a  bit of latitude on your part, Mr. Cunningham, perhaps I  could tell the story.   

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South  (Ms Southworth) has a good young offenders institution  in her constituency called Thorn Cross, which I visited  before the general election. It was an interesting visit.  The governor asked me why the then Member for Don Valley, Martin Redmond, who, as many members  of the Committee will recall, was a prolific tabler of  written questions, took such a strong interest in the  prison. I said that I was not aware that he had and  asked in what sense he had taken an interest. It  transpired that he had tabled a series of written  questions about a donkey that had managed to escape  from Thorn Cross, how long it was at large, where it  had got to, how it was recaptured and any other aspect  that he could imagine.  
<P>
The governor's concern was that he and his staff had  spent so long providing information to answer the written  questions that the management of the establishment had  suffered. I tell that story only because there is clearly a  connection between Don Valley and animal welfare that  continues to this day.  
<P>
The background to the Bill has already been given by  the hon. Member for Hertsmere, but it would be remiss  of me not to mention that the hon. Member for North  Thanet (Mr. Gale) has played a prominent role over  several years on the issue. I know that he will be pleased  that the Bill is moving forward. It certainly reflects the  concerns that the parliamentary group that he formerly  chaired has voiced over several years.  
<P>
The Bill has the support of numerous organisations,  many of which the hon. Member for Hertsmere has  acknowledged. I join him in paying tribute to the work  that Baroness Wharton has carried out with the various  interested parties in developing the Bill, which is certainly  better for having gone through that process.     
<P>
The Bill seeks to address three concerns. The first, as  the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, is the welfare of  bitches and puppies and the conditions in which they are  kept. The second is the increased likelihood of unhealthy  puppies being sold to the public. The third is the practice  of some unscrupulous dog breeders who taint the  legitimate business interests of others.  
<P>
The Committee will have gathered from my remarks  that the Government are sympathetic both to this largely  technical amendment and to the Bill. I know that our  deliberations will be careful. All the amendments that  have been tabled are sensible and I shall not detain the  Committee by opposing any of them. I wish the Bill  speedy progress. Let us all hope that it will end up on the  statute book this time.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his  remarks. He did what I should have done at the outset by  paying tribute to the hon. Member for Weaver Vale and  my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet. I endorse  what he said about them.

<P>

<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): I want to comment on  what my hon. Friend the Minister said. A year or so ago,  I discovered that my local authority had once attended a  conference on stray horses in Ireland. There may be a Don  Valley parliamentary or local government connection with  such matters. I declare an interest as a patron of the  RSPCA South Yorkshire animal centre. I was pleased to  support my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale in  his attempt last year to get such a Bill on to the statute  book. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertsmere on  taking up the challenge.  
<P>
There are many reputable dog breeders who have  welfare as their first concern. However, some people see  dog breeding as an easy way to make a quick buck and  have no consideration for the dogs or for families who  purchase them in good faith. As a child, I experienced the  problem of getting a pet that turned out to be ill and had  to be put to sleep. There is nothing more distressing than  seeing children's great expectations of giving love and  care to an animal being cruelly betrayed when an animal  is not fit to become a pet.  
<P>
The Bill addresses an important matter. We must ensure  that the welfare of the animals is uppermost in the minds  of those who breed them and that we have the necessary  regulation and authority to enforce that. Most pet owners  take pet ownership seriously. We are known as a  dog-loving nation and it is terrible to think that despite  that reputation, there are countless examples of abuse of  pet dogs. Abuse can start with the birth of the dogs and  the manner in which they are passed on to owners.  
<P>
I welcome the Bill. I received countless letters from  constituents when the issue last came before the House. I  have continued to keep them informed of progress. I hope  that the Bill will be successful and that this Parliament  can start to put right the bad practice that remains a sad  feature of the breeding and selling of dogs.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Gale </B>(North Thanet): I congratulate my  hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere on taking the Bill  through so expeditiously. I thank him and the Minister for  their unfailing courtesy during our entirely non-partisan  deliberations. I also appreciate the work of the chairman  of the all-party animal welfare group, or whatever it is  now called. I agree about the great work of Baroness  Wharton, without whom the Bill would not be before us. I  hope that it goes through the remainder of its proceedings  unfettered and undamaged.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe </B>(Bradford, South): It is a pleasure  to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham. I do  not want to detain the Committee long. I was a member  of the Committee that considered the Bill introduced by  the hon. Member for Weaver Vale. It is important to  highlight the effects of the Bill, especially this week when   the RSPCA has published a report about increased  negligence of and cruelty to animals. I wish the Bill a  speedy passage. It will go a long way to putting right  some of the wrongs that occur in this country, which is  supposed to be a nation of animal lovers.  
<P>
The dog warden in Bradford has done tremendous work  over the years on issues such as voluntary registration  schemes. I put on record my thanks and those of the  population of Bradford to Mr. Singh for his work in  promoting the welfare of animals, especially of dogs.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I know that hon. Members have put a  lot of effort into the Bill, but let us keep this short and  sweet.  
<P>
<B>Ms Helen Southworth </B>(Warrington, South): I  welcome the fact that my hon. Friend, as I might well  call him on this occasion, the Member for Hertsmere has  brought the Bill to the House again. He was with me at  the opening of Crufts this year, and he met my dog  Findbharr. He was well aware, as my hon. Friend the  Minister was when he came to my constituency and met  my dog, that people prefer dogs to politicians.  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Very wisely.  
<P>
<B>Ms Southworth:</B> Often very wisely because the one  thing about my dog is that you can always trust him. Hon.  Members have made tremendous efforts to support the  welfare of animals because we recognise that companion  animals are important to people.  
<P>
The Bill deals with the sale of dogs. The relationship  between breeders, sellers and purchasers is important  enabling people to choose the right dog for their lifestyle  and the right temperament for their family. The  development of that relationship is important. In my  constituency, a number of pet shops have already been  working in advance of the Bill to set that up. I am sure  that we shall see far better provision for ensuring that  people purchase the right dog.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Lady told me earlier that  somehow she intended to get the name of her dog in  Hansard. I see no problem with what she said, but she  did work a flanker on me.  
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): I am not a pet owner, but I  want to stress one aspect of the Bill. I am glad that my hon.  Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)  brought home to people the real suffering of animals. I pay  tribute to all the hon. Members who have been mentioned,  especially the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who has done a  great job in steering the Bill through the Committee with  the assistance of other hon. Members and to hon. Members  who previously introduced similar Bills, I pay tribute to  Baroness Wharton, to whom many in the parliamentary  group for animal welfare owe a great debt for keeping the  issue on the political agenda.      
<P>
I received a letter from a distressed constituent last  week that brings home to us why the Bill is so necessary.  She bought a dog in good faith from someone whom she  thought was a reputable breeder. A couple of years on,   not only has she had to pay a fortune in vet's fees, but  the dog has suffered as a result of inappropriate breeding.  She has tried to get justice through the courts. She  reported to me that the dog's mother was an elderly bitch  who had had numerous litters. Her dog has congenital  defects and is unhealthy. I hope that the Bill will prevent  the sort of suffering caused to her, her pet and her family.  
<P>
We are all reminded of past RSPCA campaigns. We  have seen pictures of hugh piles of dead dogs that had to  be destroyed because they were unwanted and uncared for  as a result of unscrupulous breeding. Those of us who  have dog wardens in our constituency will know that  before dog wardens were introduced, packs of dogs  roamed about frightening local residents. Dog wardens  have got rid of that problem. The campaign to make every  animal a wanted animal is important. I pay tribute to the  hon. Member for Hertsmere because the Bill goes a long  way to making that a reality. Without it, we would see far  greater suffering of domestic pets. I am grateful to him  for introducing it and I am sure that it will have the full  support of the House.  
<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): I apologise for  arriving later, Mr. Cunningham. I congratulate my hon.  Friend the Member for Hertsmere on his efforts and thank  the Minister for supporting him. I understand that the Bill  was dealt with in 10 minutes. Unlike the hon. Member for  Warrington, South, I did not have the honour to open  Crufts, but I presented one of the main prizes in the new  utility group. My hon. Friend's Bill does great credit to  him, to all those organisations that have been mentioned,  to Baroness Wharton and to the Kennel Club. I hope that  its remaining stages will be dealt with as swiftly as  possible.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I am pleased that  hon. Members are speaking to the Bill, even if only at the  end of our proceedings. For one glorious moment, I  thought that we had gone back 20 years in the Labour  party's history and that I was back in some committee  room agreeing to everything without debate and then  realising afterwards what we had agreed to. I am sure that  on this occasion there was genuine consensus.  
<P>
I am chair of the associate parliamentary group for  animal welfare as it is now called, for reasons with which  I will not bore hon. Members today. We had a meeting  when the hon. Member for Hertsmere introduced the Bill.  He gave an excellent presentation that members of the  group supported thoroughly. Even at that early stage we  knew that this was a Bill that we wanted to succeed and,  perhaps more important, that it had warm support from  all political parties in Parliament.     
<P>
Many hon. Members have mentioned Baroness  Wharton. She is an able vice-chairman of the  parliamentary group who does her best to persuade me  that perhaps that there is something in hereditary peerage   after all. She has not quite succeeded yet. Without the  effort that she put into the Bill, we would not be here  today. Other hon. Members have mentioned it and we are  very grateful for all that she did.  
<P>
I have been encouraged by the Committee stage  because clearly everyone agrees with the Bill and some  good technical amendments have been approved. I wish  it well and I hope that we can all persuade our colleagues  across the House that it very much needs to be on the  statute book. I hope that it will be.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I am pleased  to support the Bill and I congratulate the hon. Member  for Hertsmere. It could be said that by being here I am  showing that I am a glutton for punishment, as he and I  began a sitting of another Standing Committee at 4.30 pm  yesterday which is still sitting some way down the  Corridor. We have spent many hours listening to each  other expound on a quite different Bill. Perhaps we may  learn some lessons about Government assistance in  expediting business to take back down the Corridor.  
<P>
My interest in the Bill comes from a general interest in  animal welfare and dog rescue organisations. Sheffield  dog rescue came to me because it often has to pick up the  pieces when an unlicensed breeding establishment has  gone wrong. It ends up looking after animals that it has  taken out of appalling circumstances. It has presented  dreadful cases to me and says that there is nothing that it  can do under current legislation. It has been incredibly  frustrated so I am sure that, like me and all other members  of the Committee, it will be welcome the opportunity to  introduce legislation that we can test. It will enable  organisations to go out there with some teeth and try to  deal with appalling instances such as those that happen in  my city and, I am sure, everywhere else.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to colleagues for their  comments. I should mention that the hon. Member for  Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) is a sponsor of the Bill on  behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I am grateful to all hon.  Members who have attended today and supported the Bill,  and to those hon. Members who are sponsors of it. I hope  that it can make similar progress in future.  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I said at the outset that you  would dispatch our business with efficiency and fairness,  Mr. Cunningham. Our conduct under your wise  chairmanship has borne out that prediction. I join other  hon. Members in wishing the Bill speedy progress. Unlike  my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, South, I do  not have a dog to mention, but my daughter owns a rabbit  called Thumper. I thought that it would go down well  with her if I got a mention of that in Hansard.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In the spirit of the Committee, I note  that I have two dogs, but I am not going to get their names  in Hansard as some hon. Members have.  
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
