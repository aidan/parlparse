be amended by adding after regulation 8(10) the words &#147;and if
the accounting period or year of assessment in which the reference
number is received differs from the accounting period or year of
assessment in which the first transaction forming part of the
arrangements is entered into, then the reporting requirement in this
regulation shall relate to the later of those two periods (unless a tax
advantage arises in an earlier period in which case the reporting shall
be in that earlier
period).&#148;&#146;.</div><a name="08061271000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I say on behalf of the whole Committee not only that it is a pleasure
for you to be here, Sir Nicholas, but that it is a pleasure for us that
you are here. We look forward to your presence for the rest of the
day.</div><a name="08061271000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to representations that the Treasury has received
from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has identified an issue regarding
the tax avoidance scheme disclosure rules. Taxpayers have to put the
scheme reference number on their tax returns, and a difficulty arises
where there is a delay, which can sometimes be substantial and is not
uncommon, between making an arrangement available to a client and the
commencement of implementation. As a result, a client in receipt of a
scheme reference number may reach the filing date with no obligation to
report that scheme reference number on the return, as implementation
has not commenced. However, if he starts implementation after filing
the return, he has to file an amended return to report the reference
number.</div> <a name="08061271000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
suppose a notifiable arrangement giving a PAYE-related advantage is
made available to a client in March of this year but is implemented in
September. If the client receives the reference number in
September&#151;within the statutory time limit&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column652" />Column number: 652</div>reference number will be put first on the 2008-09 P35, submitted in May
2009. However, if, as encouraged by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs guidance, the promoter sends the reference number to the client
in March of this year, when he receives it from HMRC, the client is
placed in an awkward position. When he submits the 2007-08 P35 in May
2008, there is no obligation to put the number on the P35 because the
arrangement has not been implemented, and a decision to implement may
not have been taken. However, when implementation subsequently takes
place in September, an obligation is created to report the reference
number on the P35 return for the year of assessment in which the number
was received, that is the previous year. Therefore, an amended P35
return must be
submitted.</div><a name="08061271000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
does not seem to be a policy reason for HMRC to receive the reference
number earlier than on the return for the year in which it would have
appeared had the promoter provided the reference at the end of the
statutory time limit. Therefore, amendment No. 296 proposes that
regulation 8 requiring the taxpayer to report the reference number
should refer to the return for the later of the accounting period or
year of assessment for which the reference number is received, and the
accounting period or year of assessment in which the first transaction
forming part of the arrangements is entered into. That avoids the
requirement to amend a return that has already been submitted, but it
does not disadvantage HMRC. It will still get notification of the
scheme reference number when it needs
it.</div><a name="08061271000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
somewhat technical and is designed to be helpful. We look forward to
the Financial Secretary&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="08061271000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000256"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> Good
morning, Sir Nicholas. The draft regulations that we are considering
today are limited to the changes necessary to implement the measures in
the Bill. There is concern in respect of the point raised by the hon.
Gentleman. HMRC has said, in its published response to a constructive
consultation on this area, that it will hold further discussions with
interested parties over the coming months on how the current system of
reporting scheme reference numbers by users might be improved and
simplified. The issue addressed by the amendment is a fair
representation of the concern but it deals with only one aspect of a
broader range of issues that it is sensible to deal with as a package
at a later date.</div><a name="08061271000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
is considering changing the rule to reporting the scheme reference
numbers when the scheme is implemented. Therefore, it has taken on
board the point raised by PricewaterhouseCoopers. However, there are
further issues, including transitional issues and the timetable for
amending the return forms on which most SRNs are
notified.</div><a name="08061271000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that,
with those reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will note that we have
accepted the concerns that have been raised, but there are one or two
other areas that we would like to be resolved all at the same time and
in a tidier way than the amendment would allow
for.</div><a name="08061271000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000257"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I appreciate the Financial Secretary&#146;s
response and her recognition that this is a legitimate issue. In light
of that, and in the expectation that the matter will be addressed, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column653" />Column number: 653</div><a name="08061271000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment</i><i class="I">,</i><i class="I"> by

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000258"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 280, in
clause 113, page 70, line 25, after
&#145;provision&#146;, insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;under
which the amendments can take effect only in relation to claims and
assessments for a fiscal year starting after the date in which the
order is
made&#146;.</div><a name="08061271000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
113 implements schedule 39 and relates to the time limits for
assessments and claims. We are changing the period of time in which
assessments on claims must be made. There is concern that, for example,
a person who believes that he has five years, 10 months to make an
existing claim and decides not to do so until the end of that period
because he cannot foresee whether his circumstances may change, may now
find himself time-barred because the time limits are reduced to four
years. That is unfair. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has
raised the issue of legitimate
expectations.</div><a name="08061271000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light
of that concern, we propose in the amendment, essentially, a
transitional arrangement. The amendment will only come into effect in
relation to claims and assessments for a fiscal year starting after the
date on which the order is made. Therefore, the circumstances that I
have outlined will not apply and transitional arrangements will address
those. That is the issue behind the amendment. Again, we should be
grateful if the Minister
responded.</div><a name="08061271000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000259"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Schedule 39 aligns when HMRC can make assessments
to bring tax into charge if too little has been paid or too much
claimed. It also aligns the time limits for taxpayer claims. There has
been extensive consultation, and it is worth telling the Committee that
that Law Society has
said:</div><a name="08061271000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
applaud HMRC&#146;s attempts to align time limits structures across
IT, CT, VAT, PAYE and
NICs&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08061271000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">income tax,
corporation tax, VAT, pay-as-you-earn and national insurance
contributions. It
continued:</div><a name="08061271000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is our view that this makes a great deal of sense and will make, it is
hoped, compliance with tax laws somewhat easier and provide greater
certainty.&#148;</div><a name="08061271000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">That has
encouraged us that the route that we are taking is
right.</div><a name="08061271000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule sets a four-year time limit for assessments, which is a change
from six years for a number of taxes&#151;inheritance tax,
corporation tax and capital gains tax&#151;and from three years for
VAT. It also sets a six-year time limit for assessments if the taxpayer
has failed to take reasonable care, which is a change from 20 years for
income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax, and a 20-year time
limit for assessments by HMRC in certain
circumstances.</div><a name="08061271000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would constrain the transitional provisions that will be
contained in the Treasury&#146;s order introducing the new time
limits. The transitional arrangements that we envisage are that we will
lay the commencement order by 1 April 2009 to introduce the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column654" />Column number: 654</div>time limits for claims and assessments from 1 April 2010. The new time
limits will therefore apply to claims made after that date. The
arrangements will ensure that it is clear to everyone which time limits
are changing and when. The main reason for not making the change
suggested in the amendment is that it would introduce significant
complication. It would mean that different sets of rules applied to
different periods in matters as basic as a claim or an
assessment.</div><a name="08061271000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
reason not to accept the amendment is that it ignores the aim of
aligning taxes. Giving taxpayers extensive notice of a change in time
limits, as we propose, is a fair way to introduce such a change. The
time limits will be confirmed in legislation a year in advance, giving
taxpayers time to make claims for earlier years. HMRC will use the
period in between to publish extensively the changing time limits and
situations in which taxpayers may be able to make claims. If the time
provided does not prove enough for taxpayers&#146; claims, we will
consider delaying the introduction of the new time
limits.</div><a name="08061271000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
strong support that I have mentioned for this package of measures to
align time limits, it is right that taxpayers should see the benefits
of them as soon as is reasonably possible. Our proposals meet that
challenge, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061271000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000260"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We do have some specific concerns to turn to when
we debate the next group of amendments, but I am grateful to the
Financial Secretary for her comments that HMRC will seek to raise
awareness of the change in the time limits for assessments and so on,
and that it will keep the matter under review. On that basis, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061271000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000262"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 277, in
schedule 39, page 385,  line 21, leave
out paragraph
12.</div><a name="08061271000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000263"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> These amendments have been suggested to us by the
Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, an organisation that we have mentioned a
number of times of late in the Committee. Paragraph 12 of schedule 39
reduces the time limit for reclaiming overpaid tax from five years and
ten months to four years. The LITRG makes the point that it has no
objection to alignment when it is for the better operation of the tax
system, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column655" />Column number: 655</div>that it should not take place for its own sake, particularly if it will
cause an erosion of the rights of unrepresented
taxpayers.</div><a name="08061271000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
general concern about overpaid tax, so it would be helpful if the
Minister were to give some details of any estimate that HMRC and the
Treasury have made of the levels of overpaid
tax.</div>
<a name="08061271000210"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08061271000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
illustrate the scale of the problem of unrepresented taxpayers, in
particular, not claiming back tax that they have paid, but which they
do not owe, in 2004-05, the pensioner tax back project repaid 50,000
pensioners some &#163;20 million. It is also worth mentioning the
arrangements for the 10p tax rate for savings income. Some people are
concerned that there will be large amounts of overpaid tax, because the
savings rate will not be claimed. In those circumstances, there is
considerable and understandable concern that reducing the time in which
people have a right to claim from five years, 10 months, to four years
might leave innocent taxpayers who have overpaid out of pocket and not
in a position to reclaim. I acknowledge the Financial
Secretary&#146;s more general remarks about schedule 39, but that
specific matter has raised genuine
concerns.</div><a name="08061271000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two approaches to that matter, as set out in the amendments. The
simplest approach is set out in amendment No. 277, which would simply
delete paragraph 12 of the schedule, so that we retain the existing
position. Of course, there would not be full alignment, but as the
LITRG says, alignment for its own sake is perhaps not the strongest
argument. Alternatively, if the Government are determined to align all
these matters along four years, the LITRG has proposed that no order to
change the assessment time limit be made unless HMRC can satisfy the
House of Commons that it can identify all the individuals who have
overpaid income tax in previous years, and state the arrangements to
refund them. That might cause some administrative
difficulties&#151;we shall see&#151;but it gives the Government the
opportunity to continue their policy of alignment while addressing the
concerns that I have tried to outline this morning. If the Financial
Secretary is minded to accept one amendment over the other, we would be
more than happy to
oblige.</div><a name="08061271000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000264"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Amendment No. 277 would remove the long-standing
symmetry between assessment and claim time limits, and allowing a
longer time limit for claims and assessments would present a
significant risk to tax revenues. For that reason, if for no other, I
am not attracted to it. It would result in a one-way flow, because HMRC
would forego its right to assess underpaid tax, but taxpayers would be
allowed to make late claims. Under the clause and the schedule,
taxpayers will still be able to make income tax claims beyond the time
limit if they have a reasonable excuse for not making the claim on time
and if they make the claim without unreasonable delay once that excuse
has been accepted.</div>
<a name="08061271000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 278 would require
HMRC to identify all taxpayers, as the hon. Gentleman described, who
have overpaid tax, and to make arrangements to refund them. He ought to
think carefully about what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column656" />Column number: 656</div>that would mean: it is not possible with self-assessed tax, because HMRC
does not have the information necessary to identify how much tax
everyone in the UK should, and does, pay, and therefore any difference
between the two figures. Requiring everyone in the UK by law to send
HMRC full details of their earnings would represent a significant
administrative burden, not just for HMRC, but for everybody, and would
be of no benefit to most people. Instead, therefore, HMRC promotes the
ability to claim through communications with taxpayers, advertising and
so on.</div><a name="08061271000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC will make
sure that all taxpayers are informed of the change in time limits. It
will work with taxpayers&#146; representatives, including the low
incomes tax reform group ,to identify which groups of people are likely
to be able to make which kind of claims. It will use publicity on the
new time limits to advise them how to make a claim, and it is planning
another tax back campaign along the lines of the one in 2000 to which
the hon. Gentleman alluded, to encourage individuals to claim overpaid
tax. It will target pensioners in
particular.</div><a name="08061271000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061271000265"></a><b class="B">Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000266"></a>Jane

if tax has been overpaid, individuals can reclaim it and HMRC is

hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will accept that
reassurance that we take his concerns

we have already debated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column657" />Column number: 657</div><a name="08061271000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000269"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The amendment raises two issues that we have
already touched on. First, it would leave an unbalanced situation.
Until 5 April 2014, taxpayers could make claims relating to tax for six
years, but HMRC could assess claims only for four years, unless the tax
loss was careless or deliberate. The amendment would remove the
long-standing symmetry between assessment and claim time limits.
Allowing a longer time limit for claims than for assessments would
involve a high risk for tax revenues. It would mean in some years
forgoing underpaid tax when taxpayers could still make late claims. I
have described that as a one-way flow of revenue. Secondly, the
amendment would need complicated transitional rules as to what time
limits applied. I hope that with that short response the hon. Gentleman
will accept that we are alive to his concerns, but that the proposals
in the Bill are
sensible.</div><a name="08061271000200"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000270"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I note the Minister&#146;s comments on it being a
one-way street or one-way flow and her point about symmetry, although
we are talking about a relationship between HMRC and the taxpayer that
is not entirely symmetrical. Taxpayers are often hard pressed,
unrepresented and in a difficult position, so I continue to believe
that there is an issue in this regard and, as I have said, we might
return to it at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061271000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000271"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 298, in
schedule 39, page 384, line 30, after

&#145;deliberate&#146;.</div><a name="08061271000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000272"></a>The

&#145;deliberately&#146;.</div><a name="08061271000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000273"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I should explain initially&#151;no doubt the
Financial Secretary will have noted this&#151;that amendment No. 299
should use the word &#147;deliberate&#148;, rather than
&#147;deliberately&#148;, so I should clarify that grammatical
point. The amendments relate to assessments involving a loss of income
tax or capital gains tax which has been brought about deliberately by
the person. The provisions in paragraph 9 stipulate that that loss of
income tax or capital gains tax must be</div>
<a name="08061271000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;attributable to a failure by the
person to comply with an
obligation&#148;</div><a name="08061271000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="08061271000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;attributable
to arrangements in respect of which the person has failed to comply
with an obligation.&#148;</div><a name="08061271000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are in part probing. They seek a better explanation of what
the word &#147;failure&#148; means in those two contexts and of
whether that covers simple carelessness or means something stronger.
The attempt to insert &#147;deliberate&#148; is intended to tighten
that definition so that the provisions in paragraph 9 will not come
into effect if someone is simply careless. We would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s views on those
matters.</div><a name="08061271000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000274"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Taxpayers have a long-standing obligation to
notify HMRC that they are liable to tax. If a taxpayer does not provide
such notification, HMRC might not find out for some time. HMRC, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column658" />Column number: 658</div>therefore, needs time to investigate their affairs and quantify the tax
due. Amendments Nos. 298 and 299 would make the extended time limits
apply only if the failure to notify liability or use of a scheme was
deliberate, but they ignore the fact that that provision is not a
penalty. It requires the taxpayer to pay the tax, if they have not paid
because they did not notify HMRC. HMRC owes it to those taxpayers who
come forward and arrange to pay tax not to allow those who do not do so
to have a significant competitive advantage.</div>
<a name="08061271000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the amendment were made,
HMRC would have to prove that a taxpayer or a company had deliberately
failed to notify it of their tax liability, and it should be clear to
everyone that that would be extremely difficult. Even if a taxpayer has
deliberately failed to notify HMRC of business activity or the use of a
disclosable scheme, evidence to prove that that is the case would have
to be given by HMRC. Those difficulties would genuinely arise if the
amendment were made, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that
that would lead me to resist the amendment if it were
pressed.</div>
<a name="08061271000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000275"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Again, we will not be pressing the amendment, but I
think that it was an important point to raise. I am not sure that the
symmetry between the taxpayer and HMRC is necessarily present in the
way the Government profess&#151;carelessness can extend the various
limits available to HMRC&#151;and I am not certain whether the
taxpayer benefits from the same rights. None the less, we acknowledge
the Financial Secretary&#146;s comments and some of the practical
difficulties, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061271000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

shallower pleasures of limited-overs cricket for the next few
weeks.</div><a name="08061271000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
refers to paragraph 15 on page 385, which has already been touched on,
because we have discussed more minor amendments on the same point.
Sub-paragraph (5)
states:</div><a name="08061271000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this Act a loss of tax or a situation is brought about

<div class="Column"><a name="Column659" />Column number: 659</div><a name="08061271000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern is that a period &#147;some

their position. The amendment would change that phrase
to</div><a name="08061271000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within four years of
that information having been
provided&#148;.</div><a name="08061271000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is as simple as that, and I am interested to hear the
Financial Secretary&#146;s response. I ought to say that we are not
wedded to a period of four years. If she thinks that another figure is
preferable, the Committee may well be persuaded. However, the principle
of a specified time limit as opposed to the expression, &#147;some
time later&#148; is of value. With your indulgence, Sir Nicholas, may
I say that, although amendment No. 195 is not in this group, it relates
directly to this matter? It would put the measure in place from 6 April
2009, so that there would be a period for people to adjust to the
proposal. Having made that point, I will not feel the necessity to make
it
later.</div><a name="08061271000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000279"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I endorse the hon. Gentleman&#146;s words: test
cricket is a far superior game to Twenty20 cricket. I share his view
that there is a problem with the measure. Amendment No. 300, which I
tabled with my hon. Friends, reminds me of the Conservative amendment
with regard to deceased persons that the Financial Secretary graciously
accepted last Tuesday. We agreed in the Committee that there was no
point in the time period within which information should be provided
being any longer than the period in which tax could be assessed.
Amendment No. 300 makes a similar point regarding the period of time in
which it is possible for an assessment to be raised to recover lost
tax. There is a parallel to be drawn: given that I was successful with
our earlier amendment, I thought that that would be a particularly
persuasive argument for the Financial Secretary, but we shall
see.</div><a name="08061271000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000280"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000284"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary says that
it is all my fault for accepting the amendment earlier this week. With
regard to the point about the phrase, &#147;some time later&#148;,
what was said sounds reasonable, and it is important that I respond to
it thoughtfully.</div> <a name="08061271000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation makes it clear that after six years a careless inaccuracy
cannot be corrected, so the taxpayer knows that he or she need not
inform HMRC. The Bill replicates the definition used for penalties for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column660" />Column number: 660</div>incorrect returns in the Finance Act 2007: a taxpayer should take
reasonable steps to tell HMRC if he or she finds an error in
information given to HMRC. Both the amendments seek to restrict the
time available to taxpayers to do so, which would mean that HMRC would
not be told of certain errors that led to the underpayment of tax. It
would also mean that the definition for a careless loss of tax would no
longer be aligned with that used for penalties, which would be
confusing for taxpayers. The onus would be on HMRC to demonstrate
careless or deliberate behaviour, for both penalty purposes and the
assessment of time limits. That definition of a careless loss of tax
does not create any new obligation to notify HMRC beyond that which
already exists. Instead, it clarifies the situation as a careless loss
of tax. The alignment of time limits, as I said earlier, was welcomed,
because overall, the changes in time limits give taxpayers certainty
earlier. However, giving that certainty to those who know there are
inaccuracies in their returns but choose not to tell HMRC, does not
meet the objective of ensuring that taxpayers pay the right amount of
tax at the right time.
</div><a name="08061271000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Taunton spoke on amendment No. 195, which would mean that the schedule
applied only to claims made on or after 6 April 2009. In the Budget
note accompanying the changes, we said that the new time limits would
not be introduced in full until 1 April 2010 following extensive
publicity, as I have described. That will ensure that taxpayers have
sufficient time to make any necessary claims or preparations. As a
result, the amendment is not necessary. I hope that all three
amendments were tabled in a probing spirit, and that I have reassured
the Committee about the concerns that have been
raised.</div><a name="08061271000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000286"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> It will be a short stand part debate. I have one
question, which I could have addressed on amendments Nos. 298 and 299
but it was not directly related to that group. It involves returning to
paragraph 9 of schedule 39, which concerns the extended time periods
that may be available for HMRC assessment. Under new subsection (1B),
the circumstances include those where the loss has been brought about
by another person as opposed to the taxpayer&#151;that is, a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column661" />Column number: 661</div>third party or an adviser. Concerns have been raised about that, given
that the taxpayer may be entirely innocent and not complicit in any
way. I have not proposed an amendment and I do not advocate deleting
the new subsection, but could the Minister briefly inform the Committee
of the thinking behind it? Does she have any concerns that taxpayers
may be treated unfairly as a consequence of
it?</div><a name="08061271000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000287"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I do not, but it is always helpful to give the
issue some thought. The tax assessment can be made only to require a
taxpayer to pay the tax that they should have paid in the first place
and that other taxpayers have had to pay. That is a basic obligation,
it is not a penalty. It would not be fair on other taxpayers if the tax
remain unpaid. The purpose of the extended time limits is to give HMRC
more time to identify and to quantify loss of tax where necessary. It
has long been that case that time limits are extended where a person
acting on behalf of the taxpayer is negligent. Where that happens,
there is recognition that the taxpayer ought not to be penalised
unfairly. The schedule reduces the time limit in those circumstances
from 20 years to six
years.</div><a name="08061271000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
debate, I set out the purpose of the schedule, which is to align the
time limits. That alignment has been warmly welcomed. Representative
bodies have described harmonised time limits as reasonable, sensible
and logical. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that, given the
approach that HMRC will develop with the new arrangements, there will
be a willingness to recognise where such an event has occurred and, as
I have said, to work in co-operation with taxpayers who are seeking to
be compliant.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000293"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 302, in
schedule 40, page 394, line 16, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(A2) For this
purpose a person shall be deemed to have disclosed an inaccuracy if he
corrects the inaccuracy in accordance with regulation 34(3) of the
Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 provided that if requested to do so he
subsequently gave HMRC the help and access referred to in sub-paragraph
(1)&#146;.</div><a name="08061271000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
this is a rather technical amendment. We have tabled it as a
consequence of representations made by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants. It relates to disclosure of VAT errors. The ICA is
concerned that amendments to the Finance Act 2007 provisions in
paragraph 9 essentially mean that a deregulatory provision will prove
ineffective. The Government have decided to increase the VAT de minimis
limit for mandatory disclosure of VAT errors under regulation 34(3) of
the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 from &#163;2,000 to
&#163;10,000, which is a welcome deregulatory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column663" />Column number: 663</div>measure. The concern is that the revised penalty rules will deter most
taxpayers from taking advantage of this
deregulation.</div><a name="08061271000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that is that paragraph 9 largely negates this provision
because it grants reduction in penalties for disclosure of an
underassessment subject to the taxpayer meeting certain conditions.
Where a person seeks to take advantage of the Government&#146;s
deregulatory relaxation, he cannot benefit from the reduction in
paragraph 9, as the correction will not meet the conditions in
sub-paragraph (1). This effectively means that it will be dangerous for
a taxpayer to correct an error on a subsequent tax return unless he
also makes a separate disclosure of the inaccuracy to HMRC, as a
taxpayer has no way of knowing when he discovers an error whether HMRC
might consider the error as one arising due to failure to take
reasonable
care.</div><a name="08061271000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
effect of the Government&#146;s deregulatory intention in increasing
the de minimis limit will, in the view of the ICA, impose a greater
rather then lesser burden on business, as the business in question will
have to make two notifications instead of one. It is unlikely that the
Government intended that this deregulatory measure should deny
taxpayers the benefit of paragraph 9, and the amendment would give the
taxpayer that benefit provided that he meets the appropriate conditions
in response to a later request for information by HMRC. As I said, this
is a technical amendment. We hope that it is consistent with the
Government&#146;s intention of reducing the burden on reporting VAT
errors. As the drafting stands there appears to be a concern, which we
hope the amendment will enable the Government to
address.</div>
<a name="08061271000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000294"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that
overall, schedule 40 has been welcomed as a measure reducing
administrative burdens on business. He is also right to say that there
has been concern about how the error-correction procedure will interact
with the new penalties for incorrect returns. In the past, so-called
VAT voluntary disclosures have been guaranteed not to attract a
penalty. Under the new regime, most will still escape a penalty, but
this will no longer be guaranteed. Instead, whether a penalty is due
will depend on whether that error was careless or deliberate and on the
quality of the taxpayer&#146;s disclosure. The change is being made
because the guaranteed escape from penalty was undermining the key
message that taxpayers should declare the right tax at the right time.
HMRC have been working closely with VAT experts from industry and
representative bodies to develop clear policy and guidance in this
sensitive
area.</div><a name="08061271000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
majority of errors identified by taxpayers for correction are neither
careless nor deliberate, so penalties will not be an issue. Where a
taxpayer is unsure whether they have taken reasonable care with their
tax affairs, they should notify any resulting errors to HMRC separately
even if they are below the de minimis limit. In this way they can make
a full unprompted disclosure, reducing the penalty to nil. This is
because the special arrangements for correcting smaller errors are not
necessarily visible to HMRC. The onus is on HMRC to determine whether
reasonable care has been taken in an individual case, and they cannot
do that unless they are aware of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column664" />Column number: 664</div>facts. In considering the interaction between the new penalties and the
VAT error correction procedure, HMRC have tried to balance reducing
administrative burdens on businesses with encouraging taxpayers to
declare the right tax at the right time. It is quite proper that we
have a debate as to whether that balance is
right.</div><a name="08061271000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000295"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> In reality, if a business person discovers that they
have made a VAT error and correct it&#151;as does happen&#151;under
the new rules there is no incentive to tell the Revenue. Telling the
Revenue might attract penalties that one would attract anyway if the
error were discovered, so the provision is actually a disincentive to
declare the error
voluntarily.</div><a name="08061271000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000296"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I do not think that most compliant taxpayers
would see it in that way. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s experience has
been very valuable in Committee and I acknowledge that he has
experience of precisely these matters. However, HMRC, in consultation
with VAT experts and business, believe that the balance is right in
terms of encouraging the taxpayer to be compliant, to get the tax right
and therefore to report
errors.</div><a name="08061271000118"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000297"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I am thinking of a situation where the taxpayer does
make a correction, so the tax is then right; however, there is not the
incentive to tell the Revenue because penalties might be imposed.
Before, they knew that if they told the Revenue, there would not be any
penalties.</div><a name="08061271000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000298"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If it was later discovered that there was an
error, their not telling HMRC about an error that they have found would
risk a penalty of up to 30 per cent. of the tax understated. HMRC
believes that that is the incentive to the taxpayer. As I have
explained, the vast majority of errors are not careless or deliberate,
and the vast majority of VAT payers do pay correctly and on time, but
this amendment, if enacted, would displace the balance that HMRC is
confident it has achieved. VAT errors identified by the taxpayer of as
much as &#163;50,000 would become virtually exempt from penalty,
regardless of the underlying behaviour, which would seriously undermine
the regime&#146;s integrity. That would be unfair to the wider
taxpaying population and would seriously undermine the objective of the
penalty regime to encourage people to take care with their tax. It is
also important to remember that the new penalty regime will apply to
all taxes and duties. That will enable clear deterrent messages to be
sent and it will help to ensure a fair and consistent approach to
errors. However, it means that we need to think very carefully before
creating or expanding special rules for particular taxes or
groups.</div><a name="08061271000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000301"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> This group of amendments relates to the liability
of company officers. A number of concerns have been expressed with
regard to the original proposals in the Bill. In broad terms, they are:
that company officers may be unduly liable; that they may be seen to be
an easy target for HMRC; that the proportion of the penalty levied
against an individual officer, as opposed to the company, might be
unnecessarily and inappropriately high; and that more than the correct
amount could be obtained by penalties both to officers and to the
company itself.</div> <a name="08061271000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thinking behind amendment No. 308 is that in pursuing an officer, HMRC
should have regard to the proportion of the penalty that, in all
circumstances, is just and reasonable to allocate to the officer. On
the face of it, it is difficult to argue against that and I am sure
that the Minister will assure us that HMRC will not be seeking to
pursue an officer for more than what is just and reasonable to allocate
to the
officer.</div><a name="08061271000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have also tabled amendments on this issue, which to some
extent seek to address the concerns of the various bodies that
scrutinise these matters closely. We look forward to hearing what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column666" />Column number: 666</div>Minister has to say about the Government&#146;s amendments, and to
testing whether they satisfactorily address the real and understandable
concerns that exist about how company officers may be
pursued.</div><a name="08061271000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000302"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The Government amendments are largely technical
and I will come to the issue that they address in a moment.</div>
<a name="08061271000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before a penalty can be pursued
from an officer of a company, who is usually a director, HMRC has to
demonstrate that the inaccuracy was deliberate and was caused, at least
in part, by the director. It is right that HMRC officers should take
into account all the circumstances and that they should act reasonably
when deciding how much of the penalty should be collected from the
officer. However, it is neither necessary nor desirable to specify that
in legislation, as suggested. To do so in the Bill, but not in relation
to other matters where HMRC makes decisions about penalties, would be
inconsistent and would perhaps call into doubt the basis on which other
decisions should be made.</div>
<a name="08061271000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
debated many times while considering these powers, HMRC officers are
required to act reasonably at all times. A number of different factors
should be taken into account when deciding the penalty to be paid by
the director&#151;for example, how many directors were involved, and
the extent of personal gain by each. The provision will also be helpful
in combating cases where a company deliberately becomes insolvent and
transfers its activity to a new company in order to evade tax
liabilities. It may be a surprise to the Committee, but there are
occasions when that
happens.</div><a name="08061271000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Government
amendment No. 241, if there is a deliberate inaccuracy in a
company&#146;s return that is attributable to an officer of that
company, HMRC may pursue all or part of the penalty from that officer.
As a result of further scrutiny by HMRC, it has come to light that the
way in which the measure is drafted means that there is a risk that
HMRC will not be able to assess such a penalty from the officer, and
that the officer would not be able to appeal against a penalty. It is
regrettable that that was not identified or addressed sooner, but it is
important that it be put right before such penalties can be charged,
from 1 April 2009. That is the purpose of our
amendments.</div><a name="08061271000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that I have addressed the points that the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire made, and I will happily listen what he has to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000314"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, again.
<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i><i class="I"> </i>May I say how pleased I am to learn that
Government Back Benchers are paying such close attention and I shall
see what I can do about it.</div>
<a name="08061271000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
Nos. 303 and 304 relate to penalties for non-deliberate failure to
notify. It might be worth making a general point about the policy
because in their approach to enforcement and penalties the Government
will want people to come back into the system. When people have erred
and particularly where they have not deliberately erred but found that
through some mistake they are in breach of the tax law and regulations,
the Government will rightly want to ensure that they comply in future.
The system has its deterrents and its punishments but the desire
rightly must be to ensure that those taxpayers comply in future and
that they regularise their arrangements. With regard to both of these
amendments we must bear in mind whether the Government has quite got
the balance right. That is the point that we are
testing.</div><a name="08061271000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 303, in the proposals for late notification penalties,
the penalty chargeable to a person whose failure to notify is not
deliberate will normally be 30 per cent. of the potential lost revenue
but can be reduced for an unprompted disclosure. The reduction will
normally be to 10 per cent. of the potential lost revenue but can be
greater, even to nil per cent. if HMRC is told about the failure within
12 months. This point is made by the Low Incomes Tax Reform
Group&#151;there are many unrepresented taxpayers who simply do not
know that they need to notify HMRC of something and their non-culpable
failure can go undetected for many years. When eventually they find out
and notify HMRC, compliance officers have hitherto been empowered to
agree a nil penalty. The LITRG says, however, that that will no longer
be the case under these proposals. Consequently, the purpose of
amendment No. 303 is to enable a reduced or nil penalty to be charged
where HMRC is first told of the failure within 12 months of it
occurring or within 12 months of the taxpayer first becoming aware of
it, whichever is later.</div>
<a name="08061271000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
precedent for that within the tax credits system where a claimant is
obliged to notify HMRC of a change of circumstances within one month of
the change or one month of the claimant first becoming aware of it.
Under the penalties proposals in schedule 41, there is scope for a nil
penalty in special circumstances where the taxpayer has a reasonable
excuse for not informing HMRC. However, the view of the LITRG&#151;an
organisation that has considerable experience in the sector&#151;is
that trying to persuade HMRC that the unrepresented taxpayer has a
reasonable excuse is often a hopeless task. The amendment would
therefore give greater certainty to the taxpayer and preserve
the status
quo.</div><a name="08061271000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 304
introduces a suspension regime in the context of these non-deliberate
failures to notify. A key feature of the new penalty regime as a whole
is the provision of penalties for failure to notify as a result of
carelessness. We suggest that such penalties could be suspended for up
to two years, because if a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column669" />Column number: 669</div>taxpayer has merely been careless, they should be encouraged to comply
with the rules in future. The schedule 24 position can be distinguished
from what we are talking about because HMRC argues that suspension is
about curing systemic failures, to which schedule 24 relates, and it
could be argued that a failure to notify is a one-off failure rather
than a systemic problem, so suspension is not appropriate. To some
extent, I am anticipating the argument that the Financial Secretary
might make, but we point out that if the Government&#146;s aim is to
get people to comply and to keep complying, it would fit well into the
framework to have a two-year suspension of penalties for careless
failure to notify, on the condition that accurate tax returns were
submitted on time in that period.</div>
<a name="08061271000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a requirement would be as
measurable as any other criterion used for suspension and would give
exactly the incentive that HMRC seeks to get taxpayers to operate
properly. Without it, the incentive is for taxpayers to stay outside
the system in the black economy. That is the thinking behind both of
our amendments. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group and the Chartered
Institute of Taxation have made sensible representations to us on the
issue, and we would be grateful if the Government closely considered
the
proposals.</div><a name="08061271000156"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000315"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> To prevent penalties from becoming a barrier to
people coming forward when things have gone wrong, there are
substantial reductions in penalties for disclosure by taxpayers.
Paragraph 13(5) of schedule 41 says that if a person comes forward
unprompted within 12 months of tax becoming unpaid as a result of a
failure to notify, the penalty may be reduced to nil. That involves a
date that is identifiable to the taxpayer, their advisers and HMRC, and
it provides clarity on how long the additional reduction will apply.
That is important to encourage people to come forward to HMRC early,
and was amended in line with suggestions that were made during
consultation. It means that someone who starts a business in one year
and delays going to an accountant to sort out their tax until just
before the following 31 January deadline&#151;I can
imagine that all the work of setting up in business could, on occasion,
lead to that happening&#151;would still be able to escape a
penalty.</div>
<a name="08061271000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman says that he has heard representations that it is a
&#147;hopeless task&#148;&#151;that phrase was used&#151;trying
to persuade HMRC of a reasonable excuse. HMRC has made it clear that a
person who had reasonable grounds for believing that an obligation to
notify did not arise will have a reasonable excuse. That and other
matters of interpretation will be published in HMRC guidance. If there
are clear examples of HMRC not applying that, I will be happy to
consider the examples. Let me give a few examples of what might
constitute a reasonable excuse, but this is not an exclusive list:
compassionate circumstances, such as serious illness, at the time when
notification was required; doubt about whether an activity is taxable;
and uncertainty about employment status when there is genuine doubt as
to whether a person is self-employed.</div>
<a name="08061271000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fundamental
problem with the alternative proposed in amendment No. 303 is that it
will be difficult to ascertain, in any verifiable way, when the
taxpayer became aware of the failure. Where a taxpayer has a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column670" />Column number: 670</div>reasonable belief that an obligation to notify did not arise, they will
not be charged a penalty. That will be so even if HMRC, or a tribunal,
subsequently determines that the activity is taxable&#151;an
important safeguard for
taxpayers.</div>
<a name="08061271000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="08061271000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">An example is a
case in which where there is genuine uncertainty about whether there is
an obligation to provide notification. Someone may consider all the
facts, take advice and conclude that their activity is not taxable. I
think of my dad, who is an avid collector of small die-cast models of
diesel trucks. He goes to events called swap meets, which other avid
collectors of diesel trucks attend, and they swap trucks. The value of
those items depends on the condition of the box as much as the model
being swapped. Small amounts of money are exchanged, and we would not
want to catch people engaged in that kind of hobby, which may, or may
not, be a trade. That is not quite an interest to declare, but my dad
came to mind when I was thinking about the details of the
measure.</div> <a name="08061271000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concept
of reasonable excuse will address that type of situation, and HMRC will
publish guidance to make that clear. That mirrors the principle that is
applied to incorrect returns: if a mistake is made, despite reasonable
care being taken, it should not be penalised. If the amendment were
accepted it might be perceived as unfair to the compliant majority who
come forward to register and pay tax that is due on time. With no clear
downside for those who fail to do so, compliant taxpayers may lose
confidence in the fairness of the system.</div>
<a name="08061271000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061271000316"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
listened with interest to what the Minister said, particularly the
example that she gave. The Opposition are concerned that that the bar
is set too high. The reality, as far as I can see, is that for anybody
with any previous business experience&#151;through incorporation, or
trading as a sole trader and thus having dealings with tax
officers&#151;and for anybody who has ever taken professional advice
from an accountant and so on, will almost certainly be unable to claim
under these provisions. We are trying to capture, as it were, such
individuals, who have made a genuine mistake, in our
amendment.</div>
<a name="08061271000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000317"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I accept the point that the hon. Gentleman has
made, and I undertake to keep that particular provision under close
review to make sure that it works as intended, in the event that we
resist the amendment.</div>
<a name="08061271000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
304 seeks to provide the facility to suspend penalties for failures to
notify that are &#147;neither deliberate nor concealed&#148;.
Conditions for suspension would be that a further failure to notify did
not occur, and that a carelessly incorrect return should not be made
for a period of up to two years. The suspension of penalties is an
innovative aspect of the new penalties introduced for incorrect returns
in the Finance Act 2007, which did a lot of good work. That is
appropriate in the case of errors due to poor accounting or
record-keeping systems. Conditions are set so that someone spends money
to improve systems to prevent further inaccuracies, but the amendment
seeks to apply similar 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column671" />Column number: 671</div>provisions to the failure to notify penalties. However, there is an
important difference, as HMRC believes that it would be unworkable. The
obligation to notify a new taxable activity is a one-off, unlike
submitting accurate returns, which is an ongoing requirement for most
taxes.</div>
<a name="08061271000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is hard to
see what conditions could be set to help the taxpayer avoid a further
penalty for failing to notify. The provision would be applicable only
if they started another taxable activity requiring notification and,
again, it is difficult to see how specific conditions could be set to
help prevent them making an error in subsequent returns. It was
suggested in the consultation that suspension of a failure to notify
penalty should be made on the condition that routine tax obligations,
such as filing returns and paying tax on time, are complied with for a
period. That makes more sense, but there are still difficulties with
that approach, not least because it could weaken and confuse the
message that people must tell HMRC when they start a new taxable
activity. Both amendments are unnecessary, particularly amendment No.
303. Amendment No. 304 is unworkable, so I suggest that neither
amendment should be pressed further.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061271000318"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I welcome the Financial Secretary&#146;s remarks
about the concept of reasonable excuse. The term &#147;hopeless
task&#148; was not mine, but was used by the low incomes tax reform
group, which has a great deal of experience in this area. She made an
interesting practical point about how HMRC would ascertain when
somebody became aware, but again, I highlight the fact that the tax
credit system permits that. She may have her own views about how that
aspect of the tax credit system operates, but it does allow for
that.</div><a name="08061271000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">On suspension, I
am not persuaded by the Financial Secretary&#146;s comment that it is
difficult to see how one could have a suspended penalty in such
circumstances. One could do it on future notifications, ensuring that
tax returns are filed on time and accurately. Therefore, I will
withdraw amendment No. 303, but I will press amendment No. 304 to a
