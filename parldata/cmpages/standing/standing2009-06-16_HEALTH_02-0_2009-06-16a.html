to have regard to NHS
Constitution</div><a name="09061771000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000418"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): I beg to move amendment
3, in
clause 2, page 1, line 16, after
&#145;Constitution&#146;, insert &#145;, Handbook, and Statement
of
Accountability&#146;.</div><a name="09061771000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to multi-task by turning off my phone at the same time as I
introduce amendment 3. This is a probing amendment to tease out the
status of the handbook, particularly the statement of accountability.
The amendment would ensure that NHS bodies have regard not only to the
constitution, but to the handbook and statement of
accountability.</div><a name="09061771000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister explain why the statement of accountability is not in the
Bill, when the handbook is? In purely legislative terms, that gives
equal status to the handbook and the constitution and lesser status to
the statement of accountability. If de jure the documents are of
different value, conversely they seem to be de facto of the same value.
The constitution cannot stand alone, which can only undermine it,
because it needs the 148-page handbook and the 20-page statement of
accountability to support it. Alternatively, the Minister might argue
that the constitution is, in fact, superior to the handbook and the
statement of accountability. If they are different, how is that so and
why are they different from one another in that respect? Why has one
but not the other been included in the
Bill?</div><a name="09061771000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
although paragraph 7 of the constitution states that</div>
<a name="09061771000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government
will ensure that there is always a clear and up-to-date statement of
accountability for this
purpose,&#148;</div><a name="09061771000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">there
seems to be no legislative responsibility or mechanism for doing so.
Why is that the case and how will it work?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="09061771000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000419"></a><b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I rise to support those points. One
issue debated in the other place was that, in the handbook, there is a
greater degree of information that is not available in the constitution
itself. If one were to open the &#147;Handbook to the NHS
Constitution&#148; at random, one might
read:</div><a name="09061771000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;you
have the right to make choices about your NHS care and to information
to support these choices. The options available to you will develop
over time and depend on your individual
needs.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
when one looks at the explanation of what that means, a number of
persons are excluded&#151;for example, those detained under the
Mental Health Act 1983, military personnel and prisoners. A number of
services are also excluded. For some reason, maternity services are
excluded, which is quite alarming, as are mental health services. That
will be of concern to a number of people who may already have issues
with the mental health services that they receive. That is a
contentious area where service users sometimes have a different
perception from health professionals regarding what treatment they
might benefit from. I certainly support the amendment, because it seems
that the handbook will be revised, and it would be much more useful if
it were referred to in the
legislation.</div><a name="09061771000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000420"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> Amendment 3 would oblige those bodies that must
have regard to the NHS constitution to also have regard to the handbook
and the statement of accountability. The hon. Member for Eddisbury has
indicated that he wants to know why one is in the Bill and the
other is
not.</div><a name="09061771000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may help if I set out the purpose and intentions behind the handbook
and the statement of accountability. The handbook is an explanatory
guide designed for patients, members of the public and members of NHS
staff. As the words in the constitution are necessarily at a high
level, the handbook outlines in practice what each right, pledge and
responsibility in the constitution means. In a sense, it is a
description. That intent is clear in the introduction to the handbook,
which
states:</div><a name="09061771000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;this
Handbook is designed to give NHS staff and patients all the information
they need about the NHS Constitution for
England.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
handbook is not an instruction manual or guidance for the NHS. It does
not create any new policy or law; it merely describes what currently
exists; and it does not contain guidelines to which people must have
regard. The handbook does not ask anything fundamentally different of
NHS organisations. It merely sets out policy and law with which
organisations should already be
familiar.</div><a name="09061771000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, it would be inappropriate to impose a duty for bodies to
have regard to a patient and staff-facing explanatory guide. It is just
a document for members of the public to glance at in order to get some
idea of what the constitution means in practice, and no more. We would
be somewhat concerned if some sort of legal effect were given to a
handbook that can be rewritten from time to time.</div>
<a name="09061771000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
imposing a duty to have regard to the handbook would create a case for
a more formal process for updating it, such as a requirement to consult
on any revisions, which might merely reflect current departmental
policy or law. Strengthening the legal status of the handbook would
make it a much less helpful guide for patients, the public and staff,
as the process of making 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>minor or primarily technical amendments to it would become bureaucratic
and time-consuming, potentially requiring extensive consultation.
Essentially, what we are looking for in the handbook is something that
can be amended whenever it needs to be and that will not have any legal
force, but will just help the patient or NHS member of staff know what
the constitution, to which bodies must have regard, is all
about.</div>
<a name="09061771000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statement
of NHS accountability, on the other hand, was published alongside the
constitution on 21 January as a response to last year&#146;s
consultation, in which we heard that patients and the public would find
it helpful to know the system of responsibility and accountability for
taking decisions in the NHS. We believe that it is vital that the
public know how the NHS is accountable at a local level and how they
can get involved. The statement of accountability is also a
public-facing document and explains roles, responsibilities and
accountability in the NHS. It is a short summary of the current
structure and functions of the NHS in England. There would be little
value in requiring NHS bodies to have regard to a factual document
detailing the structure of the
NHS.</div><a name="09061771000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that reason, although it is permissible to refer to the documents in
regulation, we do not want them to have any statutory force, be
referred to during court cases or add a large amount of documentation
to an NHS constitution that we want to be fairly straightforward.
People will require some explanation. They will ask, &#147;What does
this mean?&#148; or &#147;What does this sentence in the
constitution mean?&#148; Therefore, we want to provide a handbook,
but we do not want to give it a lot more weight than it needs. Giving
it that extra weight would add complications, and the courts might then
start to take a keener interest in it than we want them to. It is not
for judges or lawyers; it is for patients and members of
staff.</div><a name="09061771000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000421"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. He has
tried to explain why the handbook is effectively a subsidiary
operational document rather than a framework, strategic and standard
document. I am also grateful for the support of the hon. Member for
Romsey.</div>
<a name="09061771000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">One thing
that is easily recognised is that the Minister&#146;s explanation is
consonant with that of Lord Darzi, who said in his speech on the
provisions in the other place that the handbook is &#147;the
explanatory guide&#148;, which is exactly where the Minister arrived
in the end after saying that it was not guidance or guidelines, to be
used by patients, the public and staff. He went on to
say:</div><a name="09061771000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Similarly,
the Secretary of State has the power to make minor and technical
revisions to the handbook at any time in line with changes in
departmental policy or law.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House
of Lords, </i>26 February 2009; Vol. 708, c.
GC151.]</div><a name="09061771000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
had seen that reference by Lord Darzi, I was concerned that due to
changes to the law, there might have been a reference to say that that
had legal effect. The Minister confirmed the negative just
now&#151;it is not intended for the handbook to have legal effect.
The fact that we have had this exchange on the record is
helpful.</div><a name="09061771000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Darzi went on to
say:</div><a name="09061771000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
do not think that it would be proportionate to have to consult on such
changes, and I think that most noble Lords agree. However, any
significant changes to policy or law that affect the handbook are in
themselves likely to trigger consultation
requirements.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,
</i>26 February 2009; Vol. 708, c. GC155.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="09061771000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patently, he must have
had in his mind that consequential changes would come into the handbook
as a result of changes to the law. I wanted to make sure that, given
the way that it has been expressed in the other place, we do not have
any confusion in the record that could have any potential legal effect.
Unless I misinterpreted the Minister&#151;I think that I have
understood him accurately&#151;it does not currently have legal
effect and is not intended to do so. He has not intervened to correct
me, and so, for the record, that has been cleared up. Therefore, I do
not need to press the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000424"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Amendment 164 was tabled by the Liberal
Democrats. I will make my few points before the hon. Member for Romsey
catches your eye, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Amendment 7 would put
the NHS board as the first body that must have regard to the
constitution. It seems wise that the NHS as a whole should adopt the
constitution, rather than simply the bodies listed.</div>
<a name="09061771000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will be aware that Conservative Members favour the incorporation of an
independent NHS board&#151;incidentally, the Prime Minister also
favoured that precise option when he was on the campaign trial for the
Labour leadership just a couple of years ago. That approach would
remove politicians from responsibility for the day-to-day running of
the NHS, which, over the past 11 years, has inevitably led to many
accusations of day-to-day politically inspired meddling, which we
believe have stuck. The amendment is clearly consistent with the
approach that we have taken to the architectural structure of the NHS,
which we have published, and we very much hope to have a legislative
opportunity to deliver that. There may be a need for the Minister to
examine whether the bodies listed do not include something that
encompasses the whole of the
NHS.</div><a name="09061771000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the phrase is &#147;NHS services and those who are contracted to
it&#148;&#151;we will deal with the question of contracted persons
and subcontractors shortly&#151;there is a question that the Minister
touched on in discussing a previous group of amendments in relation to
how that flows through to the sense of obligation and behaviour of NHS
employees and the expectations and requirements of their conditions and
terms of employment. The Minister has said that although he sees the
NHS constitution as binding on institutional bodies, he does not see it
as binding on individual employees. We need to be clear that there is a
flow-through that is capable of affecting the way in which individuals
in the NHS 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>behave, which will help the delivery of the constitution. Those bodies
will therefore not be let down because their employees do not work
within that spirit, let alone to the letter. Amendment 7 explores that
area.</div><a name="09061771000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="09061771000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
8 would&#151;importantly, I think&#151;add the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence to the bodies that must have regard
to the constitution. The amendment is an opportunity to explore the
Government&#146;s rationale for the list of bodies. None of the
Department&#146;s arm&#146;s-length bodies are on the list, even
though many of them have a huge impact on what NHS services are
delivered to patients, and all of us know from our postbags know that
none has a bigger influence than
NICE.</div><a name="09061771000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#163;195 million price tag on the NHS constitution is due to its
impact
on</div><a name="09061771000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;improving
the timeliness of NICE guidance and increased uptake of NICE approved
drugs&#148;,</div>
<a name="09061771000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">according to the impact
assessment. Can the Minister explain how the constitution will deliver
the assumed uptake of NICE-approved drugs and how the costings have
been made? If that information is not to hand, I hope that he will give
a commitment to make it available to all members of the Committee, so
that we can return to the matter if we have an opportunity to do
so.</div>
<a name="09061771000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
be interesting to know whether the parameters that NICE uses to make
its cost-benefit assessments are compliant with the NHS core
principles. As the Committee will know, the Government have
consistently refused to published the so-called quality assisted life
years formula, so there can be no independent corroboration of the
assurance that I am about to seek from the Minister, but can he tell
the Committee to what extent the QALY formula conforms to the
principles set out in the NHS constitution? He will be under no
misapprehension as to why that is a serious and important
question.</div>
<a name="09061771000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liberal
Democrat amendment 164 adds children&#146;s trusts, Sure Start and
some other organisations to the list. I am grateful to the hon. Member
for Romsey for picking up on a point raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller) on Second Reading. If
the Department has neglected its own arm&#146;s length bodies in
relation to the constitution, as I described in relation to amendment
8, it is little surprise that it has neglected bodies that are overseen
by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. What evidence can
the Minister provide that his Department sought to break out of the
silo of its departmental responsibilities, and that the Government
really have looked across all Departments to make sure that the policy
is not hindered by having a single departmental
viewpoint?</div><a name="09061771000058"></a>

<a name="09061771000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
107 and 108 widen the remits. The point about arm&#146;s length
bodies is valid, because many organisations within the NHS that do not
have direct patient contact are or should be responsible for driving
forward quite a bit of change. We could perhaps include 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>a body such as the National Patient Safety Agency.
It is not clear how such organisations fit into the wider picture. Some
clarification would be
useful.</div><a name="09061771000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Eddisbury is quite correct: I was taken by the remarks

said:</div><a name="09061771000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill establishes
children&#146;s trusts as statutory bodies that have an important, if
not vital, role to play in the commissioning of services, including NHS
services, for children in local
communities.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 8 June 2009; Vol.

see the difference between a primary care trust and a children&#146;s
trust in that role, if they are both commissioning NHS services. The
Minister made much earlier of the fact that there was almost a
catch-all, because the PCTs would be commissioning services and those
services would effectively be covered by the constitution. By
extension, therefore, one could argue that services commissioned by a
children&#146;s trust would not be covered by the constitution. I
find that slightly alarming. It could be that we are not doing as well
for our children as we could.</div>

centres, although they do not commission services, have been a key part
of delivering services to children, many of which are public
health-related. I struggle to see why NHS trusts, which provide
services, must have regard to the constitution, but Sure Start does not
seem to have to. I am also unclear where organisations or
establishments such as independent sector treatment centres fit.
Clearly, they are delivering treatments paid for by the NHS, albeit
under an independent banner, so it seems somewhat perverse that,
apparently, they do not have to have regard to the
constitution.</div>
<a name="09061771000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are designed to tease out a little more of the thinking and
to seek reassurance that there are no parts of the health delivery
service, or even the more strategic parts of the health service, that
are falling through the
gaps.</div><a name="09061771000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000426"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The amendments are interesting, and they do
probe whether the NHS constitution reaches the parts that other
constitutions do not reach. Amendments 7, 8 and 164 would
place a duty on something called the NHS board, NICE, the
children&#146;s trusts, Sure Start centres and other organisations
providing NHS
services.</div><a name="09061771000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
first to the point about the obligations of NHS employees. I hoped that
I had made this clear, but let me reiterate. An NHS employee does not
have any new legal obligations as a result of the constitution. Boards
will be in a position where they are required to comply with the
constitution: they will have to have regard to it. An NHS employee will
have the duties of an employee of an NHS trust or board, or whatever
the organisation in the NHS is. As part of their contract of
employment, they will have to deliver what they are obliged to do under
that contract, but they do not, as individuals, acquire any new legal
obligation under the constitution themselves. The board will and they
are employees, therefore the board will have an obligation to ensure
that they deliver the constitution. Were they to fail to do so, they
would be dealt with in the normal manner as employees. It does not
impose an additional duty on employees that does not exist today. I
hope that makes the position very clear.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="09061771000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to
amendment 7, I need to point out that there is no such thing as an NHS
board, so there is therefore no point in referencing one in the
legislation. However, I understand that in their policy document the
Conservative party have the objective of creating such an NHS board.
They are getting a bit presumptuous&#151;they think they are going to
win the next general election. I say wait for the electorate&#146;s
opinion before proposing amendments that are supposed to take effect
after the election. I suspect that the hon. Member for Eddisbury may
find that the electorate will make their own mind up and he should not
try to jump ahead. Let me be clear that I do not think that the
amendment and that reference to the NHS board is
necessary.</div><a name="09061771000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not want to have a broader, longer debate about greater operational
independence for the NHS. Suffice it to say, however, that I do not
agree that the NHS should be completely removed from any meaningful,
democratic control. The NHS is responsible for spending more than
&#163;100 billion of taxpayers&#146; money every year. As long as
policy and spending decisions are taken by democratically elected
Ministers who are accountable to Parliament, there will be an
obligation to subject their decisions to proper scrutiny. We believe
that there must be a continuous thread of accountability through the
system to the Government of the day and, through them, to
Parliament.</div><a name="09061771000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
NHS needs a period of stability. We do not believe that now is the
right time to impose further top-down changes to its structure. It is
more important that there should always be clarity and transparency in
the accountability of the NHS. The statement of NHS accountability
published alongside the constitution will help to achieve
that.</div><a name="09061771000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
of that is to say that the Government are in favour of centralising
power in Whitehall. We have consistently demonstrated our commitment to
a  more devolved system: for example, through the establishment
of NHS foundation trusts, through devolving commissioning
responsibilities to PCTs and GP practices, and by looking at ways to
put more control in the hands of patients, which we will discuss later
under the proposals on direct
payments.</div><a name="09061771000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
8 is unnecessary because NICE is already included. It is a special
health authority and is therefore captured in subsection (2)(d). Our
aim is to ensure that all organisations that are part of the NHS are
obliged to take proper account of the NHS constitution. NICE will have
that obligation. A number of special health authorities will be
covered, including the National Patient Safety Agency, the NHS Blood
and Transplant organisation and the NHS Litigation
Authority.</div><a name="09061771000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right to NICE-approved drugs articulates the existing legal duty on the
NHS to provide such drugs when clinically appropriate. NICE will
therefore be obliged to have regard to the constitution. NICE will also
be obliged to ensure that QALYs, where they are used, are in compliance
with the
constitution.</div><a name="09061771000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to amendment 164, I am aware that the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children
and Learning Bill requires local authorities to establish
children&#146;s trust boards. I assume that the hon. Member for
Romsey was referring to those bodies, rather than to children&#146;s
trusts. I assure her that we at the Department of Health are working 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>closely with colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and
Families to make children&#146;s trust boards a
success.</div><a name="09061771000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady&#146;s interpretation of children&#146;s trust boards is
incorrect. Although they will become a statutory entity, subject to the
approval of Parliament, they will be strategic bodies. Their only
functions will be to prepare, publish, review and revise local children
and young people&#146;s plans and to monitor their implementation.
They will not be involved in their delivery, which she suggested we
should have regard to. Children&#146;s trust boards will not hold
budgets for commissioning, nor will they provide services, so it would
not be appropriate to place them under a legal obligation to have
regard to the NHS
constitution.</div><a name="09061771000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sure
Start children&#146;s centres will also be given a specific statutory
basis through the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill.
However, like children&#146;s trust boards, they will not be
providers or commissioners of health services. It is important to be
clear that children&#146;s centres, as provided for in that Bill, are
places where services are provided by a range of organisations. They
are not bodies with an identity or functions separate from the
organisations that provide those services. A legal duty will therefore
not be placed on children&#146;s
centres.</div><a name="09061771000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is the responsibility of the relevant local authority and its statutory
partners, including primary care trusts, to ensure that
children&#146;s centres provide integrated services for young people
and their parents. Of course, all providers of children&#146;s NHS
services, and primary care trusts as commissioners of children&#146;s
NHS services, are captured by clause 2. When a service is delivered by
or for the NHS, it will be captured. However, organisations such as
children&#146;s trust boards and children&#146;s centres are not to
be subject to the constitution because they are not part of the
NHS.</div><a name="09061771000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
let me make it clear that clause 2 already captures any other
organisations providing NHS services, either directly or through the
commissioning functions of the NHS bodies listed in clause 2. I hope
that hon. Members agree with me that in the absence of an NHS
board&#151;for the time being or otherwise&#151;there is no need
for amendment 7; that NICE is already captured by the clause and a duty
on children&#146;s trust boards and Sure Start children&#146;s
centres would be inappropriate. So I hope that they will withdraw their
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000388"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000427"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I said at the outset that I was hoping to
tease a number of things out of the Minister, and tease I certainly
did. I slightly regret amendment 7 now, on the basis that it gave rise
to an unsolicited party political broadcast on behalf of the Labour
party, which I will not respond to because it would detain us too long,
as I would like to have challenged almost every sentence. That said, I
was only seeking to be helpful. It might be a very efficient way of
providing the means to put an NHS board in place, should the
contingency arise. We have had an opportunity to air that and I have no
difficulty in begging to ask leave to withdraw amendment 7.</div>
<a name="09061771000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to amendment 8, it was important to make sure that we understood that
the special health authorities encompass the National Patient Safety
Agency, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>the NHS Blood and Transplant organisation and the NHS Litigation
Authority, as well as NICE. I do not think that the Minister said that
was the exclusive list. I assume he read those out as examples. It
might be helpful to make a list
available.</div><a name="09061771000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000428"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> For the record, yes that is
correct.</div><a name="09061771000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000429"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister because it could be
helpful to the Committee. I do not need to press this to a vote but it
has helped to make sure there is clarity as to why those particular
categories have been used in the Bill. It would be useful to have a
list of the current special health authorities to know where we start
and to have a baseline of information for the future. When anyone
invents any other new bodies&#151;NHS boards or otherwise&#151;they
will have to consider when drafting whether it is a special health
authority or not.</div>
<a name="09061771000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will wait
to see whether the hon. Member for Romsey wishes to press amendment
164, but it was helpful to have that discussion. It was fascinating to
hear the Minister say that the Government do not believe in any further
top-down processes in the NHS, knowing that we are also totally against
further unnecessary organisational change. It looks as though the NHS
can take some comfort if those words are to be believed, and I regard
him as someone who does not use his words lightly.</div>
<a name="09061771000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
importantly, it is clear, at least from the Department of
Health&#146;s perspective, that the bodies referred to, such as the
children&#146;s trust bodies and Sure Start, are non-commissioning,
non-provider bodies and are therefore strategic in nature rather than
those that need to be brought within the ambit. It might be helpful to
ensure a bit more cross-departmental discussion. My hon. Friend the
Member for Basingstoke, with responsibilities relating to another
Department, had been led to believe that there were to be some
commissioning processes from these children&#146;s trust bodies. She
raised the point on Second Reading because she had been given the
impression that that was to be the case. As they would have some
commissioning responsibility they would potentially be in the place of
a PCT with regard to some health services for children. As long as
there is absolute clarity we do not need to bring them within the
ambit. If there is no clarity, the Minister might want to reflect on
that. In the light of those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the amendment, and I am happy if the Liberal Democrat spokesman does
not press her
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000445"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 10, in clause 2,
page 2, line 25, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5A) Each person
who is sub-contracted by persons in sub-contracting arrangements under
section (5) must, in delivering that contract, have regard to the NHS
Constitution.&#146;.</div><a name="09061771000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment to investigate how far down the food chain the
NHS constitution bites. In the Bill, any private or third sector
organisation which contracts with the NHS must have regard to the
constitution. Likewise, any body which they subcontract
to</div><a name="09061771000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
or assist in
providing&#148;</div><a name="09061771000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">must
also have such regard. The amendment would require that any body
subcontracted by a subcontractor would also have to have regard to the
constitution. Amendments could be tabled to deliver a body
subcontracted by a subcontractor&#146;s subcontractor and so on, like
Russian dolls ad infinitum, ad
absurdum.</div><a name="09061771000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify how many
iterations of subcontraction the provision affects. I assume that the
main contractor takes an obligation to bind all those who are suppliers
in a contractual chain&#151;that the intention is to bind everyone to
have regard to the constitution. I will leave him to have fun with the
legal niceties of that
one.</div><a name="09061771000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister also clarify the wording</div>
<a name="09061771000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide or
assist in
providing&#148;?</div><a name="09061771000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">What,
in terms of law, does it mean? Does it include a subcontractor named on
the contract? Does it apply to every contractual relationship the
contractor holds, whether it pertains to the NHS contract or not? I am
not talking about common sense but about the force of the statute. For
example, if a cleaning contractor fails to have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>regard to the principles because their paper supplier fails to deliver,
can the NHS constitution be brought to bite on the paper
supplier?</div><a name="09061771000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise from our earlier discussion that the clause is not intended
to lead to new courses of action, but, when the Minister described the
intended effect of the constitution on all those who supply services,
he said that it was intended to bite. Indeed, that was precisely the
word that the noble Lord Darzi used throughout his defence in the other
place of the drafting of the Bill. If we are not talking about direct
legal courses of action, we need to understand what is meant by
&#147;bite&#148;, and how far it goes down the
chain.</div><a name="09061771000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister also provide some examples of joint contracting under
subsection (8)? The fact that that provision is in the Bill seems to
betoken that it has been thought through, because there must be a
particular concern, opportunity or even mischief in mind. Furthermore,
will the duty &#147;to have regard&#148; be inserted in all
contracts that the NHS has with its contractors? Will the NHS mandate
the insertion of the duty in all its contractors&#146; contracts? To
some degree, that is the same point as the first
one.</div><a name="09061771000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
issue that often comes up is that private sector providers to the NHS
feel they cannot compete with, for example, the public sector pension
fund, which makes the attraction and retention of staff difficult. I am
yet to be convinced of that argument. I believe that the flexibility of
the private sector usually allows it to suffer the differential on VAT
happily, because its efficiencies amply recompense it for such
difficulties. The question is whether the staff of private and third
sector providers would have grounds to claim against their employer,
using the constitutional right to the fair pay and contracts framework.
Furthermore, will contractees have to warn the contractor of this duty
before entering into a contract, or will they operate a tick-box
exercise on the paper trail afterwards to show that they were
&#147;having regard to&#148;, as we discussed earlier? We must also
consider the argument of justiciability, and whether it should be
inserted into contracts. What assessment has the Minister made of
whether that will become a justiciable area in contract law? If the
contractor fulfils his contract but fails to have regard to the
constitution, is that now, or might it become, a ground for termination
or some other form of contractual
remedy?</div><a name="09061771000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next point was raised earlier by the hon. Member for Romsey and then
picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead,
particularly when he spoke about air ambulances. We need to cast our
minds to clause 3(7), which raises the interesting question of the
position of volunteers within the contracting and subcontracting
organisations&#151;and, indeed, within the NHS itself. I do not want
to teach the Minister grammar or how to suck eggs, but he will be aware
that there is no contractual basis for enforcement between two parties
intending to create a legal relationship, if there is a failure of
consideration for money or money&#146;s worth.</div>
<a name="09061771000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
volunteers, there is by definition an absence of money or
money&#146;s worth. One could argue that some sort of time element
might be of value, but the fact is that the time is given voluntarily
and without the expectation of reward or compensation, which means that
there is an absence of consideration. There is the question of whether
it might be misleading to encompass volunteers within the term
&#147;staff&#148;, which is how the Bill is currently 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>drafted. If so, there can be no ability to enforce&#151;or, if that is
too strong a word, to lay up the expectation that they should have had
regard to the constitution. The last thing that we want to do is to
create perverse incentives on volunteering, and I dare say that the
Minister entirely shares that sentiment. I am sure that in all our
constituencies we can find great examples of volunteers helping
hospitals and other NHS
facilities.</div><a name="09061771000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment brings to light a further possible illogicality. It seems
that foundation trusts are bound to have regard to the constitution
only in respect of their NHS patients and not their private patients.
To a  degree, we have already discussed that matter. However,
many people receive dental services under contractual arrangements made
through general dental service  contracts. Although the dentist
will be a contractor under subsection (4), or possibly
subsection (5), and thus be covered by the duty, patients increasingly
pay for their services through Denplan. A private patient in hospital
is not covered by the constitution, whereas a private patient in a
dentist&#146;s surgery is.</div>
<a name="09061771000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make no
argument for both or either, but the legislation should be consistent.
Given the multiplicity of ways in which all of us, as citizens of the
devolved countries of the United Kingdom, can gain access to primary
care and other health services, we should have thought the matter
through in a careful and detailed way with specific examples. I hope
that the Minister understands the thinking that lies behind the
amendment and that he will take the opportunity to assure us that these
things have been thought through and are going to
work.</div>

Andy Slaughter</b> (Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush) (Lab):
On subcontractors, I wonder whether my right hon. and learned Friend
can help me on the issue of telephone services. I know that the issue
is fresh in his mind, because during the short adjournment he was
engaged with one of my constituents, Mr. David Hickson, who
is involved in an assiduous campaign against the use of 084 numbers. I
will ask my question in two parts. First, is there any conflict between
what the constitution states in relation to services being provided
free of charge and the profit that is made either by NHS institutions
or by the private providers of telephone numbers? Secondly, given that
the widespread consultation, which may of course resolve the issue
depending on the Department&#146;s response, concluded on 31 March
2009, when does he expect the response to it? It highlights
considerable disquiet about the use of 084 numbers in relation to NHS
services.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000448"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> My hon. Friend tempts me down the line of
discussing 0845 numbers, 084 numbers and a number of other numbers. We
could debate the issues at some length, but he is right to say that a
consultation has been completed. We will shortly announce the outcome,
but I do not have the date for that announcement. I hope to look at the
issue in some detail in the near future, and I hope that we will then
be able to announce how we intend to pursue
it.</div><a name="09061771000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to recognise that there are a number of areas in the NHS
where organisations have the ability to not only provide services, but
to jointly fund them through patients&#146; contributions; I gave the
obvious example of prescription charges earlier. That is allowed within
the terms of the constitution. Particular problems arise on telephone
numbers, however, which I want to look at with a great deal of care. As
my hon. Friend has said, a considerable degree of concern has been
expressed by patients about the way in which certain premiums have been
charged in relation to such numbers. If he bears with us, I hope that
we will be able to deal with the issue at greater
length.</div><a name="09061771000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000449"></a>Mr.
Slaughter:</b> I thank the Minister for that. It would be
helpful to know when he has an indication of when we can expect a
departmental response to the consultation. By mentioning prescription
charges, he tempts me to push the point on the constitution, which
clearly
notes</div><a name="09061771000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
right to receive NHS services free of charge, apart from certain
limited
exceptions&#148;.</div><a name="09061771000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prescription
charges are a clear example of that, but, as far as my constituents and
I are aware, telephone services are not. Does he therefore agree that
that inconsistency would be best addressed by not allowing the use of
084 numbers within the health
service?</div><a name="09061771000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000450"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have heard the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point, but he is straying a little far from the terms of the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000451"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> My hon. Friend is tempting me not only to stray
from the amendment, but also to pre-brief people on the outcome of a
consultation, which ought to be dealt with in a more appropriate way
and announced at a more appropriate time. If he will forgive
me,  I will duck the question, valid as it is, and turn to
amendment
10.</div><a name="09061771000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we go, as the hon. Member for Eddisbury has described it, ad nauseam
through the various ranks of subcontractors, it becomes, to use another
legal term, somewhat otiose as to whether the constitution applies; it
will at some stage become a matter for contract as to whether it does
or not. To put volunteers&#146; minds at rest, where there is no
contractual liability, tortious liability may arise, but that duty is
normally imposed not on the individual volunteer, but on the trust
itself. No new duty will arise that does not already exist in relation
to volunteers. He is quite right that volunteers do an enormously
important job for the NHS and, as a result of that, we do not wish to
impose any new burden on them. In our view, the provision will not do
so.</div><a name="09061771000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bodies
under a duty to have regard to the constitution must have regard to it
when performing their commissioning functions. Therefore, whenever they
contract with the NHS from a non-NHS organisation, we propose that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>they will be legally obliged to ensure that the organisation acts in
compliance with the constitution when providing services. We have
chosen a deliberately broad approach to the duty to have regard to the
constitution in order to avoid contracting being a way of getting
around that duty. We want all those connected with the provision,
regulation or commissioning of health services to have regard to the
constitution and to uphold the values and ethos of the
NHS.</div><a name="09061771000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the example given of the provision of paper supplies, the
provision of NHS supplies will potentially bring into effect, as far as
the person purchasing them is concerned, the NHS constitution, if they
are otherwise covered by it. If someone is merely supplying a product
from the private sector, they are not otherwise bound by the NHS
constitution. As I have indicated, there are no new causes of action.
When the hon. Gentleman asks &#147;where does it bite?&#148;, it
bites where it bites already, but with a tiny bit of extra
energy&#151;no more than that. I do not want to be too deliberately
opaque, but the aim, as I have said, is not to create a new cause of
action.</div><a name="09061771000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as employees, fair pay and contractual obligations are concerned,
we are not creating any new way in which negotiations on pay can be
conducted. There is no new legal obligation. As far as subcontractors,
and subcontractors of subcontractors, are concerned, it is entirely a
matter for them to delineate in terms of their contracts. If they wish
to take a particular view, that is a matter for them. The constitution
imposes no new obligation on
them.</div><a name="09061771000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000452"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b>: I take the point about the volunteers and
the duty of care under tortious liability, which is one that would
always focus on an institution more quickly than it would on particular
individuals, subject to an individual having an express or ostensible
authority to commit a particular body in relation to its actions, which
would be unusual. It would be pretty unusual for it to be given to a
volunteer, although not impossible. I am happy to accept the
reassurance on that, as indeed I was on fair
pay.</div><a name="09061771000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as the paper suppliers example is concerned, what one needs to note
rather than press is if the NHS employee&#151;who is part of the
process, whoever the employer body is within the NHS&#151;has to have
regard to the constitution, it is possible that through various
contracting arrangements they might seek to impose conditions on the
supplier to ensure that they themselves can conform to the expectations
under the constitution. They can therefore help to
demonstrate&#151;perhaps through an audited paper trail that I
suspect they will want to keep&#151;that they have indeed had regard
to the constitution and that they feel that they have complied with it.
That is a possible way that the procurement contracts will flow
through. I suspect that we will have to wait and see. That might be an
actual example of the bite with a bit more energy rather than a greater
cutting power, if one wants to take the analogy far too
far.</div><a name="09061771000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the broad point made by the Minister on subcontractors, I can see
that there is an intent, which I think that I am satisfied with. The
approach taken to contractors, subcontractors and the chain of
contracted supply is effectively intended to be an anti-avoidance
measure, so that people cannot avoid having to have regard to the
constitution. There is a genesis at the top 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>of the chain&#151;someone who will be covered and intends to be
covered by the Bill, once it is enacted. Following those reassurances,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09061771000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000453"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 9, in
clause 2, page 2, line 41, after

and&#146;.</div><a name="09061771000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that this matter will detain us for long. The amendment
would clarify the ambit of NHS services by including</div>
<a name="09061771000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;paid for out of
public
funds&#148;</div><a name="09061771000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
the definition. That seems a much neater way of demarcating NHS
services than the Bill&#146;s entanglement with specific enactments,
an issue which we covered earlier. I hope that the Minister will, of
course, continue to support health care paid for out of public funds.
As we have discussed, we have concerns about some of the issues where
the core principles have been taken away from what was proposed by the
Government. The Minister has sought to assure us that that is because
those values are represented elsewhere. As he knows, we have not taken
that to the nth degree, but there is still a concern. He might want to
reflect on whether that particular area will need further discussion
among the new ministerial
team.</div><a name="09061771000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000454"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Section 1 of the NHS Act 2006, to which the
clause refers, makes it absolutely clear that NHS services must be
entirely free of charge subject to the conditions in relation to, for
example, a contribution where prescription charges are involved. I do
not see any need to repeat section 1 of the NHS Act 2006
now.</div><a name="09061771000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman may be concerned that the Government no longer believe
that public funds should be devoted to NHS patients. That is not the
case, as  I explained in my responses to previous amendments. I
will not repeat my points here. It is the case that NHS funds will be
applied to NHS patients. That is the objective, the aim and the way in
which we wish to proceed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000455"></a>Mr.

was my concern that we would end up with a chain of legislative

concerned that we would end up with a series of pieces of legislation
that would contain the phrase &#147;any enactment&#148; and then
&#147;under an enactment&#148;. My point is that one has the grave
danger of never specifying where the chain of legislative line follows.
I shall not press the amendment to a Division, but the point has been
made that we should be careful not simply to rely on the phrase
&#147;any enactment&#148; or &#147;enactments&#148;, because it

Gidley:</b> These are a couple of simple amendments to try to
further the debate on Second Reading about the availability of the
constitution for those who may have some sort of disability. I am
particularly mindful of people with a visual impairment. I perhaps
should declare some sort of interest here. My husband is registered
blind, so I am acutely aware of some of the difficulties faced by
people in trying to access information. The Minister could argue that
the issue is covered by equality legislation anyway and that existing
legislation should ensure that the information is made available.
However, the facts do not bear that
out.</div><a name="09061771000390"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09061771000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research
undertaken by the Royal National Institute of Blind People shows that a
large percentage of patients did not receive information in an
appropriate format. In many cases, that information might have been
available with a little thought, but nobody thought to provide
something usable. The statistics are stark. The group that came out
best was community pharmacists&#151;I probably ought to declare
another interest&#151;although information about prescriptions came
out worst, so the picture is slightly mixed. In urgent care, perhaps
nobody minds too much if the information is not readily available in an
accessible
format.</div><a name="09061771000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the interest in health and the drive towards self-care, on which the
Government seem keen, it is more important than ever that information
is available. If we start with the constitution by including access to
information in accessible formats in the Bill, it will help to drive
improvements in all other areas of the health service. The Minister
could also argue that the Equality Bill, which is going through
Parliament at the moment, might be a more appropriate place for such
provisions, but people who work in the health service take far more
notice of legislation in a health Bill. Given the failure to put
existing legislation into practice, that is another reason for putting
the measures in this Bill. In a letter to Lord Low, the
Solicitor-General
said:</div><a name="09061771000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are not persuaded of the case for making specific reference to the
provision of information in alternative formats on the face of the
legislation&#148;</div>
<a name="09061771000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;a reference to
the Equality Bill.</div>
<a name="09061771000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is a simple amendment that should not need to be included in the Bill,
but the evidence is overwhelming that we must do something, as the
provision for an increasing group of people is inadequate. Given our
ageing population, many of whom have eyesight problems, such an
amendment is even more important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="09061771000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000459"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I can see where the hon. Lady derived the
impetus for the amendments, and I agree with the principle behind them.
It is certainly right that every citizen, taxpayer and service user
should be able to access the constitution, the handbook and all the
other associated documentation and rules. I worry slightly that the
duty as drafted might apply only to people with more than one
disability, but presumably that was not her
intention.</div>
<a name="09061771000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am slightly
concerned that by its very inclusion&#151;I think that this is the
second point that the hon. Lady was seeking to make in the amendment
when she said that the equalities legislation will cover all such
issues&#151;the amendment would open up a divide in the public
discourse between patients, staff and members of the public and people
with disabilities, which is something that we have all been seeking to
combat for years. I am not suggesting that that was the hon.
Lady&#146;s intention, but we need to be careful lest we create
separate categories. All patients are patients, and some of them, I
accept, have disabilities. The same goes for staff and members of the
public. As long as we are clear that there is no such intent, as I am
sure is the case, we are allied in backing the spirit of the
amendments.</div>
<a name="09061771000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000460"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I begin by reassuring the hon. Member for
Romsey that the constitution and the handbook will be, and are, readily
accessible to  patients, public and staff. The constitution is
available in a number of alternative formats in addition to
translations in 11 languages. It is available in Braille, large print
and audio format, and there is an easy-to-read version that can be used
by children and those with learning disabilities. The handbook is
available in Braille to those who request it. Those formats are
available through the internet, over the phone and by post. NHS bodies
have also accessed the hard copies of the document, and are being
supported by the Department of Health in promoting the constitution
locally. We fully intend to keep the formats, so there is no need to
put that in the Bill. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 already
requires public authorities to take reasonable steps to provide
disabled people with an auxiliary aid if that would facilitate the
receiving of any benefits. I believe that further duties are
unnecessary.</div><a name="09061771000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that the hon. Lady reasonably makes is that we may have
legislation, but it is not always delivered in practice. I accept that,
but the original legislation must be enforced rather than compounding
the problem by saying that it was not always enforced when it should
have been under the 1995 Act, so we will repeat it. That does not
resolve the issue. The way to resolve it if the law is not being
complied with&#151;this does not seem to be the case&#151;is to
enforce the existing law. We should not pretend that we can do
something just by repeating the same effect in new
legislation.</div>
<a name="09061771000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Law making
and law enforcement are different, and the option of using the law
subsequently to ensure that organisations enforce previous legislation
is available to citizens and various representative organisations such
as RNIB. It is therefore right that they should use the existing
legislation and the new equalities legislation when appropriate to
ensure that the various pieces of information are available in the
necessary forms. Repeating it in subsequent legislation&#151;we could
do that in every piece of legislation&#151;is not the way forward. We
have generic legislation, and it should be used.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="09061771000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I submit that
the NHS constitution is available in the ways that the hon. Lady hopes,
and I hope that she accepts that we agree that it should be readily
available in the appropriate format for people who need it. I believe
that it and the handbook are available in those various
forms.</div><a name="09061771000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000461"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): Why will it be produced
in so few languages, when NHS Direct provides a translation service in
175 languages? I am not suggesting that the constitution should be
produced in 175 languages, but if NHS Direct is translating into so
many languages, the limited number in the provision will not be
suitable for the members of the population who need to read
it.</div><a name="09061771000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000462"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I will take that back to those who are
responsible for the matter, and tell them it was suggested in the
Committee that 11 languages are insufficient, and that 175 seem to be
necessary.</div><a name="09061771000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000463"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I want to clarify whether 11 is sufficient; 175
means that a ridiculous amount of taxpayers&#146; money is being
wasted by NHS
Direct.</div><a name="09061771000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000464"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Having advocated 175 languages, the hon.
Gentleman is now withdrawing that and saying that that number is
ridiculous. I am not sure where he is on this, but as far as I am
concerned we must try to make the NHS constitution readily available to
those who may need to access it. I will leave it to others to determine
how that ready availability should be determined. The hon. Member for
Romsey raised issues concerning people with visual impairment, and I am
anxious to ensure that they will have access to the NHS constitution in
an appropriate
form.</div><a name="09061771000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000465"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I am obviously pleased that the constitution is
available in many formats, and habitual users of Braille, which
requires a lot of training, will not have second thoughts about asking
for information in their format of choice. My concern is that those
whose eyesight has failed as they have grown older may not be used to
asking for information in an alternative format or even aware, in many
cases, that it is available. It is a bit of a cop-out to say,
&#147;Well, it&#146;s the DDA that&#146;s not working so
there&#146;s no point in putting it the Bill&#148;, because
reinforcing the DDA on numerous occasions may make that Act more
effective.</div><a name="09061771000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics show that a lot of patients are not given access to suitable
formats. The staff seem to be the missing links who, perhaps because
they do not have a disability, are probably not aware of the
difficulties faced by others in accessing information. I intend to
withdraw the amendment, but I think that there should be a little more
in the handbook aimed at staff to give them a responsibility to ensure
that information is provided in the format most useful to any
individual. That is on a slightly wider point than just the
constitution, but an early review of the handbook may be the best way
to address this matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000466"></a>Mr.

the handbook, and I will certainly give it due and full consideration.
Thanks to the wonders of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>modern technology I can add that there are 180 countries in the world,
and NHS Direct provides language interpreters rather than various
translations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000467"></a>Sandra

further with a new clause tabled later in the Bill, so, for the moment,
I am happy to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000468"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I want to clarify the situation regarding the
languages in which the document will be available and NHS
Direct&#146;s ability to use interpreters, especially for languages
as obscure as Cherokee, which the British taxpayer is paying for. We
are using interpreters in the UK to help people access the NHS

two O&#146;Briens and an O&#146;Hara in the room it is a blessed
relief that we are not speaking Irish or double-Irish. Amendment 11
would revise the constitution whenever the legislation underpinning it
changes in such a way as to bring legislation and the constitution into
contradiction. Earlier, I set out our commitment to the core principles
of the NHS as established in the NHS plan, which was the subject of
amendment 5. We will continue to seek to enshrine those principles in
legislation&#151;we had some enjoyable teasing out on amendment 7. I
believe that the Government intend to continue to believe in that too.
However, there is explanatory paraphernalia in the constitution itself,
and I am thinking particularly of  the responsibility under
section 2b which
runs:</div><a name="09061771000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
should keep appointments, or cancel within reasonable time. Receiving
treatment within the maximum waiting times may be compromised unless
you
do.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sound
stuff, leaving aside the somewhat Orwellian veiled threat that it seems
to encompass, or perhaps not, although it sounds commanding.</div>
<a name="09061771000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State has just taken up his post and promised a bonfire of the
targets. Given the enormous volume of regulations that have indeed been
introduced on this Government&#146;s watch, even if the bonfire is as
fierce as it was at Buncefield in the constituency of my hon. Friend
the Member for Hemel Hempstead, as extensive as the fire of London, or
even as destructive as the very fires of hell, I cannot see any of
those regulations being burnt to a sufficiently small number. So much
legislation seems to be being produced, not least by regulation, that I
hope that the Minister will confirm what will happen in the event that
the constitution ceases to be underpinned by legislation. It is
important that we have a backstop, which this amendment is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>intended to provide, in case there is a mismatch&#151;as one can
envisage happening quite easily&#151;between the legislative
underpinning and the constitution, even as amended, in the
overlapping Venn diagram, which I referred to
earlier.</div><a name="09061771000391"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000473"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Amendment 11 obliges the Secretary of State
to revise the constitution whenever its constituent parts seek to be
consistent with legislation. Let me reassure the Committee that it is
already our intention to revise the constitution if it ever becomes
inconsistent with the law or departmental policy. My noble Friend Lord
Darzi put that on record in the other place. I do not believe that a
new statutory requirement in the Bill is necessary. Indeed, I would say
that, because it is not necessary, putting it in would amount to
over-regulation. In fact, the amendment would inadvertently limit the
Department&#146;s flexibility and impose an overly bureaucratic
approach to how that was done. Indeed, on the face of it, this seems to
be an attempt from the Conservative Front Bench to ensure that we do a
little bit extra. It will impose extra bureaucracy on the NHS that we
just do not need. For example, there could be two changes in
legislation in short succession that affect the constitution. It would
clearly make sense, therefore, to deal with both of them together
rather than be forced, as this additional regulation would do, to
revise and republish the constitution twice over, with full
consultation each time.</div>
<a name="09061771000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, it
would be perverse to force the Government to make minor and purely
technical changes only a few months before a major 10-year overhaul of
the constitution, as required in the Bill. The more sensible approach
would be to make a clarification in the handbook, which is designed to
be easily updated. In principle, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective
is a reasonable one, but I do not believe that a duty in the Bill is
the right way to achieve it. I hope he will therefore feel that he can
withdraw the amendment, because he is fulfilling precisely that fault
that he criticises, which is over-regulation. This, indeed, if it was
passed, would be
over-regulation.</div><a name="09061771000174"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000474"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Be it never said, I hope, that I am in
favour of lots of regulation. Indeed, I am sufficiently enough of an
anorak to have produced three pamphlets on deregulation. I hope that,
as a result of the Minister&#146;s reassurance, the Committee will
recognise that there is an attempt to ensure that there is not an
unnecessary administrative burden, in an effort to have an almost
rolling update of the constitution. I can see that there is a need to
ensure that some de minimis rules apply, but at the same time it was
important to explore it to make sure that this will not fall foul of
anything becoming inconsonant with the legislative underpinning,
because that is&#151;if I can go all the way back to our first
discussion&#151;the ratio decidendi of the Minister, in saying that
this contains no new legal rights or causes of action. Therefore, it is
absolutely vital that however much we want to maintain a lack of extra
bureaucracy, the point is made. As he said, it was a reasonable point
and it is very important, because the underpinning of the constitution
and the way it is intended to operate is that we do not leave any gaps
between the legislative underpinning and the constitution. On that
basis, I am happy to withdraw the amendment. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="09061771000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000475"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I beg to move amendment 166, in
clause 3, page 3, line 4, leave
out subsection (2) and
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) A review of the
NHS Constitution shall be carried out on the anniversary of its first
year of operation by the Secretary of State and at least once in any
period if 10 years thereafter (referred to in this Chapter as a
&#147;10 year
review&#148;).&#146;.</div><a name="09061771000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is simple. It merely places a statutory requirement on the
Secretary of State to undertake a review of the NHS constitution one
year after its inception. Attempts were made in the other place to
secure an annual review, which we would concede is probably a little
onerous. However, a number of concerns have been raised about how
things will work in practice. In the other place, one of the
concessions was that local authorities should be consulted in any
review of the constitution. It seems fairly sensible to have a review a
year after the implementation date to ensure that we have done our job
properly and things have not slipped through the
net.</div><a name="09061771000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
groups have raised concerns and suggested that, despite the wide
consultation process on the constitution, they might like to make some
fairly small amendments. One example is the Proprietary Association of
Great Britain, which is responsible for the licensing and promotion of
medicines that can be bought over the counter. It would like to extend
the section on responsibilities, which includes the part that
says:</div><a name="09061771000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
should recognise that you can make a significant contribution to your
own, and your family&#146;s, good health...and take some
personal responsibility for
it.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
wants to beef that up by saying that health care can start with people
looking after and treating their families in the home; in many cases,
people can be responsible for preventing ill health, maintaining good
health and looking after members of their family with common illnesses
in the home. That is quite important because the constitution is very
heavy on staff responsibilities and patients&#146; rights and there
is a thinner section&#151;it might be too thin&#151;on the
responsibilities of patients. If they are to be true partners in
health, patients should accept more
responsibility.</div><a name="09061771000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
organisations may want some strengthening of existing provisions and,
if there was a review after one year, they could make their feelings
known. I would not want the process to be too long-winded or onerous,
but some things may not be working as well as intended. It therefore
seems sensible to have an early review and then to have a later review
at some stage during the  10 years. That is all that the
amendment is designed  to
do.</div><a name="09061771000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000476"></a>Mr.
Mike O&#146;Brien:</b> Amendment 166 would require the
Secretary of State to conduct a review of the NHS constitution one year
after it came into effect. The review would be additional to the
reviews already proposed to be conducted at least at intervals of 10
years and additional to any review occasioned by the need to alter the
constitution because of a statutory
change.</div><a name="09061771000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the hon. Member for Romsey wants to ensure that the
constitution remains appropriate and fit for purpose in a year&#146;s
time. However, the amendment is unnecessary. We consulted widely on the
draft constitution less than a year ago and we now have a document that
carries broad support. That was a very wide and a not inexpensive
consultation on the constitution. People would be surprised if one year
into it, the consultation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>was undertaken again, with great expenditure of time and effort by the
organisations involved. We need to be aware that people did engage very
seriously. It required a lot of effort from them. Putting that burden
on them again needs to be done with a reasonable amount of care. It is
not that it should not be done, but there needs to be a reasonable time
scale. We consulted very widely and the consultation specifically asked
whether legislation should require the Secretary of State to review the
constitution every 10 years. There was broad support for that proposal.
Very few responses suggested that the constitution should be reviewed
more regularly. Most respondents were simply concerned that the
constitution should be updated as it became
necessary.</div><a name="09061771000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can assure the hon. Lady that it is our full intention to ensure that
the constitution does not become out of date. The process in clause 4
for revising the constitution allows us to do that. Indeed, if it
becomes apparent that a fuller review is needed within the first year,
clause 3 is drafted to allow us to do that. I do not agree, however,
that we should mandate now an early review of the constitution and put
pressure on the various organisations to participate in another major
review. So I should like to reassure the Committee that the Government
fully intend to monitor the impact of the constitution on an ongoing
basis. The most meaningful way to do that is to collect data on a
regular basis rather than wait for the three-yearly report on the
impact of the constitution. That will allow us to see how the
constitution is taking effect on the ground and to act if
necessary.</div>
<a name="09061771000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked me about patient responsibilities. We listened carefully to last
year&#146;s consultation and the constitutional advisory
forum&#146;s view was that the balance of rights and responsibilities
was about right. The constitutional advisory forum recognised that we
need to be careful not to deter people from getting the services that
they needed. Feedback from NHS staff suggests that they are very
supportive of the patient responsibilities and they are the group most
likely to want to extend. I hope that reassures the hon. Lady and she
will withdraw her
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000477"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification. I am
reassured that if things are missed and there are problems there is a
mechanism for review. It may be that this would be unnecessary.
However, I am unclear about who would initiate such a review. Would it
be the Government responding to concerns raised by patients and the
public or is there some external
mechanism?</div><a name="09061771000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000478"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The Secretary of State would initiate and
undertake the review. The Secretary of State would need to make a
decision that circumstances required that to happen and that could
result from a change in the legislation. It could result from pressure
from various groups or it could result from a view that because there
had been a number of minor changes it was appropriate to begin the
consultation. So there are a number of circumstances in which the
Secretary of State could take the view that a new full round of
consultation needed to be undertaken rather than waiting for the
10-year period or just review the operation after three years. It is a
matter for the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09061771000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000479"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I am happy with that further clarification. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000480"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 12, in clause 3,
page 3, line 14, after &#145;(5)&#146;,
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(fa) Local
Involvement
Networks.&#146;.</div><a name="09061771000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
causes some grave concern and it may take us a tiny bit longer than the
previous couple of amendments. The amendment seeks to add to the list
of bodies that must be consulted about the NHS constitution on a
10-year review. Amendment 167 tabled a few days later by the Liberal
Democrats does exactly the same thing in exactly the same way. They
have added their names to this and will not be moving their separate
amendment. I thank them for their support. I find it sad that the
Government have consistently sought to undermine the patient voice. It
has been a 10-year journey almost to the day for me as part of my
experience of the House.</div>
<a name="09061771000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government decided to get rid of community health councils. That was
announced just a day before we rose for the summer recess in 2000, when
they published the NHS plan. Hidden away in the middle of the document
was a phrase stating that after consultation, the Government were going
to axe the CHCs for not being effective as advocates of the patient
voice and for a number of other reasons. They were pretty strident
criticisms of the CHCs. I think I am right in recalling that there were
107 of them, of which 4 had been criticised, and well over 100 were
regarded as being extremely important to the local
communities.</div><a name="09061771000392"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09061771000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was something of an outrage, because during Prime Minister&#146;s
Question Time, I challenged the then Prime Minister Tony Blair on the
matter. He said that the Government were certainly getting rid of them,
but of course, only as a result of a widespread consultation. It was
perfectly clear that they needed to be got rid of, and that was what
was supported. Within minutes, I received a handwritten, three-page,
&#147;Dear Stephen. Love, Tony&#148; letter, which was basically a
grovelling apology written quickly by someone called Alastair Campbell,
saying that the House had been completely misled House: there had been
no consultation whatsoever, and it was a complete misrepresentation in
the NHS plan
document.</div><a name="09061771000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
managed to get a stay of execution for a year. But as a result of that,
we discovered that the true motive that lay behind that was a real
concern on the part of the Government that if there was any ability to
have credible criticism of the NHS, it would be regarded as a personal
slight to the Labour party. Therefore, the Government replaced CHCs
with patient and public involvement forums. Then they found those to be
too outspoken as well, particularly through the Commission for Patient
and Public Involvement in Health, or CPPIH, commonly known as
&#147;chippy&#148;&#151;that seemed to be the way the Government
saw them. So the Government abolished those as well, and replaced them
with local involvement networks. We had quite a run-out on that during
the course of the Health and Social Care Bill just over a year ago. The
contempt in which the Government hold the patient voice was shown in
tagging the issue of local involvement networks on to another
portmanteau Bill&#151;the one about local
government.</div><a name="09061771000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason it is so important&#151;why I am making something of an issue
of it&#151;is because lately, the tragedy of Mid Staffordshire
hospital has been in part attributed to the cull of LINks, and the lack
of a strong local patient voice in holding trusts, NHS executives and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>ultimately Ministers to account. It is right that the LINks should be
able to comment on the constitution. They provide the most independent
and local voice on how Government policy is operating on the
ground.</div><a name="09061771000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
part of the Government&#146;s problem with CHCs was that they were
genuinely independent. The trouble with all the successor
bodies&#151;we have had many relevant debates in the House on a
number of Bills&#151;is that the Government have brought them into
the ambit of the NHS, to cease to allow them to be independent. We
cannot say that that is an unintended consequence, because the debate
has been held over and over again. The trust and confidence of people,
particularly those who need their hand held&#151;often at their most
vulnerable time&#151;to chart their way through the labyrinthine
processes of the NHS, is because they trust something that is
independent from it, not something that is from within it. That is the
key to this&#151;to try to find the new way forward with something
that is
independent.</div><a name="09061771000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000481"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Just to reassure the hon. Gentleman before
the batters the living daylights out of the straw man, it is not the
Government&#146;s intention to not consult LINks. On the contrary, we
have an amendment in the Bill that ensures that bodies or other persons
representing patients will be consulted during the 10-year
review&#151;precisely what he is requesting. It will happen in any
event.</div><a name="09061771000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000482"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful. The Minister says that there is an
amendment in the Bill, but I do not see a Government amendment in the
marshalled list, which is the only reason why I am asking my questions.
I have been waiting to see it, and I hoped that because we put down the
amendment, the Government would want to do that.</div>
<a name="09061771000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that I am operating from the latest marshalled list&#151;unless I am
wrong&#151;and I will certainly look to receive any advice I can. But
I cannot find any Government amendment. If there is an intended
amendment, I will be extremely pleased that that has provoked the
Minister to intervene and confirm that in
advance.</div><a name="09061771000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000483"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> It is an amendment that was taken in the
other place, so the provision is already in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09061771000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000484"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">O'Brien:</b> That is helpful. I had thought that it
ought to appear in this list of those who have to be consulted. Perhaps
we should ensure a read-across. When the Minister replies, we can look
at the technical drafting, but this is clearly the most obvious place
for the provision. I shall listen to what he has to say with interest.
Even if LINks is already included, it is something that needs to be
perfected. It would certainly help to demonstrate the
Government&#146;s credentials if they are serious about
accountability in the health service.</div>
<a name="09061771000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In December
2005, an independent review of the NHS regulatory framework was ordered
by the Department of Health. Its chairman, David Currie, wrote to the
then Secretary of State, saying
that</div><a name="09061771000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
importance of consumers/patients in the values of Health Service reform
is frequently expressed but not always so effectively mobilised.
Establishing representative national and regional fora to contribute a
reasoned collective consumer perspective to the process of reform could
well improve both the efficacy and legitimacy of that
reform.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div><a name="09061771000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is clearly
important. I suspect that the Minister will pray in aid those words as
showing the import of what the Government have tried to do; it gives us
a clear steer on what needs to happen. Having done away with the
national forums, the Bill gives us the opportunity to reinforce and
strengthen the role of LINks. Will the Minister explain exactly how
they are meant to work and whether we need to strengthen them, as I
would certainly be in the market for that?</div>
<a name="09061771000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
factor should be recognised. If the Government are earnest about LINks
and the whole process of local involvement, they must give patients
individual help and advocate their interests within the NHS&#151;and,
indeed, in social care, which is equally important for many people,
particularly when they are most vulnerable. That also gives us a real
opportunity to find developing patterns of behaviours, which is
something that gave the community health councils such authority.
Through the casualty watch and bed watch schemes, they were able to
identify those areas that were causing real problems, and discover
patterns of activity across the health service.</div>
<a name="09061771000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something has
recently come to our notice, and I shall use this opportunity to ask
the Minister about it. If LINks are to be celebrated by the Government
as a powerful and accurate voice, acting as advocates, they should be
involved in the constitution and the consultations. However, I am a
little disturbed to discover that &#163;3 million has been
top-sliced from the budget earmarked to support LINks, and is being
used to pay for the time and costs incurred by civil servants,
distributed among regional offices, who are doing their best to ensure
that LINks are established and encouraged. However, that completely
bypasses the National Association of LINks&#151;NALM&#151;which is
having some difficulty in ensuring that it is an allowed representative
body.</div>
<a name="09061771000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
remembered that we had an allowed representative body in the Commission
for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, and before that the
national council that represented community health councils. Those
bodies were important in bringing together the collective wisdom that
comes from the individual, atomised experience across such a complex
organisation. We can demonstrate how much we want to involve LINks. I
am grateful to the Liberal Democrats for their support. Given the
Minister&#146;s interventions, I look forward to his confirming that
that is indeed what he intends to do, and that we need to perfect the
drafting to ensure that it is explicit.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000485"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I wish to add only a few brief points, as I agree
with much of what the hon. Member for Eddisbury said. It is a great
disappointment that LINks in many areas of the country have been slow
to get off the ground. The public are not relating to them yet, their
powers seem to have been eroded, and they are poorly funded. The
Government&#146;s drive over the past few years seems to have
decreased the importance of some of these independent groups. Some of
the community health councils were not very good, but those that were
good were excellent. It has always been a mystery to me why we did not
build on the strengths and beef up that structure rather than trying to
create something new and then, just when that was starting to work,
create the LINks concept. Nevertheless, that is what we have at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>the moment. Although the Minister said that the Government were going to
consult, I cannot see LINks specifically mentioned in the
Bill.</div><a name="09061771000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000486"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Lady is quite right. What we
referred to was</div>
<a name="09061771000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;bodies or other
persons representing
patients&#148;.</div><a name="09061771000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled in the other place as a result of concerns raised
in relation to LINks. We do not know what the set-up will be in 10
years&#146; time, but we want to ensure that patients&#146;
representatives will be
consulted.</div>
<a name="09061771000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000487"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The Minister is referring to clause
3(3)(a), which is where LINks would fit into the Bill. I am slightly
disappointed because it should be a given that LINks are included.
However, there are ways in which patients, bodies and &#147;other
persons representing patients&#148; can be consulted without going to
LINks themselves. Perhaps the Minister is admitting that the LINks
experiment has not been an overwhelming
success.</div><a name="09061771000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000488"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> LINks are successful. They are clearly
independent of the NHS. They are funded through local authorities and
attached to local authority areas. However, it is our intention to
ensure that the representatives of patients are fully and properly
consulted during the whole course of the 10-year review. We have
already consulted local organisations representing patients as part of
the review that resulted in the introduction of the constitution. My
noble Friend Lord Darzi put on the record in the other place the fact
that we would consult LINks in any review of the constitution, just as
we did during the initial consultation. It is our intention to work
with LINks both on 10-yearly reviews and on any more minor revisions.
The amendment is therefore unnecessary. We listened to the debates in
the other place and to concerns raised by LINks and others that we
needed to refer specifically to patients bodies in the consultation.
The amendment was then tabled requiring the Secretary of State to

the right balance. It ensures that patients and their representative
organisations are specifically consulted while respecting concerns
about listing large numbers of organisations. Although we refer to
LINks, there are other organisations that represent all sorts of groups
in the NHS. LINks address both health and social care issues. It was
for that reason that they replaced CPPIH and patient forums, both to
link public concerns and to ensure that social care and health can be
dealt with together and considered in the round. Therefore, we want to
ensure that local organisations are fully consulted during the course
of a 10-year review and any other
revisions.</div><a name="09061771000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000489"></a><b class="B">Patrick

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000490"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> My hon. Friend is right. I entirely accept that.
LINks are a primary source of much of the patient and public reaction
to Government initiatives on health and were important to the
consultations that we have recently
undertaken.</div><a name="09061771000393"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000491"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am pleased that through that exchange
we have ensured that there is complete absence of any uncertainty about
the Government&#146;s intention to include local involvement
networks&#151;their own creation&#151;in clause 3(3)(a). The fact
that has been put in generically perhaps reflects the fact that
successive bodies have represented patients under the
Government&#146;s watch and that the Government did not want to bind
their commitment to LINks necessarily being the last
word.</div><a name="09061771000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
met representatives from LINks during the interval between
today&#146;s Committee sittings. One of the things that we discussed
is how they could transit to the health watch that we have proposed for
a number of years, ensuring that that independent and powerful patient
voice can have real influence in how services are delivered and how we
consult on the constitution
.</div><a name="09061771000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000492"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Did I hear the hon. Gentleman right? He
wants to reorganise patient groups again, having complained previously
about their being
organised.</div><a name="09061771000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000493"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> No, the Minister did not hear right. I was very
careful to say &#147;transit&#148;, because we have made it clear
that the last thing that we would do is to unpick LINks. However, we
would enhance and reinforce both their role and what they
do.</div><a name="09061771000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Bedford make a contribution. I
am happy to put on the record the fact that he fought an at times
lonely but noble fight on CHCs a decade ago. He has made a valid point
about the public role, as well as the role for the individual
patient.</div><a name="09061771000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of our exchanges, I need not press the amendment to a vote. We
need to make sure that there is not only involvement but a real attempt
to understand how important the independence of the voice concerned is,
in order to engender the trust and confidence that enables patients to
feel that they are being well represented in the right way. LINks also
have the broader role of identifying the pattern of experience and
behaviour, and of spotting if anything goes wrong. All of us have the
tragic and worrying experience of the Mid Staffordshire trust in mind
as we consider such matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000494"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 13, in
clause 3, page 3, line 24, after
&#145;NHS&#146;, insert &#145;or social
care&#146;.</div><a name="09061771000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can be a bit briefer on this amendment, which questions the definition
of &#147;carers&#148; in the Bill, something of particular interest
to all of us in light of Carers Week having taken place last week.
Currently the Bill defines &#147;carers&#148;
as</div><a name="09061771000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons
who, as relatives or friends, care for other persons to whom NHS
services are being provided&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div><a name="09061771000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">A somewhat strange
contradiction seems to exist in that definition of
&#147;carers&#148; being put forward by the
Government.</div><a name="09061771000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee should note that carers were only put in the Bill in the
other place. That was very welcome, and I am glad that the Government
were prepared to show acceptance. However, we need to be sure that the
amendment that was made in the Lords is seen through in both spirit and
letter. Amendment 13 would change the Bill to refer
to</div><a name="09061771000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons
who, as relatives or friends, care for other persons to whom NHS or
social care services are being
provided&#148;.</div><a name="09061771000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important addition is the words &#147;or social
care&#148;.</div><a name="09061771000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
5(4)(b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 already has a statutory
definition of &#147;carers&#148;. In that Act, which the hon.
Member for Romsey and I spent many hours debating in a room just along
the corridor, the definition
is</div><a name="09061771000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;people
who care for service users as relatives or
friends.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
seems strange is that that is not the definition used in the Bill,
provoking the question why it is not being used. Is something intended
by changing the definition, or are we in danger of spreading
confusion?</div>
<a name="09061771000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Government are not worrying about the numbers&#151;whether that
is 5 million or 6 million carers. I think that there are 5 million in
England and 6 million in the UK as a whole, but that is often
thought to be an underestimate, as is the number of 175,000 child
carers. I do not believe that the Government seek to use the definition
to change anything to do with the numbers, but it is important to
recognise that there was a fairly settled position in the Health and
Social Care Act which seemed to be accepted by all the carer
organisations.</div><a name="09061771000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is fitting to raise that point, particularly when we have just had
carers week. Like so many stakeholders, carers are yearning for the
publication of the Government&#146;s social care Green Paper. That
has been promised by spring this year, so technically no later than 25
June. As we know, carers bridge the gaps in a system which have
remained unaddressed for too long.</div>
<a name="09061771000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Government take the point seriously, and in the spirit in which it
is intended. The amendment seeks to ensure that we have a clear
definition and an explanation as to why, if the Minister wishes to
pursue the matter, he has not adopted the same definition as that
proposed by the Government a year ago.</div>
<a name="09061771000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000495"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I certainly agree with the hon. Gentleman
that carers are an important group in our society. We have the highest
regard for them and for the work that they do. We are not changing our
definitions in relation to the Health and Social Care Act.</div>
<a name="09061771000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 13
would expand the definition of &#147;carers&#148; to include those
who care for persons to whom social care, as well as NHS services, are
provided. We propose a duty on the Secretary to State to consult
carers, in their capacity as carers for those who receive NHS services.
Where a carer cares only for someone who receives social care services,
the constitution would not be relevant. That is because the
constitution is for the NHS, not for social care. There would be a
responsibility to consult NHS services, but not in relation to a
non-existent constitution relating to social
care.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="09061771000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000496"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> It would be helpful for the Minister to clarify
the definition of &#147;NHS care&#148;. Does he refer only to that
element of care in a nursing home, for example, that is funded by the
NHS? The difficulty with nursing homes is that there is not always a
clear division between health care and personal care. There are endless
debates with funding panels over that issue. It is difficult enough for
commissioners to provide absolute clarity on that, and a patient or
carer might have great difficulty in differentiating between health
care and social care. People often feel aggrieved when their loved one
has needs that are related to a health condition&#151;in cases of
Alzheimer&#146;s, for example&#151;and those needs are deemed as
being related to personal care rather than to health care. Will the
Minister provide greater clarity about where that boundary will be
drawn? It is a difficult issue.</div>
<a name="09061771000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000497"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>Order. That is rather a long
intervention. I call Stephen O&#146;Brien. I mean Mike
O&#146;Brien.</div><a name="09061771000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000498"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. Having
more than one O&#146;Brien can get a bit confusing. Of course we
accept that health care and social care are interlinked. It remains a
Government priority for the NHS and social care systems to work
together on the constitution, and it highlights the importance of
joined-up services.</div>
<a name="09061771000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
principle 5
reads:</div><a name="09061771000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
NHS works across organisational boundaries and in partnership with
other organisations in the interest of patients, local communities and
the wider
population.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
constitution also contains a pledge to make the transition as smooth as
possible when patients are referred between services such as the NHS
and social care or where services are jointly provided. It is
particularly relevant to transitions between health and social
services. Anyone who cares for someone in receipt of an NHS service is
captured by this and is therefore able to be
consulted.</div><a name="09061771000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">NHS
services must be paid for out of NHS funds. The obligation is on the
Government to consult the carers on the NHS constitution. It would
therefore be rather odd to seek to consult those merely receiving care
services about a constitution that does not directly apply to those
care services. Where there is a factor of NHS provision in the
patient&#146;s component of care&#151;some of it might be social
care and some might be NHS care&#151;there is a requirement to
consult representative
organisations.</div><a name="09061771000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern that the hon. Member for Romsey expressed about the situation
is being addressed, because we are looking at who needs to be consulted
and what they need to be consulted on. They need to be consulted on the
NHS constitution, because it applies to them. If it does not apply to
them directly, there is no obligation to be consulted on the social
care itself. That will happen separately. Indeed, the Government will
in due course publish a major Green Paper on the reform of the care and
support systems. That is a different issue. It is interlinked, but is
not about the NHS
constitution.</div><a name="09061771000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is appropriate to say that carers will be consulted when there is an
NHS factor in the care provided. I hope that that reassures the
Committee that the Government theme of partnership is clear. We want to
work closely with those providing social care, which is an important
component. We want to ensure that carers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>are properly consulted, but that they are consulted on a particular
thing&#151;the constitution. They will be consulted only on that. In
relation to other matters, such as social care, consultation will take
place in other ways. I hope that that reassures people that it will be
relevant to consult only those who care for people receiving NHS
care.</div><a name="09061771000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000499"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b>: I have listened to the Minister and
recognise that he does not intend to do anything by sleight of hand. I
dare say we will come back to the issue when we deal with direct
payments in chapter 3, but the more that we look at packages of care
that straddle the NHS and social care, it becomes more important,
because it is difficult, as was mentioned, to disentangle care services
that are provided by the NHS and those that are an extension of care
packages.</div><a name="09061771000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have about 30,000 people under continuing care, which is an NHS
provision that carries forward into the social care context, but that
is becoming more fungible as we look at the growth of direct payments,
individual budgets or personal health budgets. That is the direction
that I think hon. Members on both sides of the House wish to see
pursued. It is appropriate and relevant to individual patients and
those who need care, and it is something to which we will need to
return. In the meantime, I am prepared to postpone some of the
discussion until we get on to direct payments and I will take the
Minister&#146;s assurance at face value. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Stephen O'Brien:</b> We could discuss staff and contracting at
this point, but to some degree we have dealt with that satisfactorily.
Prompted by my experience in Cheshire, I want to cover something raised
by provisions in subsection (8), although it does not warrant an
amendment. Because of Government edict, we ended up having to abandon
the historic county of Cheshire and impose two new unitaries&#151;the
East Cheshire unitary authority and the West Cheshire and Chester
unitary authority. I want to ensure that the Minister knows that the
list in subsection (8) includes county councils, district councils,
London borough councils, the common council of the City of London and
the council of the Isles of Scilly, but not unitary councils. Where,
therefore, in that list do the new East Cheshire unitary authority and
the West Cheshire and Chester unitary authority sit? That might be a
drafting point, which has a consequential effect on Government
legislation in other areas. If the Minister does not have an immediate
answer, I am happy to accept a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000504"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I wish to address subsection
(3). What assurance can the Minister give that the Secretary of State
will ensure that those who will be consulted will
include</div><a name="09061771000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;patients,
staff, members of the public and other persons as appear to the
Secretary of State to be affected by the proposed
revision&#148;?</div><a name="09061771000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not aware of how that will be done objectively. At the worst end, a
whole load of yes-men would be selected, who might give the answer that
the Secretary of State first devised, and at the other, it would be a
completely random unrepresentative body of people. If we are going to
have other revisions, it is important that the consultation process is
seen to access not only stakeholders and appropriate patient groups.
Given the other discussions that we have had in relation to LINks and
those in the list in clause 3(3)(a), it is important that some
assurance is given, even if only by placing on the record at this point
that the selection is intended to be objective, and that there is no
possibility of either cronyism or of trying to select the people to
consult in order to produce the first answer thought of by the
Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09061771000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000505"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The appropriate word in
subsection (3) is &#147;include&#148;. There is a
non-exhaustive list of those who need to be consulted. Particular
attention is drawn the requirement to consult those who are directly
affected by the revisions. However, there are others who are generally
consulted on revisions who would also need to be consulted. The list is
not exhaustive; on the contrary, it merely draws attention to the
obligation on the Secretary of State to ensure that those directly
affected are directly
consulted.</div><a name="09061771000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000506"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful for that perfectly fair
response. I dare say that the Minister will be aware of others in
addition to LINks and patients having a voice, which we have discussed.
For instance, on the Health and Social Care Bill we took evidence,
because it was not a Bill generated in the House of Lords, from, among
others, institutions such as Which?, and consumers who might have a
patient&#146;s view. That is an interesting point and could therefore
be
included.</div><a name="09061771000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point relates to where formal staff representational positions
are in place. I am sure that the Minister is as aware as I
am&#151;those of us from the north-west, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, are particularly aware of this&#151;that the
Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel continues to rail
against the fact that it is never consulted. There has always been a
great turf war between various effective union representations of
ambulance staff, and the association continues to fail to be
represented. That is an example of how a real effect could be achieved.
Therefore if the association were to be included it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>would be extremely pleased, as that would be an improvement in its
position that it has sought for many
years.</div><a name="09061771000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000507"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000510"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The amendments are brief. They do the same thing
and would insert the statement of accountability into clause 5 on the
same terms as the handbook. Clause 5 is about the availability, review
and revision of the handbook. Through the amendments, the statement of
accountability would also have a legislative foundation for its
availability, review and revision. We had many discussions about that
when we debated amendment 3 and I will not rehearse those, except to
ask the Minister why the handbook is in the clause when the statement
of accountability is not. Logically, it should be both or neither. I
hope his reply will clarify
that.</div><a name="09061771000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000511"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> There is no need to place a duty on the
Secretary of State to make available, review and update the statement
of accountability because the Government are already committed to it.
Principle 7
reads:</div><a name="09061771000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
system of responsibility and accountability for taking decisions in the
NHS should be transparent and clear to the public, patients and staff.
The Government will ensure that there is always a clear and up-to-date
statement of NHS accountability for this
purpose.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
seven principles in the constitution, including that one, cannot be
changed except by regulations laid before Parliament. Therefore, no
Government can renege, without parliamentary approval, on the
commitment to keep the up-to-date statement of accountability. That
provides ample clarification. It would be unhelpful in terms of
timeline to insert into the Bill when the statement of accountability
needs to be reviewed, since it describes the structure of the NHS,
which might not change at all in any three-year period, or conversely
might change sooner. Flexibility is needed to keep the statement up to
date and so keep it useful for the audience with which it is supposed
to engage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div><a name="09061771000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer to
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s key concern is that the issue is covered by
principle 7. The three-year period would just add unnecessary
bureaucracy. Why, if the statement of accountability has been reviewed
after two years and nine months, review it again after three years? It
does not make sense. There is an obligation; it is required to be
constantly updated and that is the best way to deal with
it.</div><a name="09061771000269"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000514"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 114, in clause 5, page 4,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000515"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> This series of amendments seeks to put in the NHS
handbook strong indicative markers for performance. They might also be
markers for any report on the effect of the NHS constitution under
clause 6. Amendment 113 takes three areas in which the Government have
consistently underperformed; I am sure that hon. Members could
add others&#151;health inequalities, malnutrition, single-sex wards
and superbugs, for instance.</div>
<a name="09061771000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to dentistry&#151;a subject on which my hon. Friend the Member for
Hemel Hempstead has repeatedly called the Government to
account&#151;the failure of the Government is becoming a byword.
Access has declined since the Government&#146;s new dental contract
was introduced in 2006. Patient outcomes have worsened considerably and
the dental professional is feeling, somewhat justifiably,
disfranchised. More than 36,000 children with tooth decay are admitted
to hospital each year and the figure is rising. It is now the third
most common reason children are admitted to hospital, with a 13 per
cent. rise in the incidence of hospital admissions relating to tooth
decay in five years.</div>
<a name="09061771000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend and our party have pledged to restore access to an NHS dentist
for the million patients who have lost it under the Government&#146;s
current failed system, by slashing bureaucracy and cutting waste and
creating new incentives for dentists to spend more time on preventive
dental care, improving oral health and reducing long-term costs. It is
important to use money that is currently spent on carrying out
unnecessary treatments to reintroduce dental screening for children in
schools, so that children aged five can have their oral health
addressed. That is also part of a scheme that would
give  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>dentists the freedom to charge patients who repeatedly miss
appointments&#151;a counterpoint to what we were discussing a moment
ago&#151;and ensure that taxpayer-trained dentists work for the NHS
for at least five years. If this were a benchmark for the performance
of the handbook and the constitution, we might get a real sense of what
improvements they can bring.</div>
<a name="09061771000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take
another example, in January 1,849 people were still waiting more than
18 weeks for digital hearing aids, 585 of whom had waited more than a
year. That has been a long-running scandal which has particularly
affected older people. The ability of the constitution and the handbook
to deliver on that would also be a mark of their value; failure to
deliver would be a mark of their failure.</div>
<a name="09061771000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">To emphasise
the need for the three amendments we also need to look at podiatry
services, where older people have long been neglected. Age Concern has
been campaigning for years on podiatry services and its &#147;Feet
For Purpose&#148; document, published in August 2007, shed light on
the horrific circumstances of many people. It found that one in three
of the 2 million people in England over the age of 65 cannot cut their
nails. Lack of even the most basic foot care can lead to complications
resulting in dangerous falls, severe restrictions on mobility and
social isolation. Proper foot care is key to the dignity and freedom of
so many older people and, yet again, the dignity challenge is silent.
The press has reported that at least 12 PCTs have cut podiatry
services, and the Government&#146;s national service framework for
older people in 2001 highlighted the need for podiatry as part of old
age specialist care. Functioning podiatry services would make a real
difference to older people and the NHS, and would be a good benchmark
for measuring the effectiveness of the constitution and the
handbook.</div>
<a name="09061771000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also pay
tribute to Diabetes UK, which made a particular point of emphasising
the need for better and more accountable podiatry services. One of the
many unseen challenges and afflictions that affect the many people who
suffer from diabetes is the difficulty, not only in making sure that
they can cut their nails, but in keeping healthy feet when facing so
many other challenges.</div>
<a name="09061771000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 114
would enable the Committee to explore two intriguing statements in the
Department of Health cover note to the impact assessments on the Bill.
Paragraph 3
states:</div><a name="09061771000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
benefits of each of these proposals are expected to outweigh the
associated
costs.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
7 of the NHS constitution
states:</div><a name="09061771000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;These
may have both costs and benefits; there is currently insufficient data
to make a realistic
estimate.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Minister can explain that contradiction and tell the Committee
how much the constitution has cost to date; otherwise he might want to
add that to his letter pile.</div>
<a name="09061771000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, as
with so much in the Bill, the review seems to be left at the potential
whim of the Secretary of State. Amendment 115 would ensure that all the
bodies and persons who feed into the tenure review of the constitution
also support the review of the functioning of the handbook. It is right
that such a review should be open, informed and honest, and I hope that
the Minister will accept that and our other
amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000516"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> While I cannot argue with the hon. Gentleman, I
find amendment 113 a little confusing. It is fairly weak because the
wording states that it &#147;may address the impact&#148;, so it
hardly seems worth putting in the Bill. It seems to be a &#147;do it
if you want to&#148; approach. He mentioned areas of neglect and
quite rightly highlighted three that are of concern. However, by
putting those into the Bill, he may be neglecting other important
areas. For example, we could easily add &#147;access to talking
therapies&#148; or &#147;availability of NICE
medicines&#148;&#151;it would be interesting to force a review of
that because implementation is patchy. Others may prefer &#147;access
to IVF services&#148; to be listed. Those three examples immediately
sprang to mind, but if we brainstorm&#151;I am not sure that we are
allowed to use that phrase anymore&#151;we could come up with a long
list of underfunded services. I am concerned about supporting the
amendment, although I recognise the intention behind
it.</div>
<a name="09061771000395"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="09061771000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
I am concerned about amendment 114, which again contains the weasel
word &#147;may&#148;. I have sat in many Committees in which the
Conservatives tried to strike out each &#147;may&#148; and replace
it with &#147;must&#148;, so I am surprised to find the word here.
I would not necessarily support a &#147;must&#148; in this case.
The constitution is not about finance, and the unnecessary bureaucracy
involved in assessing the financial implications of the constitution
runs counter to everything we hear about the Conservatives wanting to
reduce regulatory burdens, but I may have missed something. I find it
difficult to support the amendment.</div>
<a name="09061771000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 115
is perfectly sensible. It may be superfluous, but I have no difficulty
supporting it.</div>
<a name="09061771000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061771000517"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): I am concerned about
dentistry, because it is very poor on the island, despite attempts by
Ministers to do something about it. The problem is that the recording
system is based entirely on the number of appearances before a dentist.
We no longer have a system that looks at each person; instead it looks
at the number of visits. That tells us how many appearances, not how
many people, there are before the dentist. That is the wrong system and
it gives the wrong impression. It appears that more people have
inspections, but in fact they are the same people&#151;the same
people are going to the dentist more and the same people are going to
the dentist less. We must fix that problem by recording the number of
visits that each person has, not just the smaller number of people who
have regular
visits.</div><a name="09061771000288"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000518"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Amendments 113 and 114 would allow the
Secretary of State to address the impact of the handbook on national
health services, including dentistry, audiology and podiatry, during
the first three-yearly review of the handbook, and to assess the cost
savings made as a result of the constitution during each three-yearly
review.</div><a name="09061771000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Eddisbury set out on a general rant about the NHS. Let
me remind him that the NHS now has the shortest waiting lists since its
records began. Across England, the NHS has met its target to treat
patients within a maximum of 18 weeks from referral by their GP to
consultant, including audiology 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>patients referred to ENT departments. The hon. Gentleman mentioned
audiology: the NHS is also ensuring that patients do not wait a long
time to access a non-consultant-led audiology service, and the median
waiting time from referral to direct access to audiology treatment is
now just 4.6 weeks. He mentioned podiatry: foot care services for older
people have been reviewed as part of the prevention package announced
in May 2008. The package is due to be launched later this year, with
the publication of guidance for commissioners and providers of foot
care services for older people, and self-care guidance for the
public.</div><a name="09061771000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Members for Isle of Wight and for Eddisbury mentioned dentistry
services. There are a number of issues in relation to those services
and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight raised a particular point. I am
not sure that the handbook is the way to address it, and I hope he
forgives me for not going down the route he invites me to take. In
general terms, we have invested a record &#163;2 billion in dentistry
and set up a national access programme. We have also commissioned an
independent review of NHS dentistry led by Professor Jimmy Steele. The
review will report later in the summer and give an independent view of
how we should further develop dentistry in the coming years.</div>
<a name="09061771000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 115
would oblige the Secretary of State to consult on reviews in relation
to the handbook and the statement of accountability. The Conservatives
ask how the constitution will be a cost-saving exercise, but it is not
intended to be a cost-saving exercise. All too often, the Conservatives
are obsessed with how to make cuts in the NHS. They have recently made
statements that indicate how they want to make cuts across the
board&#151;</div><a name="09061771000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000519"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Anything but.</div>
<a name="09061771000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000520"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister has got away with enough so
far.</div>
<a name="09061771000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000521"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I can but try, Mr. O&#146;Hara. You
quite rightly bring me back to order.</div>
<a name="09061771000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
the reviews is not to cut costs; it is to empower patients and staff
through greater understanding of their rights and responsibilities. We
do not want to single out particular areas or services in the
reviews&#151;they must be looked at as a whole. As the hon. Member
for Romsey pointed out, if we start picking services, we could leave
others off the list. She rightly identified some services that the
Conservatives have left off their
list.</div><a name="09061771000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000522"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The Minister reads his briefing notes very well,
but I must admit that his mention of podiatry rather incensed me,
because podiatry services are non-existent in some parts of the
country. I am sure that he wants to get out and about to meet people,
so I invite him to Hampshire to witness podiatry services&#151;I
would not quite use the phrase &#147;in action&#148;. He will see
that there is a problem. It is not the thrust of the Bill, but after we
have finished our deliberations on it, it might be nice for him to get
out a little
more.</div><a name="09061771000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000523"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s offer to take me
out, but I will decline for the moment. I remind her that the aim is to
launch a podiatry services package 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>later this year, with the publication of guidance for commissioners and
providers of foot care services. When that happens, perhaps she will
see that the Government are focused on the issue as she would
like.</div><a name="09061771000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
114 would be out of kilter with the purpose of the reviews of the
handbook. It is not designed to go further than assessing the
helpfulness of the document itself. A review is not a broad review of
every service, and the measure is about looking at the document and
determining whether it fulfils the role that was intended for
it.</div>
<a name="09061771000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
115, the Secretary of State may make minor changes to the handbook at
any time to bring it into line with current departmental policy or
changes in the law, to ensure that the handbook is always up to date.
It would not be appropriate to impose a requirement on the Secretary of
State to consult on such changes. The handbook is not intended to be a
legal document as such; it is merely guidance for the general public.
Any changes to the law or to departmental policy that are more
significant would, in themselves and by their very nature, trigger
consultation requirements, either by virtue of statute, or to comply
with the Government&#146;s code of practice on consultation, or
because we would be expected to consult. We have therefore decided not
to include that as part of the
requirement.</div><a name="09061771000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
reviewing the handbook, we will certainly continue informally to
involve patients, the public and other groups and parties who have
contributed to its development. However, we do not want to impose a
formal duty to consult every time that there is a minor change. It is
important that the handbook is regularly updated. On the statement of
accountability, as I have previously mentioned, it is a public-facing
and factual document that explains roles, responsibilities and
accountability in the NHS. To require the Secretary of State to consult
on it would be inappropriate, and the changes would merely bring it in
line with the current structure of the NHS. Such changes, not the
document itself, should be the subject of consultation. I hope that
those explanations will lead to the withdrawal of the
amendment.</div><a name="09061771000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000524"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I listened to the Minister with some
care. He was unusually opportunistic in suggesting that I am obsessed
with cost savings. I will not go down the wholly inappropriate and
erroneous route that that he went down. The Government have been keen
to reverse the declining productivity in the NHS, and we thought that
it would be helpful to discuss
that.</div><a name="09061771000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to draw attention&#151;I could do this during the
stand part debate, but I might as well cover it now&#151;to something
that is not the subject of an amendment. Paragraph 86 on page 18 of the
explanatory notes centres on clause 5 and mentions how the Department
intends to use the reports on the effect of the NHS constitution to
assess what further measures are required. I am a little concerned by
the use of the word &#147;Department&#148;, because normally it is
either the Government or the Secretary of State who are involved. I
will not press the issue&#151;I dare say that there is an
explanation&#151;but I wanted to ensure that it was
highlighted.</div><a name="09061771000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight
for highlighting the situation of members of an island community who do
not want 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>to have to travel by ferry to access services. It is important that that
is seen as a community interest that needs to be supported by public
services. He also made the important point about access to NHS
dentistry services. We want to ensure access to services, rather than
simply concentrate on the quantity of particular people&#146;s visits
and the absence of access by
others.</div><a name="09061771000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also pleased that the Minister made a semi-announcement that
Diabetes UK&#146;s campaign on podiatry services will bear some fruit
and that an announcement will be made later this year. That will be
extremely welcome news to Diabetes UK and the many others who have
vigorously and rightly campaigned for such a focused and strategic
uplift of such services.</div>
<a name="09061771000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain
concerned that we have not received the strong answer for which I had
hoped in response to the amendments. Indeed, I had hoped that the
Minister would adopt the
amendments.</div><a name="09061771000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000525"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Perhaps I could strengthen my answer by
mentioning a point that I did not refer to earlier. The total cost from
the inception to the completion of the constitution was just under
&#163;1
million.</div><a name="09061771000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000526"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I am grateful for that, because it means that I
will not have to ask that question again. The figure is useful and is
now on the record. I also want to address the implied criticism from
the hon. Member for Romsey when she said that she did not fancy the
word &#147;may&#148;. It would not be appropriate for the
Government, as the Bill&#146;s promoters, or for my hon. Friend the
Member for Hemel Hempstead and I, as the amendment&#146;s proposers,
to bind the hands of any kind of review. Inevitably, that is in the
conditional, or the subjunctive to be more precise, and it is important
to note that it is about guidance, rather than legal force. I made the
clear distinction of saying that there were three items, but that is
inclusive&#151;it was not intended to be exclusive. I thought that
those were three good examples that would help to highlight the matter.
In considering that we should flag up our intent, perhaps for no other
reason than emphasis, and despite recognising that the Minister has
given some partial answers, I would like to press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="09061771000396"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000543"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The clause
states:</div><a name="09061771000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must publish a report every 3 years on how the NHS
Constitution has affected patients, staff, carers and members of the
public, since the last report was produced under this
subsection.&#148;</div><a name="09061771000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were
the amendments to be made, the clause would require the Secretary of
State to report every year on the delivery of the pledges in the NHS
constitution, and that the first report must be published not later
than 31 March 2010, or, under proposed subsection (1A), not
later than 31 January 2010. The amendments are designed to strengthen
the review of the NHS constitution.</div>
<a name="09061771000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 116
takes issue with the concept of a pledge in the constitution, which is
rather weakly indicated by the word &#147;pledge&#148; in brackets.
How effective would the US constitution be if it stated, &#147;We the
people establish this constitution for the United States of America
(pledge)?&#148; Surely a constitution is something one either does or
does not do. What place do pledges have? I hope that the Minister will
be able to give us the benefit of the thinking that lies behind that,
because &#147;pledge&#148; in this context is a relatively weak
word, although in other contexts it is not.</div>
<a name="09061771000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
fitting that the Secretary of State should have to report every year on
the delivery of the pledges, which would be achieved by amendments 117
and 118, which propose that the date for the first report should by 31
January, one year after the constitution was signed with great flourish
in Downing street by the Prime Minister before it appeared in the Bill,
and indeed before consideration by either House of
Parliament.</div><a name="09061771000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
14 seeks to have the first review undertaken and published on or before
31 March 2010 rather than 5 July 2012. Clearly, that is
designed to make real what is contained in the Bill and to ensure that
there is public accountability in advance of the general election. That
date has been chosen to ensure that the matter is not shuffled off
until after a general election and that the accountability that is
envisaged under the Bill is produced in time for the public to have
their say in the general election, which we all know must be no later
than June
2010.</div><a name="09061771000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000544"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I have no problem in principle with amendments 116
and 117, but I was curious about amendments 14 and 118. I am glad that
the hon. Member for Eddisbury has explained that the intention is for
this to take place ahead of a general election. I think that is the
wrong approach to take because, yet 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>again, it makes the NHS a political football at a time when Conservative
Members keep telling us the NHS is too politicised. There seems to be
some contrary thinking on those Benches.</div>
<a name="09061771000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">My major
objection to the proposed date is that it is far too early to have a
realistic review. I would support a little bit of electioneering if I
felt that it was fair to the NHS staff, but it takes a little while for
something to bed in, so any date that is within a year of the enactment
of the Bill is too early and any information gleaned would be of
limited value. There will be far more important debates to be had at
the general election than the NHS
constitution.</div>
<a name="09061771000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000545"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> To some extent the point has already been
made by the hon. Member for Romsey, but the situation is even worse
than she has suggested. The duty in the Bill with regard to the
constitution is not expected to come into force until January 2010,
subject to its progress through the House, so the Conservatives appear
to be proposing that the NHS should undertake a new layer of
bureaucracy so that, a mere two months after the duty on the
organisation comes into force, it has to review and publish an
examination of its effect. They are not even allowing time for the
constitution to be read and digested by those who work for the NHS,
never mind having to perform the significant administrative task of
reporting back.</div>
<a name="09061771000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
want to place an excessive administrative and regulatory burden on the
NHS, as the Conservative proposal would do. Reporting once every three
years will maintain momentum while still allowing time for the
constitution to embed and to gather some meaningful evidence. The
amendment is mere political opportunism by the Conservatives, who think
they will perhaps get something out of it when, in fact, they would be
imposing an administrative burden on the NHS.</div>
<a name="09061771000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
amendments 116 and 118, there is no need to create a separate reporting
process for the pledges. That would again create an unnecessary
bureaucratic burden on the NHS. Three-yearly reports will cover the
pledges as well as every other part of the constitution. We must not
forget that the pledges represent existing departmental policy. Many of
them therefore have their own reporting requirements, such as waiting
times and cleanliness pledges. We know what they are. Why impose an
extra bureaucratic burden? If the Conservative Front Benchers want to
talk about regulation, let them look at the mote in their own eye; they
are creating more administrative regulation than the NHS can stand. Let
us deal with these issues in a much more sensible way and not try to
use them for mere political opportunism.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000546"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> If the Minister is asking me to remove
the mote from my eye, I hope that he will remove the three oak
facsimile beams from his own eye. I dare say he knows precisely where
that comment comes from&#151;it is from the great big book.</div>
<a name="09061771000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
with care to what the Minister said, which was an interesting
exposition of what I wanted to establish, which was the nature and
quality of the pledge that lies behind the measure. Although it is
important to recognise that, to a degree, we need to be conscious that,
whatever we do and however much we may wish to remove so much of the
discussion about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>the NHS from the political fray, as the hon. Member for Romsey said,
there is of course the reality of electoral time scales, over which
most of us have very little control. I simply wanted to establish the
quality of the pledge that is in place, to ensure that the measure is
outward-facing rather than self-serving, either within Government or
within the Department, and to ensure that there is a degree of
accountability that would refract back on to the people who sent us
here.</div>
<a name="09061771000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000547"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I would have some sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s arguments if an election was a year hence and an
amendment was tabled to bring a report after a year, which is not an
unreasonable length of time to have an early review. However, I am sure
that he must accept that a period of two months&#151;I had not
realised that it was quite so short a time&#151;is unhelpful and
would provide little meaningful
information.</div>
<a name="09061771000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000548"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The point that I was about to conclude on is
this. Having had this discussion, it is clear that there are some grave
difficulties about the timetable, simply because we are bumping up
against the final moment at which the Prime Minister has to make up his
mind about when he is prepared to call upon the country to endorse his
position or not endorse it. It strikes me that it would be
inappropriate to press the matter to a Division, because I think that
it has been a useful discussion, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000549"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I do not intend to revisit any of the
issues that we have discussed. However, it would be helpful to place on
record my concern that the Bill, and in particular the drafting that we
have looked at in relation to the constitution, do not give fair weight
to an important issue&#151;one to which I certainly give weight and,
judging from the Minister&#146;s earlier response, one to which he
also intended to give weight. We must show that we genuinely value
social care as much as we do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>health care. Because we are dealing with NHS services in NHS provision
and therefore with an NHS constitution, there is a real danger, simply
by referring to the document, of making a social care a second order
area. It is difficult to attach an equivalent importance to social care
in the absence of a social care constitution.</div>
<a name="09061771000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that we are all governed by the very high expectations that the
Government have encouraged us to have of the Green Paper, whose
publication is imminent. That said, however, we need to recognise that
social care is likely to be regarded as an untouched and slightly
under-discussed subject; it may even be the Cinderella of the two
aspects of care, even though it is so important to so many people.
Although primary care deals with  95 per cent. of people who
access health care, in the end social care tends to affect all of us,
in one way or another, during the course of our lifetime. It is vital
that we place on record&#151;the point is best made in a stand part
debate&#151;that we want the social care aspects of the Bill to stand
on equal terms with health care. Although it is difficult to see how
that could be incorporated on the same footing, through our discussion
of the Bill and this stand part debate, we can at least make sure that
our intention is on the record. I shall be interested to see whether
other members of the Committee feel equally strongly about
that.</div>
<a name="09061771000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061771000550"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> We certainly regard social care as
enormously important and on a par with health care. For much of the
time, the two are inextricably linked. We take the view that that needs
to be an important focus of Government policy, which is why we have
been preparing the social care Green Paper. Given the importance of the
issue, we will be publishing that shortly to ensure that we have a full
and appropriate national debate.</div>
<a name="09061771000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
issue of an NHS constitution is concerned, we do not propose to have a
social care constitution because we do not have a national social care
service; we have a national health service, and that requires a
constitution. However, that should in no way diminish the key
importance that social care should, and does, have to the
Government.</div>
