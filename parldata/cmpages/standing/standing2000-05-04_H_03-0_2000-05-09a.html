<P><center><b>(Except clauses 1, 12, 30, 31, 59, 102 and 113)</b></center>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a hot afternoon, so it will be in order if hon. Gentlemen remove their jackets if they so wish.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty and rebate on hydrocarbon oil</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Clark. I doubt that you will be sterner in your guidance than your co-Chairman, Mr. Cook, who rightly reminded me to address my remarks to him, not to others in Committee.
<P>
We were treated this morning to many arguments about the method that was used for what the Government are pleased to call valorisation--in other words, indexation. The Financial Secretary will be sorry to hear that that issue arises in relation to hydrocarbon oil duties. I wish to declare a potential interest as some clients may have an interest in oil matters, but I do want to know how the calculation was made for hydrocarbon oil duties. Since this moming's sitting, the Financial Secretary will have had the advantage of being able to refer to the fountain of all wisdom in Great George street and no doubt he is now fully equipped with the figures. I hope that he will let us into the secret and tell us the market expectations for mortgage interest rate increases that are built into the calculation.
<P>
Beyond that, will the Financial Secretary explain the relationship between valorisation and escalations? Last year, the Chancellor told us with some flourish that the escalator was to be brought to an end. It is a term of art, in that it is an automatic mechanism for uprating something, but other mechanisms are used for such purposes, one of which is straightforward, so-called valorisation or indexation. I shall not tediously remind the Committee that we have explored the composition of the forecasts of the RPI all-prices index increases, which are being used as a basis for the so-called valorisation. We know that the set-up is asymmetric in that it could contain a its persistent bias without its being corrected ex post.
<P>
Can the Financial Secretary guarantee that, if the indexation turns out over time to re-create the escalator or part of the escalator that had been abolished with such a flourish, the error will be corrected? The Chancellor said specifically to the public that there will not be an escalator, so I take it that that means that there will not be a revalorisation that goes beyond revalorisation. In such a case, for the sake of consistency, surely there should be an obligation to produce a correction after the fact on a continuing basis. However, there is nothing like that in the clause and it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman explained the provision. Is there to be such an exposed adjustment in the light of the Chancellor's statements and, if not, why not?
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): The hon. Gentleman is suggesting, as he did this morning, that there should be some compensation if the reality turns out to be different from the prediction. Is he also suggesting that if an overestimation was made there should be a surcharge--or is he suggesting a one-way ticket?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks a reasonable question which I might, in the manner of an e-mail, forward to the Financial Secretary. It would be interesting to know whether the correction is to be symmetrical or asymmetrical. As I mentioned in another context this morning, it was the practice of the previous Government to operate a forward-looking variant of indexation. The adjustment was made on an asymmetric basis, so that the gain to the recipients was banked when the indexation turned out to be less great than the actual. The recipients were not asked to hand back social security payments when the indexation turned out to be greater than the actual.
<P>
Whether that variand should apply in the case that we are discussing is an interesting question of public policy. I would not presume to insist that it should be one way or the other, but we need an explanation of a symmetrical adjustment at least; at best, we should have an explanation of an asymmetric one. If it turns out to be the latter, the Financial Secretary will have a persistent bias in his favour. As things stand, we can conclude that there is an implicit escalator, if the forecasts persistently turn out to be above the reality.
<P>
To know how likely that is to be the case, we desperately need the answer to the following question. What is the figure for a so-called market expectation of the interest rate rise component built into the RPI all-prices index, and how much like a market expectation is that?
<P>
While we are on the subject, will the Financial Secretary also tell us what he means by a market expectation? We have had an opportunity to think about that question in the interim, and I have had the inestimable advantage of talking it over with my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) over a drink of tea. The Financial Secretary may be able to tell us that we are mistaken and that the standard measure, the discrepancy of bond yields--of indexed and nominal bonds--is what led the Govenunent to create the forecast. However, it was not verified by the National Audit Office as being consistent with the RPIX forecast--that was true two years ago but not this year.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I would like to draw it to the attention of all members of the Committee that electronic devices are not permissible. I should be grateful if those that have them would put them away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I wish that I possessed the kind of machine that I would need to--
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): On a point of order, Mr. Clark. I should be grateful for a definition of an electronic device.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be that in front of you, Mr. Jack, there is a computer of some type or a PC laptop. I do not know what it is, but it looks like an electronic device to me. If you tell me that it is not and that it is only a plastic paint-box, I will be pleased to hear it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Clark. The device is electronically powered, but the system contains the notes on clauses for the measure that we are discussing. I was not aware that there was a ruling of the House that hon. Members may not obtain their data for use in the Committee by other than the printed fashion.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Jack, there is a ruling of the Chairmen's Panel, over which the Chairman of Ways and Means presides, that electronic devices of the type that you describe are not allowed in Committee. I would be very pleased if it was taken off the desk and put away.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The irony of that exchange is that an electronic device is probably exactly what the Financial Secretary requires--or perhaps he should obtain guidance from somebody who has one. I believe that he is so well endowed in the intellectual department that he could invent programmes for electronic devices. Between sittings, he may have invented a programme to discover the answer to the very question that we are asking.
<P>
 I return to the seminal question, which is whether the market expectation to which the Financial Secretary referred as the basis for the interest rate rise component in the RPI all-prices index used to "revalorise" the hydrocarbon oil duty is a bond yield-based measure or a judgmental measure based on the forecast of someone in the Treasury. That is vitally important. To refer to the question by the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer), whose constituency I temporarily forgot--
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Labour gain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I are fast becoming pals.
<P>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe rightly referred to asymmetry; it is probably true that if the Treasury, with or without the approval of the National Audit Office, builds those estimates into its forecast of the RPI all--prices index as a bond yield-based measure--even where genuine market mistakes, in the sense of impact on long-run bond prices, occur--they will probably turn out to be symmetrical over time. I say that without empirical proof but simply as a matter of theory. I take it that there is no inherent bias in the market and therefore that, over quite long periods, the taxpayer ought to end up just about even stevens on hydrocarbon oil duties, compared with genuine ex post inflation measures, if the market measure is used. If, however, the Treasury has simply made a judgmental insertion into the forecast of the RPI all-prices index, there may be--this comes back to the point raised by the hon. Member for Broxtowe--a systemic bias, making it all the more important to know whether there will be correction and whether we have an implicit escalator in the hydrocarbon oil duty increases. The Treasury is not just the body that sets the hydrocarbon oil duties through the Finance Bill; although no longer responsible for the setting of interest rates, it is also a main player. It is at least the second most important player in the land in determining macro-economic policy--and since the Chancellor sets the RPIX targets for the Monetary Policy Committee, it could be argued that it is the most important player in that. If the Treasury had put in a judgmental measure, that would convey--bizarrely in the case of indexing hydrocarbon oil duties, for example--a signal for the markets.
<P>
There is therefore a problem of feedback when talking of a market expectation and it is extremely important for the Financial Secretary to recapitulate several points. First, what is the figure for the mortgage interest rate rise component in the RPI all-prices index forecast that yields the 3.41 per cent. being used for that indexation? Secondly, what is the basis upon which that estimate of the interest rate rise has been made? Is it a judgmental measure or a bond yield differential measure? Thirdly, at which date was the forecast constructed? Finally, what measures will be taken in the light of the Chancellor's remarks that there will not any longer be an escalator in the hydrocarbon oil duties to ensure ex post that any over-egging of the rises will be removed?

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell (Charnwood):</B> I should like to echo and reinforce the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) about the need for the Government to be open about the interest rate assumption that lies behind their calculation of the figure of 3.41 per cent. The Committee needs to be clear about that.  We are being asked to raise the duty on hydrocarbons in the same way as we were asked this morning to raise those on wine and cider, on the basis that the Government predict a definition of inflation for September of 3.41 per cent. Before the Committee agrees that all the duties should go up by 3.41 per cent, we are owed a full explanation of how the Government arrived at that number.
<P>
I give the Financial Secretary full credit for the fact that he did not seek to disguise the fundamental concepts behind the calculation this morning. He made it crystal clear that the 3.41 per cent. forecast for the RPI in September 2000 represented the Government's forecast of the definition of inflation that excludes interest rates, which is known as RPIX, plus the effect of interest rate increases to take the RPI level above that. He was clear about the calculation method and about the fact that the interest rates, as they stood on Budget day, did not justify a figure of 3.41 per cent. He said that the figure was arrived at because the Government included in the estimate of RPI for September 2000 interest rate increases that on Budget day had not come into force. He said that the quantum of those expected increases in interest rates on Budget day was "market expectations".
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is seeking clarification of what that phrase means. As one would expect of him, he moderately asked whether the concept of "market expectations" focused on measurable figures in the bond markets, which is a conventional way in which to consider expected future movements of interest rates, or whether it represented an entirely judgmental question arrived at in the Treasury.
<P>
The matter is important, and affects everyone who pays a mortgage or pays any interest in the British economy. One might be a hard-pressed manufacturer. Perhaps I should declare an interest as a director and shareholder in a manufacturing business who is not, for this purpose, paying interest. Manufacturers up and down the country pay interest on overdrafts and see their profit margins squeezed not only by the interest rate on the overdraft, but by the impact of interest rates on the exchange rate and therefore on the strength of the pound against the euro. The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not actually go to the Dispatch Box on Budget day to say that interest rates would go up, but he announced inflation forecasts that the Financial Secretary told us could be justified only if the Chancellor, when he announced them, expected interest rates to go up between Budget day and September 2000.
<P>
I echo the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. Perhaps more importantly, I ask the Financial Secretary to follow the open approach that he adopted this morning and give the Committee one extra piece of information. He acknowledged that the Chancellor knew what interest rates were on Budget day and that he expected them to go up. When did the Chancellor expect them to go up, and by how much? What is the number that he included in his forecasts to justify the figure of 3.41 per cent?
<P>
The Financial Secretary has made a good start in being open with the Committee. We now seek the number that he acknowledged this morning was in the Government's working papers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton):</B> May I, from the Liberal Democrat Benches, welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Clark,  and look forward to your presiding over our proceedings as we enter late May, June and, no doubt, the Government Whip notwithstanding, July.
<P>
I echo the comments of the hon. Member for West Dorset and the right hon. Member for Charnwood. Liberal Democrats want the Government to be upfront about the methodology and figures used in calculating the uprating index for this financial year. It is an important issue, and they should be transparent about it. They need not be worried if, as the Financial Secretary told the Committee before we adjourned for lunch, it is standard practice and has been used throughout this Parliament. If that is so, the Financial Secretary should have no political problem with telling us the methodology and giving us the figures, and when he does so, I hope that he will try to justify the methodology. Market expectations do not provide sufficient detail, so we cannot be expected to accept that justification. They are a subjective measure unless it is clear which market has been used.
<P>
Does the Financial Secretary feel that market expectations are a sustainable measure for such an important decision? They are notoriously imperfect on such issues. In the past two years, with the introduction of a new anti-inflation regime and the Monetary Policy Committee setting interest rates, mistakes have often been made in learning how that new body of nine members, each with a different attitude about how the economy works, votes on interest rates. We have witnessed volatility in the attempts by markets to second-guess what the MPC will do, especially in relation to short-term interest rates. Using market expectation of future interest rates may, therefore, lead to an inaccurate measure of future inflation as measured by indices that include short-term interest rates. I hope that the Financial Secretary will try to meet that anxiety.
<P>
The argument of the hon. Member for West Dorset was so persuasive that I almost felt that in this case we should perhaps consider using not the main RPI, because of the sensitivities involved, but the underlying measure of inflation, RPIX, because it might be more stable and might prevent the need for swings and roundabouts to ensure that one particular sector or group of our constituents is not deleteriously affected by changes in tax rates. Perhaps we should be looking elsewhere for the right uprating index. The RPI index might be a candidate, although, because of its political significance and economic and social effects, a wider debate is necessary to decide how and when to make that change. It would be a major change, but if problems such as those described are being experienced, there may be a case for changing the uprating index.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there is a case to be made. However, does he agree that the most important point is consistency? Regardless of whether we argue that, because people face the cost of the RPI all-prices index more closely than RPIX, that measure should be used in preference to RPIX for this purpose, or vice versa, the same index with the same element of looking forward or retrospectivity should be used for hydrocarbon duty, all associated duties and benefit uprating, so that everyone knows that all the calculations are based on one inflation rate measured in one way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I agree that consistency is important. However, I counsel the hon. Gentleman not to push that point too much. As he mentioned earlier, when in government his party used a range of indices, including the tax and prices index. Nevertheless, I agree with his basic point, and add to the principle of consistency his wider point about transparency. Consistency and transparency are equally important principles that should apply to any index used for such an important matter.
<P>
I move from the debate about the interest rate and market expectations that the Treasury has used to set the index to the policy of uprating petrol duties. Last year, we had a long debate, because the Government were still using the escalator and shoving up petrol duties by significant amounts. It is therefore right to welcome the fact that the escalator has gone, even though the Government and the Chancellor will make the operating decision on a case-by-case and year-by-year basis.
<P>
I hope that escalators of recent years, under the Conservative and Labour Governments, have served their purpose, and that we can now look forward to much lower increases in petrol duty. However, Liberal Democrat Members want to reiterate the point that we made when the escalator was in place--it is necessary to compensate motorists, especially rural motorists, for the extra costs that they must bear as a result of increases in petrol duty. We have often argued for reductions in other taxes on motorists, especially vehicle excise duty, which is a tax on ownership and does not serve a useful purpose. It is better, environmentally speaking, to tax use, not ownership. We have therefore argued, on too many occasions to recall, that VED would be a good tax by means of which to compensate the motorist properly. The Government have made a few tiny steps towards graduating VED, as we will discuss later, but the two taxes have never been linked. That is not joined-up government, not holistic, and does not ensure that the interests of private and commercial motorists are looked after.
<P>
I welcome the freeze on duty on road fuel gases that the clause introduces. The use of such fuels has increased, and I hope that the Government will do more to encourage motorists to use such fuels, which are of considerable benefit to the environment. If such encouragement succeeds, many of the arguments that we have had previously about the trade-off between environmental and economic benefits will be superseded, as environmentally friendly fuels will be used by the vast majority of vehicles. The use of such fuels cannot be encouraged sufficiently through a small incentive in terms of duty. Clearly, such an incentive would be helpful--as was the introduction of lower fuel duties for unleaded petrol--but a different issue is at stake in relation to some of the new fuels. A critical mass in terms of infrastructure is required. Unleaded petrol was easy to deal with, because the infrastructure existed already, and the price incentive was sufficient to ensure a speedy uptake. However, new fuel gases will require a different infrastructure that fuel stations--to use the generic term--will have to introduce, operate and maintain. There would have to be a quantum leap in investment by the businesses involved.
<P>
The Government would have to do more than introduce a mere price incentive to promote new and environmentally beneficial fuels. Grants and support would be necessary to assist those companies that would supply the new fuel to consumers, and to make sure that vehicle manufacturers and the main vehicle purchasers are attracted to such environmentally friendly vehicles. So I hope that the Financial Secretary will assure the Committee that the Government's policy does not rely simply on a price incentive.
<P>
I urge the Financial Secretary to answer the central question. Which expectations have been used in the calculation of the index? We need to know before we can allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I should like to follow the lines of argument used by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) to probe the Government further about the basis  on which the duty increase has been levied. I support the argument made in carefully probing the market expectation used by the Government in their assessment of the increase in the rate of inflation.
<P>
There is a precedent for the Government's exposing their thinking. The index used to uprate the mortgage interest calculation for income support is the average of the top 20 lenders in the country. That is admittedly a retrospective index and triggers a change in the payment of interest for income support when a quarter point change has occurred in mortgage interest rates. In the interests of transparency and of understanding how the calculations are made, there is nothing to prevent the Government from publishing the details that my right hon. Friend seeks.
<P>
We are moving into an era in which we should probe the Government on why they do not use a more sophisticated method to determine the necessity to raise taxes in relation to this matter. During the Government's lifetime, the price of the raw material--oil--has dropped as low as $10 a barrel and risen to more than $30 a barrel. There appears to be no acknowledgement of the determining factor that causes the Government to change taxation on hydrocarbons, which is substantial changes in the price of a major ingredient of petrol. A major ingredient in the price of petrol and gases is tax; half of the price is tax. The decisions of the Treasury can have a profound influence on the overall retail selling price and subsequently on the RPI. The two interact inextricably.
<P>
When the Financial Secretary sums up, I hope that he will suggest whether he is prepared to be more open in future about the ways in which such matters are calculated. Also, I hope that he is prepared to acknowledge the need for a more sophisticated model to determine whether, at times of sharply rising oil prices, it is proper for the Treasury to add another twist to the possible inflationary spiral by automatically raising the price of petrol via changes in tax.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> Let me first add my welcome to you, Dr. Clark, as the Chair of our Committee. I look forward to seeing you, especially, I gather, during the afternoons of our deliberations.
<P>
I shall deal with the issue of fuel duty, which has been given relatively scant attention in our debate--not by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who spoke before lunch, but by those who have spoken since it. The Budget was good for motorists. A headline from The Daily Telegraph was quoted this morning; that paper stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This was the most motorist-friendly Budget in 8 years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Financial Secretary describes the Budget as good for the motorist. How would he describe the previous three?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The previous Budgets had many virtues, which were widely publicised at the time.
<P>
There is no doubt that motorists and hauliers, whom we mentioned this morning, have welcomed the cancellation of the escalator. The Royal Automobile Club said that the Chancellor was "on the right tracks", while the Automobile Association said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the first time drivers can take some heart from a Budget in over seven years.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On fuel duties, it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chancellor has listened to our view.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Budget was welcomed by motorists and their representatives. Those remarks reflect the changes in vehicle excise duty to which we shall refer in later proceedings, but the decision about duties was the key to the warm welcome that the announcement received. In percentage terms, it is the lowest increase in fuel duties for 11 years and the first time since 1992 that we have not had a rise above inflation. In 1992, inflation was running at a significantly greater level.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to those whose income is not index linked. The most important thing for them is that inflation is low and stable, and that it does not reach the heights that it did under the previous Government. They benefit from the fact that the United Kingdom's rate of inflation is now the lowest in the whole of the European Union, as a result of the Government's policy on macro-economic stability and the new framework that we have introduced. The hon. Gentleman asked what the Chancellor said in his pre-Budget report. My right hon. Friend decided that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>revenues from any real terms increases in fuel duties will, in future, go straight in to a ring-fenced fund for improving public transport and modernising the road network.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that we have an inflation increase, there is no contribution to that ring fence, yet a substantial sum has been set aside for investment in improving public transport and modernising the road network. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor was right about investing in that area. The previous Government left a huge backlog in investment not only in public transport but in public infrastructure as a whole. Raising the level of investment in infrastructure is an important task and our 10-year programme for transport will be part of our spending review that will be published in the summer.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to the concerns of hauliers. I serve on the road haulage forum, which is chaired by Lord Macdonald, and I am familiar with those worries. It was set up by the Government to examine the competitiveness of the United Kingdom industry. The hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know that the Freight Transport Association welcomed the Budget and said that, for transport, it had been positive. It repeated that welcome at the forum's last meeting. Clearly, hauliers welcome the cancellation of the escalator, as they do the significant cuts in vehicle excise duty for lorries, which is much in line with what they have been asking for.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we favoured unleaded petrol as opposed to diesel. He argued that the rate of duty under the clause was pretty much even, which reflects the view that, although carbon dioxide emissions per kilometre are lower from diesel than from  petrol, nitrous oxide and particulate emissions from diesel are higher, even from ultra-low sulphur diesel. We have taken into account a balance of considerations.
<P>
Over the past couple of years, the fuel escalator has played an important role in helping the United Kingdom achieve our contribution to the environmental commitments made at Kyoto. The Chancellor announced in November, however, that it was time to change the way in which increases in fuel duties were determined. So in future decisions will be made on a Budget-by-Budget basis in the light of the social and economic considerations at the time. I hope that that answers the questions asked by the hon. Member for West Dorset. Given that we broadly expect to meet out Kyoto obligations, taking into account the increase in crude oil prices from  23 a barrel to  30 a barrel between the pre-Budget report and the Budget, the Chancellor decided that there should be no real-terms increase in the duty rates on hydrocarbon oil this year. The rate of duty on unleaded petrol has risen by 1.61p per litre, on higher octane unleaded petrol by 1.68p, and on leaded petrol by 1.8p. The other rates broadly cascade from that.
<P>
Hon. Members have invited me to enter again into the debate that we had this morning about the methodology followed in the calculation that led to the figure of 3.41 per cent. We have debated that subject exhaustively, and there is not a great deal more to be said about it. I refer hon. Members to box C1 on page 195, which we looked at this morning, which contains a comment about the assumptions on interest rates. No doubt hon. Members will want to pursue the matter here or elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. Does the noise that I hear emanating from another part of the Committee Room come from an electronic device?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that it comes from an electronic device. Would somebody please say whose it is, and turn it off. Is it coming from the green box? Mr. Jack, I am grateful to you for bringing it to my attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary say why he does not want to give us the figure? What prevents him from doing so? I am in genuine perplexity about this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We covered the matter exhaustively this morning. I have had the opportunity to dig out the NAO document on the audit of assumptions for the March 2000 Budget. The hon. Gentleman is right that the NAO's detailed consideration was carried out in 1997, when the Comptroller and Auditor General considered whether there were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>better alternative methods for projecting interest rates, including rules that describe how interest rates have been adjusted in the past by the authorities in respect of factors such as the difference between actual and target inflation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
His conclusion this year is that, as then, he has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no reason to believe that they offer methods that would be agreed on generally as offering superior results to those derived from market based financial information.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The comptroller and auditor general has reaffirmed his satisfaction on that point this year, and I am happy to accept his assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Financial Secretary is right to say that we made a lot of progress on the subject this morning, and I gave him credit for having been clear with the Committee as to how the figure was calculated. However, in the interests of transparency he should simply tell the Committee what, within the formula, was the figure by which on Budget day the Chancellor expected interest rates to rise? That is all that we are asking him. He acknowledged that the Chancellor expected the rates to rise; there must have been a number in the Chancellor's mind, as he produced the figure of 3.41 per cent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not have that calculation to hand. The figure used and referred to by the Chancellor was the 3.41 per cent. figure that is in the Red Book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I realise that the Financial Secretary may not have the figure in his pocket book. Perhaps he will undertake to write to hon. Members so that, in the interests of open government, we shall have a clear record of the figure that the Chancellor used on Budget day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The figure that the Chancellor used was 3.41 per cent., and that is the figure in the Red Book. I do not have the figure for which the right hon. Gentleman asks in my pocket book or on my laptop.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I wonder whether I might press the Financial Secretary. He prayed in aid part of the Red Book in responding to an earlier debate, and pointed to a table that refers to a three-month market forecast of expectations of interest rate. What is that figure and from where does it derive? That seems to be the key to the answer to my right hon. Friend's question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, the right hon. Gentleman is right. Box C1 on page 195 contains a reference to the three-month market rates. I am happy to write to hon. Members with that information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary, but I should like to be clear about what he has just undertaken to do for the Committee. It will represent a genuinely welcome step on the part of the Government that will allow us to make progress if he is to write to the Committee giving us the figure by which the Chancellor on Budget day expected interest rates to increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I propose to provide the data about market expectations referred to in box C1 on page 195.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made a couple of interesting points about the fuel duty aspects of the clause. Quite reasonably, he raised the anxieties of people in rural areas. We have always recognised that for many people, especially in rural areas, car ownership is a necessity rather than a luxury. That lies behind the proposed changes to VED, such as reductions for smaller and fuel-efficient cars with low emissions, which will be especially welcome for people who must have a car and people in rural areas.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton also referred to the freeze in duty on road fuel gas. Duty on road fuel gas was cut by 29 per cent. in the Budget last year--a substantial reduction. Since then, the number of dual-fuel--petrol and liquid petroleum gas--light vehicles has increased by 10,000. The number of refuelling sites has risen by 200 to 350, so it has more than doubled.
<P>
Gas-powered vehicles have many benefits. They emit significantly fewer pollutants than do vehicles using petrol or diesel. We hope that, by freezing duty rates following the sharp reduction last year, thus increasing the differential in favour of road fuel gases, we shall encourage manufacturers to increase distribution and availability of this highly environmentally friendly fuel. We also hope that the lower cost to the consumer of using that fuel will help offset the cost of vehicle conversion. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is right to draw attention to that aspect of the clause, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I add my welcome to you in chairing our proceedings, Dr. Clark, especially in the afternoon.
<P>
People who live in rural areas or are reliant on pensions that either do not increase or increase by considerably less than the income of those in work suffer the most from even allegedly inflation increases in such duties. Opposition Members do not feel that enough has been done to deal with the interests of those two groups. We welcome the different scales of licence, but pensioners are unlikely to renew old cars unless it is absolutely necessary.
<P>
The Minister alleged that the Road Haulage Association had welcomed the increase. The Road Haulage Association and the haulage industry heaved a great sigh of relief when the greatly ramped-up escalator was abandoned, but the fact that the differential in diesel duty between Britain and our near neighbours in continental Europe is currently some 33.1p per gallon means that the UK industry will continue to decline and to be subject to competition from round-tripping by continental hauliers, with which it cannot cope. The Government must accept that that is the price of having got hydrocarbon duties up to their present levels; the duties have increased some 32.5 per cent. in money terms in the three years since the Government came to power.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) said that duty constituted half the price of road fuel; it is in fact 80 per cent. of the price, after the increases, but I was interested in his suggestion that a more flexible formula might be possible for hydrocarbon duties. While the impact of significant increases in the price of fuel would be less--duty made up only 20 per cent. of the sale price in the past--it would certainly be good in terms of domestic inflation if there were a ratchet, as it were, that could be worked in both directions. When the Government were ratcheting up the price in the past, they did not expect the price of crude oil to increase when it did and that gave rise to immediate hardship on the haulage industry. I shall welcome hearing the Government's thoughts on whether there may be any scope in that territory.
<P>
Without rehearsing the arguments yet again, our main objection remains that either an increase will occur well in excess of inflation--3.41 per cent. is nearly 1 per cent. above the level of RPIX inflation--and the Government will thereby impose a stealth tax on to us, or the Government's expectations for the increase in mortgage interest rates are alarmingly high. We shall not be satisfied unless, by one means or another, the Committee knows precisely what increase in mortgage interest rates the Chancellor and the Government assumed in arriving at that figure of 3.41 per cent. The measures are either a bona fide attempt to limit the increase to the expected rate of inflation or a somewhat devious stealth tax. Until we are satisfied on that matter, the Opposition will not be satisfied with the measures being taken, even though we welcome the ending of the escalator and the VED adjustments that go with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to pick up a couple of the points made by the hon. Gentleman. I quoted the Freight Transport Association in my reference. I certainly do not agree that we have a declining freight industry; I have seen no evidence of that. I have seen evidence of strong competitive pressures in part of the road haulage industry, but competition is a good thing. We have an effective and efficient road haulage industry. I understand that, far from its being a declining industry, there is a shortage of drivers. The road haulage forum is considering the range of issues affecting the competitiveness of the industry, including the extent of cabotage, as was mentioned earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The cause of the shortage of drivers is the fact that drivers' wages are extraordinarily low in this country in comparison to their wages in other parts of Europe. They have not been increased as the industry has struggled to survive the increase in diesel costs. The number of people working in the industry has been significantly reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We have a strong haulage industry with some of the most efficient and, in terms of international comparison, effective haulage operations in Europe. It is a good industry, which is investing and developing, and I would not want to talk it down.
<P>
If we take all the factors into account, including not only fuel and VED but the fact that we have the best commercial tax environment in the European Union, the overall operating costs that hauliers in the United Kingdom face are broadly comparable with those in other member states. We continue to work on the road haulage forum towards detailed cost comparisons, and need to factor the effect of Budget changes into that work. Many factors are as important as, or more important than, fuel and VED in their effect on the competitive position of UK hauliers, such as relative levels of efficiency and labour costs.
<P>
Many believe that there is a large incidence of cabotage, by which I mean vehicles from outside the UK coming here to pick up loads and drop them off within the country. The evidence for that is scant. A survey took place in Ashford during January and February, at our instigation. The methodology was agreed with the representatives of the road haulage forum beforehand. The survey's conclusion was that less than 0.06 per cent. of domestic haulage is carried out by foreign hauliers. The real picture is different from that suggested by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Before lunch, I referred to the work of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, which, as the Financial Secretary will be aware, was commissioned by the Road Haulage Association after talks with the Government. That detailed survey found that the loss of revenue to the Government resulting from such cabotage was £1.2 billion a year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I believe that the Committee should take that figure with a pinch of salt in the light of the more recent study. The figure of 0.06 per cent. is consistent with that for the past few years. We have a good competitive haulage industry. Its competitiveness will be enhanced by the changes in the Budget, such as the reductions in lorry VED and the absence of a real-terms increase in fuel duty. I hope that the Committee will support the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 5, like the remaining clauses in this part of the Bill, is essentially technical. As I understand it, the main objective of the clause is to encourage a major switch to ultra-low sulphur unleaded petrol, which is analogous to the switch that occurred in recent years as a result of duty differences for unleaded petrol. The duty advantage that will be provided to ultra-low sulphur unleaded is 1p. Will the sale price, duty inclusive, be less than that of ordinary unleaded, or will the 1p, or a higher amount, carry through? Using the model with which the Conservative Government successfully introduced unleaded, I suggest that a duty advantage of more than lp per litre will be needed to accomplish the same shift with speed. What are the Government's expectations in terms of the shift to the new ultra-low sulphur unleaded?
<P>
The clause also gives the Treasury the power to change, by order, the specification of ultra-low sulphur petrol and ultra-low sulphur diesel. The explanatory notes state that the Government intend to consult with the trade, but why does the Treasury need such powers? Is it in the interests of the consumer or of the industry? Surely, we can live with such definitions year to year, from one Finance Bill to another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that clause 7, rather than clause 5, is relevant to the last set of issues to which the hon. Gentleman referred. A number of provisions have been made for the definitions to be changed by regulation. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point, which I shall be happy to deal with when we reach the relevant clause.
<P>
I do not think that this is a technical clause. It is much more than that. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it gives ultra-low sulphur petrol a duty incentive of 1p a litre over conventional unleaded petrol. European Commission legislation reduced the sulphur content of unleaded petrol to 150 parts per million from January this year. I am pleased to say that all UK refiners have met that requirement, so the time has come to look forward to the next change in specification, which will take effect from 1 January 2005.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the precedent of unleaded petrol, although, in many ways, the most impressive precedent is the duty incentive for ultra-low sulphur diesel, which already accounts for all of the UK road diesel market, five years ahead of the European requirement. We want ultra-low sulphur petrol to repeat that success story. It offers environmental benefits over conventional unleaded petrol, and rejuvenates--or cleans up--catalytic converters in the existing vehicle fleet. The duty incentive should encourage production and use of ultra-low sulphur petrol well before the 2005 deadline. It will also allow the introduction of advanced petrol engine technology, which can further improve fuel efficiency by up to 20 per cent. and is dependent on low sulphur fuel.
<P>
The specification for ultra-low sulphur petrol follows the current restrictions in the 2005 European petrol specification, which requires that the sulphur content is less than 50 parts per million, and that the aromatics content does not exceed 35 per cent. We shall, of course, keep that specification under review to reflect future changes. The target date for introducing the incentive is 1 October, and we are currently consulting the industry on the exact timing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked why the incentive was only 1p a litre. We think that that is sufficient to encourage manufacture and distribution of this cleaner fuel. Some companies are already selling ultra-low sulphur petrol, and will be grateful for the extra penny to offset development and production costs. We gave careful consideration to the representations that we received from oil companies in advance of the Budget, and concluded that an incentive of 1p a litre would have the desired effect. The selling price is a matter for oil companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Financial Secretary make clear whether changes to engines are necessary, as in the case of unleaded petrol? Can the new fuel be put straight into a conventional engine?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Existing engines require no adaptations to use the new fuel. However, in order to gain the additional fuel efficiency benefits of the next generation of petrol engines, ultra-low sulphur petrol will be necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am trying to determine how quickly the new fuel will take off. Do the Government expect the new low-sulphur petrol to cost the consumer the same, less or more, net of duty? If the Government want uptake of the new fuel to be as speedy and successful as that of low-sulphur diesel and unleaded petrol, one would expect them to want it to cost marginally less.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The selling price is a matter for the companies to determine.  There is a clue in the fact that BP has been selling ultra-low sulphur petrol at the same price as unleaded petrol in Edinburgh without the duty incentive.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
Mixing of rebated light oils
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I suggest that we debate clause 6 with schedule 1 stand part and, if necessary, vote on them at the end. I trust that members of the Committee will be content with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There is little controversy about the combination of clause 6 and schedule 1, which lay down that, if the new ultra-low sulphur petrol were mixed with other petrol after it had enjoyed the 1p duty advantage, it would become liable to duty at a higher rate. Such provisions merely support clause 5 and stop those measures from being used to achieve something other than the specific duty advantage of low-sulphur petrol. It is therefore likely that the Committee will support the measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The background to the provision is that, when the duty incentive for ultra-low sulphur diesel was introduced, it was discovered that some companies were manufacturing ultra-low sulphur diesel, delivering it, paying the lower rate of duty and then mixing it with conventional diesel. That diluted the environmental effects and detracted from the behavioural change that we wanted from the general public to make the product a success. In response to that, mixing restrictions to similar to those under schedule 1 were introduced to prevent such a practice from happening. That did the trick, so we repeated such provisions in the Bill. I imagine that the hon. Gentleman and all members of the Committee will be happy with that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that I said that schedule 1 could be debated with clause 6. Given that no member of the Committee appears to want to speak on schedule 1, I take it that all are content with it.

<H4><center>Power to amend definitions of types of hydrocarbon oil</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister is correct. It is clause 7, not clause 5, that gives the Treasury power to amend by statutory instrument, subject to positive resolution, the definition of what constitutes the various categories of hydrocarbon oil and the specifications thereof. I understand that the Treasury's powers are strictly limited to the make-up content of the fuels, not to the duty that would apply to those make-up contents. I repeat the question that was asked earlier: is the power really needed? It may be convenient if there are to be changes, possibly emanating from continental Europe, in the standard definitions of different hydrocarbon fuels, but I should have thought it quite livable with for the Government to address such an issue annually under Finance Bills. We should like to hear any overwhelming arguments, if there are any, for thus giving the Treasury yet further powers.
<P>
5.45 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that nothing draconian is going on. The clause gives the Treasury power to amend by order the specifications of ultra-low sulphur petrol, unleaded petrol, leaded petrol, higher octane unleaded petrol and ultra-low sulphur diesel. It will allow the entire process to be more flexible, and not linked to the annual Budget cycle. The new specification for ultra-low sulphur petrol that we have been discussing is a good example of how that might be important. That specification follows the current 2005 specification set out in the European fuel quality directive, which may change before 2005--discussions have not been finalised. Under the terms of the clause we will be able to amend the United Kingdom definition.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that, in the past, fuel specifications have not changed much from one year to the next but, with technological advances and increasing research into the envirornmental effects of some fuel ingredients, specifications are now under almost constant review. It is no longer appropriate to be able to change those things only once a year. However, I assure him that Customs and Excise will have the opportunity to consult the trade when appropriate, before the order is laid before the House. The House will be required to approve a resolution by the affirmative procedure before any order can come into force. The measure contains all the safeguards that one would wish to see. Therefore I hope that  the hon. Gentleman will be content.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are never content with the increasing powers of central Government, but the issue is not one that we wish to put to a vote. The Government must envisage the possibility of a change, between financial years, in the make-up of one of the fuels that we are discussing. I appreciate that technological advance is running apace, but it is unlikely that the Government will need to use that power in the foreseeable future. We accept that the Government will use it in good faith.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As I understand it, the purpose of the clause is to reverse a judgment last March by the Court Session in Edinburgh on the interpretation by Customs and Excise of the existing legislation on fines for breach of the rules for rebates on heavy oil as a road fuel. There are two different penalties of £250 each; the issue is whether two lots of £250 can be applied at the same time, or only one. The clause will mean that the fine can again be £500, when the Edinburgh judgment meant that there could only be a fine of £250 at one time. That appears to be satisfactory and complies with the original intent that there should be a possible fine of £500, but I would like the Minister to explain in more detail the circumstances in which those fines arise. I assume that if people fiddled on the rebate for heavy duty oil, the penalty would be larger than that sum and they would have to repay any rebate that they had taken illicitly. I would appreciate a little background to how the fines occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his wholly accurate account of the clause, which extends the civil penalty provisions that Customs and Excise may apply when it detects the misuse of rebated heavy oil as road fuel. Some categories of user have access to rebated heavy oil, but ordinary road users are not permitted to use it.
<P>
The legislation currently provides for the imposition of alternative penalties when first-time misuse is detected, either in the taking-in of rebated heavy oil to a road vehicle or in using rebated heavy oil as fuel for a road vehicle. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, on 5 March the Court of Session in Edinburgh determined that Customs and Excise's interpretation of the legislation was incorrect, and that the penalties for an individual were alternative rather than cumulative. The clause merely corrects that. Each penalty is in the amount of £250, which, if imposed alone, may not be enough of a deterrent to prevent misuse. The power to add penalties together to total £500, as was always the intention, will deter potential offenders to a much greater extent. The change will be especially welcomed by hauliers, to return to our earlier discussion, because it will deter the cowboy element of the haulage industry, which rears its head from time to time, from using cheaper "red diesel" when legitimate hauliers are using legitimate diesel.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Use of rebated heavy oil as fuel</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is another very specific clause, which is intended to prevent tractors from being used on public roads to haul trailers for any purpose other than agricultural activity while enjoying the advantages of low fuel duty for agricultural usage. The explanatory notes on the clause advise that the genuine farmer driving his tractor on the road will be safe from attack under the clause. However, a farm tractor might sometimes tow something other than agricultural equipment but nevertheless be engaged in farm business. For instance, what will happen in the case of a farm tractor towing a lorry load of cider apples to be converted into high-duty cider? I should like fuller confirmation that the changes in clause 9 will not have unfair side-effects on continued bona fide usage by farmers of road tractors.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I welcome you, Dr. Clark, to the Chair of the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs makes a good point. Farm tractors are often used not only for carrying agricultural produce or, indeed, for matters that are strictly germane to agricultural use. For example, they are used to carry machinery and for other activities not strictly covered by the definition of "agricultural". How flexibly and realistically will Customs and Excise interpret the provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause deletes the off-road tractor category from the list of vehicles that can legitimately use rebated heavy oil as fuel while travelling on the public road. However, I can reassure the Committee that it will not have any of the unwarranted side-effects that hon. Members have raised concerns about, because there is protection for those on agricultural business.
<P>
With effect from 1 May, we propose that off-road tractors will be removed from the legislation so that only tractors engaged in activities relating to agriculture, horticulture and forestry will be allowed to use rebated heavy oil when travelling on the public road. The farming industry will not be affected by the change and will still be able to fill its tractors with rebated fuel for agricultural activities. The measure means that owners of off-road tractors will not be able to undercut legitimate haulage businesses, which will operate lorries rather than tractors, by using rebated heavy oil as fuel to carry out short-haul haulage contracts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> This is a difficult point to get right. I am aware from my constituency that people in the haulage industry can get extremely upset when non-hauliers pay a subsidised rate of duty and carry out work that the haulage industry would otherwise perform. That is unfair competition. Nevertheless, genuine farmers and others employed in agriculture will make the occasional journey from farm A to farm B without necessarily carrying agricultural produce or goods. What comfort can the Financial Secretary give to such individuals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I entirely understand the hon. Gentleman's concern. He is right to point to the possibility, which has become more real, of unfair competition for hauliers. To use the example that we have referred to all day, we propose that a farm tractor towing cider apples could use "red diesel" as that would be an agricultural use. That will be the case when people tow their own farm's apples or if they do so as part of a farmers' co-operative arrangement. The clause will change nothing for farmers. Customs and Excise has an agreement with the National Farmers Union about what constitutes agricultural use, which should provide the protection that hon. Members seek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I do not believe that cider apples are a good example. On other occasions, such as--it may sound ludicrous--at carnival time, farmers might take a carnival float five or six miles into town on the back of a tractor. Perhaps that would contravene the provision. I could give other examples. There is nodding going on to your right, Dr. Clark, but I should be grateful to hear from the Financial Secretary that things will not go over the top when clause 9 is interpreted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Participation in the Torridge carnival would not qualify as an agricultural use. It would always have contravened the rules, so I hope that those who have participated in it over the years have not been using "red diesel" to tow their floats. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing to jeopardise the farming interests of his constituents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The most obvious problem that occurs to me would result from an individual driving his tractor between his home and his farm, towing nothing. That frequently happens in rural areas, and is the most important circumstance that could cause practical problems if the rules are too tight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> From the hon. Gentleman's description of that situation, that would count as an agricultural use and would not cause a problem.

<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The measure seems to be sensible, helpful and practical. It allows Customs and Excise some discretion when determining the precise proportions for lower duty oil that is delivered for home use, when the duty is considerably lower and when dye must be applied to determine the proportions. At present, the regulations state that if the proportion of dye were wrong, technically the whole fuel might not qualify for the lower duty. The clause will allow customs some flexibility when deciding the intent. That seems to be thoroughly sensible. I should be interested to know whether some practical issues have given rise to the need for the clause and what leeway customs will have in terms of the dye proportions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I might have been better advised to refer to the Torrington carnival, not the Torridge carnival. Given that Torrington is a town and a wider area, it is more likely to have a carnival.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Financial Secretary, but I must inform him that the town is called Great Torrington.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Well, now we know.
<P>
As for clause 10, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is right that we are trying to introduce some helpful flexibility. He asked why that was necessary, and I shall cite one recent example. Last year, it was discovered that someone's marker meter, which measures the marker into gas oil that is loaded on to rail trucks at a refinery, had been wrongly calibrated for a considerable period. As a result, gas oil had been delivered containing between 84 per cent. and 99 per cent. of the required marker. There was little revenue risk, because the gas oil still carried the bright red distinctive colour, so it would not have been appropriate to withdraw the rebate on oil that had been so treated. In fact, the rebate required under current legislation to be repaid to customs in such an instance would have been £65 million--a large sum. I am sure that it will be clear to the Committee why the clause is helpful and should be one that it can support.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This seems to be a further helpful measure, which exempts from duty the water content in emulsions of water in gas oil, which are used substantially by local pick-up delivery fleets, waste management vehicles and for urban short bus journeys. I should be interested to know how material that will be in terms of an incentive to the use of emulsions of water in gas oil. I assume also that such emulsions are environmentally more friendly than even the new forms of diesel and unleaded petrol. What financial incentive will the measure give to the usage of such environmentally friendly substances?

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It turns out that oil and water can mix. Water diesel emulsion is a new, environmentally friendly fuel in which water is suspended in the oil, as opposed to normal emulsion, in which oil particles are suspended in water. The water is not used as a fuel but  assists fuel dispersion in the engine. It lowers the combustion temperature and reduces nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions, both of which are of particular concern in urban areas--at which the use of this fuel is particularly aimed. It is targeted at centrally located fleets that are able to refuel from a central point--pick-up and delivery fleets, urban and school buses, and waste vehicles, for example--and early tests show that an emulsion fuel with a water content of 10 per cent. gives a 9 per cent. reduction in nitrogen oxide compared with ultra-low sulphur diesel and a minimum of 19 per cent. reduction in particulates. It therefore offers a substantial improvement.
<P>
To introduce the concession, we need a derogation under article 8(4) of EEC directive 92/81, to enable us to exempt the water content in such emulsions from excise duty. Unfortunately, that approval has not yet been received so the measure will come into effect not from Budget day but from Royal Assent. The French Government have applied for and been granted a derogation under that article, to allow them to do something similar. The product is already in use in France; at the end of April 1998, more than 70 buses and coaches were running on water-diesel emulsion there. No problems arose from those on-road experiments, which were operated by bus companies in cities such as Chambery and Lyon. Two UK companies, Elf and Lubrizol, are involved in the manufacture and development of those emulsions.
<P>
Once again, we are using the taxation system to encourage the development and use of environmentally-friendly fuels. The measure makes it economically viable for companies to develop and produce that emulsion. That is yet further evidence of our commitment to improving urban air quality, and I hope that the Committee will welcome it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does the Minister know what the innovation is worth in terms of money and what the financial incentive of exempting the water content will be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am sure that I do know that. If the hon. Gentleman will give me a moment to gather my thoughts on the subject--now I do know. Water is 10 per cent. of the emulsion, so that amounts to a 10 per cent. reduction in the duty due.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> So it is 4p.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Roughly. It is 10 per cent. off.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
