<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000435"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
(Mr. David Kidney):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Atkinson. I was asked a question by the hon. Member for
Northampton, South and I did not have the information immediately
before me. If it is in order, Mr. Atkinson, I shall just say
now that the budget for the advertising campaign called &#147;Act on
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#148;, shared between five Departments and the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is as follows: in
2007-08, &#163;5.5 million; in 2008-09, &#163;13 million; and in
the current financial year, &#163;10 million. My Department&#146;s
share of those costs is &#163;15
million.</div><a name="10011484000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000436"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Atkinson. It is always appreciated when the Minister clarifies things,
as he has just done.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="10011484000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am conscious
that we are debating a group of amendments here. This is an important
issue, which seeks to put right an injustice and an unfairness that has
affected large numbers of people throughout the country, through no
fault of their own. As the hon. Member for Sherwood and others well
know, the purpose is to expand the scheme that assists people who have
to pay more than 10 per cent. of their income on fuel bills to include
those who are not on the gas mains. The amendment seeks to add to the
list in clause 8, which currently
states:</div><a name="10011484000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
support scheme may apply
to&#151;</div><a name="10011484000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
licensed gas
suppliers,</div><a name="10011484000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
licensed electricity suppliers, or</div>
<a name="10011484000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) both
licensed gas suppliers and licensed electricity
suppliers&#148;.</div><a name="10011484000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would add two more
categories&#151;</div><a name="10011484000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;
(d) licensed suppliers of liquid petroleum gas for domestic
use;</div><a name="10011484000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e)
licensed suppliers of fuel oil for domestic
use.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman will no doubt argue in a minute that it should be
widened to its broadest extent, and we support his amendment.</div>
<a name="10011484000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
definition of who is licensed and how the industry works is, of course,
different for people who deliver in bulk to the back door, gate, yard
or farm entrance, and those who deliver through a pipeline to the
property. There is not the same arrangement of the big utilities. This
is probably going to be a probing amendment, so that we get agreement
on the principle. All of us, with our colleagues from the Scottish
National party and Labour party&#151;I am not suggesting that the
Conservatives do not support this extension&#151;would be happy to
work together on getting the drafting right, as long as we can get the
principle agreed on
Report.</div><a name="10011484000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will make three simple points on the issue. First, the latest figures
show that the average energy bill will soon approach a record
&#163;1,000 a year. All the figures I have seen in recent years
suggest that those who are not on the gas mains&#151;and therefore
rely on fuel oil or Calor gas&#151;have higher than average bills.
That category regularly appears at the top of the league tables. I hope
the Minister will be able to confirm that. As he may have more accurate
and up-to-date figures than we do, it would be helpful if he put on the
record what his Department works on as the basis of the average bill
for people across the UK with that sort of non-gas energy supply. He
may also have figures that differentiate between the four countries of
the UK, which would also be helpful; I know that a lot of the four
countries&#146; records on this issue are kept separately.</div>
<a name="10011484000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there are significant numbers of people in that category. In a written
question on 14 September last year to the Secretary of State of Energy
and Climate Change, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and
Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy)
asked:</div><a name="10011484000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;what
recent estimate he has made of the number of households designated as
being in fuel poverty which use <i class="I">(a)</i> heating oil, 
<i class="I">(b)</i> liquefied petroleum gas, <i class="I">(c)</i> mains gas and <i class="I">(d)</i>
other systems of
heating&#148;.</div><a name="10011484000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister of State
replied:</div><a name="10011484000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
most recently available fuel poverty statistics relate to 2006. Figures
for the number of households in fuel poverty in England are produced
from analysis of the English House Condition
Survey.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 14 September 2009; Vol.
496, c. 2120W.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div><a name="10011484000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figures that she
gave were as follows: 202,000 households in fuel poverty use heating
oil, 36,000 use bulk liquid petroleum gas, 1,669,000 are on the mains
and 525,000 are in other categories&#151;a total of 2,432,000, nearly
two and a half million people.</div>
<a name="10011484000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
English figures. There are figures collected separately, in different
ways, in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I do not have the most
recent figures and my second request to the Minister is that he put on
the record the latest figures for each of those countries, so that
those who follow these debates with interest, and who see this as a
very important issue, can be absolutely clear about the numbers of
people we talking about.</div>
<a name="10011484000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
point is that one reason why this is a regular cause of concern is that
until now, a customer who purchased both fuels&#151;gas and
electricity&#151;from the same supplier would often be offered a dual
fuel discount. That, of course, is not an opportunity open to people
who cannot get their gas from the same supplier because the same
supplier has not got piping to reach them.</div>
<a name="10011484000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point
really concerns people who have been consistently disadvantaged and
prejudiced against. We will come later to the debate on how to ensure
that everybody has the lowest possible tariff and the discussion on
trying to ensure that everybody is given not just the best information
so that they can choose, but the same opportunity to access cheap fuel,
irrespective of the means of payment. There would then be no prejudice
against people who pay by prepayment, as opposed to direct debit. The
dual fuel advantage is one that can apply only to certain categories of
people, and we are trying to make sure that that is not a
disadvantage.</div><a name="10011484000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
(Danny Alexander) regularly raises that point with Ministers. He did so
as recently as last week, because in big rural constituencies such as
his&#151;certainly in Northern Ireland, Scotland, rural Wales and
rural England&#151;whole communities are in the category that I have
been discussing. The Minister knows that.</div>
<a name="10011484000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
really important to very large numbers of people who, at the moment,
pay the highest amount of money to keep warm, to keep the electricity
on and look after their households. I hope that the Minister will be
sympathetic. The hon. Member for Sherwood, with all his experience and
authority as Chair of the Sub-Committee on Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, will, I hope, weigh in on that persuasively in a minute to
make sure that his Ministers understand.</div>
<a name="10011484000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister can be positive, that will be widely well received, by not
just the Committee and all the parties, but very large numbers of
people outside. Here is an early popularity in the new year for a
Minister whom we respect. We have told him we wish him well. This is
the chance for him to do himself good, so that we can congratulate him.
We look forward to a positive, enthusiastic and entirely committed
response.</div>
<a name="10011484000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011484000437"></a><b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman has
interpreted my intentions correctly. I agree entirely with all his
positive points about my colleagues the Minister and the Minister of
State. They will respond appropriately, because they are both well
aware that this is a tough issue to resolve, particularly in relation
to those who are not on the gas grid.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div><a name="10011484000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 26
to 29 are tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger). We both
represent semi-rural areas and are familiar with the problems faced by
people who are not on the gas mains. It is clear to me and to the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey that people in that group are
disadvantaged, because they have to rely on LPG and other measures that
are not in the regulated market. There is a good deal of evidence to
show that prices have increased above inflation in recent years and it
is also apparent that those people get the social tariff dividend only
for their electricity
bill.</div><a name="10011484000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will sketch a little more of the context. People go to the countryside
to retire. There are no figures available for that, but it is pretty
clear that there is a large group of elderly people who are
disadvantaged. The hon. Member for Wealden made a point this morning
about housing in rural areas. It is extremely difficult, if not
impossible, to bring many houses in rural areas up to the required
standard. It is therefore important that we take steps to help people
in that
position.</div><a name="10011484000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to discuss the principle involved. The Minister knows that
something needs to be done, and I am using this opportunity to probe
and push a little, and to tell him that he needs to look carefully at
the issue to try to find a resolution. Other steps have already been
taken, such as the extension of Warm Front and the use of
microgeneration, but this is a big and important issue. I hope that the
Minister will listen to the debate and to the hon. Member for Angus,
take on board the Committee&#146;s views, consult widely and return
with a good solution for a warm new year for people who are not on
the  gas
grid.</div><a name="10011484000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011484000438"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I think we are all trying to get
to the same place with these amendments. Amendment 21 stands in my name
and approaches the issue from an angle slightly different from that of
the other amendments in the group. I will explain why after saying
something about the issue itself.</div>
<a name="10011484000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I represent a
largely rural area, and many of my constituents do not have access to
the gas network&#151;with the best will in the world, they never
will; it will never go to the glens of Angus and the islands of
Scotland, however much it is extended in future. Many of my
constituents have no option but to use LPG, home fuel gas or some other
alternative
fuel.</div><a name="10011484000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been estimated that some 4.3 million consumers, mostly but not
exclusively in rural areas, are not on the gas network. In some areas,
although the gas network may technically be available, the cost of
connecting to it is outwith the means of many consumers; they simply
cannot afford to connect to the network.</div>
<a name="10011484000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumers who
are off the gas network face particular problems. As the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey said, a typical gas bill is now
rising to around &#163;1,000 a year, but I understand that it has
been estimated that those who are off grid are facing bills of around
&#163;1,700 a year. Although the hon. Member for Sherwood mentioned
many of the excellent schemes to help insulation and energy efficiency,
many of the homes in rural areas are hard-to-treat homes, which further
exacerbates their position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div><a name="10011484000399"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="10011484000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
to deal with the problems of the people affected has long been a matter
of frustration to me. They do not have access to the social tariffs
that the customers of mains gas can access. I accept that, as the
Minister has said, they can access the social tariffs available to
electricity consumers, but the fact of the matter is that many off-grid
consumers use home fuel oil or LPG as the main fuel for heating their
homes and water, and that is likely to be the major part of their
energy spend. The Department&#146;s &#147;Annual Report on Fuel
Poverty Statistics 2009&#148;, chapter 4, page 21, states:</div>
<a name="10011484000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
highest proportion of fuel poverty is amongst households without gas,
where nearly 23 per cent of households are fuel poor, compared to
around 17 per cent of both standard credit and pre-payment meter
customers.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011484000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would add that in
Scotland the situation may be slightly worse due to the geography and
lack of grid in the highlands and islands. According to the latest
Scottish house conditions
survey:</div><a name="10011484000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Households
that use electricity, oil or other fuel types (such as coal or peat)
are around twice as likely as those who use gas to experience fuel
poverty. Also, those who use...&#145;other fuel types&#146;
(not gas or electricity) are more than twice as likely to experience
extreme fuel poverty than gas
users&#148;</div><a name="10011484000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the point made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey, I should say that I understand that the number of off-grid
customers in fuel poverty in Scotland is around
116,000&#151;about  47 per cent. of those who are
off-grid.</div><a name="10011484000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Citizens
Advice produced a paper for the debate on Second Reading and it took up
the issue. I will not quote from it at length but I refer hon. Members
to the case that it cites from south Wales of someone who could no
longer afford fuel because it had gone up from &#163;150 a few years
ago to &#163;750. Citizens Advice also raised the issue, which many
of my constituents face, of people having to buy a full tank because it
is difficult to get smaller deliveries. It cites a case from
Northumberland of neighbours trying to gang together to have one tank
to serve all the houses but they could not get a supplier to do it,
which seems completely
perverse.</div><a name="10011484000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are many other issues that intensify the problem&#151;for example,
bulk deliveries, as I mentioned. Many people have to pay substantial
sums&#151;Citizens Advice quotes &#163;740&#151;up front to get a
delivery. It is often impossible for people on low incomes to come up
with that money. They simply cannot do it, which means that many are
forced to go without heat and hot water. Even if they can pay, problems
can occur. One thing that has not come to attention in the recent bad
weather is the fact that it has been very difficult for the fuel
supplies to get through. If someone has a gas pipe and an electricity
supply, the chances are that their energy will get through unless the
conditions are particularly extreme. If they need fuel and the roads
are blocked, it is a different matter because they cannot get the
deliveries through. That has been a problem in some parts of the
highlands.</div><a name="10011484000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
an aside&#151;I know that this is outwith the Minister&#146;s
competence&#151;we have to consider thinking outside the box on these
issues, so should we look at how the winter fuel payment is made? It
might be better for off-grid customers for the payments to be made in
the late summer or early autumn when they could get the oil more
cheaply and fill up their tanks for the winter when it is affordable If
they get the money in the winter, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>cost is greater and they cannot afford it. That would not cost the
Treasury money, but it would be one way of tackling the
problem.</div>
<a name="10011484000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The plain
fact is that those consumers who rely on other types of fuel often fall
between the cracks of the measures to introduce social tariffs. I have
pursued that issue for many years. I served with the hon. Member for
Northampton, South on the Business and Enterprise Committee, and in
2008, we produced a report that
said:</div><a name="10011484000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned that there is not sufficient regulatory oversight of the
market for domestic fuel for households which are not connected to the
gas
network.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
called for more action but, unfortunately, the Office of Fair Trading
concluded that the market was working satisfactorily. There is still no
effective intervention in the market. It seems that everyone simply
takes the view that it is too difficult to take action but, given the
statistics on fuel poverty in that group, that view is simply
unacceptable, and we must find a way to
help.</div><a name="10011484000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
main problem is that the structure of the market for such fuels is very
different from that for mains electricity and gas, which are, of
course, dominated by the big six energy companies. The market for other
fuels is much more diffuse and difficult to regulate, although I
question whether in many areas there is real competition. Therefore, we
need to look at more radical solutions to tackle the whole problem. I
fully support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey, to which I added my name, and which is also
backed by the hon. Member for Sherwood. However, I wish to propose
another option for consideration, which does not revolve around clause
8 but around clause 10, and would provide the opportunity to introduce
a more all-encompassing scheme to help people in fuel
poverty.</div><a name="10011484000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the purpose of clause 10 is to allow the Secretary of
State to introduce a reconciliation mechanism that means that, should
one company have more fuel-poor customers than others it would not be
particularly badly hit: the burden would be spread among all the
companies so that each would meet, as far as possible, an equitable
amount of the cost of meeting the obligations under the social tariff.
That principle is a good one, and it could be extended further to bring
in all fuel suppliers, to allow a general sharing of the burden of the
cost of meeting obligations to help the fuel
poor.</div><a name="10011484000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier, one of the problems with the market is that the
suppliers are in many cases fairly small, and it would be very
difficult to introduce individual social tariff mechanisms for each of
them. However, a general reconciliation mechanism that brought those
suppliers within the ambit of the scheme, but which allowed the overall
cost to be shared between all the energy suppliers, would enable us to
make progress and extend the social tariff concept to that very
disadvantaged
group.</div><a name="10011484000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
main purpose of my amendment is simply to bring such consumers into
that more general reconciliation fund to bring about more fairness and
to tackle fuel poverty. In deciding to press ahead with such a scheme,
the Secretary of State should bring in all the suppliers of all forms
of energy and allow all their customers to benefit from the scheme. As
well as ensuring that no energy company was disproportionately hit by
having too many fuel-poor customers, it would make it possible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>to share out the benefits more widely, and would ensure that all energy
suppliers could operate the equivalent social tariff for their
customers, whether they were in receipt of electricity, gas or other
forms of fuel. Ministers might be attracted by the fact that it would
be a revenue-neutral approach for the Treasury; it would not impose a
greater burden on it.</div>
<a name="10011484000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can hear
the howls of protest from the major energy companies at my suggestion,
but I believe that it is a way to tackle an intractable problem. I
recognise that through the years, the Government have taken measures to
try to alleviate fuel poverty and to deal with social tariffs, but the
group in question has consistently been left out and there is a fuel
poverty problem in rural areas in particular as a result. I am not
suggesting that my proposal is the be-all and end-all, but I float the
idea and think that it is worth considering whether we could come up
with a mechanism to achieve the end I have in mind&#151;not
necessarily by means of my amendment, but by some similar
approach.</div><a name="10011484000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011484000439"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): The Minister will have seen the
extent of cross-party agreement&#151;including, to a substantial
extent, among Labour Members&#151;about the changes that are being
proposed. It is an opportunity for us to give a significant amount of
help to 5 million households that suffer badly at the moment. According
to my figures, they pay about a third more for their overall energy use
than people on the gas and electricity mains. There are issues that
need to be dealt with, on which further help and support is undoubtedly
required.</div><a name="10011484000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figures also show that 15 per cent. of people who are off-grid for gas,
and particularly those who use heating oil, are in fuel poverty,
compared with a figure more generally of less than half of that
percentage. We all recognise that there is a group of people whom we
have the opportunity to help, and I hope that the Minister will respond
positively.</div><a name="10011484000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is often a tendency to think that a Bill must come out of Committee
exactly as it went in, but I hope that on this occasion the Government
will see that we are considering a substantial proportion of the
population who suffer badly and need help, and that what is proposed is
an opportunity to give them that help. Of course, the proposed changes
would not determine how the Minister should impose regulations. There
would be scope for him to determine how and at what level measures
should be implemented. There would be significant leeway, but the
provisions would simply bring within the scope of the Bill a section of
the community who have had a pretty rough time, and whom we are all
keen to help further.</div>
<a name="10011484000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011484000440"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Phil Willis</b> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD): I support
amendment 9, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey. Although I generally support the amendments tabled by
the hon. Members for Sherwood and for Angus, they involve specific
difficulties, which they have both acknowledged. Indeed, there is also
a difficulty with amendment 9, which my hon. Friend the Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey and I have
discussed.</div><a name="10011484000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must declare an interest. I know that the hon. Member for Wealden was
referring to my home when he mentioned large stately homes in Yorkshire
this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>morning. The last time that my hon. Friend the Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey visited, we had to open the east wing
specifically for him. He remarked, however, that it was quite chilly,
and the reason for that is that we use domestic burning oil to heat our
humble dwelling. Indeed, I have today purchased 1,000 litres of
domestic burning oil for &#163;520, which is 52p a litre. That was
roughly the best price I could get. However, when I purchased 1,000
litres of oil on 16 November&#151;this is just for the east
wing&#151;I paid 37.5p per litre, so in the space of two months the
price has gone up about 38 per cent. If that applied to gas or other
forms of electricity, there would be absolute outrage and motions would
be tabled in the House. The effect is sparse, however, because of the
communities in which people live. We do not have a gas main, because it
has not been extended from York&#151;it cannot get up the hill. The
reality is that this is a very serious
issue.</div><a name="10011484000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem, for me, is who we should regard as the suppliers. For example,
most of the people who supply oil to me and to other people are small
companies that take the oil from the main distribution depots, add a
premium, then sell it. That is how the system works. We should,
however, regard large oil companies as the suppliers, because that is
what they are. Shell and BP provide most of the market for domestic
burning oil&#151;the same applies to gas with companies such as
Calor&#151;which gives us a different view of the actual suppliers.
In his response to the amendment, I urge the Minister not to get hung
up on the issue of licensed suppliers being the people who put the oil
or gas into a tank. We should look at the large companies, because they
are the main wholesalers of those commodities. That would help us when
considering the amendments. My difficulty with the amendments tabled by
the hon. Member for Sherwood is they would apply to coal or to solid
fuel. I do not think it beyond the wit of Ministers to look at
suppliers in a different sense from that adopted by the
industry.</div><a name="10011484000064"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000441"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I thank all hon. Members who have contributed to
this valuable debate. If people expect me to say that I want the Bill
to change the whole post-privatisation settlement of the utilities, I
am afraid that I am going to disappoint them. I will resist such
amendments. On the other hand, if people want to hear me say that we
are doing all we can, including measures in the Bill, to help people
who are off the mains gas grid and in fuel poverty, the answer is a
resounding yes. I am positively with hon. Members on
that.</div><a name="10011484000400"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="10011484000365"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I
want to remind the Committee of a couple of things. First, I am aware
of the seriousness of the problem, through my work both as a Minister
and as a constituency MP. Like all hon. Members, I am invited each year
during warm homes week to visit constituents who have a problem keeping
their homes warm or who have recently had help making them warm. Last
year, I visited an elderly husband and wife, in a village off the gas
grid, who had been helped by Warm Front to replace their heating
system, with oil in that case. We talked about the huge difficulties in
finding the up-front costs of replenishing their supplies, the problem
of oil being dearer than gas and how much better it would be to have
access to cheaper energy. That is something that I would like to deal
with in a moment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div><a name="10011484000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want to
talk about targeting fuel-poor households. I regret the absence in this
country of reliable, accurate information to enable us to target
households in fuel poverty as much as we should. We know, in general,
that there is a high incidence of fuel poverty among pensioners, among
those in the greatest financial poverty and among those who are off the
gas grid. It is not impossible for a household to be in all three of
those classes at the same time. I accept the premise that there is a
high incidence of fuel poverty in areas where people are off the gas
grid and that we need to do as much for that group as for any other. In
some cases, there are practical difficulties, especially with isolated
rural communities. The hon. Member for Angus mentioned the difficulty
for lorries of getting supplies through in times of snow, for example.
Sometimes there are more or special reasons to give help in those
cases, and I appreciate that.</div>
<a name="10011484000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to run
through the kind of things that are being done, either through the Bill
or otherwise, that give help in those circumstances. First, the Bill
proposes, as several Members have adverted to in their contributions,
to give help to people in fuel poverty through their electricity bills.
Clearly, one reason we chose that method for delivering help is so that
it reaches everybody&#146;s home, including those who are off the gas
grid. If we had said that we wanted to reduce everybody&#146;s
tariff, those in an area off the gas grid would not benefit from a low
tariff for gas. This way, everybody benefits from the
scheme.</div><a name="10011484000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another point I would like to make. I do not suggest it is my
thinking but it could come out of the debate that we have over the
consultation. Clause 8, if left as it is, is sufficiently wide to say
that the amount off the electricity bill could be different for
different groups of people who are in fuel poverty. If it became the
will of Parliament and the will of the public, there could be a higher
rebate on the electricity bill for people in fuel poverty and off the
grid. The fact that that is a possibility in the Bill is my best
defence for saying that people do not need to amend the Bill in order
to do more things to help in that situation. Recognising the group and
its difficulty is what needs to be done, not changing the law as
drafted in the Bill. That is just one measure to help people who are in
fuel poverty and off the gas
grid.</div><a name="10011484000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
measure, I would remind people, is included in the fuel poverty
strategy. The Government made a commitment to deliver mains gas to more
fuel-poor households without access. In the next five-year price
settlement, as a result of that strategy, Ofgem provided incentives for
the energy companies to deliver a mains gas supply to more people in
fuel poverty in off-gas areas.</div>
<a name="10011484000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000442"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the Minister is saying, but the
difficulty with that concept is that there are large areas of the
country where that is simply impossible. There is no gas grid in much
of the highlands of Scotland; there has never been a grid in the
islands of Scotland. The same will be true of other remote areas in
England and Wales. Although that measure may help a few people, the
vast bulk of the people affected are not anywhere near a gas
main.</div><a name="10011484000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000443"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I accept that point but, nevertheless, if some are
helped by this means, it is a positive contribution. This week, Ofgem
delivered news of a new scheme and stated:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="10011484000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Almost
20,000 households could be connected to the mains gas network due to
new partnerships between gas distribution networks...and agencies
that provide grants for central heating systems or help to make homes
more energy
efficient.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
might be a small number in the context of the big number, but it shows
a contribution to meeting the need that everybody in the Committee
wants to meet.</div>
<a name="10011484000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
on to those circumstances in which such a scheme would be impossible.
We foresee the possibility of helping people by providing alternatives
to the expensive energy sources on which they currently depend. For
example, under Warm Front in England, there are pilots of solar thermal
energy and air source heat pumps. They may prove successful and popular
over time, and help people to change their heating systems. On that
point, the introduction of feed-in tariffs this April and a renewable
heat incentive next April, would make those much more attractive
options for people in fuel poverty off the mains gas grid. I wanted to
draw those matters to everybody&#146;s attention. Those are the kind
of things that are being done and could be done under the Bill without
the amendments.</div>
<a name="10011484000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Angus reminded us of the difficulties that some fuel-poor
households experience in finding the up-front costs for fuel delivery.
We heard evidence from National Energy Action last week about a project
sponsored by my Department working with credit unions to deliver an
affordable means of assisting people in that situation to spread the
cost of their up-front purchase. We are waiting for the results from
the project in March, but I am hopeful that it will be of
assistance.</div>
<a name="10011484000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return
to what I intended to say before I heard everybody else&#146;s
contributions. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked
me about statistics. I do not have a great deal of information to add
above what we have heard. We know that people in areas off the gas grid
pay more for their fuel, and about 20 per cent. of the fuel-poor live
off-grid. We heard what that means for households in Scotland from the
hon. Member for Angus; in England, the equivalent figure is 616,000
households.</div><a name="10011484000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked about the
discounts offered to dual fuel customers that are not available for
those who live off the gas grid. I remind him of Ofgem&#146;s retail
energy market probe, which found that some discounts given to dual fuel
customers were much more than was justified by any objective reasoning.
One licence condition that came out of that probe outlawed those
excessive benefits. That is a way of assuring people who are off the
gas grid that they are not subsidising those who have the advantage of
the discounts. I remind hon. Members that later in the Bill there are
additions to Ofgem&#146;s powers and to those of the Secretary of
State that address the problem, so the matter is already being
addressed.</div><a name="10011484000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000444"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I thank the Minister for confirming the England
figures. Can he give us the Northern Ireland and Wales figures, either
now or at the earliest convenient moment after the Committee, so we
have the complete
picture?</div><a name="10011484000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
what the Minister says mean that if a customer has the dual fuel option
from the same supplier, they do not still have an advantage because
they get a discount? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>There has been a probe and a conclusion, but those customers still
benefit through the reduction of their electricity, or other fuel, bill
in a way that someone who has no access to mains gas
cannot.</div>
<a name="10011484000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000445"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> On the first point, I will do my best on
collecting more statistics and giving them to the Committee. On the
second point, I reject any suggestion that no good has come of the
probe, if that is what the hon. Gentleman is saying. A justifiable
commercial discount is permitted but anything more than that that is
prejudicial to customers has been outlawed by a licence condition
change for the energy
suppliers.</div><a name="10011484000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000446"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that. I do not want to disagree, but
I want to be clear. Customers who are off the mains have a disadvantage
in the cost of their electricity, because they cannot get the discount
they could get if they had access to, and bought, gas and electricity
from the same supplier. That is not as anti-competitive as it was from
the point of view of the supplier, but from the point of view of the
customer there is still a clear, inherent disadvantage in having access
to only one source of supply from that
supplier.</div><a name="10011484000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000447"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> My point is that not only has the inherent
discrimination been outlawed, but the distinction in the amount of the
benefit is much
reduced.</div><a name="10011484000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have spent quite a lot of time directly addressing the points raised in
the debate, and I now want to deal with the amendments. Amendments 9,
26, 27 and 28 all aim to broaden the types of fuel supplier that the
scheme can apply to. Amendment 29 aims to ensure that the benefits
provided under social price support schemes could include lower charges
for heating oil or solid fuel. Amendment 21 aims to include suppliers
of LPG or fuel oil in the reconciliation mechanism that we intend to
introduce under clause 10 to ensure the equitable distribution among
suppliers of the costs of social price support schemes. In addressing
those amendments, I want to show some of the practical constraints with
the
proposals.</div><a name="10011484000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers proposed under the Bill for schemes to reduce fuel poverty refer
to licensed gas and electricity suppliers, as hon. Members
acknowledged. Those suppliers are licensed under the Electricity Act
1989 and the Gas Act 1986. There is, however, no comparable licensing
regime for the suppliers of heating oil, compressed natural gas, LPG or
solid
fuel.</div><a name="10011484000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that difference in regulatory regimes is that the
electricity transmission system and gas pipe networks are both natural
monopolies. As hon. Members will know, the risk arising from such
natural monopolies is that the networks might be unfairly exploited.
That is why, in the Acts to privatise those publicly-owned utilities, a
system of regulation was established. Ofgem is the independent economic
regulator. It has a duty to protect customers, and one of the key tools
it has to do that is using the licensing regime to ensure that
suppliers comply with certain rules.</div>
<a name="10011484000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In contrast,
a significant number of operators are involved in the distribution of
heating oil, LPG, compressed natural gas or solid fuel for domestic
use, and there is an open and competitive market. There is no
equivalent network monopoly operation. For example, there are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>more than 200 distributors of heating oil, and around 15,000 outlets
retailing LPG to consumers, many of which are small and medium-sized
companies, as has been acknowledged in the
debate.</div><a name="10011484000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">General
consumer protection legislation, such as the Consumer Protection from
Unfair Trading Regulations 2008,<i class="I"> </i>and competition law apply to
this sector. We believe that regulation is appropriate and
proportionate, and for those who want it tested by an outside body, let
us remember that in 2004 the market was referred to the Competition
Commission and the result, only five years later, is that, by and
large, it is competitive. Two orders were made on permitting switching
and giving more transparency of information to
customers.</div><a name="10011484000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
designing our policy around licensed gas and electricity suppliers, we
bring many practical and cost-effective benefits. Those include the use
of an existing licensing and enforcement regime, an independent
regulator with a duty to protect consumers and expert knowledge of the
industry. We believe that setting up a new regulatory regime for
heating oil, LPG, compressed natural gas or solid fuel for domestic use
would take a disproportionate amount of time and money. That seems
especially true given that we have identified an alternative, more
cost-effective way to help fuel-poor customers who are off the gas
grid. For example, subject to consultation, in summer 2010 our
intention is to focus social price support on electricity accounts.
That will ensure that eligible households can benefit from the policy,
irrespective of the fuel the household use to heat their
home.</div>
<a name="10011484000401"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="10011484000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
suppliers participating in social price support schemes will most
likely pass the costs of participation and providing benefits on to
their customers. The costs of setting up a new regulatory regime for
the heating fuels covered by this amendment would also be likely to be
passed to consumers. There is, therefore, a risk that including those
suppliers of heating oil, LPG, compressed natural gas or solid fuel
would simply add to the already high prices, which hon. Members are
telling me are too high, faced by consumers who are off the gas
grid.</div><a name="10011484000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000448"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> That is not the most compelling point the
Minister has ever made in his time as an Energy Minister. We have not
been afraid of piling costs on customers&#146; bills and I ask him to
be careful with that argument.</div>
<a name="10011484000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000449"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I take that reminder from my hon. Friend. After
all, we talked about a levy on all consumers&#146; electricity bills
for clean coal. Under the renewable heat incentive, which I mentioned,
the suppliers we are talking about here would be required to charge a
levy on all their customers for the payments under that incentive. I am
not afraid or lacking in courage in imposing those costs, but we ought
to take into account what they might be and who might have to pay for
them.</div><a name="10011484000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
this debate, where the complaint is that the costs are already
punishingly high for some people, we are talking about taking steps
that would add to those costs. That is a factor that we should take
into account.
</div><a name="10011484000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000450"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Does the Minister not accept that if one were to
put the people who are not on the gas main into the same position as
somebody who is by trying to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>deal with those who spend more than 10 per cent. of their income on fuel
bills, there would have to be a differential subsidy on the electricity
bill and the difference would have to reflect the additional cost of
the other fuel for those who are not on the gas
main?</div><a name="10011484000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems to me that unless the Minister is willing to go further than
saying, &#147;We have the power, potentially, to have differential
support&#148;, and unless he is willing to say, &#147;We completely
understand the point; we will have a differential payment for those off
the gas main and it will reflect the difference in cost&#148;, he
will not meet the point about the lack of fairness, which is at the
core of the
debate.</div><a name="10011484000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000451"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I thought I was following the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, but he lost me by the end. Perhaps that is my
difficulty in understanding what he said, rather than the way he
described it. If clause 8 is left as it is, there will be the
facility&#151;if we decide, in the end, to proceed in this
way&#151;to pay an additional amount to people in fuel poverty and
off the mains gas grid. By &#147;we&#148;, I mean Ministers,
Parliament and the public, through the
consultation.</div><a name="10011484000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, that would meet the basic point that people are asking
me about and give extra help to those people, without the steps that
would need to be taken under the amendments. If the hon. Gentleman is
saying that we would then, as well as having differential payments,
have differential collections from people&#146;s bills, that does not
follow at all from what I said. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> He

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000452"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I think the Minister is trying to be very helpful
here and I realised, as the hon. Member for Sherwood began his remarks,
that this is a very difficult area. If it was easy, we would have done
something about it before. However, it seems to me that the Minister is
shying away from this difficult issue, rather than trying to achieve a
key
solution.</div><a name="10011484000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Giving
somebody an additional social payment&#151;the fuel-poor&#146;s
subsidiary payment&#151;if they are on electricity only and not on
the gas main would add an additional penalty to all the other consumers
and the big six electricity suppliers, all of whom would have to find
that tariff and pay it back to those customers. That would let off
completely the suppliers of compressed gas and oil in particular, who
may massively profiteer&#151;as they are doing at the moment, because
of the poor weather that people are experiencing and the circumstances
in which they live&#151;because they are not controlled by
Ofgem.</div><a name="10011484000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
suppliers not regulated, so they can charge whatever they like. They
can work together to rip off consumers&#151;exactly what they are
doing at the moment&#151;and get off scot-free. The Minister is
saying, &#147;We don&#146;t want to touch them because it&#146;s
too difficult, but what we might do is charge everybody else, to give
their consumers a little help through the electricity bills&#148;.
That is grossly unfair, Minister. It is also unlike him&#151;he is a
decent chap.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000453"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman feels that I am
trying to be helpful. I want to be enormously helpful where possible,
and I have described how I am doing everything possible to be helpful.
I am not simply saying that this is too difficult or that I am not sure
about it; I am saying that there is a point of principle in this
country&#146;s systems. We have introduced such regulation because of
a monopoly. Where an open and competitive market is appropriate and
possible, that is how we organise things, and that is how they are
organised in this
market.</div><a name="10011484000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not saying that those who are subject to the general law of
competition get away scot-free with the kind of behaviour that the hon.
Gentleman has described. For five years we had an investigation of this
very market by the Competition Commission, and it concluded only last
year. On that point of principle, right, strength and might are on my
side, not on the side of those who have tabled the amendments. However,
I do not want to take away at all from the sympathy that I share with
everybody for those who are in fuel poverty and off the gas grid, or
from the determination to give them every help we
can.</div><a name="10011484000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have given quite a list of the ways in which we are helping, can help
and intend to help. With those assurances, I ask those hon. Members who
have tabled amendments to accept that, while I share their ambition to
help people, the ways in which they propose to do so are not the right
ones. That is why I ask them to not press their amendments. If they do,
I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote
against.</div><a name="10011484000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000454"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I hear what the Minister says and appreciate that
there are extreme difficulties here, but I do not think that he has
really addressed my point. I was trying to put forward, at least for
consideration, a proposal for a way to tackle the problem. Although I
appreciate what he says about the possibility of putting a greater
discount on the electricity supply, that does not address the point
that many of those people use gas or home fuel oil as the principal
method of heating their homes and
water.</div><a name="10011484000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point is important, but it will not be covered and people will still
find themselves in extreme difficulty. I appreciate the problems, but
the issue has been trundling along for a long time and we need to get
to grips with
it.</div><a name="10011484000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister rightly made the point&#151;the hon. Member for Sherwood
also brought it up&#151;about the amounts that we are putting on
energy bills. Everybody&#146;s bill is going up; energy is not going
to get any cheaper. The way oil prices are going, those people will
suffer more and
more.</div><a name="10011484000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue has to be tackled, otherwise the incidence of rural fuel poverty
will keep increasing, which is unacceptable. There is a real injustice
here. I do not propose to press my amendment to a vote, but it is worth
consideration. I shall certainly give it more thought and I urge the
Minister to do
likewise.</div><a name="10011484000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000455"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister, and I
know that he has lived with and worked on the issue for a long time. He
has first-hand experience of it. He asks us to not press the
amendments. In return, I ask him to think carefully and listen
carefully to the debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div><a name="10011484000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say
bluntly that the issue will not go away? The Bill will go through its
various stages of consideration; I do not find the Minister&#146;s
assurances so far satisfactory. I hope that he will look again at the
issue&#151;I know that he will&#151;and that at some stage there
will be an opportunity to make further
progress.</div><a name="10011484000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000456"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am grateful for the debate on those issues and
for the contributions made by the hon. Members for Sherwood and for
Angus. I will press my amendment to a vote because we cannot just say,
&#147;We think the Government have the answer,&#148; because we do
not think that.</div>
<a name="10011484000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said how much the
cost of heating his east wing has increased since I was there. He must
have had a succession of eminent visitors over the Christmas season if
he had to ensure that it was fully heated, but that is very like him.
It surprises me that that is so expensive because, although he of
course likes to keep his good lady wife in comfort and in pleasant and
warm surroundings, he is away quite often, so one would expect the cost
to be cheaper, but there he is, sharing the difficulties of people who
are off the gas mains.</div>
<a name="10011484000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
seriously, my hon. Friend, like the rest of us, is concerned for
constituents across rural England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and
in places that I know very well such as west and north Wales, where my
family come from, and where nobody is on the gas mains and everybody
has to buy their fuel from the local
supplier.</div><a name="10011484000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are aware of the Competition Commission inquiry, but the Minister knows
that in many parts of the country there is effectively one supplier. He
also knows that, according to the latest figures, not only is local
competition often non-existent, but only 1 or 2 per cent. of those
consumers annually switch supplier, whereas the figure is far higher
for people on the mains who switch electricity and gas companies. We
are talking about a group of people who do not have the benefit of
competition and a competitive market in the way that those on the gas
and electricity mains do.</div>
<a name="10011484000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011484000457"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): The argument
seems to centre on rural areas, yet the problem impacts on sizable
numbers of people who live in what the Americans call trailer parks,
which sit in almost all our constituencies, including in urban
areas.</div><a name="10011484000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000458"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Many people on the
south coast, in his constituency in the east midlands and in many
villages around the country on the edges of cities and towns are in
exactly that position. For example, when I was growing up, we lived in
a village a few miles down river from Hereford and a lot of that area
was not on the gas or water mains, even though it was only 3 or 4 miles
from the centre of Hereford, the county
town.</div><a name="10011484000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Ofgem figures are clear: 4.3 million households are not connected to
the gas network, with particularly high numbers in Scotland, Wales and
rural England. That does not mean that nobody is affected in other
areas&#151;they are.</div>
<a name="10011484000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
repeated what the Secretary of State said in general terms to my hon.
Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey last
week. The Minister understood my point that, if we are to solve the
problem by giving people money off their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>electricity bills, there has to be differentially high payments for
those who cannot be compensated in that way, but he did not address the
problem that then arises, which my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate
and Knaresborough homed in on. Due to the market&#151;or the lack of
a market, as may be the case locally&#151;suppliers of alternatives
to gas can get away with their pricing and price rises and not bear any
of the burden. They do not pay any of the costs. That is why we have
argued that a scheme needs to include
them.</div><a name="10011484000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand the why about the market being organised differently and
that there is not the natural monopoly that has to exist with
electricity and gas, which come through one pipe or line, while this
fuel comes on tankers and gets delivered, or consumers go to the garage
down the road or whatever. None the less, there needs to be a scheme
that incorporates people who are
off-grid.</div><a name="10011484000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="10011484000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister, I hope, understands that although there will be a
consultative process, we want to leave the Committee with people
outside knowing that this will not simply be a possible option on which
there might be progress at some stage in future. We want to know that
the Government are committed to dealing with this differential issue. I
think that that view is held on both sides of the Committee and across
the
House.</div><a name="10011484000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly,
the budgets of most of the people we are talking about will be
particularly adversely affected in bad weather. Those people may have a
bit more electricity expense during bad weather, but the main extra
cost  is for the fuel for heating their homes. That heating is
normally powered by gas for those of us who are on the gas mains, but
for these people it is powered by the oil in the tank that supplies the
central heating. In winters such as this one, many more people will
have bills of the order we are talking about. The average annual bill
is &#163;1,000, but the figures show that on average people off the
gas mains pay a third more, so we are talking about average bills of
more than &#163;1,300, and I have seen figures that show that some
people are paying more than &#163;1,500 a year for their combined
bills. In a particularly bad winter, that figure might nudge up towards
&#163;2,000. If the 38 per cent. increase in three months that my
hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has indicated
has taken place&#151;of course the market goes up and down, but none
the less this is a time at which people will be ordering their fuel in
to ensure that they have the
security&#151;</div><a name="10011484000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000459"></a>The

we are in danger of going over the same territory again. I would be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000460"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is what I did at the beginning, but I am
happy to confirm my decision any second  now. We are clear that
this is a real issue affecting millions of people who feel that they
have had a bad deal. The Government need to do much better than show
sympathy; sympathy does not pay the bills. We want help with paying the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000474"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we move on to amendment 31, we must
remember that the Committee is due to end at about 4 o&#146;clock in
a week&#146;s time and we are making slow progress. There are a lot
of clauses to be covered and a considerable number of new clauses at
the end. I ask hon. Members to bear in mind the fact that we need to
make
progress.</div><a name="10011484000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000475"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment 31, in clause 8,
page 7, line 11, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(7A) Payments made
under paragraph (7)(a) shall only be made to scheme customers on the
cheapest tariff offered by the supplier, and the supplier shall be
obliged to place all scheme customers on their cheapest available
tariff.&#146;.</div><a name="10011484000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment aims to ensure that people who will be supported because they
are fuel poor&#151;they spend more than 10 per cent. of their income
on their fuel bills&#151;will automatically be on the cheapest
available tariff. Heeding your request, Mr. Atkinson, to
make sure that we progress and complete this part of the Bill, which I
am sure that we all wish to do, I will not elaborate on the point made
in debates downstairs and elsewhere that one of the things that has
been a bane of people&#146;s lives is the multiplicity of
tariffs&#151;thousands and thousands of different
tariffs&#151;which make it very difficult for people to discover the
cheapest one.</div>
<a name="10011484000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the amendment is to see whether the Minister agrees with the
double proposition in amendment 31. Any payment&#151;such
as the one he indicated with &#163;100 off an electricity bill, for
example, or a differential amount that might mean more off electricity
bills for certain people&#151;will be made only to scheme customers
on the cheapest tariff offered by the supplier, but, and this is the
important thing, the supplier should be obliged to place all scheme
customers on their cheapest available tariff. It will be dead easy when
there is a smart meter, because everybody will be able to see exactly
what tariffs there are and the suppliers will be able to organise
accordingly. I do not see why it is not entirely possible for
people&#151;who are either indicated by the Government, because they
are on the appropriate benefits that mean they get support, or in other
ways&#151;to tell the utility companies that person x, household y,
or family z should not be on their lowest tariff at all times. I would
like the Minister to tell me that he is determined to make sure that
the poorest people are not, by accident, still paying, or at risk of
paying&#151;tomorrow, next week, next year once this Bill is
enacted&#151;more for their electricity or their gas than they need
to because they are not on the lowest tariff.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div><a name="10011484000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
without this precaution, the system is nonsensical, because the
Government will arrange for a repayment&#151;it will not be their
money, but money from other people&#151;to reduce a bill which need
not have been as high in the first place. That is the whole point,
because by definition that person would be on a higher tariff than they
need be. That is nonsensical, and the other customers who are not
receiving any financial support, and who are therefore paying a
premium&#151;paying additionally to subsidise, or
cross-subsidise&#151;will therefore be paying into the hands of the
utility companies who clearly make a considerable profit out of the
fuel that they supply.</div>
<a name="10011484000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister can be robust and very firm. I hope that he will go further
than sympathetic warm words and say that even if the drafting needs to
be corrected&#151;I am happy to take the amendment away and work with
him and officials to get it right&#151;he accepts the principle that
people who are going to be supported will be the people, it will be
assured, on the lowest tariff that that company
offers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000476"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I very much agree with the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey about the importance of transparency. Indeed,
new clause 4, which, I hope, we will debate at some point, looks at how
to provide more information to consumers about what would be the most
advantageous tariff for them.</div>
<a name="10011484000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have,
however, questions about the workability of the amendment as drafted.
We accept that it should be reasonable to have different tariffs to
reflect different aspects; for example, people who choose to go for a
tariff where they will predominantly use off-peak energy will get a
different rate from those who decide not to use off-peak energy.
Clearly, for people in vulnerable households that may be more
challenging, because they might be at home much more during the day.
They will not be out at work at those times, so that option might not
be open to them. People might choose to go on to different tariffs
because they want to go on to one that is more skewed towards weekends,
or they want an environmentally friendly tariff. People are entitled to
make their own choices about what suits their own consumption pattern
best. It then becomes incredibly difficult to put a burden on the
supplier to, at all times, be in a position to move people on to a
tariff that happens, in their eyes, to be cheaper, but does not
actually suit the consumption pattern for that individual so
well.</div><a name="10011484000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000477"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> As ever, the hon. Gentleman makes a very sound
point. However, my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey and I are trying, through the amendment, to get the
Government to agree to the principle that people should be on the
lowest tariff wherever possible. Moreover, if an energy company places
somebody on the lowest tariff, the individual should then be able to
say, in the way described by the hon. Member for Wealden, that, while
the company has fulfilled its obligation, they want another tariff for
a particular point. We could achieve that quite easily and give the
individual consumer the right to negotiate a different
tariff.</div><a name="10011484000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000478"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Yes&#151;there is common ground that could be
explored. When some of the heads of the energy companies appeared
before the Select Committee, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>I asked the chief executive of Scottish and Southern Energy Group
whether he would ensure that, if anybody rang up to ask about a tariff,
it would be company policy to tell them that they would be better off
on a particular tariff. He replied that that would be their commitment.
There are therefore things that can be done to move us in the right
direction, although I am not sure about the way in which the amendment
is phrased.</div>
<a name="10011484000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another cause
of concern is the fact that an agreement on a tariff is a legal
contract between the electricity supplier and the customer, so any
change requires the agreement of the consumer. The reason why we have
ended up with an extraordinarily high number of tariffs from different
companies is that they make an offer for a certain period then knock a
new tariff into another period, but the old one remains available for
those who are still on it. Moving people arbitrarily is difficult and
challenging, so the element of compulsion in the amendment causes me
anxiety.</div><a name="10011484000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000479"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I have one question for the hon. Gentleman. Does
he agree that, by one means or another, we must require the utility
companies to reduce the number of tariffs that they offer? Does he
accept that principle? We can discuss how it can be done, but does he
agree that having about 4,000 tariffs is nonsense and that there ought
not to be more than a handful of tariffs
available?</div><a name="10011484000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000480"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> After our discussion on this issue in the evidence
session, I looked into how many tariffs are generally applicable. The
number is not as vast as we might think. I went on the internet as if I
was a customer who was going to switch. I clicked on the screen and was
asked whether I used electricity or gas, who my current supplier was
and what my payment method and meter type were. I then had to put in my
current tariff&#151;apparently my current supplier has  13
different tariffs that I could be on&#151;and my current spend and
unit use. Eventually, I started to lose the will to live. However,
having gone through the process, I was offered six alternative tariffs
from that one company. Each of those tariffs was fundamentally
different from the others&#151;there were saver, eco, environmental
and discount versions&#151;and I can see why each one had
merit.</div><a name="10011484000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that tariffs that were introduced years ago are still
available, because they were not time limited, even though, in some
cases, only a very small number of people are still using them. I
absolutely concur that, for simplicity&#146;s sake, the smaller the
number of tariffs, the better. Consumers can only choose if they
understand the choices available to them. I accordingly encourage the
energy companies to do so. However, the 4,000 tariffs are not all live
tariffs; some of them are historical tariffs. When one goes through the
process, one ends up with a relatively small number of tariffs to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000481"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am one of those people who has been bypassed by
the technological age. Is my hon. Friend talking about going on
computers to get the information? Is he happy that when an elderly
person who is not computer literate phones up, he or she gets the
advice necessary to make their choice?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="10011484000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000482"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> My understanding is that it can be done just as
readily over the phone. I hope that companies will follow what the
Scottish and Southern Energy Group has said and make a commitment to
inform anyone who rings up asking about a tariff of the best option for
them according to their consumption patterns and
choices.</div><a name="10011484000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
deeply begrudge unsolicited telephone calls during the evening or on
Sundays when people ring me and say, &#147;It&#146;s your
electricity provider here; we would like to talk to you about your
tariff.&#148; They then say, &#147;We have a very good deal for
you,&#148; and I tell them that I am not interested and do not want
to talk to them. I lose my normal good humour, become churlish and
horrible, and put the phone down. They may well have a much better
option for me, but they do not get past the first sentence on their
questionnaire. There are many of us who, once we have locked into
something from a desire not to change, may end up with a deal not as
good as some of the other tariffs
available.</div><a name="10011484000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10011484000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000483"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> We would all love to know whether the hon.
Gentleman decided to change his tariff at the end of the exercise and
whether he has done anything about it. The more serious point is that a
lot of the people he is talking about are not as capable of making the
choices, or dealing with perhaps six options on the phone, or having
the long conversation working out all the benefits. They are people
with caring responsibilities, loads of children, lesser intelligence,
extreme poverty, illness, sickness and so on. For them, the current
system is a nightmare and many people do not change at all. I think 50
per cent. do not do so because it is too
complicated.</div><a name="10011484000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000484"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I did not change. The other issue is that many
people change on to a higher tariff. This is an area where we clearly
need much greater transparency and simplicity. We must give consumers
much greater choice, but, at the end of the day, my preference comes
down to the importance of giving people choice and helping them to make
those decisions. There is an element of compulsion inherent in the
amendment, which perhaps goes too
far.</div><a name="10011484000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000485"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> In answer to the amendment, the combination of the
current voluntary agreement and the ruling by Ofgem on the meaning of
&#147;social tariff&#148; has resulted in 1 million customer
accounts being effectively on the lowest available tariff. The solution
that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey proposes exists
under the voluntary agreement. Remember that under the Bill it is
intended that the voluntary agreement outcomes&#151;those 1 million
customer accounts benefiting from social tariffs&#151;will be
grandfathered into the new scheme. Part of what the hon. Gentleman
seeks to achieve exists already. It is now a question of what we do in
terms of the additional support that we intend to
deliver.</div><a name="10011484000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
two main options for delivering the support are to say to energy
companies, &#147;Either put the customer on the lowest tariff or give
them money off their electricity bill.&#148; We in the Department
wrestled with the choice 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>between the two; the amendment effectively says both&#151;people would
get the money off the bill and be put on the lowest possible
tariff.</div><a name="10011484000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will explain why we chose the route of taking money off the bill rather
than putting people on the lowest tariff. I do not want to stand in the
way of energy companies being more proactive in giving assistance to
their customers in appropriate cases, but I want to explain why in law
I would not want to instruct companies to put customers on their lowest
tariff. We have, however, drafted this measure to leave that open as a
solution if, as a result of debate and consultation, it is by far the
better choice. However, I think mine is the better choice and I want to
explain
why.</div><a name="10011484000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stakeholders
have voiced many times to Government their concerns about the range of
social tariffs offered by suppliers under the current voluntary
agreement, saying they can be confusing and do not allow consumers to
compare tariffs easily when deciding which supplier is offering the
best deal, even when the social tariff is linked to the best available
tariff offered by that
supplier.</div><a name="10011484000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
policy has been developed taking into account that type of feedback
from such representatives, so we have chosen to go down the route of a
known, stable and clear benefit. I also believe it is in the best
interests of consumers to preserve a competitive energy market. I
believe that rebates will minimise any distortion to the market by
preserving the incentives to suppliers to continue to compete for
customers across the entire market. We are keen to avoid certain
categories of consumer becoming less attractive to suppliers because of
the benefits that they are entitled to
receive.</div><a name="10011484000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000486"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Would it be legal for a supplier to reject
somebody on the basis of their financial or other
status?</div><a name="10011484000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000487"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am not saying it would be legal or illegal. I am
saying that, as companies compete for business, they might construct
their offers in legal ways that encourage some customers to join them
and discourage others from joining them. That is my objection to the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposal.</div><a name="10011484000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to say a little about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s long-standing
campaign on the number of tariffs, which he has raised with me on many
occasions. The big six responded to his request made at the evidence
session and have provided information about their tariffs and the
number of them. I agree with the hon. Member for Wealden&#151;when we
have the tariffs in front of us, we see that there are not that many of
them.</div><a name="10011484000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
raise an eyebrow at the description &#147;thousands of
tariffs&#148;, because the number is more manageable than that.
Nevertheless, there are understandable distinctions&#151;for example,
if there are regional differences in the charges to suppliers from the
transmission networks, is it reasonable that they take that into
account when setting the tariffs for that region? The Ofgem guidance on
the lowest available tariffs says &#147;in the region&#148; for
that
reason.</div><a name="10011484000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
home, I have chosen a tariff that, to the best ability of the supplier,
covers energy from renewable sources. I want to encourage suppliers to
offer such tariffs, even if it means that they have one more tariff
than they would have if they did not offer them. I notice from the
evidence that one of the companies has an  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>arrangement with Age Concern&#151;Age UK as it will become&#151;to
market a tariff jointly. I would not want to prevent such innovation in
marketing
schemes.</div><a name="10011484000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000488"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Will the Minister pass the telephone number on to
me because I am in that age bracket and it could be very
helpful?</div>
<a name="10011484000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000489"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I do not know about the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
constituency, but in mine it is easy to contact Age Concern and its
representatives. They are a great bunch of people. The name of the
company concerned is in the evidence in front of him in the description
of the tariffs.</div>
<a name="10011484000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for Wealden, I am committed to the most transparent information
for customers to enable them to compare and make choices. There are
practical constraints associated with mandating a scheme of social
tariffs if we are to ensure that eligible consumers receive social
price support, irrespective of their supplier. It is important, for
example, to be able to measure fairly the contributions made by each
supplier that count towards their share of the overall policy costs
within the funding envelope set by
Government.</div><a name="10011484000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
announced in the pre-Budget report that suppliers will be required to
spend a combined total of &#163;300 million by 2013-14.
Our proposals for a new transparent system involving rebates will
reduce any ambiguity surrounding suppliers&#146; contributions. That
is important among themselves; that is my
point.</div><a name="10011484000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is essential to ensure that customers do not become unattractive to
suppliers because they are entitled to benefits. That, in turn, is of
fundamental importance to allow a reconciliation mechanism to exist
that is robust to legal challenge from among the suppliers, and that
enables the suppliers to contribute to the costs of the policy in
proportion to their share of the domestic energy market. A system based
on the best available tariff would not be practicable for
reconciliation and would leave the policy open to the very real risk of
legal challenge from energy
suppliers.</div><a name="10011484000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, some might wish to impose the requirements contained in the
amendment, but we already have the powers to do so in the Bill. Our
proposals for a fixed rebate on a household&#146;s electricity bill
will be a simple and transparent mechanism for tackling fuel poverty
and directing support to more of the most vulnerable consumers. It is
also practicable and legally defensible to
administer.</div><a name="10011484000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals will, of course, be subject to consultation, and I do not
think it appropriate to restrict the scheme to a particular structure,
as the amendment would, before we are certain it will work and in
advance of consultation that may inform that judgment. Therefore, I ask
the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="10011484000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000490"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am grateful for the comments of hon. Members and
of the help, in part, that the Minister has given. I do not think,
unless I misheard, misunderstood or did not hear, that the Minister
dealt with the fundamental objection to the &#163;100 payback system,
or whatever the preferred option may
be.</div><a name="10011484000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
system is of course transparent; it has that merit. The objection is
that unless people were on the lowest tariff an additional burden
would, in effect, be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>placed on the other users, because they would be contributing to a
reduction of what was, by definition, not at that time the lowest
tariff. I did not hear the Minister deal with that question, and I ask
him to reflect on how to address the concern before we return to the
matter in others ways, both in Committee and no doubt
later.</div><a name="10011484000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly,
the figure that I have most generally used about the nature of
different tariffs comes not from me but from a Which? survey done last
year. Which? is well regarded as good and authoritative. The hon.
Member for Wealden is correct that a lot of the tariffs started some
time ago and cannot be opted into now. The Minister is right that there
are differential tariffs in the four countries of the UK, and in
different parts of England and elsewhere, and there are all the other
variants&#151;for example, night-time, weekend and green
options.</div><a name="10011484000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
still believe that if we are really going to give all
consumers&#151;not just the hon. Member for Northampton,
South&#151;the chance to make sensible choices and to have a real
choice, we need to whittle down the number of tariff options that are
available from a company. That is not against the consumer interest,
and it would force the suppliers to be more focused about what they
offer. I hope that we will return to that
issue.</div><a name="10011484000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
suppliers have responded to a degree, and the situation is better than
it used to be, but it still leads people to lose the will to
live&#151;in the words of the hon. Member for Wealden&#151;as they
try to grasp the issue and sort it out or to decide not to go there
because it is not important compared with other issues in their busy
lives. As a result, they go on paying considerably more, and the
differences can be huge, as the Minister
concedes.</div><a name="10011484000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
last point is that the measure would be obligatory. What I hear from
the Minister is that if the Bill is enacted without the change it will
not preclude regulations including a scheme that might be as
obligatory. There has to be a consultation process, and I will be
interested to hear the utilities&#146; responses. They could do two
things without any of us legislating for them. First, they could all
agree that tariff changes would happen only four times a year at most,
at the beginning of a quarter, so everybody would know when they would
happen.</div><a name="10011484000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the utilities could all agree&#151;supported by the Government and, I
hope, by Ofgem if necessary&#151;that there could be periodic
publication on the web and in the local and national papers of the
comparative prices. We might return to that point. If every quarter or
three times a year somebody could look somewhere, read across and see
which company offered the cheapest deal, that would be real competition
because people could make real choices&#151;and not just people with
lots of time on their hands and the ability to make the
choice.</div><a name="10011484000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am willing to go away and reflect on what the Minister and others have
said. I am keen that we make progress, but I hope that the utility
companies have got the message that we cannot go on as we are. There
has to be a different system, and at the moment a lot of the people who
can least afford it are paying much more than they should because they
are not benefiting from the regime. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10011484000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

the two clauses, most of the supporting subsections that relate to

benefits&#151;make it apparently clear that those are financial
benefits. My concern is that any challenge on the basis that benefits
might not necessarily be financial benefits, but might be benefits in
kind, could be ruled out on the grounds that the clause appears to make
it clear that the benefits are primarily restricted to payments, not
benefits in kind. It is important for the Bill to be amended to include
a small sentence that makes it clear that benefits may be benefits in
kind as well as payments in
cash.</div><a name="10011484000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011484000494"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): Before my hon. Friend
moves on, could he go into detail on what kind of benefits he is
talking about? Could he give specific
examples?</div><a name="10011484000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000495"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> My hon. Friend anticipates slightly what I was
going to say about new clause 17, which contains examples of benefits
in kind that might be provided as a result of a scheme. One can
envisage a number of other benefits in kind that suppliers could
provide, as part of a scheme, that would not necessarily be directly
related to financial payments, but would be taken into account in the
operation of the scheme.</div>
<a name="10011484000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 17
suggests that a number of benefits in kind could consist of benefits,
particularly for people in fuel poverty, that are not payment-related
benefits, but benefits that would make a fundamental difference to both
the payments that those people are making in bills and the proportion
of their incomes that goes towards
bills.</div><a name="10011484000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000496"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I fully appreciate the reasons for suggesting this
inclusion. What I do not understand is how other people will understand
what the benefits might be. I have looked at the benefits in new clause
6 and they blow my mind&#151;but I am not a very bright, technical
person. I can understand if the hon. Gentleman is talking about saying,
&#147;Look, if you take this tariff, we&#146;ll give you 200 quid
to have your roof insulated.&#148; That I understand. However, I do
not understand</div>

what I was going to say. I intended to attempt briefly to explain what
the items mean, should elucidation be required. My central point is
that the first proposal need not necessarily be associated with the
second one and may relate to benefits in kind. I am sure that we would
all clearly understand, in relation to the precise example that the
hon. Gentleman gave, that a benefit may emerge that is not a financial
benefit, but a benefit that clearly would make a financial difference.
I am anxious to ensure that those benefits are not sidelined by the
provisions of the Bill. The particular additional benefits in kind that
I wish to draw attention to in new clause

<a name="10011484000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
draw attention to areas that are very much neglected in our approach to
fuel poverty. We talk about either the extent to which tariffs or bills
may be modified or financial assistance given to people in fuel
poverty, or we talk about passive insulation and energy-efficiency
measures for housing that will reduce bills. I am encouraged that we
have started to talk about the installation of microgeneration, which
may provide an income for those who have such installations on their
properties, thus adding to the payback mechanism. Technologies that do
not involve the active participation of the householder in their
installation, but nevertheless increase efficiency and effectiveness,
are rather neglected.</div>
<a name="10011484000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In passive
flue heat recovery systems, heat expelled from a condensing boiler, for
example, is collected and recycled below the point at which the water
comes from the boiler and pre-heats the water, prior to its being fully
heated. The process saves substantial amounts of gas, by capturing the
emissions of the previous cycle of water heating.</div>
<a name="10011484000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Voltage
optimisation technologies reduce the voltage coming into a property,
more normally a commercial property, from 240 V to 230 V, because the
UK has a substantial derogation under EU regulations on the range of
voltage put into a property through the low voltage system. Energy
saving is achieved by regulating the voltage coming into a property,
while keeping it within the range for equipment to work and not brown
out or fail.</div>
<a name="10011484000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stand-by
down-powering technologies save energy by simply switching off stand-by
power or reducing the total voltage involved. Dynamic demand
technologies are where the fridge can talk to the system, for example.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It would be creepy, indeed.
Without the introduction of a smart grid, a dynamic demand technology
installation can detect changes in the level of power, which indicates
whether the system is overloading. It can literally switch the freezer
off or on, without damage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div>to the freezer, and thereby save substantial amounts of electricity. I
will leave my discussion of those particular technologies
there.</div>
<a name="10011484000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
examples are modest changes that could be placed into households
without the active participation of householders. They could be placed
as part of the benefit package, and yet would save substantial amounts
of electricity or heat. Stand-by technologies could, for example, save
5.8 per cent. of UK domestic electricity; voltage optimisation could
save 8 per cent. of the electricity use of any household or business.
Daylight-responsive lighting could save 12 per cent. Flue gas recycling
in the summer could result in about 11 to 12 per cent. gas-use
reduction and in the winter about 12.5 per cent. of gas use.</div>
<a name="10011484000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are not
insignificant amounts of savings. Placed together, these technologies
could make a substantial difference to the amount of energy used, and
without the active participation of the householders. The amendment
suggests that the Government look seriously at those technologies with
a view to incorporating them, if possible, into fuel poverty offers, so
that those savings can be made. The amendment modestly asks that the
Government look at them and brings a report forward with that view in
mind.</div>
<a name="10011484000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000500"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> This has been one of the most interesting
amendments. As many Committee members want to do, it asks the
Government to look more broadly than just giving people a bit of money
back in their bills. We have to look at things in a holistic way. The
list is interesting because it is not exclusive.</div>
<a name="10011484000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether, in drawing up the list, the hon. Gentleman has gone for things
that are currently mainstream, or whether he would be prepared to have
additions to that list. For example, a company in Sheffield called
Disenco amended the Stirling engine, a very old piece of engineering
equipment, so that it can not only heat an average four-bedroom house,
but in the downside put the equivalent of 3 kW of electricity back into
the system&#151;actually generate electricity that can be fed back in
the evening. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would be open to
additions being made to his
amendment.</div><a name="10011484000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000501"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Yes, indeed. There is a little clause in the
provision that
states:</div><a name="10011484000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
other technologies as
he&#148;&#151;</div><a name="10011484000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
Secretary of State&#151;&#147;thinks appropriate&#148;. The aim
of the amendment is to introduce a number of those sorts of
technologies into the realm of the thinking on fuel poverty. Other
technologies that are similarly appropriate to saving energy could be
added so that the cumulative effect could be
greater.</div><a name="10011484000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000502"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for explaining what
each of those things really is and does, because I was certainly not
aware of all that. My concern is not with the concept of benefit, which
seems very sensible, but with how that relates to the choices being
made by the fuel poor&#151;the people we are specifically talking
about.</div><a name="10011484000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000503"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The hon. Gentleman touches on an important
point. As we have heard today, part of the issue of fuel poverty is the
extent to which those who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div>are offered packages will co-operate with the installation. We have
heard, for example, about people with homes with no cavity walls
perhaps being required, as part of what looks like a perfectly
reasonable offer, to have all their walls stripped down, evacuate the
house for weeks and come back at the end of it. At that point those
people might say, &#147;I&#146;m going to live with a
fuel-inefficient house if that&#146;s alright with you, because I
don&#146;t want those changes to be made.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011484000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
purpose of these sorts of systems is that they can be introduced
without that sort of intrusive offer being made. Yet, at the same time,
they require no action by the householder once they have been
installed; they simply make the savings week in and week out, month in
and month out, year in and year out, passively operating in the house.
For example, flue gas recovery simply requires a system below the point
at which the water is inputted into the condensing boiler. It continues
to save the previous cycle of water heating forever and therefore it
continues to make a saving every time the boiler is switched
on.</div>
<a name="10011484000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make real
breakthroughs on fuel poverty, we need to concentrate on systems in
which the householder is able to get out of fuel poverty, stay out of
fuel poverty and continue to reap the benefits without having to make
an enormously intrusive series of choices as a result of the package
offer. Making those packages workable over a period of time seems an
important part of a real attack on fuel poverty.</div>
<a name="10011484000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
have already over-burdened the Committee with information this
afternoon. I shall conclude my remarks and hope that the Minister will
feel able to accept at least one of the provisions. If he does not feel
able to accept both the amendment and the new clause, I hope that he
will at least look at the principles behind them, with a view to making
a further approach on the reduction of fuel poverty. That is why
members of the Committee are here this
afternoon.</div>
<a name="10011484000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000504"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> We have had a fascinating opening discussion that
shows what the Committee ought to be about&#151;thinking broadly and
asking what can be possible. We should be absolutely clear that this
Committee will not have the solutions to the energy challenges that we
face. Whenever we get to understand some of those solutions, others
will begin to emerge and some will begin to be developed in academia or
business, and we will not yet know that they exist. The Bill should
encourage those solutions to flourish, and promote a range of new
alternatives to dealing with energy challenges. The ideas put forward
by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test bear a great deal of
explanation and discussion.</div>
<a name="10011484000405"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="10011484000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is so much genius in business, industry and academia, and we should do
everything that we can to facilitate it. To say that support given for
fuel poverty should be only in a cash fund seems rather restrictive; a
pound will be a pound will be a pound. The pound today is probably
worth a little less than it was yesterday, but apart from that, it is
still a pound. There are many other ways in which people in fuel
poverty can be helped, some of which have been mentioned. If people are
given the opportunity to develop certain ideas, they will come up with
a whole raft of new ideas as well.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div><a name="10011484000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
given the purchasing power of some of the energy companies, they could
say, &#147;We can either give you 100 quid towards your electricity
bill, or we can give you 150 quid&#146;s worth of vouchers for a
supermarket that we&#146;ve got an arrangement with, if that is what
you prefer.&#148; That is the purchasing power that such companies
can bring together.</div>
<a name="10011484000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
already seen the extent to which companies can distribute
energy-efficient light bulbs&#151;many of us have cupboards full of
such light bulbs and are wishing that they would wear out rather sooner
than they do, so that another one from the cupboard can be installed.
We have seen the difference that purchasing power can make, and it
would be a missed opportunity if the Bill tied that down to a financial
mechanism. There is so much more that could be
done.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000505"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I, too, support the initiative by the hon. Member
for Southampton, Test. His second proposal, new clause 6, has clearly
drawn support from across the House, including from the Chair of the
Environmental Audit Committee, who is not an unimportant co-sponsor of
the new clause.</div>
<a name="10011484000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
supplementary point to add to the positive comments made by the hon.
Member for Wealden. Not only is there a huge amount of technology and
science bubbling away around the country, but there are people on the
front line who want to tell us of all the opportunities.</div>
<a name="10011484000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other day
I went formally, for the first time, to the Building Research
Establishment headquarters just north of London with some of my
parliamentary colleagues. We had the sort of fascinating half-day that
I expected, and saw what new opportunities exist for making a house as
environmentally friendly as possible. We all have the opportunity to
encourage those sorts of innovations in our constituencies. The more
the systems run themselves once they are installed, and deliver
benefits without further interference, the better for all
concerned.</div>
<a name="10011484000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will be positive, and take the principal point behind the
amendment and the new clause. We want people to benefit from not only a
cashback option or other differential payment options, but having other
technology in their homes.</div>
<a name="10011484000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
reinforce a point that I have made elsewhere in another context. The
prerequisite to this initiative working well for everybody is a proper,
comprehensive survey that identifies what can be done. Not everything
can be done immediately or be within the scheme that the Government buy
into when asking utility companies to deliver a system to alleviate
fuel poverty. We have household surveys&#151;local authorities such
as mine are doing their stock condition survey again.</div>
<a name="10011484000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">If local
authorities, along with the industry, lead the process of ensuring that
they offer the service in Northampton, Sussex, Yorkshire, London and so
on, we can identify the opportunity. Crucially, the service will not be
offered by the utility companies&#151;they would be perceived to have
a self-interest&#151;but by local government, which is still trusted
to give good, independent advice, although it may well buy in an agency
or get the BRE to give
advice.</div><a name="10011484000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Science
develops, of course; a technology that does not exist today may save a
lot of money when it is rolled out tomorrow. I would like the Minister
to say that the prerequisite should be for people to have a service
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>shows them what their home could benefit from, so that everybody can
understand. Moreover, people who are at the bottom of the income scale
should be just as easily able to understand the benefit of the new
technology that saves the waste heat and re-pumps it, or that saves it
from the fridge so that it does not have to be recharged in order to
heat it up on a regular basis. I hope that the Minister will be
positive and either accept the amendment and the new clause or say that
he will return with something similar on
Report.</div><a name="10011484000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000506"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Test for tabling his amendment and new clause.
On the amendment, I do not feel so perfect as to never be able to be
questioned about whether I have got the Bill right first time. He has
drawn a point to my attention, and I will deal with it in a moment. On
the new clause, I am extremely excited about ideas and visions, and I
love discussions of the kind that we have just had. I encourage him to
carry on informing us of the technologies. I will say a little more
about that later,
too.</div><a name="10011484000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I first discussed the amendment with my hon. Friend, I was pretty
confident that the word &#147;benefits&#148; in clause 8(2) was
sufficiently wide to include non-financial benefits. Some energy
companies provide services&#151;for example, ringing up for Heatline
advice&#151;and we allow the money to count against their obligation
under the voluntary agreement. Some also provide useful benefit
entitlement advice and, as the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey has said, advise people about the things that they need in
their
property.</div><a name="10011484000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are current services and they are funded by the voluntary agreement,
and to a large extent, subject to what I am going to say in a moment,
we want them grandfathered into the scheme. Therefore, clause 8(2) is
widely drawn because we want to be able to grandfather those things
through.</div><a name="10011484000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was therefore pretty confident that everything was good enough as it
was. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test sounded
an alarm bell when he voiced his fear that many of the references to
the word &#147;benefits&#148; that appear later in the clause have
a financial aspect attached to them. I have therefore asked the lawyers
to check, double-check and check again whether the Bill is good enough
as drafted to cover my hon. Friend&#146;s point. There is no way that
I want to miss
it.</div><a name="10011484000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the moment, my advice remains that the Bill is good enough as it is. If
my hon. Friend is willing to withdraw his amendment, I assure him that
I will continue to talk to the lawyers and ensure that we are confident
that what he wants to achieve will be achieved. If my advice changed, I
would want the Bill changed, and he would certainly get the credit for
that. I hope that helps him in relation to amendment
30.</div><a name="10011484000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
more fascinating, as we have all just agreed, is new clause 6, for
which I thank my hon. Friend. We want the kind of innovation that he is
promoting in the new clause to contribute to the step change in this
country&#146;s approach to eradicating fuel poverty by improving the
energy efficiency of people&#146;s homes. He and others who
contributed to the debate have said, or it was implicit in what they
said, that the technologies involved are not simply for households and
domestic property owners. They are equally relevant to businesses and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>commercial enterprises in their battle to cut their carbon emissions,
reduce their overheads and make their properties more energy
efficient.</div><a name="10011484000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not a scientist, so, like the hon. Member for Northampton, South, I
was glad for the explanation of what each word means, but I have come
across some of them as a constituency MP&#151;for example, voltage
optimisation. When I was at Stafford college for another purpose, I
talked to its property manager about a scheme called Salix, provided by
my Department, which offers interest-free loans to public sector bodies
to cover the up-front costs of energy efficiency measures with a
reasonably short payback of a year or less. My local college had taken
advantage of a Salix loan to implement voltage optimisation, leading to
huge savings in energy costs with a payback of less than four years.
Local businesses benefited from the work by doing the installations. I
have come across that
term.</div><a name="10011484000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
one is &#147;standby down-powering&#148;, particularly for
computers. My local authority, Staffordshire county council, won a
green award two years ago for devising a scheme to do that across a
whole office in one go, and since then, the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport has implemented a similar scheme. We have joined in
promoting it across Government and are willing to share the technology
with the private sector to ensure that it is spread as widely as
possible. I have encountered the technology.</div>
<a name="10011484000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, I have been to the
headquarters of BRE outside Watford and seen some of its innovative
thinking, particularly on devising retrofit installations to make homes
energy efficient and overcoming the knotty problem of finding solutions
for hard-to-treat properties, such as solid-wall buildings, that are
affordable and acceptable to the occupants, especially if they are in
the property while the work is being
done.</div><a name="10011484000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wealden adverted to that problem during this
morning&#146;s debate. It is fascinating to visit BRE and see the
enthusiasm among the researchers there. I am delighted to support them
in their work. While I was there, I was lobbied for money for a project
that they had in mind, and I have a feeling that their application will
be successful.</div>
<a name="10011484000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are not asleep on the issue. Even within the schemes that I
have mentioned, such as Warm Front, CERT&#151;the carbon emissions
reduction target&#151;and the community energy saving programme,
there is some facility to apply technologies to solve individual
problems. I have said that Warm Front has trialled air source heat
pumps and solar thermal in some projects, and some energy suppliers
have found innovative solutions for hard-to-treat properties that have
not been given assistance under
CERT.</div><a name="10011484000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the innovation level, we work hard to promote the kinds of technology
described in new clause 6 and others not described there. We do a lot
of work on the issue and will soon publish two separate strategies
covering some of the matters referred to. For example, on passive flue
gas heat recovery, when we produce the revised microgeneration strategy
later this year, I am confident that we will be able to say more about
the deployment of household-scale low-carbon and renewable technologies
such as passive flue gas heat recovery systems.</div>
<a name="10011484000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
household energy management strategy, which we all regret is not in
front of us for reference, we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>continue the discussion that we started in the heat and energy saving
strategy consultation last year about discrete heating systems. We are
enthusiastic about discrete heating systems fitted to modern
circumstances and lifestyles in this country, and we will have more to
say about them shortly, when the strategy is
published.</div><a name="10011484000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause refers to a number of technologies aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of the electricity network. My Department is actively
exploring ways to increase innovation and encourage the introduction of
new technologies on the electricity network. We have published two
reports on the potential for dynamic demand technologies, one in August
2007 and another in November 2008, as required by section 18 of the
Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. We are also exploring,
as I adverted to earlier, how increased ICT can help to provide greater
understanding of the flows of electricity to operators and
consumers.</div><a name="10011484000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the subject of innovation generally, I have been active in persuading
the Government to be more informative about the fruits of our
investment in investigating new technologies. We are about to publish,
through the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, an annual
innovation report, in which I have been intimately involved, and there
will be references there to the energy applications of some of the
innovations that Government have supported and
encouraged.</div><a name="10011484000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us remember that to accelerate development of smart grid technologies
in the UK, we launched a &#163;6 million UK smart grid
demonstration fund. We have also recently published &#147;Smarter
Grids: The Opportunity&#148;, a document setting out the case for
developing smart grids in the
UK.</div><a name="10011484000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test, I can tell
him that a lot of work is being done and we are finding better and
better ways of communicating the advantages and the benefits of what we
have learnt from the work done. Crucially, the next step will be to
ensure that we apply that knowledge in practical ways to the task in
hand, which is improving the energy efficiency of every home and
business in the
UK.</div><a name="10011484000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that all the things that we are doing, some of which I have just
described, will make the separate reports that his new clause would
require unnecessary. Nevertheless, we are dealing with amendment 30,
and I ask my hon. Friend whether he is willing to withdraw it on the
basis of the assurances that I have given
him.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000507"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I am encouraged by my hon. Friend the
Minister&#146;s response to the amendment and the new clause. I look

are necessary to the Bill, so, on that basis, I am happy to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="10011484000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know from my experience of the Minister and his reputation that he
never, under any circumstance, talks about Bunter&#146;s cheques. I
am sure that the reports will emerge shortly and will, I hope, cover
the issues to which I refer. If placing the issue before the Committee
has ensured that that happens, moving the amendment will have been
worth while. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000508"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> I am conscious that the Committee has spent a
long time&#151;most of the day&#151;discussing the clause, so I
shall be brief. I want to raise an issue that was discussed on Second
Reading and that my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire
raised during our evidence sessions. I have been very impressed with
research done by Macmillan, which suggests that 16 per cent. of people
with cancer and 19 per cent. those undergoing treatment&#151;painful
treatment&#151;or who have just completed treatment live in fuel
poverty. That is double the average figure. There is a compelling case
for mandatory social tariffs not only for those with cancer, but for
those with chronic long-term illnesses. It stands to reason that if
someone is confined to their home, their heating costs are
higher.</div><a name="10011484000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is well aware of the problem. He told us earlier that the new
programme would involve a kernel of people who, by definition, would be
the oldest and most disadvantaged pensioners, but that he was prepared
to consider other groups. I want to press the point and explore it this
afternoon. Macmillan&#146;s campaign is about people with a terminal
illness. Will the Minister consider that group? Clearly there are
issues about targeting, which are not
easy.</div><a name="10011484000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also data sharing issues, and there will clearly be cost issues.
One of Macmillan&#146;s suggestions is that the group should include
people who have had medical treatment for cancer in the previous 12
months, have a terminal diagnosis and, particularly, are in receipt of
housing benefit or council tax benefit. That would define the group
more
closely.</div><a name="10011484000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
I ought to declare an interest: my family has links with cancer issues.
People in that group have a compelling case that should be listened to,
and I would be grateful if the Minister told us how he intends to take
the discussion forward. I am confident that he knows that a discussion
is needed about how best to proceed to help some people in real and
severe
need.</div><a name="10011484000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000509"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I want to make a couple of brief points. I agree
with the hon. Member for Sherwood that Macmillan has run a
long-standing campaign on the matter, which I hope will be given
consideration. I wish to expand the
point.</div><a name="10011484000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
groups have also raised concerns about clause 8, and about
who will comprise the kernel group. They have made the point that
Ministers have suggested that it will be pensioners only. Will the
Minister expand his thinking on that? When we took evidence, I was
particularly taken by comments from Jonathan Stern, the energy expert
at Consumer Focus. In discussing on whom we should focus help, he
said:</div><a name="10011484000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
group that we particularly focused on was those eligible for cold
weather payments. Some 37 per cent. under those criteria are fuel poor.
It is not a bad proxy compared with the equivalent for households
receiving pension credit, which is 36 per
cent.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy Public
Bill Committee, </i>7 January 2010;  c. 88,
Q204.]</div><a name="10011484000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was a
little surprised that the figures were so low. I would have expected
the figure for fuel poverty in both those groups to be considerably
higher, but that illustrates the problem we have with targeting the
fuel poor. Jonathan Stern also made the point that 41 per cent. of lone
parents are fuel poor, and suggested that households with school-aged
children should also be included in the mix.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div><a name="10011484000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Citizens
Advice made the point in its representation that although it does not
dispute pensioner poverty and the problem of pensioners, it focuses on
single-parent families and those on low incomes, and also those under
60 with long-term health problems. It said that a pensioner on pension
credit can expect to get &#163;130 per week, but someone on income
support on the grounds of incapacity receives only
&#163;91.80.</div><a name="10011484000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the current cold weather, I have received, like many other Members,
representations constituents about the cold weather payment, and
although that is not one of the Minister&#146;s direct
responsibilities, obviously the interactions between the cold weather
payment, the winter fuel allowance and the social tariff are part of
the efforts to combat fuel poverty. I would like to see an extension of
the cold weather payment to certain other groups, such as those for
whom Macmillan campaigned, but the difficulty is&#151;I appreciate
that there are limited funds available&#151;that we have to look more
closely at
targeting.</div><a name="10011484000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister expand on the thinking about how we target the fuel poor?
Do the Government intend to consider those in receipt of the cold
weather payment? Will they just consider pensioners, or are they
looking at a wider group to try actively to target those in fuel
poverty?</div><a name="10011484000263"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000510"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I want to follow on briefly from some of the points
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood and by the hon. Member
for Angus. I also want express my thanks for a clause stand part debate
being granted, because there would not otherwise be the opportunity to
start exploring some of the issues in subsection (4). I am particularly
interested in the consultation exercise that follows on from
this.</div><a name="10011484000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Issues
on the consultation were raised during the evidence session,
particularly in the questions put directly to the Minister. I just want
some explanation, rather than any particular
changes.</div><a name="10011484000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, the Minister mentioned some of the complexities and problems
involved in identifying the support group&#151;not only the
kernel group, but the secondary category risk group&#151;when he
talked about the number of people who will be affected. It is hard to
know how those people will be best identified. We all know who it is
that we want to help and support, but how do we establish the best way
to identify those people, as the hon. Member for Angus just mentioned?
Also, what support should we provide those people with, and what are
the best and most cost-effective means to give them that
support?</div><a name="10011484000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have some evidence from the voluntary arrangements that were made with
the energy companies. I want to know how that practical evidence will
feed into the consultation
exercise.</div><a name="10011484000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence session, we also discussed who will go into the kernel
group and who will go into the secondary group. One thing that will be
very important is the phrasing around the consultation, because who we
propose putting into the kernel group and who we propose putting into
the secondary group will be
vital.</div><a name="10011484000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have received some excellent written evidence from Macmillan and a lot
of us have had close dealings with Macmillan in our constituencies. I
have also done a lot of work with the Derbyshire Asbestos Support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>Team and with the Trade Union Safety Team, which is based in
Chesterfield, near to my constituency, especially in relation to
victims of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related cancers. Those
cancers are particularly important as far as my constituency is
concerned. Once someone has been identified as having one of those
terminal illnesses, it is not long before they
die.</div><a name="10011484000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to look at the really extreme end of chronic illnesses to see what
impact they have on people&#146;s lives&#151;not just those people
who are diagnosed with those illnesses, but their entire family or
household. We are not only talking about people losing income because
they are unable to work; we are talking about entire families being
devastated. So, there is an additional element that we must consider
when we talk about fuel-poor
households.</div><a name="10011484000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister makes his winding-up speech, I would like clarification on
exactly how the consultation will take place, how we will implement it
and who makes the ultimate decisions on which people go into which
group. I also make a plea that people with chronic illnesses and people
who have received treatment for cancer in the past 12 months should be
included, if not in the kernel group, then certainly in the secondary
risk category
group.</div><a name="10011484000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000511"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I want to pick up on some of the points that have
been made very effectively already, and I also want to raise a couple
of other issues.</div>
<a name="10011484000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding the
campaign by Macmillan, I think that we are all extraordinarily
sympathetic to the concerns that it is raising. The hearts of those of
us who are in good health go out to those who are suffering and who are
ill, and we completely understand the trauma associated with cancer and
other long-term chronic illnesses.</div>
<a name="10011484000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have an issue about how the scheme will be dealt with in legislation. I
hope that the Minister is prepared to meet with Macmillan to talk about
how the scheme might work in practice. We are all keen to meet
Macmillan&#146;s objectives, but how that can be achieved is what
will present the
challenge.</div><a name="10011484000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think back to my own family&#146;s experience in this regard. My
father died of cancer when I was a teenager. While he was still alive,
we still had hope. Awful things were going on, including the terrible
response to trauma and everything else, but some of the real problems
came when he died, and the way that this suggestion has been put
forward is that the support would end when someone passed
away.</div>
<a name="10011484000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
very difficult thing to put into legislation, or even into guidance,
because there could be an awful situation where a supplier might have
to write to somebody to say, &#147;We are terribly sorry to learn of
the loss of this person in your family, but I am writing to let you
know that you are no longer entitled to support under the fuel poverty
regulations.&#148; We would have all those letters sent on to us and
people would say, &#147;I cannot believe that, at the worst time in
my life, they have been so heartless as to write to me in this
way.&#148; Therefore, one must find a way that addresses the issues
not only of people with long-term illnesses, but of how to support a
family when it may be the breadwinner who has died and therefore the
family&#146;s circumstances become that much more
difficult.</div><a name="10011484000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
matters also raise issues about how the companies would find out should
be involved. Many people fighting cancer never accept that it is
terminal. They believe 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>absolutely, until the end, that they will beat it and that it is not
going to get them. They would never write to an energy company or get a
doctor&#146;s note to say, &#147;I have a terminal
condition,&#148; so there would be eligible people who ruled
themselves out by their way of fighting a terrible
condition.</div><a name="10011484000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are keen to know that the Minister will work with the charities
involved in the sector to find the most sympathetic way that we can act
on the issue and to ensure that any measures do not have inadvertent
side effects, which we are all keen to
avoid.</div><a name="10011484000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
general concerns have been expressed about the clause: its complexity
and the three different categories. Will the Minister say a bit about
that? It has been suggested that two of the categories should perhaps
be merged, and I would be interested to know how that could
happen.</div><a name="10011484000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister also say a little more about data sharing, which we have
discussed in some of our debates. The Government have facilitated the
sharing of information on pensioners, but the rules are clearly
intended to help an enormous number of other people. Will he propose
changes to the rules on data sharing in that respect as well? The
companies involved are concerned about some of the administrative costs
that it appears they are not entitled to recoup. Will he clarify the
Government&#146;s thinking on that
issue?</div><a name="10011484000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to the principal theme, we are all keen to find a way to help
people in our society who are at the most awkward, painful and
traumatic time of their lives. We are keen to use the Bill to do so if
we can. I hope that the Minister can help to find a way
through.</div><a name="10011484000407"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="10011484000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000512"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Minister has heard cases well made by the hon.
Members for North-East Derbyshire and for Wealden and others on clause
8(4) and its interpretation. Like other hon. Members, I pay tribute to
Macmillan Cancer Support, which works throughout England, Wales,
Scotland and the Isle of Man from its base just over the river on the
Albert embankment in SE1, the most happening bit of London. Macmillan
does fantastically good
work.</div><a name="10011484000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
went through the same experience as the hon. Member for Wealden. My
father died of cancer when I had just finished university and college
and my younger brother had just started. It was traumatic enough in any
event. Probably every member of the Committee has had a family member
with cancer. Thank goodness we in this country deal better with cancer
now. The Minister of State and I have constituents who go to
Guy&#146;s and St. Thomas&#146;s or King&#146;s College
hospital. Mike Richards, the cancer tsar at Guy&#146;s hospital, says
that the number of people diagnosed with cancer who survive is
improving, but the issue is none the less
serious.</div><a name="10011484000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
8(4) is clearly drafted to suggest that there may be a group of people
who would qualify. I will read two statements from real people, given
to us by Macmillan Cancer Support. They are absolutely normal,
run-of-the-mill experiences of people with the condition, given to us
in Macmillan&#146;s brief. Fiona, 47, from London, diagnosed with
breast cancer,
says:</div><a name="10011484000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am so worried about this winter. It&#146;s stressful enough having
cancer but I have to keep warm so I don&#146;t get infections and
that means bigger heating bills. I&#146;m already struggling to pay
them, if they go up more, I don&#146;t know how I&#146;ll
cope.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div><a name="10011484000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Laura, 37,
from Cambridgeshire, diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2009,
says:</div><a name="10011484000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
was at home with cancer, without a job and on an income of just
&#163;60 a week. My husband and I had to make choices between eating
or heating; we chose to eat and I sat shivering in bed under two
duvets.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tragically,
that still happens. We know that people suffering not just from cancer
but from other conditions&#151;which may or may not be terminal,
accepted as terminal or accepted by them as serious&#151;need
additional heat and support. The same goes for the very old, the very
frail and sometimes the very young in delicate condition. We are all
looking to the Minister to help us make the clause
work.</div><a name="10011484000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other point is one to which he is alert and about which his Department
has thought a lot. It would be helpful if the Minister could set out
where we are with identifying the people, using data sharing and so on,
who are fuel poor under the current definition, and spend more than 10
per cent. of their income on fuel bills. The whole exercise depends on
the system working and people not being missed out, because they may
not claim all the benefits to which they are entitled, as they are
proud or do not know, or for some other reason. Will the Minister tell
us how this will be meaningful and how any system will catch the people
who need help most and miss as few as
possible?</div><a name="10011484000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000513"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Tackling fuel poverty is a priority for the
Government. Since 2000, we have invested more than &#163;20 billion
in benefits and programmes to raise incomes and improve household
energy efficiency and heating. We continue to look for ways in which we
can improve or add to existing policies to help us to make further
progress. Fuel poverty continues to pose a significant and growing
challenge. We know that prices are a key factor influencing fuel
poverty and we have seen 16 per cent. increases in energy prices every
year between 2004 and 2008. That is why we are committed to build on
the success of the current voluntary agreement with energy suppliers,
which has already helped more than 1 million customer accounts, but
which ends in 2011. To that end, we announced in the pre-Budget report
our intention that suppliers will spend a combined sum of
&#163;300 million by 2013-14 on the social price support
scheme.</div>
<a name="10011484000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through part
2 of the Bill, our aim is to create a mandated system of social price
support to ensure that more of the most vulnerable consumers receive
help with their energy costs. Clause 8 enables the Secretary of State
to create schemes to reduce fuel poverty. It also sets out the key
building blocks of the scheme, including to whom they will apply and
the form and method for calculating benefits. The schemes can, under
subsection (3), apply to suppliers of both gas and
electricity. Some householders receive help with their gas bills
through the voluntary agreement. Subsection (2), read together with
clause 9(4)(c), would allow payments made under the existing voluntary
agreement to form part of the new mandated scheme.</div>
<a name="10011484000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Targeting the
fuel poor is incredibly difficult&#151;a point the hon. Member for
Angus made in his contribution. The fact is that whichever benefit or
other proxy we might like to choose, they are wildly different in their
effectiveness in identifying the right people. The weaker they are as
proxies, the more people not in fuel poverty benefit from something
that is supposed to help those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>who are. That is something we have to bear in mind all the time. No
method is entirely precise. Perfect targeting would require real-time
information on household make-up, income, energy efficiency and energy
prices for all the housing stock. Suppliers have previously made it
clear that they would welcome greater guidance on whom to target under
the existing voluntary agreement.</div>
<a name="10011484000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
the only guidance they have is that they should try to target the fuel
poor or those vulnerable to fuel poverty. We said in the low-carbon
transition plan that that is something that we wanted to improve, by
providing them with greater guidance and direction. Our current
thinking is that we may use different approaches for giving guidance on
targeting, depending on our level of confidence about the effectiveness
of a particular approach. For example, where we are confident that
there are proxies for finding households with a high propensity to fuel
poverty that are simple, stable and have a high hit rate, we can give
people an entitlement to receive a benefit.</div>
<a name="10011484000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
our current thinking, such households would be part of a kernel group.
The hon. Member for Angus asked me about that. I have given as an
example of my thinking on what kind of groups that includes the
poorest, oldest pensioners, because they can be identified in terms of
their situation and their benefit entitlement. As the poorest
pensioners, they are not likely in the rest of their lives to improve
their finances so much as to become suddenly not in need of assistance
with their energy costs. I give them as an example of an approach, but
there is a more general application. If I am satisfied that others
could fall into the categories that I have just described, I would want
to extend the kernel group to them as well. I hope that that is helpful
to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10011484000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
the way, the hon. Gentleman was right to remind me that, as ever,
resources are not infinite and that, as politicians, we must do this
prioritising as we balance the amount by which we want to help people
with the number of people whom we want to help and the amount that it
is reasonable to raise and budget for with respect to a particular
programme.</div><a name="10011484000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Macmillan
Cancer Support is an organisation that has received widespread support
from members of the Committee: my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood
and for North-East Derbyshire, the hon. Member for Angus and the
Front-Bench speakers for the Conservatives and the Liberals. I have
been a Minister for six months, and for most of that time Macmillan
Cancer Support and the plight of cancer patients have not
been far from my thinking. That is a tribute to the cogency,
effectiveness and strength of the case that Macmillan Cancer Support
has advanced.</div>
<a name="10011484000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can assure
hon. Members that the campaign to consider the situation of cancer
patients has been very well considered by me and those advising me in
the Department. I would like to acknowledge publicly that many Members
of Parliament have heard the call for Macmillan Cancer Support to have
support from Members and have written to me in support of the
organisation. I have written many letters of reply to hon. Members
because of their support for that
campaign.</div><a name="10011484000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind hon. Members that disability living allowance is there for
cancer patients who need extra help with their heating costs. That
might trigger receipt of a cold weather payment in times of severe cold
weather. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div>could certainly trigger help, through Warm Front, for insulating their
homes and improving their heating systems. I would not want hon.
Members to think that the Government were not sympathetic to cancer
patients and their plight. We are, and we believe that we provide
mechanisms for giving them support at
present.</div><a name="10011484000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today,
the debate is about how I see the future with regard to giving support
to the class of people whom we have been discussing. We have a duty,
under the fuel poverty law, to bring people out of fuel poverty. That
applies in particular to vulnerable households, which include people
with long-term and chronic conditions; my hon. Friend the Member for
Sherwood mentioned that issue. Obviously, therefore, the groups that we
are talking about are at the forefront of my mind as we shape and
design these
policies.</div><a name="10011484000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am considering how best we approach the position of cancer patients
within the overall policy and whether there is a sufficient argument
for a kernel group, a discretionary group or another approach. The hon.
Member for Wealden asked whether I would meet representatives of
Macmillan Cancer Support to discuss my thinking and its views, and my
answer is an emphatic yes. I am perfectly willing for that to happen at
this
time.</div><a name="10011484000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I leave the subject of identifying the people whom we want to support,
I should say that I was asked about data matching. I said earlier that
the data-matching pilot approved by the Pensions Act 2008 is under way.
The actual matching will take place in about April. I have high hopes
of that being a successful project that will lead to something big in
the future. I have a vision that involves our being able to use data
matching to identify accurately more and more of the people
to whom we want to give the most help. I would like us,
first, to use more data matching, and then to use it for more purposes.
For example, as well as delivering social price support, how about help
with benefit entitlement checks? How about help with advice about how
best people can make their properties more energy efficient, and then
how about delivering the energy efficiency measures  as
well?</div><a name="10011484000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
that would require further changes in the law, and I do not minimise
the difficulty involved in persuading Parliament to give me the power
to share the data. Hon. Members might remember that in the previous
Session a Government Bill&#151;the Coroners and Justice
Bill&#151;provided a mechanism whereby it would be easier for
Departments to share data for good causes. That provision was regarded
by parliamentarians as too widely drawn and had to be ejected from the
Bill. This is an area where, rightly, hon. Members jealously guard the
confidential and personal data of the millions of citizens of this
country. Nevertheless, I hope that if we can convince people of the
narrowness of the data-matching activity, thanks to a successful pilot
and the great good cause that we are embarking on in removing people
from fuel poverty, we will be able to expand in the future in the way
that I have
said.</div><a name="10011484000408"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10011484000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
last point that I want to make about the identification of people is
that I am currently conducting a review of fuel poverty policies, which
my hon. Friend the Minister of State started at the beginning of last
year. It is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>continuing, and one of the themes of the review is how better to amass
the correct information and then share it with people, to enable the
benefits to be delivered. That work is very much active. I hope that
all that is helpful and has answered the questions asked by members of
the Committee.</div>
<a name="10011484000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to come to a question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Derbyshire about how I envisaged the consultation taking place this
summer. A fuel poverty advisory group was established under the fuel
poverty strategy and law, and it is closely involved in the work that I
do. The consultation is a statutory requirement, as proposed in the
Bill, and we would expect it to be the fullest possible consultation,
for the fullest time possible, with as many people as have an interest
in this subject.</div>
<a name="10011484000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have our
own stakeholders in Government whom we would directly involve and we
would want to attract as much attention to the consultation as possible
over the summer. We will consult as best we can, in the ways that I
have described, on how we propose to construct a kernel group, a
discretionary group and bring in, by grandfathering, existing benefits
under the voluntary agreement.</div>
<a name="10011484000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope we
will give sufficient detail for people to feel that it is a meaningful
consultation that they can engage with and respond to positively. I
mentioned in an earlier sitting that I am willing for MPs who have a
specific interest in this subject and want to stay involved in it, to
stay involved with me on the consultation as we take that through the
summer. I hope all of that is helpful to my hon. Friend on the points
that she made.</div>
<a name="10011484000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to say that before I was elected to Parliament, I was a solicitor
in private practice who represented many coal miners. The terrible pain
and suffering from conditions such as mesothelioma are well known to
me, so I entirely understand the point that my hon. Friend made about
the sympathy and support that is needed for people in that
situation.</div>
<a name="10011484000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention, subject to consultation, is that the new benefit available
under the scheme from 2011 should be in the form of a fixed rebate off
consumers&#146; electricity bills. We believe that that kind of
rebate is simple, transparent and more inclusive for those in rural
areas and those off the gas grid.</div>
<a name="10011484000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
subsection (8), the clause also sets out the options for the Secretary
of State to determine the financial structure of the scheme. For
example, it provides the Secretary of State with powers to set out the
method for calculating each supplier&#146;s contribution to the
mandated schemes. To ensure that no supplier is disadvantaged by the
policy, we believe that it is essential that those contributions are
made proportionate to their share of the domestic energy
market.</div><a name="10011484000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, I believe that a mandated system of social price support is
an essential tool in tackling fuel poverty. The clause provides the
foundations for introducing such a mandated
scheme.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000515"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am sorry. I did miss those points but I did not
mean to, so let me come back to them. I worked really hard with the
energy companies to take into account the points that they made to me.
I entirely accept that we want a scheme that is not complex. To the
best of my knowledge, the simple money-off electricity bill is the
simplest form of scheme to administer, so I think I have tried to
respond as best I can to their
point.</div>
<a name="10011484000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
argument about administrative costs. The energy companies are lobbying
to ensure that all their administrative costs count against the
obligation on them to give the benefits of social price support. That
is possible to an extent under the voluntary agreement and I do not
want to block that off. However, I do not want to write a blank cheque
for administrative costs that could be run up by suppliers and charged
against this account. That would deprive the scheme of some of its
money to give as benefits to the most vulnerable people. I will not
give an assurance that administrative costs would count against the
spend. I am alert to the fact that people want that condition to be
included in the scheme and&#151;with the caveat that I have given to
the hon. Gentleman&#151;I am willing to consider how that can be
done. I therefore hope that the clause will stand part of the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000516"></a>The

over four hours on clause 8. Although I accept that it is an important
part of the Bill, it has taken up a lot of Committee time, and we need
to make progress.</div>
<a name="10011484000011"></a>

<a name="10011484000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Schemes for

<a name="10011484000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000517"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I will try to ensure that we make significant
progress in the remaining time available. In subsection (6), the
Secretary of State has the power to exclude a supplier from
participation in the scheme. Will the Minister give us greater guidance
as to the meaning of that provision? What sort of people might be
excluded and on what grounds? Will they be excluded from part of the
scheme or from the scheme in its entirety?</div>
<a name="10011484000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
pre-Budget report, the Government indicated that the value of the
support schemes would be about &#163;300 million. The Minister has
referred to that figure but it is not set down in the Bill. Is that
figure set in stone, or is there room for movement? Finally, when we
listened to witnesses last week, there was talk about whether funding
for the scheme should come from profits, from reducing costs elsewhere
or from charging other consumers. Does the Minister have an approach as
to what method he feels is appropriate?</div>
<a name="10011484000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000518"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The clause supplements clause 8(4) and 8(6) by
allowing the Secretary of State to define eligible customers and the
benefits to which they are entitled. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>The Secretary of State can specify the arrangements to be put in place
to help suppliers find eligible customers, through data matching for
example. The Secretary of State can also specify that suppliers must
let their customers know what particular benefits are available, and
how to apply for them.</div>
<a name="10011484000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to ensure that customers are not discriminated against simply
because the suppliers have to pay them a benefit. I am sure all would
agree that we would wish to avoid such a perverse outcome, given that
our policy seeks to help vulnerable households. Splitting the
suppliers&#146; contribution to the mandated social price support
scheme according to their market share, and having provisions for a
reconciliation mechanism&#151;to which I will return
later&#151;will prevent any such behaviour. In addition, subsection
(2) allows us to include a specific provision in the regulations,
preventing suppliers from discriminating against eligible
customers.</div>
<a name="10011484000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppliers
offer an array of services under the current voluntary agreement. Over
the coming months, we will assess which contributions under the
voluntary agreement should count under the legacy spending element of
the mandated scheme. It is therefore vital that the clause allows for
the continuation of the different elements currently included, and
subsection (4) does just that. Of course, with exclusions, there might
be an element of saying that something worked well under the voluntary
agreement and should be grandfathered through, or that something did
not work well, and should therefore be stopped. The Secretary of State
would have the ability to exclude something, which I hope answers the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point.</div>
<a name="10011484000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subsection will also allow suppliers to provide different benefits, or
amounts of benefits to different customers. That will, for example,
allow suppliers to continue giving their company-specific social or
discounted tariffs to households currently receiving help, even if they
are different from other suppliers&#146; offerings or the social
price support under the mandated scheme.</div>
<a name="10011484000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">The voluntary
agreement transition arrangements will be part of the consultation in
summer 2010. At that point, we will be able to discuss what suppliers
will be obliged to do going forward. That could include whether the
existing tariffs and benefits that suppliers offer under the voluntary
agreement will be included in the mandated scheme. Subsection (4) also
covers the continuation of pre-existing arrangements, which means the
continuation of work under the existing voluntary agreement. Examples
of that work include non-direct benefits, such as benefit entitlement
checks and energy efficiency advice for the fuel poor above and beyond
suppliers&#146; obligations through other
schemes.</div><a name="10011484000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want the schemes set up under these clauses to do a variety of things,
from grandfathering activities in the voluntary agreement to creating a
new kernel group entitled to receive a benefit. It is therefore
important that any scheme that we define can cover a range of different
things. Subsection (6) therefore allows the Secretary of State to apply
or disapply elements of the scheme to different suppliers if
appropriate. For example, only the big six are currently involved in
the voluntary agreement. If a decision were taken to include smaller
suppliers in the scheme, the Secretary of State might not wish the
requirements about grandfathering to apply to them.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div><a name="10011484000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
the clause provides the Secretary of State with essential options when
making social price support schemes to reduce fuel poverty. That
includes ensuring that customers get the appropriate benefits, that
suppliers do not discriminate against the vulnerable people we are
trying to help, and that we are able to grandfather elements of the
voluntary agreement. I appreciate that that does not deal, as the hon.
Gentleman said in his second question, with the amount of money
available to the scheme. That has been announced by the Chancellor in
the pre-Budget report, and that is the background against which we must
fit the scheme to the amount of money
available.</div><a name="10011484000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000519"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Briefly, the power for the reconciliation
mechanism is permissive rather than an obligation. What will be
considered to be a disproportionate number of eligible people? Does the
Minister intend to change the mechanism from being a power to an
obligation? That would ensure that a company that ends up with a
disproportionate number of people who might benefit can be certain that
its load will be
shared.</div><a name="10011484000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000520"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point; it
is a bit like the debate that we had this morning about
&#147;shall&#148; and &#147;may&#148;. There is no doubt that
there will be a reconciliation scheme, but its design will take some
time, owing to consultations with the energy companies, which have a
great interest in the issue, and with other organisations. The
provision is permissive, to enable it to happen, but it definitely will
happen.</div><a name="10011484000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000521"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> One question. Has the Minister&#146;s Department
come to any conclusions under the present voluntary system as to
whether the companies with the largest number of people in fuel poverty
have been more or less generous relative to one another? Some companies
will have had more customers &#147;on their books&#148; who are in
fuel poverty. Have they been less helpful in supporting those in fuel
poverty than companies that have had fewer such customers and that can,
in theory, be more generous? Has the Department compared the numbers
who have benefited against the numbers eligible under the present
voluntary
arrangement?</div><a name="10011484000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000522"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am pretty sure that there is a reconciliation
scheme under the voluntary arrangement by agreement with the companies
that is split according to the customer account numbers. The debate
during last week&#146;s evidence was about whether we should continue
with customer account numbers or move to kilowatts per hour consumed.
The point is that there is going to be a reconciliatory scheme at the
request of the energy suppliers themselves, so the hon.

arise.</div><a name="10011484000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000525"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Clause 14 sets out the interpretation of schemes
for reducing fuel poverty. The two amendments are intended to be
probing amendments to discover what power the Government are seeking to
give or keep to themselves to redefine fuel poverty.</div>
<a name="10011484000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
briefly remind colleagues where we are. The genesis of the definition
in legislation is in the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000,
where there is both a definition of fuel poverty and an ability of the
Government to define it. Under that Act, a person is to be
regarded</div><a name="10011484000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
living &#145;in fuel poverty&#146; if he is a member of a household
living on a lower income in a home which cannot be kept warm at
reasonable
cost.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a provision for the Secretary of State in England or the National
Assembly for Wales, by regulations to set out</div>
<a name="10011484000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
...what is to be regarded...as a lower income or a reasonable
cost or the circumstances in which a home is to be regarded for those
purposes as being warm,
or</div><a name="10011484000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
substitute for the definition...such other
definition&#148;.</div><a name="10011484000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a power for Ministers and a process of consultation to define fuel
poverty.</div><a name="10011484000409"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="10011484000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a parenthetical point, but I have always thought that fuel poverty
is not a phrase used in the real world of the Old Kent road or anywhere
else. Too poor to pay the bill would be common parlance. I hope we can
get away from what is not conventional English. I always try to say,
when one&#146;s bills cost more than 10 per cent. of one&#146;s
income, or more than 10p in the
pound.</div><a name="10011484000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background is that the Government are failing badly in their current
targets and we expect them to fail completely when the 2010 figures on
fuel poverty are published. I have heard the Minister say that he is
trying all he can but the chance of the Government meeting their fuel
poverty targets seems to be, if not formally, in all probability,
impossible, given that we are already in 2010. Government grants have
helped 5 million people install some kind of insulation, but according
to the figures I have there are still 5.4 million in fuel poverty in
the UK, and that number has more than doubled from 2.5 million three
years ago. We know, welcome and appreciate the schemes in existence but
they clearly have not solved the problem. Sadly, it is a problem where
the Government have failed to live up to their promise and
expectation.</div><a name="10011484000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to be clear that the Government are not seeking in the clause to
allow Government to fiddle the targets and the definition. I want to
make two obvious points that follow from that. Clause 14 says that fuel
poverty would be reduced if either of two things happen: 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div>either the total number of people defined as fuel poor under the Bill
and previous Acts is reduced, or in  clause 14(1)(b),</div>
<a name="10011484000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the extent to
which any person is living in fuel poverty is
reduced.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the argument that if people are more able to pay their bills
or do not find it as difficult, the problem is less. Amendment 7
suggests that it would be more honest and honourable to delete
subsection (1)(b), so that the truth came out, which is how many people
spend more than 10p in the pound on fuel bills; rather than trying to
obscure that by another definition looking at the number of people for
whom the extent of fuel poverty is reduced. Of course, that is an
important indicator. It is an important bit of information to collect,
but in our book it should not be the way to define who is or is not in
fuel poverty.</div>
<a name="10011484000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
clause 14(4)
says:</div><a name="10011484000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If,
by virtue of regulations under subsection (2)(b) of that section, the
definition in subsection (1) of that section is substituted, the
Secretary of State may by regulations specify what is to be regarded as
a reduction in the extent to which a person is living in fuel poverty
for the purposes of this
Part.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to allow Ministers far too much discretion to define later, by
secondary and not primary legislation, what reductions in fuel poverty
are. I thought that when the previous legislation was passed, we were
clear that the definition of fuel poverty should be included in the
Bill and could not be tampered with by regulations.</div>
<a name="10011484000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
last question to ask in this context. Six years ago, my hon. Friend the
Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) piloted through Parliament the
Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004, which provided for building
regulations to be extended to cover any building undergoing a major
alteration or extension, or when occupants moved home. The purpose was
to ensure not just that new buildings were good and warm but that
improvements were made when alterations and extensions were made or
when people moved. My hon. Friend has regularly chased Ministers to
ask, &#147;When are you going to do anything about this?&#148; I
know that it is principally the responsibility of the Minister&#146;s
colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government and
not the Department of Energy and Climate Change, but it relates to both
emissions and insulation, and therefore to bills.</div>
<a name="10011484000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful, as would my hon. Friend, to hear whether the Government
intend to do anything, as the Act requires them to do, to use their
existing powers to solve the problem. That would be a much more useful
response than a piece of legislation allowing the Government to change
the definition. I hope that we can persuade the Government that the
regulations to do so are not necessary and that we should define what
we mean in the Bill. I therefore hope that the Minister is minded to
accept my amendments in one formulation or
another.</div><a name="10011484000348"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000526"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
has raised an interesting and important point. We are right to be
suspicious on such issues. The Government have form on changing the
basis for calculating statistics and relative figures so they can say,
&#147;You can&#146;t make a comparison on that basis because the
figures haven&#146;t been collected over a long enough
period.&#148; Particularly when one can see us heading so rapidly in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>the wrong direction on fuel poverty figures, one might imagine that the
Government would be keen to find a way out of a problem of their own
making.</div>
<a name="10011484000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
reasonable in considering fuel poverty not to pursue a one-dimensional
approach. To suggest that people are either in fuel poverty or out of
it does not give a full understanding of how the world looks. We have
an extra definition of severe fuel poverty, but it is reasonable to
have gradations as well, so we can understand more clearly to what
extent people are in fuel
poverty.</div><a name="10011484000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
primary concern is amendment 8. Subsection (4) appears, almost on a
whim, to give the Secretary of State the opportunity to redefine fuel
poverty. That ought to be dealt with in primary legislation. I am not
quite so concerned about some of the earlier issues referred to by the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, but it is important
that the Government should not be able to change definitions on a whim
to meet statistical
challenges.</div><a name="10011484000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000527"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I need to correct slightly something that I told
the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey in answer to a
question he asked. The obligation is presently split among the energy
companies by customer numbers, but the amount of money that must be
spent under the voluntary agreement is split among them according to
their market share. That is not the kind of reconciliation scheme that
I propose in the Bill; there are excellent reasons, including an
entitlement and a kernel group, that make that way of dealing with it
unsuitable. I am sorry if I said slightly the wrong thing in my
answer.</div><a name="10011484000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is the job of a parliamentarian scrutinising a Government Bill to be
suspicious, but I think that the point we are making has been
misunderstood. Here are the qualifications or triggers for a scheme to
be acceptable. If we have a scheme of the kind that I have described, I
am sure that it will take some of the people who receive the benefit
out of fuel poverty, and will move others towards it. That is therefore
a qualifying condition for making the scheme, and the benefit is
advantageous to those who receive it. Moving someone from spending 20
per cent. of their income on energy to spending only 10 per cent. might
not take them out of the definition of fuel poverty, but it is a big
benefit to them. Otherwise, we would have to design a scheme that was
aimed only at those who are just in fuel poverty, to shift them over to
the other side of the line. I hope that people will accept that the
measure is not at all to do with trying to change the definition of
fuel poverty, or even to change the accounting for the number of people
and households in fuel
poverty.</div><a name="10011484000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
it comes to changing the definition, as has been pointed out, there is
a method in the Act that set up the scheme for eradicating fuel poverty
that allows for an amendment, and for a statutory way of making such an
amendment. The Bill is not about amending the definition of fuel
poverty; it is about amending the scheme if the definition
were changed by the statutory route provided for under the existing
Act. The measure is consequential, because if the definition is changed
we need to change the terms of the scheme. That is all it  is
for.</div><a name="10011484000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000528"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is helpful, because it gives me a signpost to
the amendment that I ought to have tabled and which I could have
therefore explored on Report. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>I have understood the Minister correctly, the amendment needs to be to
the previous Act and not to the Bill. I understand the regulatory
options given under that Act. I am grateful for the support from the
hon. Member for Wealden for the principle of the second amendment in
the group, but the mischief is that clause 14(1)
states:</div><a name="10011484000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this Part, fuel poverty is reduced
if&#151;</div><a name="10011484000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the number of people living in fuel poverty is reduced,
or</div><a name="10011484000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the extent to which any person is living in fuel poverty is
reduced.&#148;</div><a name="10011484000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
could therefore be possible under the proposed legislation for the
Government to say, &#147;We have reduced fuel poverty because all
those who spend more than 10p in the pound on their fuel spend less,
but not a single person has actually crossed the threshold into
spending under that amount&#148;.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The Minister of State has said no
from a sedentary position. I am completely willing to be corrected if
have misunderstood, but why is clause 14(1) drafted such that paragraph
(a) or paragraph (b) is the definition? Why can we not keep the
definition to paragraphs (a) and
(b)?</div><a name="10011484000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000529"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Every year, we publish the statistics for fuel
poverty, and every year in the future we will do so. The clause does
not change anything at all in that publication about how we are
doing.</div><a name="10011484000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000530"></a>Simon

knowledge. I will go back and reflect on the original Act and the Bill
and their interconnections. I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>will look again at the publication from the Minister&#146;s Department
that gives the figures. Like the hon. Member for Wealden, I am
concerned that we should not allow a definition that people have grown
to
understand&#151;</div><a name="10011484000358"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011484000532"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Minister is saying that we are not. She will
understand that that is the concern. We are rightfully probing to
ensure that the 10 per cent. of income spent on fuel remains the ratio
and the definition. If the Minister is saying that that will not change
