<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam. It is an unexpected pleasure to see that you are presiding over this afternoon's deliberations.
<P>
The amendments, including those tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), deal with extensions to the schedule 2 list of restrictions, which must be observed by people who visit access land.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Are members of the public excluded from this sitting, or have they simply not been let into the Room?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have no idea. There is no reason why the public should be excluded. I do not know whether there is any interest in the matter under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was right to make that point; there may be little interest in the matters currently before us, but until now our deliberations have attracted considerable crowds. I am sure that we will soon see—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not in order to refer to strangers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. McWilliam. I was trying merely to fill in time, so that those who want to enjoy the full show could be in their places to do so.
<P>
The amendments deal with the potential for adding various restricted activities to those already listed in the schedule. All hon. Members agree that much of the practicality of the regime established by the Bill will depend on sensible lists of restrictions. The Government have acknowledged that need by including a long list of restrictions and extensions in the Bill. The amendments seek to probe the Government and to find out whether they believe that the current list should be extended.
<P>
When I surveyed the Opposition amendments together with those tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I felt slightly abashed that his amendments dealt with healthy outdoor activities such as bungee jumping and paragliding, while our amendments dealt with drinking and smoking. What the amendments reveal of our thoughts on what people might unsuitably do in the open air, I pass over in silence. I merely congratulate him on his healthy view of life.
<P>
Amendment No. 100 concerns one practical effect of walkers who may not be used to the countryside. To them, the removal of minerals, soil or peat might seem an innocent enough activity. However, it would be useful—as the Bill's access provisions come into force over the years—to have a clear and fairly extensive list of unsuitable activities, such as removing some soil for the garden, some peat for the roses or a few logs for the fire. An individual doing any of those things would have no impact on the land, but thousands doing them would have a considerable impact. We have already seen that on some of our beaches, where people have removed shingle and sand, causing difficulties. We do not want that to be repeated elsewhere in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): Would the amendment extend to removing litter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If the hon. Gentleman bothered to read the amendment he would see that it does not apply to litter. I suggest he reads the amendments before he makes interventions.
<P>
Amendments No. 101 to 106 involve a variety of other activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lepper </B>(Brighton, Pavilion): I have to return to the hon. Gentleman's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice). Amendment No. 100 states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>removes any mineral, soil, peat or part of the land or any object from the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should give the Committee a clear definition of the word ``object'' in this context, and of the words ``from the land''. A definition of the objects that can be removed and the way in which they can be removed might sway our voting intentions on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am fascinated that Labour Members should have begun to filibuster with such foolish interventions. The definition of ``object'' would not include crisp packets or something that people had dropped. The Bill makes it illegal to drop litter and I assume people would obey the law. I am not sure why hon. Members have returned from lunch in such light-hearted spirits. I find their attitude puzzling because there are practical problems that need to be addressed which we are attempting to do in the amendments. Moving on to activities such as the use of metal detector, there will be occasions when people feel that that is worthwhile. I would be interested in knowing whether the Minister believes that to be a legitimate activity, such as walking over access land.
<P>
People might want to use their right of access to dump things. We had a discussion earlier in Committee on the problems of dumping. The Under-„Secretary suggested that he did not want to encourage landowners to create rubbish tips, which would then have to be excepted. The Government at some level believe it possible that some people will want to dump things on the land. We agreed that that was unlikely, although possible. I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on amendment No. 102.
<P>
Amendments No. 103 to 106 form a raft of behavioural amendments covering the misuse of drugs, sleeping out, drinking, being drunk or setting out to disrupt legitimate countryside activities. Is it important to specify them in the Bill? Its extensive list contains some objectionable activities. Lying behind the amendments is the desire to see what criteria divide the activities that the Minister wants to exclude from the wider range of activities that Opposition parties seek to exclude.
<P>
Amendment No. 109 attempts to meet our criterion of keeping the Bill practical. We do not intend to make it illegal to smoke cigarettes when walking across open land. Many people will want to do that. If the hon. Member for Pendle wants to get into an argument about litter, no doubt we could agree that dropping cigarette ends and safely stubbing them out so that there is no risk of fire, need not constitute litter, although it would be preferable for people to remove them. However, we need to be realistic about how people behave.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 is also a behavioural amendment. The Bill may unintentionally help people who wish to disrupt legitimate countryside activities. We want to make it clear that disrupting people who are engaged in legitimate activity will not be permitted.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 refers to hot air balloons. They are attractive and, on the face of it, harmless. However, the use of gas cylinders and fire could be dangerous in hot weather. The activity also requires a large area of land. People might think that it is not a serious matter to land a balloon on grass, but grass can be a crop. If it is trampled and crushed, it may no longer be fit for its original and proper purpose which is to feed livestock. There is a practical advantage in having an explicit exclusion.
<P>
Other amendments refer to organised games, but not orienteering. A similar argument applies to grassland. What might appear to be an attractive field appropriate for football might be grass that is awaiting haymaking. It could be damaged irretrievably. A few people orienteering would not trample over the same piece of ground for a long period, so there is a significant difference between the activities.
<P>
In sum, the amendments would make practical additions to the Government's list. Many of them probe the Minister's attitude to the principles that lie behind the list because they are not obvious.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I, too, welcome you to the Chair. I apologise for my slight surprise, which was due to my not reading the papers properly.
<P>
The group of amendments deals with the compendious list in schedule 2. I contributed two amendments, which I shall briefly address. Amendment No. 205 deals with what appears at first sight to be an inconsistency in the wording of the Bill. In paragraph 1(j), the word ``intentionally'' is not qualified by the words ``or recklessly'', which are included in other paragraphs. There is obviously a deliberate reason for that; it is not merely an omission or jeu d'esprit on the part of the draftsman, but I am at a loss to understand what that reason might be. I thought that it might be in order to avoid accidental damage to herbage, but that could not be construed as reckless.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The wording of paragraph 1(e) is analogous. That paragraph relates to animals, birds or fish, which presumably includes invertebrates. Presumably you could unintentionally damage a precious invertebrate hidden in the herbidenda underfoot—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman used the word ``you'', which refers to me. I have never intentionally damaged an invertebrate in my life, but I might have done so unintentionally because I spend a lot of time walking in the hills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. We have had this discussion before, and I used the word ``you'' in the impersonal sense to illustrate my case, rather than to express any intention on your part. I am sure that you take great care to step around any ants or similar creatures that you find on a footpath.
<P>
This is a serious point because reckless disregard for plants is just as culpable as reckless disregard for animals or anything else included in the schedule. It would help the Committee if the Minister explained why those words have been omitted from paragraph 1(j).
<P>
Amendment No. 206 would amend line 44. There is a marked difference between my approach and that of the hon. Member for Ashford. He imagines that all sorts of squalid activities take place on open access land, whereas my imagination is not nearly so liberal. I am not concerned about people bungee jumping all over access land, but I am trying to discover from the Minister for the Environment why the schedule contains a brief list, which includes hang-gliding or paragliding, but not any other airborne or semi-airborne activities. Why has a generic term not been used to cover those activities? Why is the list not comprehensive? I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy me that there is some sense in the present drafting.
<P>
More generally on this group of amendments, the Bill contains what purports to be an exhaustive list of restrictions, but I am not convinced that it is exhaustive. It goes beyond the broad outlines of what would be unacceptable, which could be qualified by law, but does not exhaust all possibilities, as the hon. Member for Ashford has amply explained. We have some difficulty in understanding why the Government have been prescriptive, but not prescriptive enough to cover all the activities that might damage land or the tranquil enjoyment of others using the land. That is the thrust of the amendments, and the Minister would help the Committee greatly by commenting on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): I should like to make two points, one of which is sort of serious, while the other is very serious. The Committee should not snigger at hot air balloons. Hon. Members may remember the famous case of somebody whose enjoyment of the hills was so ruined by a hot air balloon that he took it upon himself to shoot it down.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> It was not you, was it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> No, it was not me; I missed. The balloon was shot down and a court case ensued. I am sure that hot air balloons do not do much damage, but an incapacitated hot air balloon in the middle of the Pennines will be a difficult little thing to move away. I therefore endorse the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford.
<P>
Secondly, amendment No. 111 principally concerns the disruption of legitimate countryside activities. Sadly, we are living in an increasingly intolerant age, in which too many people take it upon themselves to try to disrupt legitimate sporting activities. Such disruption occurs not only because of foxhunting saboteurs and arises in upland areas. Too many unpleasant people seek too often to disrupt the legitimate activities of others, and some of us believe that the Bill could unintentionally help such disruption. The amendment would make it clear that disrupting lawful and legitimate activities in which people are engaged in or may engage will not be permitted. It seeks to replace with the word ``may'' the words ``are about to'' in that context.
<P>
The Under-Secretary should be aware that the problem could become more serious, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome recognised. It is clear to Opposition Members that the Government do not intend such problems to occur. Indeed, that is in the nature of the Bill. Will they reflect on the amendment and consider whether a minor change might clarify the provision and lead to greater coherence and clarity for the future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): First, there has been some debate about what constitutes an outdoor pursuit in relation to amendment No. 206. I listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Ashford in that context. In my view, bungee jumping, hang-gliding and parascending are all unhealthy pursuits, and I would not engage in them. However, that is merely a personal view.
<P>
Secondly, there was some discussion about whether items are fixed to the land, in relation to amendment No. 100. I am concerned specifically about the removal of soil or peat. Under the Commons Registration Act 1965, many hundreds if not thousands of people throughout the UK have registered rights of turbary to legitimately take peat for burning. In my home village of Llanuwchllyn—if that does not excite the Hansard writers, nothing will—people still cut peat, dry it during the summer months and burn it during the winter. The removal of peat by people who merely walk by is an infringement of those registered rights. No doubt the Minister will again say that such infringement can be dealt with under trespass laws. However, I have personal experience of legal action involving infringement of commons rights. The process is horrific, expensive and involves long delays. It is also virtually impossible to achieve a reasonable result in such cases. Amendment No. 100 is therefore a reasonable proposal. The amendment is also important for conservation. I said that peat was removed for burning, but in other areas it is taken at an alarming rate. We are losing peatlands, and responsible gardeners should not be using peat mulch. I make those points in passing and I am sure the Minister will address them in due course.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> I am delighted to see you, Mr. McWilliam, and I hope that you are delighted to see us. We shall judge that at the end of the sitting.
<P>
Paragraph 1 of schedule 2 sets out a number of activities in which people should not engage when exercising the right of access on open country and registered land. They are meant to be common-sense restrictions. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked why we have only those restrictions and no more. They are derived from the second schedule to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but they have been updated to reflect the development of new forms of recreation—for example, hang gliding, paragliding—and new legislation. Rather than seek a completely comprehensive list, I remind the Committee that, as I have said before, where a particular difficulty arises it will be possible to apply for a restriction under chapter II, and if the problem is serious enough a byelaw may be justified. We also have the power by regulations to update the list of restrictions in schedule 2 in the light of experience.
<P>
Hon. Members have tabled a large number of amendments, and I shall try to deal with each of the points that they cover. They divide into four categories, the last of which is composed of further amendments. The first category comprises those activities that are already criminal offences, and many of the activities listed in schedule 2 are also criminal offences. They have been included because we believe they might cause problems in open country. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that it is important to keep the number of restrictions manageable and to avoid replicating existing offences where unnecessary, otherwise the list would be endless.
<P>
We expect the restrictions in paragraph 1 to be widely published—certainly that is our wish—particularly in the vicinity of access points, which we debated last week. An excessively long list would serve only to discourage the interest of passers by and would be counterproductive. We must be realistic about how much information people are prepared to assimilate. However, I do have some sympathy with the argument that certain other criminal activities should be added to the list of restrictions. For instance, it is undesirable that somebody who has been abusing alcohol or drugs cannot be asked to leave the land unless he offends against one of the restrictions in paragraph 1. I do accept that point.
<P>
Elements of amendment No. 100 on the removal of minerals, amendment No. 103 on the misuse of drugs, and amendment No. 134, sub-paragraph (aa) on polluting water, and sub-paragraph (bb) on breaking into a shooting cabin are worthwhile. I shall consider tabling an amendment on Report which would provide that the commission of any offence while on access land constitutes a breach of the restrictions in schedule 2, which would, of course, render that person a trespasser and therefore liable to be removed from the land. None of the amendments tabled seek such a general provision, but it is right that landowners should be able to ask someone to leave their land if they commit an offence of any sort. In some cases, the offence may not be related to access, which was the reason for my initial doubts on this, and may have little or no impact on others or on anything in or on the land, so such a measure might be considered rather sweeping. However, somebody misusing drugs might not be causing harm or damage to anybody but themselves, but that is no reason for allowing them to remain on the land. If the offence is serious, we would expect action by the authorities and criminal proceedings to be brought. I have made that statement before. I hope that that commitment demonstrates the Government's determination to ensure that the legitimate concerns of those who own or manage the land are addressed.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second category of restrictions relates to harmless activities. That has less merit. The debate had an Alice in Wonderland atmosphere, which I shall try not to encourage. The amendments would prohibit activities that are fairly harmless and innocuous. I shall refer to them, if only to demonstrate their inappropriateness.
<P>
Amendment No. 102 would place a restriction on anyone who leaves any item, whether or not they intend to return to it. I presume that the intention is to prohibit the leaving of litter, which we have discussed. Paragraph l(p) places a restriction on depositing rubbish or leaving litter. The criminal offence of dropping litter in a public place is punishable with a fine of up to £2,500, although that is rarely exercised. The provisions are sufficient to cover problems that might arise, but the amendment goes further. It would—no doubt unintentionally—prevent people from leaving a rucksack under a hedge when they climb to a nearby viewpoint. It would also cause someone to lose the right of access if they left their thermos behind after stopping for a break—indeed, the amendment would prevent the owner from returning to retrieve it. Once people were parted from their possessions, that would be the end of it, which would be a bonus for the landowners.
<P>
Amendment No. 109 attempts to clarify the restriction on lighting or tending fires to make it clear that the lighting of cigarettes is not included—the Opposition are displaying their concern for the tobacco-addicted walker. Much as the Government want to encourage people to adopt a healthier lifestyle, we do not want to go as far as banning smoking in open country, although that might be a good idea in a dry spell on the moors. I am assured that the restriction on lighting fires in paragraph l(d) would not make smoking illegal.
<P>
I am not sure why hon. Members think that someone who falls asleep on access land should be a trespasser, but that is the implication of amendment No. 104. We have included a restriction on camping. The amendment would render someone a trespasser if they have a nap after a picnic on a sunny day or they are carrying a baby that falls asleep. There is similarly no need to restrict consumption of alcohol, which would prevent people from having a bottle of wine with that picnic. If consuming alcohol might cause problems, its use could be excluded by another restriction, such as disorderly or annoying conduct or, depending on a person's actions, obstructing a legal activity on the land. If the conduct were sufficiently serious, it could count as a criminal offence, and our plans to table an amendment on Report would be relevant.
<P>
I was not going to mention model aircraft, but as that has been referred to, I should address the concerns that that harmless activity arouses. It has given rise to sub-paragraph (ii) in amendment No. 134. Where that activity poses a problem because of the numbers involved or the disturbance that it might cause to walkers, livestock or wildlife, it could breach of a number of restrictions. The relevant authority could apply restrictions or the local authority could make a byelaw if it became a particular problem in a locality.
<P>
The third group of restrictions are covered by existing restrictions. Numerous amendments try to add activities to the restrictions in schedule 2. Although those activities are, indeed, undesirable in open country, they are covered by other restrictions. Those additions sought in amendment No. 100 and new sub-paragraph (ee) proposed in amendment No. 134 would stop the removal of minerals, soil or peat from the land. I take it that it is meant seriously. I am not sure how it could be done without causing damage to the land—it clearly would—but it is covered by the restriction in paragraph 1(i). If the products are removed from the site, it is likely to be theft; that, too, is dealt with in our proposed amendment.
<P>
I am not sure whether anyone mentioned them, but the use of crossbows on the land, which is listed at new paragraph (z) of amendment No. 134, is likely to offend against the restrictions in paragraph 1(s) of annoying or disturbing other people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> Will my right hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall give way to my hon. Friend, who is an acknowledged expert on the subject of crossbows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> For the second or third time, my right hon. Friend has used the word ``annoy''. I am not entirely sure whether we can properly define that word—for instance, to satisfy the Countryside Commission. In its briefing note, the commission draws attention to the use of that word. It stated that its use is ``excessive'' and that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would be difficult to prove or enforce.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) told us about the landowner who was annoyed by the passing hot air balloon to the extent that he shot at it. Some landowners may be annoyed by ramblers wearing brightly coloured cagoules. Is the word necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am relieved to find that paragraph 1(s) states to annoy ``without reasonable excuse''. That is reasonably precise. The fact that ramblers were wearing red coats would not constitute a reasonable excuse.
<P>
Amendment No. 106, referred to by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, would place a restriction on anyone engaging in the disturbance of hunting, shooting, fishing, or any other country sport. Such activities would generally be covered by the restriction in paragraph 1(r), which includes intimidation, obstruction or disruption of any lawful activity on the land. That restriction will apply to the disruption of hunting, shooting and fishing provided that they are being carried out lawfully.
<P>
Amendment No. 134 proposes two new restrictions which relate to the use of vehicles. No one would dispute that a restriction is already in place on driving or riding a vehicle on access land; it is also a criminal offence. I am not sure how someone can park a caravan or trailer without driving it onto the land, but if the caravan were left on the land that itself would be a trespass against the owner of the land. The same applies to the proposed restriction on repairing a vehicle. How would a vehicle get on to access land without being driven or ridden? Those activities are therefore already covered by the schedule.
<P>
Several amendments call for the inclusion of such activities as hot air ballooning—a subject that seemed to generate more heat than light—parascending, bungee jumping and the use, launch or landing of light aircraft, helicopters or microlights. That would make it an extraordinary Bill. I am sure that hon. Members are aware that the restrictions currently include hang-gliding and para-gliding. Those activities were listed because they were not considered to involve vehicles as such; almost all the proposed activities would be covered by the restrictions on riding or driving a vehicle on the land. No one could say that someone in a helicopter was not riding a vehicle. Parascending involves someone being pulled by a boat or vehicle, the driving of which are restricted activities. In practice, it would be difficult to launch a passenger-carrying balloon without vehicular support. The taking of vehicles off public roads would normally fall foul of the restrictions in paragraph 1(a) and the criminal law. In any circumstances, a launch that caused disturbance to livestock would offend against the existing restrictions.
<P>
The only activity that would remain is bungee jumping. I do not have experience of the sport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> At the Victoria Falls, on the boundary between Zambia and Zimbabwe, there is a high bridge from which a rope extends. I was challenged to dive off the bridge into the swirling river below. I declined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The rest is history.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Well, it would have been history had I dived.
<P>
Bungee jumping normally takes place from a crane—which is a vehicle and so may not be on access land—or from a high bridge, often over water, as in the case to which I referred. I am not sure that many such places exist on land likely to be mapped as open country. Such places that do exist might be on public highways, in which case it is not for this part to address.
<P>
I shall deal quickly with the other amendments. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome wanted to add ``recklessly'' to paragraph 1(j), which places a restriction on intentionally removing or damaging any plant, tree or shrub. That would bring the restriction into line with other restrictions, such as those concerning damage to animals or land, that include ``intentionally or recklessly.'' However, the restriction is drafted to ensure that it is consistent with the parallel criminal offence on damage to plants in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
<P>
Introducing ``recklessly'' would extend the spirit of the restriction to anyone who damaged any plant, however trivially and regardless of whether they intended to do so, provided that the damage was caused recklessly. If carried to the extreme— and the hon. Gentleman's ingenuity is considerable—that could have the effect of denying the right of access to virtually every walker who entered access land. The hon. Gentleman did not intend that, but lawyers—several sit on the Committee— might argue that, if you trod on grass or other vegetation, that simple action would amount to reckless damage. I realise that that sounds ludicrous; I mention it only as an ad hominem. I knew that it would generate a response but I am not inclined to give over-enthusiastic lawyers the chance.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister gives way, I remind him that ``you'' refers to me. I always walk on grass when I take the dog for a walk. He should not use ``you'' recklessly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The expression that I seek to interpolate is capable of being construed absurdly by lawyers and others, but the same interpretation could be applied to paragraph 1(e). One can be certain that any reckless action involved in taking a footstep will destroy as many members of the animal kingdom as of the plant kingdom. If we are to have the provision, it will be sensible to avoid reckless damage to vegetation. What is the result of acting recklessly? It is to be excluded for 24 hours for trespass. It would not be a major criminal proceeding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. Paragraph 1(e) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>intentionally or recklessly takes, kills, injures or disturbs any animal, bird or fish.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is another matter to talk about intentionally or recklessly disturbing or damaging vegetation. I stand by what I said—including the word would open up so wide an opportunity for lawyers that I feel strongly disinclined to go down that route.
<P>
Amendment No. 134 seeks to add the holding of a political meeting or the delivery of a political address to the restrictions. Although that was listed as a restricted activity under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, holding or attending a political meeting would not constitute ``open air recreation''. I am sure that we all agree with that statement, whether we are sleeping or listening. The activities would therefore not fall within the scope of the right. If necessary, problems could be dealt with by a local restriction under chapter II.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have covered more or less everything, apart from amendments Nos. 101 and 134, which I shall mention because the hon. Member for Ashford mentioned them. The amendments refer to metal detecting, which is a criminal offence on scheduled ancient monuments but not on other sites. Those using metal detectors would not be able to dig up any ``hits'', but it is difficult to see why they would engage in metal detecting unless they intended to do that, and they might well decide to return later.
<P>
We have carefully considered the amendment, and I hope that hon. Members will be content if I say that I propose to table an amendment on Report to the effect that any offence shall be deemed to be a restriction under schedule 2 and render someone a trespasser subject to removal from the land. I believe that that covers the spirit of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. In fact, I am grateful that he is here at all, given some of his experiences overseas. The ability to say no in the right place is clearly essential.
<P>
The Minister drew attention to paragraph 1(s). Some hon. Members expressed concern that reference to a noise was insufficiently clear, but paragraph 1(s) includes the words ``disturbs, annoys or obstructs'', and ``disturbs'' seems to me to be at least as open to interpretation by lawyers as a noise. However, I generally welcome the Minister's commitment to table an amendment on Report to strengthen the restrictions in the schedule. As I said in my opening remarks, in tabling the amendments, we sought to provide the Minister with a menu from which he could choose. He accepted all or part of amendments Nos. 100, 103 and 134. We are grateful for that and will carefully consider the details of the amendment that he tables on Report. We want to improve the schedule and believe that some sort of amendment is necessary. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I also welcome you to the Chair.
<P>
This group of amendments deals with all the issues relating to dogs. The Minister will remember that this issue was raised in almost every speech on Second Reading by hon. Members on both sides of the House, who were concerned in particular about the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the vicinity of livestock''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in schedule 2. The Government had some difficulty defining what that means. I look forward to what the Minister has to say on this. He will realise—having looked at our amendments—that we also found it difficult. We are not seeking to amend that particular word, but to circumnavigate the problem with other amendments. Mr. McWilliam, you have selected a wide group of amendments, which—as I said earlier—fit into two clusters. One relates to dogs and whether or not they are on leads, and the other relates to the definition of livestock.
<P>
Amendment No. 107, the lead amendment, is slightly defective. However, it serves to emphasise an important point. It would ban dogs altogether from access land. As I realised after we had drafted the amendment, it would affect those who use dogs as guide dogs or for hearing. However, I do not think the principle of excluding dogs in general should be so quickly dismissed. I realise that it is a radical and draconian proposal, but when one considers all the problems caused by dogs and reported by numerous organisations and observers, it is easy to reach the conclusion that a total ban—except for dogs that are used as guides—might be the best way forward. I want to make it clear that I am not in any way being anti dog. I am fond of dogs, although I do not own one myself because my nomadic existence as a Member of Parliament does not suit ownership of a dog. I fully recognise the strong relationship between people and their dogs and their wish to take them along on their walks.
<P>
In preface to my other remarks, I would like to note the point that the Under-Secretary of State has made—quite rightly—on several occasions. Only this morning, he said again that he had to pinch himself when he heard the comments of Conservative Members because large parts of the country are already open to access. He may be inclined to make the same remark in respect of our concerns about dogs. However, there is a difference between existing access and that provided for in the Bill. Existing access is largely linear. Under the Bill, people will be able to walk anywhere on open land rather than just on linear footpaths. Therefore, what is proposed is different.
<P>
Amendments No. 108, 224 and 118 all define a lead as less than 2m long. That may seem unnecessary, but hon. Members will be aware that many dog owners use expanding leads, which allow a dog a considerable amount of roam around the owner. In a moment, I will raise the kind of disturbances that can result from that and why such leads are unacceptable; or should be restricted to less than 2m.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 would require a dog to be on a lead at all times, not only during the three-month period the schedule suggests. Amendment No. 117 extends the three-month period to four-months. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex has mentioned charts prepared by the Game Conservancy. I have a similar chart produced from data collected by Colin Harrison who published a book, ``A Field Guide to the Nest Eggs and Nestlings of British and European Birds''. The chart refers to the breeding seasons of upland waders. It shows that the egg laying, incubation and the chick rearing periods extend well into July for species such as the curlew, dunlin and the greenshank. Snipe and golden plover's seasons tend to be over by the end of June. However, there are species, including some rare species, where the season clearly extends almost to the end of July. As I said earlier, there is evidence that moors managed for the purpose of keeping red grouse have significant benefits for upland-breeding waders. Changing the length of the period is not an attempt to stop people enjoying open ground access. It merely acknowledges that birds nest for longer than to the end of June. A bird with extremely young chicks can be just as disturbed or damaged—or even killed—by a dog.
<P>
Professor Derek Yalden of Manchester university shows that, unlike some ground-nesting birds, which sit very tight when walkers or dogs pass by, golden plover can be alarmed by dogs at distances greater than 400m. Those who regularly walk in such areas will know that several species of bird have the natural trait of trying to distract potential predators by fluttering away from the nest as if they were injured and trying to draw the threat away from the nest. That is entirely understandable; it is part of the bird's nature. The consequence, however, is that the chicks are left untended. If the bird perceives the constant stream of walkers and dogs as a threat, it will never return to the nest, and the chicks will suffer the inevitable consequence. If only one walker goes by, the bird may do its distraction act and return to the nest when the threat has passed; but if a continued threat is perceived, the bird will continue acting as I have described. I fear that that would lead to serious damage to wildlife.
<P>
The National Gamekeepers Organisation says clearly that dogs
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>do serious damage to wildlife especially when running free.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also says that much of the open country involved is of high conservation importance and that the Government are under an international obligation to protect it. Research shows that the public cannot be relied upon to keep dogs on leads, especially in open country. It goes on to say that dogs should not be allowed on access land at any time.
<P>
On the question of not being able to rely upon the public, I refer the Committee to the fact that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors states that there is a significant problem. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Dogs can disturb wildlife within a 100m strip of footpath, chase sheep and disrupt hefted sheep flocks. Where dogs are allowed they should be on a short not expanding lead.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The RICS calls for dogs to be on leads at all times in open country, and that dog leads should be of a short, non expanding type. That is important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> Would the provision on dogs extend to commons? Under the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, dogs can roam free on Dartmoor commons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which I had not considered. I am certainly of the view that dogs should not be allowed to roam wild on access land. Dartmoor common land is a relatively unique scenario; common land is usually on a smaller scale and it is perfectly acceptable activity, even though it may be risky for the dog because of the proximity of traffic. I still maintain that it is not sensible to extend that principle to all land. For all its great attractions, Dartmoor is not home to many of the bird species to which I referred. Many of those birds nest on uplands, which Dartmoor is not, despite its natural features.
<P>
The British Association for Shooting and Conservation also welcomes the recognition in the Bill that dogs should remain on a lead during the sensitive breeding season, but points out that the period stated in the Bill ends on 30 June. Late broods of ground-nesting birds remain vulnerable from disturbance until the end of July. It therefore supports the amendment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I also have a worthy report from A.P. Tharme, R.E. Green, D. Baines and I.P. Bainbridge carried out for the RSPB, the Department of Zoology at Cambridge university and the Game Conservancy Trust. It is a major treatise entitled ``The effect of management for the sport shooting of red grouse on the population density of breeding birds on heather-dominated moorland''. It stresses the importance of moorland for nature conservation and the fact that six European heath and mire plant communities are virtually confined to Britain and Ireland and seven others are better developed here than anywhere else. Of 40 species of breeding birds associated with the UK uplands, seven occur in internationally important numbers. There is ample evidence in the document of the importance of grouse moor management not just to waders, but to disturbance and predator control, which is equally important.
<P>
The Moorland Association to which my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex referred, makes a point that comes back to what I said about dogs being on a lead at all times and how the public cannot necessarily be relied upon. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The restrictions in respect of dogs are totally inadequate in the light of the experience in the Peak District where even with a bylaw sanction and with massive publicity 60 per cent. of those with dogs let them off the lead within 250 yards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is why we have to take what appear to be drastic measures. We will never be able to prevent it, but we can minimise the effects. The association goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The consequences for nesting birds are incalculable. We suggest that during the nesting season . . . there should be no dogs and for the remainder of the season all dogs should be on a lead.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not just those who have a shooting or a sporting interest in the moorland who argue that, because the Countryside Agency makes the point, as do the Countryside Agency for Wales and the Country Landowners Association.
<P>
There is a real need for the Government to think again about the controls. I urge them to consider extending the period from 30 June to 31 July and requiring dogs to be on a lead at all times, rather than only during that period. As I said in my opening comments, we are talking about people who will be walking anywhere on open countryside, not just on footpaths. The potential for damage and disturbance of nesting birds and livestock is very much greater. Livestock and wildlife can instinctively stay away from regularly used footpaths, but that instinct does not apply when it is not clear where the walkers may be going.
<P>
I now turn to the second cluster of amendments which relate to wildlife. I did not refer to amendment No. 135 which would remove dogs from footpaths over open land. The genesis of the amendment was concern about the potential conflict between the Bill and existing legislation in respect of dogs on footpaths. There is a lot of open land with footpaths. That land is subject to existing legislation for the control of dogs. Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain whether the Bill is compatible with that legislation.
<P>
Turning to livestock, it is probably fair to say that we have a pick-and-mix selection of amendments. I shall not go through them all in detail, but suffice to say that the earlier comments about dogs were designed to minimise the problem of defining the vicinity. This cluster of amendments is designed to ensure that we are genuinely talking about livestock that is likely to be on the moor or on the open country. We are proposing to add deer: although most deer are wild, many are semi-domesticated being farmed as a livestock enterprise. They are, therefore, just as important, and far more prone to disturbance, as more conventional livestock.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) proposes to include alpacas, llamas and so on. He is quite right to do so because they are being kept in developing enterprises in many areas. We would also stress that game in the wild state is equally important in terms of the livestock that exists on the moor. On many moors, game is the only economic resource that generates an income. In that respect it is no different from sheep, cattle or any other stock.
<P>
The reasons for ensuring that the term ``livestock'' covers everything that we believe it should cover are not just in the interests of preventing the disturbance of wild life, but to minimise the risks of sheep worrying and cattle worrying. They also recognise the genuine difficulties that occur in controlling dogs. However well-meaning people are, they take their dogs onto a moor and let them off their leads. The dogs may not respond to entreaties or yells to come back because they are busy chasing something that they should not be chasing and are easily distracted.
<P>
Finally, there is also the danger to the walkers themselves. Cattle can be quite vicious to walkers, particularly if they are caught unawares and more particularly if dogs are involved. We know that cattle are attracted to dogs and that there have been tragic cases of walkers being trampled to death—not by malicious intent on the part of the animals, but simply as a result of their herd curiosity.
<P>
Also on open land there are breeds of cattle that are very aggressive, particularly when they have calves at foot. The Galloway breed is one that occurs to me, but others can be very aggressive. They can certainly turn on people. If, for example, walkers are on an area of moor that is away from what is normally considered the beaten track and suddenly stumble on a cow with a young calf, she might well turn very vicious. This is not something that any of us would want and it certainly puts the walker at risk.
<P>
This is a huge group of amendments covering very important linked issues. I hope that, despite the fact that I have been briefer than intended, Ministers will understand that I have raised some very real concerns. On Second Reading it was made clear that these concerns came from all sides of the House. I urge the Minister to accept the amendments, at least in principle.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) has correctly outlined the double thrust of this large group of amendments, and those in my name fall into both categories. The first deals with the control of dogs, and the second with the definition employed for livestock. I shall not dwell at length on either. I am not a dog owner or much of a dog lover. However, I appreciate that many people are and that they like their dogs to accompany them when they walk in the countryside, and there is no reason why they should not. That is why I would not be attracted to an amendment that prevented people from walking their dogs in all open countryside in all circumstances.
<P>
There is, however, a difference between that situation and people walking through land on which there is domesticated livestock or in a season when the birds are nesting and there is an obvious risk of dogs disturbing them and causing considerable disruption. It is quite beyond the owner's capacity to prevent that if the dog is ranging widely. I therefore tabled amendment No. 224, which identifies what paragraph 4(1) should mean by the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any dog which is not on a lead<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
by specifying what is meant by a lead. As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, there is a new fashion in leads, which means that they can extend over a large area and provide no real control over the dog.
<P>
I feel slightly abashed about having tabled the amendment because I have had great fun over the years at the expense of the municipal authorities of Geneva. I know of someone who was prosecuted for having his dog on too long a lead in that fair city, and I have always considered that to be an illustration of one aspect of the Swiss mentality. Now, however, I am now promulgating a similar suggestion. None the less, a reference to a fixed lead of less than 2 m in length clearly identifies what is probably intended in the Bill. The intention is to ensure that a dog is under its owner's control and in no position to range widely and disturb livestock and wild creatures in the way that dogs do, sui generis, if left to their own devices. The definition in the amendment is helpful to the workings of the Bill and to dog owners in understanding what is meant by the term ``lead''. It will prevent the possibility of an altercation between a person who exercises his rights of access under the Bill with his dog and a landowner, warden or other person with authority.
<P>
I looked at the definition of livestock in paragraph 5(2) on page 41, and my immediate reaction was to ask, ``Where is the reference to deer?'' It is extraordinary to omit them. They are clearly a problem as far as dogs are concerned and are often kept on the land that we are discussing, which begs the question of why they have been left out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I do not think that it is a case of them being kept; if they were, they would be in a deer park and properly fenced in. The hon. Gentleman is making a fair and good point, but there are much more likely to be deer in the wild, which are, of course, attractive to dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He is right that a deer park would fall under the definition of agricultural land or we must assume that it will once the Bill has been amended. The category of owned deer on what would otherwise be open land would be included, so there is a real concern. The more that I thought about the problem of deer, the more that I realised that the definition was tightly drawn and might not include other livestock that would be kept.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not steal the thunder of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who has given examples of animals now kept as domesticated creatures. I have my doubts as to whether they are kept on mountain tops, but there are buffalo and llama farms on common land in my constituency. [Interruption.] I do not believe that there are any ostriches, but I stand to be corrected. Such farms exist, so there is no reason why they should not be on heath or common land. We might run into such circumstances. Rather than speculate on what livestock one might find, would it not be better to have a definition that encompassed any domesticated livestock?
<P>
I have made two suggestions. Amendment No. 208 would add the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or any other domesticated species,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as a catch-all or backstop to ensure that the definition was all-encompassing. Alternatively, amendment No. 211 uses the wording in the Agriculture Act 1947. Given that that has operated effectively as a definition of livestock in statute, there seems no reason to invent a less inclusive alternative for the Bill. The Minister may have good reasons to prefer a different formulation, but the definition should cover the domesticated species that we may find. We should not have to add species to the Bill later due to circumstances that we have not thought about properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome conjured up a splendid view of majestic herds of wildebeest trampling over the Somerset levels, with Krakatoa erupting in the background. That is a Basil Fawlty description, as some hon. Members may remember, but it is not quite the way things are. There are not that many buffaloes on the uplands at the moment, although, by the time that the Government are finished with farming, it may be reduced to that. I mean that in a caring and obliging sense.
<P>
I want to speak about the general dog sentiment, and should declare an interest, as I have been owned by several dogs. I do not have one at the moment, but I am a tremendous dog lover, sympathiser, promoter and supporter. Nothing that I say should be deemed to be to the detriment of dogs, which I consider to be noble and good animals—as opposed to cats. There is no cat clause yet, and we can only hope that their Lordships will see fit to examine the cat end of the market a bit more carefully.
<P>
I want to speak to the general dog amendments, but especially to amendment No. 135. I know that the Minister had a good meeting with people from the Moorland Association. He was kind enough to see them, he listened carefully and they were most grateful. They wrote him a detailed letter on 23 March restating the points that they had made. I know the way in which officials follow letters up, and that it is rare that Ministers see them, so I should be grateful if the Minister would assure me that he will ensure that his officials show him the letter. It contains a great deal of common sense that he would want to see.
<P>
As the Moorland Association said, the control of dogs is extremely important, and a critical factor in making urban access work consistently with the needs of land management. Schedule 2 contains some controls, but, at sensitive times of the year, a dog on the lead can still be extremely disruptive to ground-nesting birds. A lead of more than 2m in length does not restrain dogs near sheep. Clearly, that is important during lambing and at other times, whether or not they are in the vicinity. Buffaloes, llamas and so on are another matter.
<P>
I want to endorse the view expressed by the Country Landowners Association, the Moorland Association and the National Gamekeepers Organisation. I want the right hon. Gentleman to assure me that the Government will pay attention to the National Gamekeepers Organisation, which, after all, is the body responsible for conserving an enormous swathe of the uplands. It states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Even with the restrictions imposed by Schedule 2, there is no doubt that the new right of access will disturb wildlife and the environment. Dogs—even when on leads and certainly when off them outside the restricted period—will cause serious disruption. As much of this open country is already designated SSSI or Special Protection Area, the Government has internationally recognised obligations to conserve it. Are they laying themselves open to a challenge that by allowing dogs access in this way they are in breach of their conservation obligation? In any case they gave no manifesto commitment to allow for dogs, only for people.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who is behind the desire to give free access to dogs? I have not heard from any representative body that wants it. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire produced some important figures on the breeding seasons of upland waders in England, which were sent to the Minister following the Game Conservancy meeting. The lapwing, for example, starts breeding at the beginning of April, and continues until the end of June. As my hon. Friend said, the curlew continues until July. Grouse are not on the list because they are not upland waders. They will be nesting in April and May, their chicks will be on the ground in June, July and August, and they are highly susceptible to interference and chasing. In many upland areas—the Pennines, for instance, most of which is entirely an SSSI—such birds are, in economic terms, what enables the uplands to be maintained and to look as they do. The views of the Game Conservancy and the National Gamekeepers Organisation are important, and I hope that Ministers listen to them.
<P>
In a letter to the Minister after their meeting, the Game Conservancy expressed its concern about the proposed regime for dogs set out in paragraph 4. It did not believe that the regime would be adequate for heather moorland, and cited the Peak district as an example of how, even with byelaws and sanctions, people ignore requirements that dogs should be kept on leads. The legislation, it said, should make it clear that the right of access was for people, not dogs.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendments, which are not intended to impede or harm the passage of the Bill but make it more sensible and pragmatic. All those who are responsible for maintaining and caring for the uplands—keepers, owners, tenants and everyone else—would be immensely relieved if the Government were to introduce a minor amendment to deal with dogs. It would give great comfort and show that the Government are responding to an issue that is of real urgency and importance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> It was remiss of me, Mr. McWilliam, not to have welcomed you as Chairman earlier. It is a little late, but I do so now.
<P>
This is an important matter, and, thankfully, hon. Members can join in a common cause. Surely all of us want to ensure that upland ground-nesting birds continue to thrive.
<H4><center>[Mr. GEORGE STEVENSON in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
In some instances in my constituency, the stone curlew has almost disappeared. Indeed, curlews have virtually disappeared. I have my own theories about that, believing that it is probably due to the predominance of raptors. However, that is, perhaps, by the by, and better left for another debate. Such birds are under severe pressure, and if a general, non-linear right of access is to be provided the numbers will decline yet further. That would sadden all members of the Committee, and, I am sure, many thousands of people outside the House, too.
<P>
I do not believe that I can add much to what has been said, because I would merely be reiterating some of the important and telling points that have been made. I suggest that one way to deal with the matter would be to provide for an exclusion during the main nesting times, following which, if dogs are to be allowed, they should be on a short leash while they are on moorlands or open land. I am not a dog owner; I approach the matter not with any antipathy towards dogs or their owners but with a sincere and burning desire to maintain the upland ecology. That includes ground nesting birds, which are already under considerable strain, and I hope that the Bill will not make it even worse for them. I am sure that both Ministers will have that in mind when they respond, and I sincerely hope that a compromise can be reached to secure the future of such important birds.
<P>
The second tranche of amendments relates to the definition of livestock. I referred to llamas and alpaca just to show off, because I know what they are, but on a serious note, some farmers in my constituency who work relatively high ground keep llamas. The hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas) nods; his constituency contains such farms, too. I am worried that in constructing a definition that purports to list all domesticated species that should come within the ambit of the schedule it would obviously be wrong not to include all those currently being bred for domestic purposes. In the summer, buffaloes are kept on high land, and I foresee that they will be increasingly bred in the United Kingdom as the desire for mozzarella cheese increases. [Interruption.] I occasionally eat it, but obviously not everyone likes it.
<P>
We must extend the definition as far as possible to cover all species now being farmed, and in that vein I have also tabled amendment No. 314, which would include ostrich. On reflection, I realise that pheasant and grouse are game and are probably catered for elsewhere in the Bill, but ostrich should be referred to. Again, it is becoming an increasingly important sector of agriculture. That is not to say that, if a Scots terrier had an altercation with an ostrich, I would not put my money on the ostrich—if the Scots terrier could catch up with it, of course. Again, it is a case of considering what current agricultural practices exist. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome might have put his finger on the matter by saying that amendment No. 208 is a backstop or catch-all provision, and that might be the way forward. But we should provide for the other categories that we already know about.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> We have had a good debate on an issue that is, as I acknowledge from the outset, serious. Opposition Members, especially the hon. Members for South-East Cambridgeshire and for Mid-Sussex, have made some powerful points. The control of dogs is a subject that arouses strong views in urban areas, never mind in country areas. I must say at the outset that, under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953, it is a criminal offence for animals to worry livestock, which is the background against which we have had this discussion. There is common agreement that dog owners have a clear responsibility for their pets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Under-Secretary confirm that that Act applies only to sheep, not to other animals?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes. I thank the hon. Gentleman for pointing that out. He is correct, although sheep are the most commonly encountered livestock. The Act does not apply to birds, buffalo or many of the more exotic animals that roam the uplands of Wales and the lowlands of Somerset. Dog owners must accept that dogs, if not controlled effectively, can pose a serious threat to livestock and wildlife. But we must recognise that many people derive a great deal of legitimate pleasure from walking their dogs in the countryside. Dogs have long been considered a natural companion for man and woman, and many people value the security that comes from having a dog with them when walking in the countryside.
<P>
Our common aim should be to develop restrictions on dogs that are both effective and seen by most dog owners as necessary and reasonable. The Bill seeks to achieve that end, although I acknowledge that such a balance is difficult to strike and I make no claims that we have it right. I stress at the outset that clauses 21, 22 and 24 permit a landowner to seek restrictions in addition to those already provided for under schedule 2, if there were thought to be a serious risk to wildlife and livestock. That should meet some of hon. Members' concerns.
<P>
The Bill reflects extensive discussions with various organisations, including the Countryside Agency and English Nature as well as non-governmental bodies. As the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex said, we have received representations from the Moorland Association and the National Gamekeepers Organisation. I have not seen them personally, but I undertake to study them to see what points they make.
<P>
The Bill recognises that dogs that are not under effective control, near livestock or wildlife at certain times of the year, can cause disturbance—and, in the most serious cases, injury and damage. That is why it specifies that dogs should be on leads in the vicinity of livestock and on all access land from 1 March to 30 June to take account of the needs of ground-nesting birds. I thought that I heard the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire say that that was three months, but it is four months. That period was determined in consultation with English Nature, although I am happy to take away the points that have made about upland waders and check them out with that organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, English Nature is often wrong about such matters. It has misled him. The June figure is completely absurd. He will see from the papers left by the Game Conservancy following its meeting the exact diagrammatic scenario. The key point is not just that it is the end of the nesting season, but that the chicks are at their most vulnerable between June and July. If it has been a bad or wet spring, several birds will try to have second broods, which extends the nesting season through July and possibly into August.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made his point clearly and I undertake to reflect on it further. As things stand at the moment, we are not convinced that the period needs extending, as proposed by amendments Nos. 117 and 116. If, in the light of experience, the period needs reviewing, the Bill allows for it by giving the Secretary of State and the National Assembly in Wales the power to amend through regulation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the Bill allows for the possibility of extending the period, if necessary.
<P>
We recognise that the Bill goes too far for some, but not far enough for others. It would be ill advised to impose an outright ban on all dogs on access land, as proposed by amendment No. 107. Amendment No. 135 is less stringent, seeking to ban dogs from access land and rights of way over it during the period specified in the Bill. Many dog owners, including the responsible majority, would view such proposals as unjustified and unreasonable. As such, there is a risk that they would be widely ignored. According to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, that is already happening in the Peak District. Livestock and wildlife could be exposed to even greater risk. In the end, we want dog owners to feel that they can subscribe to the regime because they can see the justification for it. If they cannot, it is likely to be honoured more in the breach than the observance.
<P>
However, amendment No. 135 has some merit. Among our key criteria for developing the new rights of access are clarity and consistency. Amendment No. 135 suggests that dog restrictions on access land should also apply to rights of way where they cross it. There may be a case for harmonising the position on access land with respect to rights of way crossing such land. Others have raised the issue, so we intend to reflect further on the scope for requiring dogs to be on leads at all times in the vicinity of livestock between 1 March and 30 June on all access land and on rights of way crossing such land. That would have the benefit of consistency and would be welcomed by landowners, but the result would be removal of an existing right, which seems to have caused few problems, though Opposition Members may tell me otherwise, As I said, we are prepared to consider the case further, but not quite in the form proposed in amendment No. 135. I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is happy with that.
<P>
I shall move on to whether the Bill should specify that when dogs are on leads, the leads should be of short fixed length. I understand some of the concerns about extendable leads, which can mean that dogs are less constrained. The key is to ensure that dogs are on leads in the first place. Even extendable leads dramatically reduce the potential for disturbance or worrying of livestock or wildlife. On balance, I am not convinced of the need to specify the length of the leads, as amendments Nos. 118, 224 and 108 would do.
<P>
The current definition of livestock is right for present purposes. We do not wish to include game in the wild state, as suggested in amendments Nos. 136 and 299. Unlike cattle and sheep, game—particularly game birds, such as grouse, and also deer—are not always easy to spot. It would be unreasonable to expect someone with a dog always to know when game birds are close by. I have more sympathy for the proposition of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that deer—or farmed deer, at least—should be included in the list. However, as has been said, I doubt whether there are many—if any—cases of deer farming on open country. On balance, I am not persuaded by amendment No. 207.
<P>
For similar reasons, I am not convinced that we need special provision for farmed livestock such as buffalo or ostrich, as suggested in amendments Nos. 313 and 314. A general, catch-all definition of livestock, of the sort envisaged in amendments Nos. 208 and 211, may lead to more rather than less confusion about when dogs must be on leads.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): On the point about alpaca, schedule 2(5)(2) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In this paragraph, ``livestock'' means cattle<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and so on. Should not that read ``livestock includes . . .'' if, as the Minister said, the list is not meant to be definitive or exhaustive. Without being frivolous, one frequently encounters llamas and alpacas. I recently came across a herd of llamas when I was walking in the Clwydian range, for example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall have to reflect on that. I have to say that we do not see many alpacas in Sunderland. Our list is not exhaustive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> If the list is not intended to be exhaustive, why does the Minister not add to it now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We make the point throughout the Bill that it will be possible, where good reasons can be given, to apply for extensions or, as in this case, to amend it once it is working and we can see whether there are serious problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The Minister does not have to rely on me; I told him that there was upland farming of llamas in Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, but his hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Clwyd, West, has just told him that he came across llamas on the high ground of the Clwydian range. That is surely an example that would bolster an application to include llamas and possibly alpacas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As I said, I will reflect on the point made by the hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> I want to help the Committee on llamas and alpacas. First, the llamas that the hon. Member for Clwyd, West came across were probably domesticated; they would have been enlarged if they were for the purposes of eating. Normally, they have a halter on; many farms have done well by taking people on riding safaris. Perhaps the Minister does not know how a llama tells someone if it really likes him: it spits in his eye—not an attractive habit. Maybe there ought to be a restriction in the Bill on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am most grateful for that. One learns something new every day.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I do not know why the Minister wants to consider what animals he could add to his list, when it would be far easier simply to have a definition that encompassed the animals he has not thought of so that the legislation does not have to be amended later. He clearly does not want dogs to worry domesticated animals, so why does he not say that in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I have said that I will go away and reflect on it: I cannot give him any more than that today.
<P>
Were we to accept amendment No. 137, dog walkers would be guilty of a criminal offence, even if their dogs were not causing any harm or disturbance. There are those who believe that the Bill does not go far enough, but we have been careful to provide robust measures that are also likely to be accepted as reasonable by the vast majority of dog owners. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that the Bill allows the countryside bodies and local authorities to impose tighter restrictions, including an outright ban, when local circumstances demand. That addresses some of the points that have been made. The Bill does address exceptional local circumstances.
<P>
I conceded too much to the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) when he suggested that the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953 applies| only to sheep. I am advised that it does not. It makes it an offence to chase or attack livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats, swine, horses or poultry.
<P>
The Bill affords adequate protection against disturbance from dogs, provided that the restrictions set out in the Bill are observed, and, where necessary, tougher local controls can be applied. People and their dogs can benefit from greater access without causing problems. I therefore ask hon. Members not to press their amendments. I repeat, however, that we are willing to give further consideration to the position of dogs on rights of way that cross access land.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Welcome back, Mr. Stevenson. I thank the Minister for addressing all the amendments in the group, although in general, I am extremely disappointed with his response. I start by addressing the issue of livestock definitions. As the hon. Member for Somerset and Frome said, there is a clear need to get the Bill right now. It is all very well to say that the list is not exhaustive, but it is exhaustive until it is amended by regulation at a later date. We shall be discussing those regulations shortly, and whether we like the principle of being able to alter by regulation. However, once the Bill is enacted, someone whose dog attacks an alpaca or one of the other exotic species, or even a deer, will be breaking the law. Surely we should deal with the problem now, rather than worry about what can be dealt with later by regulation.
<P>
The amendment of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, which lifts the existing definition of livestock from a previous piece of legislation, is probably the best way forward. It is always better to use something that already exists in legislation than to start afresh. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the wisdom of pursuing the current line.
<P>
Some of the Under-Secretary's arguments on dogs were a bit thin, although I obviously welcome his remarks about amendment No. 135, and I look forward to his response. There has to be consistency between pieces of legislation and the apparent conflict between footpaths and rights of way legislation and dogs, and access land as it affects dogs, clearly needs to be resolved. However, there is a strong argument for a fixed lead, with a maximum length of 2 m. The Minister over-estimates people's ability to control a dog on an extended lead if the dog runs off after something which it ought not to run after. There will not always be a 200 lb he-man on the other end of a dog's lead. Many of us know how difficult it is to control a dog. Controlling a dog on a lead that is 20 ft long can be impossible if the dog is determined to chase something that it has scented or seen. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that, along with the need for a lead at all times. I had previously intended to seek leave to pursue amendment No. 116, but I will not do that because I am conscious that the Committee wants to make progress.
<P>
Although I appreciate the Minister's responses, I hope that he will reflect further on some of the issues that I have raised. A weight of evidence from a range of organisations suggests that the Bill, even if amendment No. 135 is made, will not be restrictive enough on dogs. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in, page 41, line 1, leave out paragraph 3.

<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 2'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendments concern the principle central to the Bill, and to so many other Bills, of how much power we wish to give to Ministers to alter the Bill by regulation. Both Ministers will be familiar with the debate, and I dare say that they have deployed both sides of the argument over how important it is that Parliament keeps a handle on legislation after it has received Royal Assent. It is transparently obvious from the debate that we have just had that even if the Government consider sensibly all the arguments, perfect legislation is unlikely to emerge from the initial process. We must ask whether we want to leave future changes to the good will and good sense of Ministers, or whether Parliament should have some input.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 115 and 114 would ensure that changes proposed by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales could be examined and debated openly. Amendments Nos. 297 and 298 would specifically provide for any changes to the restrictions on dogs to be made by orders, which are normally subject to affirmative resolution. The Minister said a few minutes ago that everything would be all right, because Ministers would be able to change the provisions by regulation. He must know that that is not a recipe for good governance, and I am sure that he has often made that point himself. The Committee's purpose is to make the Bill good now, not to insert provisions that allow Ministers to change their minds later in the half-knowledge that they got the Bill wrong in the early stages.
<P>
The amendments are consequential on the main issue, which is an important principle about the way in which the House scrutinises legislation and changes it in the future. In the Bill, as in much legislation, the devil is in the detail. There can be genuine differences of view that can be tested empirically only once legislation is in place. It is important that such legislation does not allow Ministers to make changes simply by regulation, and ensures that Parliament continues to have some control, so that it can properly test empirical disagreements through, for example, affirmative resolutions. I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I rise merely to say that I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ashford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I, too, shall be brief and entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ashford. If the provisions are to work, they must be implemented at a local level, because there will be variations throughout the UK. The hon. Gentleman said that the Under-Secretary must have employed the same argument many times, and in the interests of keeping the Committee cordial. I shall avoid the words poacher and gamekeeper.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If it is any comfort to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, I cannot recall having deployed this point before. I have not long held the lofty post that I now hold, so I have not had many opportunities, but who knows what the future might bring.
<P>
The aim of the present part of the Bill is to allow flexibility, where appropriate, and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy. That is why the Bill would allow variation of the restrictions in schedule 2 through regulations. Opposition Members cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, they want us to think about and change all sorts of things in the light, perhaps, of experience; on the other, they want to make it more difficult for us to make any changes. They must make up their minds which path they want to pursue.
<P>
I appreciate that some people have concerns about allowing scope for amending restrictions through regulations. However, I hope that hon. Members will agree that the restrictions in schedule 2 are reasonably comprehensive. We would, therefore, not expect to change them often. We have based the list of restrictions on that in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, but with revisions to reflect modern recreational needs. Nevertheless, no such list can cover all eventualities, and there is a need to recognise that circumstances can and do change. For example, it is not always possible to predict what leisure pursuits will be popular in 10 years' time, and we have touched on that. It is, therefore, important that the restriction regime responds to new demands.
<P>
Amendment No. 115 would remove the discretion of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly in Wales to amend or update the restrictions in the light of experience. That would not be sensible.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 114 and 291 would impose the affirmative resolution procedure. Unlike the power to extend the right of access to coastal land under clause 3, the regulation-making power in schedule 2 is about practicalities, not issues of principle— that is the crucial distinction. Affirmative resolution procedures are inappropriate and wholly disproportionate. The negative resolution procedure is the right way to deal with possible changes.
<P>
The same arguments apply to amendments Nos. 297, 298 and 292, and I hope that the Committee will agree that we should not require both Houses to vote on whether to amend the period during which dogs must be on leads on access land. That is best left to the Secretary of State and the National Assembly. They will no doubt take advice from the relevant experts, including the statutory nature conservation authorities, before introducing regulations. As we have seen, we are not short of advice from relevant experts—and even some irrelevant ones. Again, the normal negative resolution procedure is the appropriate parliamentary process.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members have been reassured by my comments and that they accept the need to build in sufficient flexibility to take account of experience and new pressures or demands. I therefore ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Under-Secretary should blush occasionally. He talked about simplicity, speed, flexibility and the disproportionate use of parliamentary procedure, but his language was that of Sir Humphrey throughout the ages. I can pay him no higher compliment than to say that it did not seem as if he had convinced himself I am happy to say that once a parliamentarian— somewhere underneath—always a parliamentarian.
<P>
The Under-Secretary accused us of wanting it both ways, but that is unfair. All parties represented on the Opposition Benches wish Parliament to have the power to influence future changes, just as we seek to influence changes by tabling amendments. Our position is entirely consistent. The Under-Secretary used as an example the question of whether both Houses should be able to discuss the length of leads, or the dates within which dogs should be excluded. That is precisely the type of legislative change that would benefit from the expertise available to the Government in the Committee, in the House and in another place, and which extends beyond the expertise of the bodies that the Government normally consult. I was completely unconvinced by the Under-Secretary's arguments in defence of the Government's position, but in the interests of good order and progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 41, line 14, at end insert—

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendment seeks simply to give local authorities the power to apply the provision of the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996 to access land. The hon. Member for Meiriommydd Nant Conwy has found a different way to address the same issue. I would not suggest that one way was better than the other; it is the principle that matters. Hon. Members are aware of the public distaste for dog fouling anywhere where people have to walk. That is, I assume, what the Under-Secretary referred to when he spoke about the problems with dogs in Sunderland and other urban areas. It is a particularly unpleasant thing, as everybody knows.
<P>
Local authorities should be allowed to apply the provisions of the Act to access land. Of course, I recognise that they cannot be applied to every square inch of open moorland, and I hope that the Under Secretary will not ridicule the proposition on that basis. In areas of access land, however, which are in proximity to places in which notice boards are to be erected and to other facilities, monuments or attractions, there will be a serious concern about dogs fouling. People's distaste is not the only issue; there is the human health risk of toxicara—that must be taken into account. There is also a risk to wildlife from the spread of certain diseases that dogs can carry, but I am especially concerned about the human health issue and the general distaste for dog fouling. I hope that the Under-Secretary will see fit to agree to the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, my amendment seeks to do exactly the same as his. The Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act, by virtue of section 1(3), excludes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>land which is predominantly marshland, moor or heath,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>land used for agriculture or for woodlands.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 2 provides some welcome restrictions with regard to marshland, moor and heath, but there is nowhere in the Bill a reference to the problem addressed by the amendment. To deal with the problem of dog fouling, we need only bring the Act into play. I hope that the debate will not be treated as ridiculous, as it is not meant to be ridiculous in any way. If dog owners in other open spaces are obliged to clear up after their animals, they should be required to do so on access land. The amendment would allow authorities to impose such an obligation and would therefore address the health problems that inevitably arise from fouling. I have no doubt that access authorities would consider placing receptacles of various sorts on open land to make it easier for dog owners to comply with the obligation. If the proposal is to be reasonable, that will follow as night follows day.
<P>
The amendment would equally benefit users and occupiers of access land, as dog fouling is a nuisance for all concerned. Under the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996, owners and occupiers of land can give their consent to waive the obligation. In other words, sheep farmers can waive the obligation in respect of their own sheepdogs. I hope that both amendments will commend themselves to the Committee, or even one of them. They deal with an important matter, which I hope that the Government will properly address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have every sympathy with the sentiment behind the amendments and I do not regard their subject as a matter for ridicule, but they are impractical and unenforceable and we have an obligation to concentrate on enforceable legislation, otherwise, we tend to over-legislate and to end up with laws that have no practical effect.
<P>
I recognise that fouling may cause problems in some local areas, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy pointed out. Such problems will occur especially in areas of intensive use, at access points and so on. However, local restrictions and byelaws are the most effective mechanisms for dealing with specific local problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Amendment No. 138 would ensure merely that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An access authority or a district council may apply the provisions of the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996 to access land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, such provision will not be enforceable in many circumstances and will be inappropriate in many areas of access land. We suggest only that the district council or access authority should have power to decide on the basis of their local knowledge whether to apply the provisions of the 1996 Act to access land, which may be common land. The amendment seeks to provide local discretion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Local authorities can already exercise such discretion through byelaws or local restrictions to deal with particular problems. I am sympathetic to such problems, which are particularly bad in cities, never mind the countryside. My instinct, however, is that the amendment will be unenforceable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> If the 1996 Act is enforceable in other areas, why would it be unenforceable on access land? As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, the obligation would not apply to the whole of the access land but to designated areas within it where people are likely to pause, and so on. I do not see the enforceability argument, any more than the Government saw the enforceability argument advanced this morning by the Opposition in respect of trespassing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The point that I am making is that a particular problem can be handled by applying local restrictions or byelaws. There are difficulties with enforcing the 1996 Act, especially in urban areas. It is enforced, but only patchily. This group of amendments would not help matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will reflect on this short debate. The issue is larger than he admits. Byelaws can be made, but the procedure that a local authority has to follow is tortuous and long-winded. We suggest that local authorities should have the powers in the 1996 Act to do that, not at the stroke of a pen, but in much shorter order. They should not have to go through the ponderous system of passing a byelaw. My experience in local government showed me that no local authority enters into that process lightly, because of the huge bureaucracy involved.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will take further advice on the best way to proceed. The proposition is not highly regulatory; it merely suggests that we should give local authorities the power to act quickly when they need to. It is about driving control to local areas. However, in the interests of progress and in light of the Minister's decision not to alter his opinion, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> This is a fairly large group of amendments. With the exception of amendment No. 221, which I shall deal with later, I shall refer to them in numerical order because that reflects their relevance to each other.
<P>
Amendment No. 301 relates to an owner's consent. Paragraph 6(3) refers to regulations that cover the revocation of directions and consent, but it does not explain how that is to be achieved or what the effect might be. The landowner or the farmer's use of the land may change, or problems might arise—for example, land might prove to be unsuitable for horses. There needs to be a facility to revoke or change directions. The amendment would provide for revocation of consent by the owner with a notice period to allow appropriate signage and notification.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 302 to 305 are similar. They relate to the modification of a direction with the owner's consent. There is provision for revocation, but there is no provision for modification of a direction. In practice, modification rather than total revocation might be necessary. Experience might show that access arrangements need tweaking instead of wholesale overturning or revocation. The opportunity to modify directions and consents would provide a halfway house between complete revocation and leaving matters untouched.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 306 to 309 fit neatly together. They would transfer the power to exclude restrictions outside the national parks from the Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales to elected local authorities. National park authorities are entrusted to exercise that power for national parks. We know that a majority of their members are drawn from local authorities. Therefore, in other areas outside the national parks, local authorities should be trusted with the power. Ministers have constantly emphasised the need for local decision making and discretion; transferring the power to the local level would be part of having a workable local system.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In your wisdom, Mr. Stevenson, you have linked amendments Nos. 221 and 310 with the others in the group, although the link is tenuous. They refer back to the point about the definition of ownership. Amendment No. 221 would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and those with an interest in the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 310 relates to the consent of the owner—the owner is defined as a tenant rather than a landlord—where that exists. We touched on the matter this morning, when the Under-Secretary rightly said that it related to geographical demarcation in terms of removal or prevention of return within 24 hours. In this and other contexts in the Bill, the importance of the definition of owner is much wider than simply the demarcation of a piece of land. It is the powers and responsibility that go with the owner.
<P>
I do not wish to repeat all the points that I and others made this morning about the different types of ownership and the fact that different people have rights to occupy land—not just farm tenants but shooting tenants and others. Transferring the term ``owner'' to a tenant in that context but not in other contexts is unwise. Paragraph 6 allows more activities on access land with the consent of the owner and moves towards a voluntary common-sense approach to access, which we support. There must be a greater understanding of the precise role of the owner.
<P>
That was a brief resume´ of the amendments in my name and in the names of my hon. Friends. I am concerned about the issue of ownership especially, as will be apparent from remarks made earlier today. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I will come to the point about ownership, but I will deal first with the general thrust of the amendments. As the hon. Gentleman has said, paragraph 6 allows the relevant authority—the Countryside Agency, Countryside Council for Wales or national park authority—to lift restrictions set out elsewhere in schedule 2 on a particular area of access land.
<P>
The intention behind the paragraph is to allow a wider range of activities to be exercised on land in pursuit of a statutory right of open-air recreation, rather than by mere toleration of the owner. For example, the restriction in paragraph 1(t) might be partially lifted to permit people to camp on the land as well as to walk on it. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle will be pleased about that. No direction may be made unless the owner of the land has first consented to it. A direction may be made to last indefinitely or for a specified period. We hope that that will provide a means of offering valuable new recreational opportunities.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 306 to 309 propose that the powers should be exercised not by the relevant authorities but by the access authorities. That is a reference to local authorities and national park authorities. The powers rest better with the relevant authorities and I will say why. Outside the national parks, the countryside bodies are the appropriate agencies to decide on closures and restrictions under chapter II, because of their statutory responsibilities for conservation and recreation and their experience in weighing the need to balance restrictions against the loss of recreational opportunities. Similarly, they should be responsible for suspending access restrictions under schedule 2.
<P>
Amendment No. 221 would require that directions under paragraph 6 not be made unless the consent of not only the owner but any others with an interest in the land had been obtained. Of course, we would expect the relevant authority to have considered any representations made by other persons interested in the land before issuing a direction under paragraph 6. The relevant authority will also need to consider the impact of that direction on the conservation of the land and whether there are adequate arrangements for the management of the additional recreational opportunities that would be permitted by the direction. We will be able to include any necessary requirements in regulations made under paragraph 6(3)(a).
<P>
A requirement on the relevant authority to obtain the consent of all those with an interest in the land, as in the amendment, would be bureaucratic. That could require the owner of the land or the relevant authority to seek the written consent of possibly more than 100 commoners. However, that would not just be bureaucratic—it would also be unnecessary. Those people with other interests in the land who consider that a direction will have prejudicial effects on their use of the land will be able to apply to the relevant authority for restrictions or exclusions under chapter II. I keep returning to that as a fallback to protect the interests of relevant persons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If the people with a relevant interest in the land—for example, the agricultural tenant—are not to be consulted by the local authority, how will they know about such an application?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My expectation is that the relevant authority would not only receive representations from persons with other interests in the land, but would consult them before deciding whether to make such a direction. In the normal case, they would be informed.
<P>
Amendment No. 300 provides that where a farm tenant consents to a direction under the powers, it should terminate on the expiry of the tenancy. However, nothing in paragraph 6 binds the successors in title of an owner, so a direction under the paragraph will have effect only while the current owner remains in possession. For that reason, the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 301 goes rather further than amendment No. 300 and allows the owner to require the revocation of any direction on one month's notice to the relevant authority. However, the owner may in any case apply to the relevant authority for a direction to be revoked, and although the authority would be under no obligation to revoke the direction, it might do so if there were sufficient grounds.
<P>
Hon. Members never miss—the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire did not again—the chance to table an amendment to the definition of owner, wherever the word appears in this part, and so we reach amendment No. 310. It would delete the modified definition of owner in sub-paragraph (4), so that where there was an agricultural tenancy, it would be the person entitled to the rack rent—not the tenant— who would need to give his consent to a direction. This has been a remarkably unideological Committee so far. Perhaps Conservative Members pay rather too much attention to those who own the land, rather than those who manage it. The amendment would mean that the tenant farmer was entirely out of the loop, which would not be justified. It would be a matter solely for the freeholder of the estate whether to permit horse riding, cycling, hang gliding and camping. Opposition Members consider those activities, and perhaps others, so frightful that they think that a mere undertaking of them on access land should be a criminal offence. The amendment does not properly represent the interests of tenant farmers, and would be unfair to them. Their rights should be upheld, so I cannot accept it.
<P>
I shall be more helpful to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire now. Amendments Nos. 302 to 305 would allow the relevant authority to modify a direction under this paragraph with the consent of the owner. A similar power to vary a direction appears in clause 25(1) in relation to directions given under chapter II. Therefore, I agree that it would be sensible for paragraph 6 to contain a similar provision, so I intend to consider what more is required and to table an appropriate amendment on Report. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will rest content.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I welcome the Minister's concluding remarks. I appreciate the fact that we might not have got the precise wording right, but I welcome his determination to alter the present description to allow for some modification.
<P>
On amendment No. 301, the Minister said that it was not right that the owner, having given his consent, should be able to revoke it later. He had already referred to the fact that the consent was not binding on future owners in title, so I am slightly puzzled as to what mechanism a future owner would have in relation to directions and restrictions made under the consent of a previous owner. If people give consent, they should have the right to withdraw it, with the necessary caveats to prevent that right from being used unreasonably.
<P>
On amendment No. 310, the Minister was a little unfair to suggest that we are ideologically attached to owners. We are not I am the first to recognise that simply removing the lines from the schedule would not achieve the whole purpose to which our overall remarks have been directed. We do not suggest that we are against the interests of tenant farmers. They must be included, which is why we referred to the other amendment about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>those with an interest in the land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although that may be slightly too broad, to say that the owner or the farm tenant must give his consent is a little simplistic and improper. I remind the Minister that under the terms of agricultural tenancies, owners retain many rights. To suggest that, under this legislation, the owner loses the right to give or withhold his consent to the various alterations and activities that might occur, simply because he has a tenant, seems to remove something from the landowner that should not be removed.
<P>
Tenants' interests are important, so tenants should be consulted. In many ways, their consent should be essential, but—[Interruption.] The Minister has obviously suddenly seen the light, probably not in relation to the words that I have used. The right of giving consent should be attached to other people involved with the land. The owner must be key. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold is the expert, but I am sure that, in most agricultural tenancies, the owner usually has to give consent for erecting buildings, doing anything that might affect trees, taking down a hedge and all sorts of things that occur on farms. That is a feature of the tenancy agreement. The landowner must give consent, yet the Bill suggests that only the tenant has to give consent for something that might be nothing to do with the farming of the land, but very much to do with the rights and responsibilities of the owner of the land. That is wrong. However, the Minister is clearly not minded to accept my arguments and is not about to respond as a result of the flash of inspiration that he had a few minutes ago. We must bear in mind the important issue about ownership. I accept that the amendment might not be entirely appropriate, but I hope that the right hon. Gentleman accepts that it must be dealt with properly. We must ensure that the interests of all are covered. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 41, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Any exclusion under sub-paragraph (1) which applies to land within a Special Area of Conservation, Special Protection Area or Site of Special Scientific Interest shall only be made following consultation with, and having regard to the advice of, the relevant advisory body as defined in section 24(6).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 222, in clause 16, page 9, line 19, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The exclusion of the application of any of the general restrictions in Schedule 2 under subsection 3(b) or (c) in relation to land falling within a Special Area of Conservation, Special Protection Area or Site of Special Scientific Interest shall only be made following consultation with, and having regard to the advice of, the relevant advisory body as defined in section 24(6).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I realise that to talk to a group of amendments at this stage of our proceedings is to court unpopularity in the Committee, so I shall attempt to be brief. When disapplying some of the restrictions listed in the schedule to particular areas of land, I wish to place a requirement to consult first the relevant advisory bodies. I anticipate two responses to my proposal, one being that the Minister would expect the relevant countryside organisation, such as English Nature, to consult on the changes that it intends to make. The right hon. Gentleman's other point will be that regulations under clause 6(3)(a) specify such action.
<P>
I refer to the most valuable land, which, if it were proposed to disapply some of the restrictions under schedule 2, might have a significant effect on conservation interests. It is not unreasonable to say that, under those circumstances and irrespective of the possibility of introducing regulations, there should be a duty to consult the relevant conservation body, English Nature, or in the case of Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales.
<P>
Amendment No. 22 is an analogous provision that relates to clause 16. It covers a dedication of land for access where, again, there is provision for disapplying some restrictions by agreement with the owner who makes the dedication. Again, there should be a requirement to consult on the most valuable pieces of land with English Nature or the relevant organisation. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, I hope that he will say that such consultation will be undertaken as a matter of course and that no exceptions will be made to the rule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The amendments relate to the powers in paragraph 6 of the schedule and to those in clause 16 to lift some of the restrictions on access land. On open country, a landowner may agree with the relevant authority that a direction should be made suspending the restrictions. If a landowner wishes, for example, to dedicate access over land in his possession, he may, as part of an instrument of dedication, disapply any of the schedule 2 restrictions; and that disapplication will have permanent effect.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 223 and 222 seek to impose some external limits on these powers in the interests of conservation. As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendments would require prior consultation with the relevant advisory body, English Nature or the Countryside Council for Wales, before a direction could be made or a dedication executed over land designated as a conservation site.
<P>
I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but I do not believe that the amendments are necessary. Only rarely will the public need to be completely excluded from land because of conservation interests. I do not accept that access and conservation are automatically mutually exclusive. It will be rare for an owner to seek to dedicate such land to wider forms of recreation than are permitted under schedule 2—or to ask for an order lifting the schedule 2 restrictions to the same effect. If a landowner was minded to proceed in those rare and unlikely circumstances, the requirement for prior consultation would be unlikely to deter him. Of course, the relevant authority could refuse to make a direction under paragraph 6 if it thought that it would damage the conservation of the land. Nothing would stop the owner voluntarily inviting people on to the land for the same purposes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister said that a landowner could disapply some of the schedule 2 exclusions. We know that the definition of owner in paragraph 6(4) applies to those with farm business tenancies under the 1995 Act. Therefore, a tenancy that might run for only a year could give way to a permanent disapplication of one of the exclusions in schedule 2. I do not know if the Minister meant that to be the case. If somebody with a tenancy for only one year could do that, it would be disadvantageous to the owner of the land who had granted that farm business its tenancy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to two different situations. I will check on that. Yes, the lifting of the restriction would last only for the period of the tenancy, as I said during the previous debate.
<P>
The Committee will eventually come to part III, which will strengthen the powers of the nature conservation bodies to allow them to require the owners of sites of special scientific interest to refrain from potentially damaging operations. If owners are determined to ignore the impact of wider recreational use, then part III will provide an appropriate remedy. For the first time, there will be a general offence of intentionally or recklessly damaging the key features of a SSSI. The purpose of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will be secured by that proposal if it is accepted by the Committee. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are determined to strengthen the protection given to SSSIs, but the amendments are not the right way to do that. I think our proposal under part III is right and on that basis I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his reply, but I am not sure that I am entirely satisfied with it. It suggests that all the restrictions under schedule 2 are for the benefit of the owner who might wish to disapply some because he does not need that protection for his land. The countryside body disapplying those restrictions should have regard for more areas of interest than simply the wishes of the owner—which I think is the purport of the right hon. Gentleman's comments. He says that the owner owns the land and, therefore, can invite people to do what they like anyway, irrespective of what is in the Bill. That sits ill with part III, which attempts to strengthen the protection of SSSIs. One might get into an extraordinary position where there was an implied licence to carry out a particular activity because it had been disapplied by the countryside body. I am not saying that this is tenable in law, but it is a suggestion that I put to the right hon. Gentleman. There is an implied licence to do so irrespective of its effect on the conservation interests of the land, simply because the advice of English Nature or, in the case of Wales, of the Countryside Council for Wales had not been taken.
<P>
I agree that that is an unlikely circumstance. I accept the fact that, under most normal circumstances, the powers to disapply would be used responsibly and would be used in consultation. Frankly, there are not enough references to English Nature, to the Nature Conservancy Council for England as it is referred to in the Bill and a statutory requirement to consult. I can conceive of circumstances in which, for instance, on the geological SSSI there might be what appear to be perfectly cogent arguments for disapplying one of these restrictions, which, following specialist advice from a conservation body, would not be a sensible move. There is a lacuna in the Bill at the moment.
<P>
I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman will take an instant decision to say that of course I have been right all along. I ask him to reflect on the issues that I have raised because, as he recognises, I raised them with the best of intentions. On that note, Mr. Stevenson, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
