<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 13, line 19, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or in association with the Learning and Skills Council for England'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am pleased to see Committee members flooding back to their places for what I hope will not be an extended sitting, although we have important matters to discuss.
<P>
The amendment is intended to probe the Government's intentions towards what might, for simplicity, be called cross-border activities. I hasten to say for the avoidance of doubt, that that is not intended to signal either a derogation of devolution or a Welsh takeover of the English education system. Those of us who have studied in England have seen and admired the tremendous contribution that Welsh teachers have made to teaching in Wales and England. It accords with the generally good spirits with which this Committee has conducted its proceedings to suggest that teachers should have the easiest interpenetration across the frontier.
<P>
I have three concerns in this context, to which I hope the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Wales Office will respond. My first concern relates to institutional co-operation. When the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) touched on that in an earlier debate about partnership and co-working, I was broadly satisfied by his remarks. I have previously discussed the quadrilateral that comprises: the two learning and skills councils, if I may use that summary phrase; the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Welsh Assembly; and the Wales Office and the Wales education department. He assured the Committee that those four elements would be able to work together and to exchange information and experience. We shall rehearse those matters further when we debate the inspectorates.
<P>
It is important for such practical institutional collaboration to continue. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council's functions will be carried out in relation to Wales only.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That implies that the remit stops at the border. I am sure that that wording was chosen to facilitate a wider understanding, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will give the appropriate reassurance.
<P>
My second concern involves the individual student, whose activities may be more sensibly conducted in another part of the United Kingdom or, if appropriate, abroad. For example, students with particular disabilities might receive better provision if they went to a specialist college in England. The converse might also apply--specialist provision might be available in Wales but not in England. The two learning and skills councils should be able to buy in to those services or to finance the activities of students who move cross the border to alternative provision, if that is appropriate.
<P>
My third concern involves institutional locations and the ability of a Welsh institution that is funded by the National Council for Education and Training in Wales to have an outstation in England, where it might serve the local community. Committee members may be familiar with what I believe is a piece of Austrian territory called the Kleinwalsertal, which is, in fact, part of the German customs area and uses German stamps, for the simple reason that it is inaccessible from Austria, except by climbing over a mountain. From my knowledge of them, that is not the case in the marches between Wales and England. However, there may be cases in which it is sensible for a Welsh college to have an outstation in England--or the reverse. It is not intended that this should be a unilateral provision.
<P>
There may also be outstations of educational establishments that exist for perfectly good reasons other than to serve the local community. Not far from my wife's family home in south Wales is Kilvrough manor, which was owned for many years by the Oxfordshire education authority. I do not know whether that is still the case. On the Gower peninsula, near the coast, it was used by students from Oxfordshire, near my own home. That kind of thing seems entirely sensible, and we should encourage such sensible collaboration across the frontier between schools.
<P>
We want an assurance from the Minister that there will be no artificial barriers to such exchanges put up by Government, learning and skills councils or individual educational institutions. We understand that there is a separate council for Wales with a separate remit, but people who wish, for educational purposes, to cross a boundary--which, I hope, is as invisible as possible--should be able to do so without let or hindrance.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. David Hanson): The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has picked on the right chap. He may be aware that my constituency is adjacent to England, and my home is six miles from the English border. If I go to the cinema or to Sainsbury's, I go to England. The airport that I use is in Manchester and the train station to which I go for a connection to London is in England. An awareness of cross-border issues is, therefore, second nature to me. I hope that I can give him the assurances that he seeks.
<P>
Amendment No. 168 is unnecessary. Generally speaking, it is right that the council in Wales will deal with Wales and the council in England will deal with England. That will not, however, restrict students resident in England who want to use facilities in Wales or students resident in Wales who want to use facilities in England. Both bodies will ensure that participation in educational activities on each side of the border is possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has made a good start. He has described the legal position, which is that people will be able to travel from one country to the other. It is important, however, that functional delivery is concerted between the various bodies. It is all very well to say that the Ritz is open to everyone, but, if there is no funding for a particular activity that it would be sensible to do elsewhere, the Minister's generous commitment will not matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that placing restrictions on the cross-border flow--the concern that lies behind the amendment--would be detrimental to the aim of offering learning opportunities according to where and when individuals wish to learn. That aim is shared by the Government and the National Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I am reassured by what the Minister is saying, but is he aware that there is a Judicial review case currently before the High Court about the Secretary of State's decision to impose the teachers' threshold arrangements on the National Assembly and, thus, on teachers in Wales? Does the Minister foresee a situation in which the Welsh council could decide on different arrangements for student support that would preclude students who, like him, live just across the border, from accessing some of the provision in Welsh institutions? That is part of the issue raised by the hon. Member for Daventry, and I should be grateful to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman said. Discussions are still going on in relation to teachers' pay and conditions. Regarding the amendment, I can reassure him that all students, from whatever side of the border and whatever institution, will be able to secure the proper provision and be funded accordingly. I hope that that clarifies the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): The Minister has given an assurance that there will be no bar to students on either side of the English-Welsh border from travelling to institutions. I should like to return to the institutional point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.  Would it be possible under the arrangements in the Bill for a Welsh institution to have a branch on the English side of the border, or would that be precluded by this subsection of the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> No. Should an English further education college wish to have, for example, an outward bound centre or a horticultural centre on the Welsh side of the border, we would welcome its participation. We would also joyously welcome the incoming students that it would bring. It would be funded by the Learning and Skills Council. The students might come from England or Wales and would be able to attend both branches.
<P>
We are discussing the institutional structures of accountability for funding, and the difference in policy implications for the Assembly and for the Learning and Skills Council. However, no student or institution will be prevented from receiving the tailored service that they require. I hope that that clarifies the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
In conclusion, when joint working by the LSC and the council in Wales is appropriate, the Bill already provides for the necessary powers in paragraph 15 of schedule 8. This carries forward section 82 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 which provides for the joint exercise of functions by the Further and Higher Education Councils for England and Wales. In practice, this covers joint working by, for example, the Higher and Further Education Funding Councils for England and Wales, and also the cross-border joint working currently being undertaken by the Further Education Funding Councils for England and Wales.
<P>
Finally, paragraph 15 of schedule 8, when properly informed by paragraph 17, will ensure that the provision in the 1992 Act is carried forward for both councils in England and Wales. I hope, in the light of my constituency background as well as my ministerial responsibilities, that the hon. Gentlemen will be reassured that we would not put anything into the Bill that would be detrimental to individuals or institutions on either side of the border.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. I understand what he said in terms of the provision of courses. However, I want to raise the issue of student support. If a student with disabilities, for example, wished to cross the border to attend an institution in Wales--quite rightly, if it was the nearest institution--where would his or her funding come from in terms of support? Would it come from the English Learning and Skills Council, or from the one in Wales? Students studying for the post-graduate certificate of education at the university of Wales Aberystwyth receive only part of the golden hello, or training salary, unless they commit themselves to teaching in Wales. We would not want that situation to pertain up to level 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the resources follow the student. For example, if a student lived in Chester and attended Northop college across the border in my Constituency to do a horticultural training course, he or she would be funded by the LSC. A student living in Northop who attended a college in Chester would be funded by the Learning and Skills Council in Wales. The money will follow the student, and each student will be placed accordingly. The resources will come from either the English source or the Welsh source, depending on residency.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister set out to be both disarming and conciliatory. I shall do my best to be both of those things. He drew on his own experience, and I have a fellow feeling for him because I live very near to a county boundary. I constantly suffer as a result of cross-border anomalies, not least because I live in an English region that is close to another. English regions are assuming greater importance in the Government's agenda. Such considerations are real and, with the best will in the world, occasionally give rise to administrative glitches.
<P>
The Minister has been conciliatory in explaining how the institutions will work together, that the money will follow the student, and that there will be no functional barrier to students attending the most appropriate place. However, there is the residual concern of student support--of which I did not want to make a wider issue in this debate--which the hon. Gentleman helped to excite in my mind.
<P>
Although the position in Wales and England is broadly similar, the Minister cannot but be aware that, as a result of the deliberations of the Cubie report on higher education, the relationship between Scottish and English students who attend universities in Scotland and England is anomalous. Ministers have tended to defend that relationship by reference to the devolved system, and by arguing that discrimination within a member state is acceptable to the European convention on human rights and the Commission. Those arguments are partial and inadequate, even in cases where money follows the student across the frontier.
<P>
I have dealt with the wider context, but it was wise to do so at this time. I hope that Ministers will bear in mind the specific issue of student support, and concert policies more generally. We do not want the new structure and devolution to create difficulties in terms of flows. Ministers owe it to members of the Committee to keep an eye on the matter. They should work together, and with their respective bodies, maintain a single market for post-16 education and training--excluding the separate consideration of higher education--across this frontier. With those slight warnings and caveats in mind, and to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 30 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>National Council for Education and Training for Wales</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Excluding changes of label, this schedule is virtually identical to the relevant schedule for England. I do not intend to waste the Committee's time by debating it, except to remark that I should have tabled a probing amendment in relation to page 64 line 37. Ministers have made conciliatory noises about the position of a chairman or chief executive of the council on vacating office. It is clear that the provision will enable a member to be re-elected, but it is less clear whether a chairman or chief executive may be re-elected, and if so, in what capacity.
<P>
I am not trying to make matters difficult for Ministers; I am merely pointing out to their drafters that, if it is necessary to make a change in one part of the Bill, it will be necessary to make one in this part as well. I omitted to table suitable probing amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful for the gentle probing of the hon. Member for Daventry. We have some sympathy with his point, and the Government intend to table an amendment to resolve the anomaly in respect of the two councils. I am grateful to him for fulfilling his duty by bringing the matter to our attention.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 4 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Education and training for persons aged 16 to 19</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 13, leave out line 26.
<P>
This is a probing amendment. It has nothing to do with destroying the opportunity for the council to provide proper facilities for organised leisure occupation. Far be it from me to suggest that that is a sensible idea. However, we want to ask the Minister to take a few minutes of the Committee's time to tell us what is in the minds of Ministers and, one assumes, the National Assembly for Wales in seeking to make provision for organised leisure occupation. That is something that we failed to do on the English clauses.
<P>
A little later in our proceedings we will debate the funding of grammar schools and sixth forms. One of the attractions of sixth forms, not just to Opposition Members but to many parents, is that the school environment can often provide a continuing and wider educational experience than is afforded by further education colleges. I accept that the duty to provide proper facilities for persons between the ages of 16 and 19 is without reference to the establishment. I should also say, before somebody points it out to me, that at present we have keyed in these extra-curricular activities only to education, but they might equally apply to training, which the next subsection deals with.
<P>
Be that as it may, a substantive point is involved. Whatever the establishment, but particularly where young people are concerned--I shall not reproduce this debate later in relation to adults, where the duties are slightly weaker--it should be possible for the CETW or the LSC in England to make provision for reasonable extra-curricular activities. That is not a bolt-on extra but an important part of young people's education. We want to encourage, it rather than diminish it, and to stimulate it rather than discourage it. Therefore, I hope that there will be no dissent across the Committee about the way in which it is done.
<P>
I want to add one other point, which springs from some points that I made on the last amendment about the external education facility for Oxfordshire education authority in Gower. By all accounts that is a sensible thing to have and a wonderful opportunity. In my county, Northamptonshire, there has been some concern about outdoor education activities at Longtown, which, as I recall, although I have not checked, is just on the English side of the border. Again we are taking people from the midlands to a more upland environment, where they can do more physically challenging activities. That seems to me highly desirable, and I hope that it will be possible for such activities to be conducted across the invisible frontier rather than confined to one country or the other.
<P>
I move the amendment simply to probe the Minister's intentions about the way in which leisure time activities, or, as I describe them, extra-curricular activities, fit in with the overall pattern of provision. It would be helpful if he could take us through his thinking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not understand the purpose of the amendment, which on the one hand seems to argue that it is good to have this type of activity and on the other hand removes it from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be a more skilful draftsman than I am, but may I assist him straight away by saying that, in order to raise an issue, it is sometimes necessary to move its deletion, so that people like him, and I hope the Minister shortly--and, if necessary, in winding up, myself--stress the importance of having it in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The logic of that escapes me, because one can make these comments in a clause stand part debate in the same way.
<P>
I welcome the provision. We have long wanted a level playing field between the further education and school sectors, and people have been attracted by the range of activities that comes with the educational package to stay on in sixth forms. The Government have made a breakthrough in recognising the necessity for activities such as physical recreation and sport, outdoor pursuits, team building and so on, and putting in legislation a requirement for the LSC to provide them. I welcome that and, whether or not the amendment is a probing amendment, I hope that the Minister will reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis). It is our intention to resist the amendment, which I am sure the hon. Member for Daventry tabled merely to probe our intentions.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, the effect of the amendment would be to remove the duty on the council in Wales to secure proper facilities for organised leisure-time occupation connected with the education of people aged 16-19. That is a flowery way of saying that it would be unable to undertake the outward bound activities, team work and range of activities that, although they may not lead to qualifications, help to build positive attitudes and team spirit, and provide people with physical outlets while doing other work. If the amendment were accepted, the council in Wales--and in England if the philosophy were applied there--would be severely restricted in providing a range of activities for developing skills for life.
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's reasons for the amendment and it may be helpful if I explain the meaning of connected organised leisure-time. it is a phrase that dates back to the Education Act 1944, so it carries some weight and has a history.
<P>
More importantly, removing one part of the main duty of the council in Wales in respect of 16-19 year olds would put in doubt the national council's ability to provide the full range of educational opportunities for young people that I am sure Opposition Members want and which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough supports. If the council lost its duty to provide facilities for more informal learning, it would lose its duty to secure the invaluable provision that enriches young people's lives and promotes social inclusion. A life-long habit of leisure-connected activities may lead to other valuable skills and development, and perhaps to careers and other opportunities or it may simply enrich life. Informal leisure-connected activities may also be the spur to go on to more formal learning and further education, and the will to learn and enjoyment of a subject may lead to formal qualifications in due course.
<P>
We discussed earlier Government amendments to clauses 22 and 23 which reflect the importance that the Government attach to the provision. We want there to be no doubt about that in the Committee. Increasing and widening the participation in life-long learning by including the socially excluded and disaffected are cornerstones of the agenda, both in England and, with the National Assembly, in Wales.
<P>
The amendment is contrary to the spirit of what we are trying to achieve and I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will accept my assurance on the definition and withdraw it. It is important to progress in the way that I outlined. The amendment would also create an anomaly in that the national council would have a duty to provide such facilities in respect of training but not education. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on the matter and withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The short answer is that the proposal would go against the Government's objectives in further education. After this somewhat Chinese means of proceeding--I hope that saying that causes no offence--it would also contravene my own objectives in further education. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough may have been puzzled by my reasons for tabling the amendments and I hope that I did not give him a sleepless night. I could have raised the matter during the clause stand part debate, but the Under-Secretary and his officials would not have focused on it to the same extent.
<P>
The Under-Secretary gave some helpful assurances. He rightly said that the matter has a long provenance, which goes back, indirectly, to the Education Act 1944. The approach appears to have been moderated by the 1992 Act, which has an interesting definition of the phrase "organized leisure time occupation"--a matter that derives from the 1944 Act. Section 11 of the 1992 Act states that the phrase involves
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>organised cultural training and recreative activities as are suited to their requirements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As was the case with much of the 1992 Act, that involves very forward thinking. My first act as an education Minister was to call for a copy of the 1944 Act and say, "I had better read this before I start." I was not as au fait with the legislation as I should have been.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's clarifications were helpful. We share a common purpose in wanting to ensure that such provision should be available. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Ruane </B>(Vale of Clwyd): I welcome the clause, which is of particular relevance to Wales, and, indeed, all of the Bill.
<P>
This morning, the hon. Member for Daventry quoted Lord Roberts and mentioned the problems that are faced by Wales. Many counties in Wales are suffering great economic problems. Our traditional sectors--the heavy industry sectors such as coal and steel--have been decimated. In the 1930s, 250,000 miners worked in the Welsh mines, but today fewer than 1,000 do so. The Point of Ayr pit, which is near my constituency--it used to be the Under-Secretary's constituency--has closed, which has had a devastating effect on Prestatyn. All Committee members know that the agricultural sector took a tremendous nosedive in recent years, which has affected market towns in my constituency, such as Denby and St. Asaph. The third sector that has suffered economically--this will be of great interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)--involves traditional seaside towns.
<P>
When I was a young boy in the 1960s, I could be found on Saturday mornings at Rhyl railway station with an old pram. I would carry visitors' cases on my pram to one of the 600 guest houses and hotels in Rhyl. The railway station was awash with visitors on a Saturday morning. Now, the station is empty and those 600 guest houses and hotels have been converted to houses in multiple occupation. That has brought great social problems to my town.
<P>
Those three sectors have declined in recent years. The key to their revival, and that of the Welsh economy, lies in reskilling our people. There is currently a tremendous opportunity for doing that, because 15 of the 22 counties in Wales have been granted objective 1 status. Of all the objective 1 success stories around Europe, the greatest has been that of learning and skills in southern Ireland. By using the Bill in combination with objective 1 funding, we can copy that success in those 15 counties of Wales--as well as in south-west England, south Yorkshire and Merseyside--and regenerate our economies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): My hon. Friend struck a chord when he referred to the dangers involved in the decline of the tourism industry. Does he agree that one of the positive and beneficial effects of the Learning and Skills Council will be the great progress that it can make towards linking skills and qualifications in the further education sector and training, especially in tourism and tourism development? That will raise standards in the tourism industry by supplying good quality and long-term jobs to people who have traditionally operated in a low-paid, unskilled and highly volatile industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. We should look not only back at the past, but to the future. In the case of tourism, that means developing niche markets.
<P>
Objective 1 funding could lead to £3,000 million of aid--European, national and private finance--for 15 counties in Wales. I hope that that money will be spent wisely on reskilling our work force.
<P>
Clause 32(3)(c) stipulates that efforts to improve skill levels should be directed at certain identified employment sectors. That is right, because we should not have a scatter gun approach to skills--they should be tailored to business needs in our communities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) for drawing the Committee's attention to the significant effects that clause 32 will have on people in Wales. His constituency and mine are adjacent, and face many common problems and issues, notably the possibilities for training for and investment in people over the age of 19.
<P>
Many opportunities exist for people who have worked in industries that were formerly prevalent in our constituencies, and many others in Wales, such as mining, steel and major parts of the retail sector. Many businesses have relocated from north Wales and moved elsewhere--for example, Kwik Save in Prestatyn, in my hon. Friend's constituency. The clause will bring about vital reskilling, retraining and investment and confer powers on the Assembly to give individuals educational opportunities.
<P>
My hon. Friend mentioned objective 1 funding. As he will be aware, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister managed to secure strong agreements with European partners for objective 1 funding for west Wales and the valleys. That does not--sadly--cover my constituency, but it covers part of my hon. Friend's constituency. The clause enables us to mesh the training and investment opportunities afforded by objective 1 funding with the opportunities that the Bill will give to people in Wales and the establishment of a council in Wales for training and skills.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thought that the Minister was about to announce that the Government had found a way of unlocking the matching resources that Wales needs to meet the European Union's objective 1 funding requirements. Will he agree that, to achieve that and to achieve the objectives so eloquently described by the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd we must not only unlock objective 1 funding but allow the CETW to take its rightful place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am happy to answer that point, because it is an issue that we deal with daily in the Wales Office in discussions with our colleagues in the Treasury. As the hon. Gentleman should be aware, the comprehensive spending review procedure is under way and will be completed in July. We hope to resolve the issue by July and statements will be made on it in due course by the Chief Secretary and the Wales Office.
<P>
It is an important issue. The Government have negotiated the original  mn1.8 billion worth of investment for objective 1 funding for Wales. That is why I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd raised the point. When that matter is resolved and the discussions on the comprehensive spending review are completed, the provisions in the clause, together with the opportunities provided by objective 1 funding, will give a great boost to the Welsh economy and improved skills to people in Wales.

It is possible that the CETW will be able to play a greater role in the new European structural fund programmes than has been played hitherto. That is a matter for the National Assembly to take forward, but any developments of this kind will maintain a clear involvement of partners, so that we can ensure that European social funding can target projects of particular importance to local communities and regeneration needs. My hon. Friend's constituency is a prime example, because towns such as Rhyl have a great need for the investment that objective 1 funding will provide. European social funding must be accessible to community and voluntary organisations. Married to the objectives of the clause, my hon. Friend's point is extremely valuable, and I commend it and the clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 17, line 1, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment has two purposes, a lesser and a greater. I have a sneaking feeling that the lesser purpose may coincide with something that the Government have also noted. The amendment relates to conditions to be set by the CETW in respect of making grants to local education authorities. The lesser purpose relates to the reference to clause 6 in subsection (2), which the amendment would delete. It is clear that that reference is a mistake, and the Government amendment would suggest that they have noticed as much. Welsh clauses must hang together, and I suspect that this is a simple drafting error that the Minister can deal with in a moment.
<P>
Our more substantive concern--which is echoed by our colleagues in the Welsh Assembly, but which I shall not rehearse at length--relates to the future of grammar schools. I hope that all members of the Committee will feel that grammar schools are an extremely important part of education in Wales, as they are in England. Lord Roberts of Conwy referred to the matter in another place during his remarks on Welsh clauses. He pointed out that there are 26,000 sixth formers in 167 schools. They form a significant part of the scene and make a distinctive contribution, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and others have made clear in respect of English clauses.
<P>
We should remind members of the Committee that, because of the devolution context, we in this place are at one remove from considerations accountability. The CETW would be empowered to set conditions, and in doing so, would presumably operate on a principled basis. In principle, the CETW's role does not differ greatly from that of the council in England, which we have already debated. It will have its own remit, and will be responsible to the Assembly. With that in mind, my colleague Jonathan Morgan expressed a concern that was noted as a statement of dissent in the post-16 education and training committee's response to the ETAG report. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Funding responsibility for ... sixth forms should stay with Local Authorities and not be transferred to ... (CETW).
<P>
That is a clear statement.
<P>
The Under-Secretary owes the Committee an explanation of how the provision will work, and what safeguards there be. Ministers have referred to expenditure safeguards that have been replicated in the Bill's Welsh clauses, so we need not reconsider that issue.
<P>
Members of the Committee responded positively to the important issue of the expense of certain minority subjects, which was raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. There is also the question of the size of school sixth forms. It can prove inappropriate for pupils to travel to a college for post-16 studies. In certain cases, there is also a distinctive ethos and quality of delivery, together with associated factors such as the breadth of the curriculum, and other pastoral and extra-curricular activities.
<P>
The Opposition do not want the contribution of sixth forms to post-16 education to be diminished in England or Wales. We are anxious to probe the Under-Secretary's thinking and receive such assurances as he feels able to give on how matters will be conducted. I am thinking primarily of the funding guarantees that will be given to sixth forms as the new structure is adopted through the National Assembly. How will they set about their business? Moreover, I should be interested to know the Under-Secretary's approach to what we regard as an extremely important issue of principle: the safeguarding of sixth forms in Wales as a distinctive part of the educational offer for all post-16 education.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I shall try to reassure the hon. Member for Daventry by clarifying Government amendment No. 32. That is a simple matter to resolve. It corrects a drafting error in clause 36(2), which should refer to section 35 rather than section 6. I hope that that resolves that issue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman tabled similar amendments to amendment No. 143 in respect of clause 7 and the LSC, earlier in Committee. Perhaps he cannot see a cherry without wanting to have two bites of it. It seems reasonable for him to raise the issue again in relation to Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall respond precisely to the Minister's analogy. We are seeking his assistance again because there is an important point of difference in these provisions. In this case, the cherry comes with a particular wrapping: the responsibility and interests of the National Assembly. It needs to be unwrapped so that we can see whether the kernel is the same as the one that his colleagues have already shown us in relation to England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. I am also grateful to him for having given a fair wind to several clauses so far. This is the United Kingdom Parliament, and he has every right to raise all these issues. I simply commented in passing that we had had a similar discussion earlier in Committee.
<P>
Clause 36(2), which the amendment would delete, is needed to ensure that the CETW can apply proper conditions to the use that local education authorities in Wales make of the funds given to them in respect of sixth form education. It will allow the CETW to require local education authorities to provide proper access to their accounts, to respond to reasonable requests for information--for example, evidence about pupil numbers and data relating to the services provided--and to ensure that the council is in a position to check such data. The conditions that might be set under subsection (2), therefore, will be of the kind that should quite rightly be attached to any public funds in the interests of protecting their proper use. There is no great master plan to control LEAs or to cause difficulties under the clause. It is simply about following and checking on the money provided by the council.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman would be right to be concerned if we were to allow the council in Wales to exercise any undue controls over local education authorities, but I assure him that that is not the case. Indeed, when the similar provisions relating to England were discussed in another place, my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone wrote to Baroness Blatch on 21 March to reassure her that we do not intend the council in England to impose any conditions such as those set out in clause 6(3) on local education authorities. That applies equally to the council in Wales. In particular, there is no possibility that the council in Wales will expect LEAs to charge fees to sixth formers for their education. That would run counter to sections 450 and 451 of the Education Act 1996.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman appeared to be exercised with regard to grammar schools. I am sure that he is aware that there are no grammar schools in Wales, only secondary schools. There are some private, independent grammar schools--for example, Howells in Cardiff--but none in the state sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I can assure the Minister that he has not caught me out on the matter. If I used the words "grammar school", it was a slip of the tongue. I was not seeking to use them as an example. My main concern was about sixth forms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am pleased that we have clarified that. The words "grammar school" arose and for a moment they slightly confused me. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was emphasising a particular point. I am pleased to reassure him that the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 applies equally to England and Wales. Should there be any grammar schools in Wales in the state sector, they would be provided for in a similar way.
<P>
We set out in another place the type of circumstance in which the CETW will use the power given to it. For example, we have said that it will require LEAs to ensure that funding for pupils with SEN statements in mainstream school sixth forms and special schools does not end on their 19th birthday. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would remove the CETW's ability to check on the proper use of funding by local education authorities. We do not intend that there should be any political or policy interference. There is simply a funding mechanism, which enables the CETW to check on the way in which LEAs use that resource.
<P>
With that reassurance, which is similar to the reassurances given by my hon. Friends the Parliamentary Under-Secretaries on the clauses dealing with England, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. We remain somewhat unconvinced. The House has an opportunity to influence the framework in which the decisions are taken. If we not exercise that opportunity when we can, we may lose control of the situation and create one which would not be acceptable to us and which, in fairness to the Minister, to judge from his own remarks, he would not wish to see either. In this case we should exercise our discretion by pressing the amendment.
<P>
We all want sixth forms to be successful. We want to ensure that the Bill does not create a loophole or an anomaly in the guidance that the CETW can publish that makes them less successful than they should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman presses his amendment to a Division, which it is his right to do, I should tell him that the clause will place additional burdens on LEAs in Wales and no significant audit burdens on schools, although funding mechanisms may require extra pupil data from schools. It is simply a mechanism to enable the CETW, as is right, to secure proper data from publicly funded information to help secure the proper use of the money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> Will my hon. Friend the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is giving way to me. I hope that, before he presses the amendment, he will reflect on those issues.

<B>Mr. Ruane rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I readily give way to the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> Has the hon. Member for Daventry had any representations on this point from political groupings in Wales or, more specifically, from LEAs or schools in Wales? I would also have liked to ask the Minister whether he has had any representations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that they both heard that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that we both heard it, and I shall respond, but I cannot respond on behalf of the Minister.
<P>
I have had representations from within Wales in the shape of our colleague, Jonathan Morgan, and it is his concerns that I am echoing in this respect.
<P>
The Minister is seeking to be conciliatory. That is his style.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I am sorry to push the point. Has the hon. Gentleman had any representations from schools in Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have had no such representations because no schools have sought to get in touch with me. My concern here as a legislator is to ensure that we safeguard against the possibility of any erosion of the powers, responsibilities and rights of schools before we hand the Bill over.
<P>
The only other comment that I wish to make in winding up my remarks on the arnendment is that we are concerned not simply with the position of the individual school but with LEAs. If they do nothing else, irrespective of their political complexion, they represent a democratic tier of local decision making. The CETW, good as it may be and good as we all hope it will be, is not directly so responsible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I am sorry to push the point, but has the hon. Gentleman had any representations from any LEAs in Wales?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry. I was momentarily distracted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I said that I was sorry to push the point, but that I wanted to know whether the hon. Gentleman had received representations from LEAs in Wales. He mentioned their importance.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No. I have taken part in a number of Committees of the House, without too many representations from anyone. When I look at legislation, I have to use common sense--a phrase that has resonated around the Committee. If LEAS, in Wales or elsewhere, wish to shackle themselves, or if the National Assembly wishes to give itself a level of representation on the CETW that is inappropriately small, it is not for me to stop them. However, it would be unwise to leave the matter unremarked on. We have expressed our concerns about democratic accountability and about the future of sixth forms in schools. For those reasons, we think it important to put down a marker, so we shall press the amendment to a vote.

</FONT><B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 17, line 29, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(1A) The Council shall immediately notify the governing body of any such appointment in writing.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment involves the appointment of governors by the CETW to an institution, and develops our debate on that matter in relation to England. Will the Assembly take action in exceptional cases or will that be the norm? The amendment develops a point that was touched on briefly earlier, which involved the evidence for such appointments.
<P>
I hope that difficult situations will not develop. They should be picked up in good time rather than near their end. But if they do develop and the CETW wants to appoint someone as a governor, the normal practice will be that he will be advised in the relevant manner and required to sign the necessary forms of assent. An emergency appointment may be made for example, to strengthen a board of governors that is weak or that faces a particular problem. If that appointment were imposed over the head of the current governor, legally watertight evidence should be supplied confirming the appointment. When a college needs to be run, the last thing that is needed is an argument about who is a governor. I hope that the Under-Secretary will give an assurance that he will consider the requirement or say that it is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The amendment would require the CETW to notify in writing a governing body in Wales of any appointment that the CETW makes under the powers that are contained in clause 39, which we shall discuss presently. It is sensible and right for the CETW immediately to inform any governing body of an FE college in Wales about appointments that it makes under those powers, although it may have done so before the appointment was made.
<P>
The Assembly and I share the hon. Gentleman's view that such a notification should be given in writing, but I do not believe that it is necessary to specify that requirement in the Bill. Common sense suggests that the CETW will inform the governing body in writing as a matter of course. How else would the governing body and the college know that an appointment had been made? The proposal is self-evident and worthy, but it should not be included in the Bill.
<P>
The circumstances in which the CETW might use the powers are such that it would probably already have been in communication with the relevant governing body. It may have set out for the governing body the different courses of action that it might take if the situation did not improve in the near future.
<P>
The requirement at which the amendment aims raises detailed matters that will be governed by secondary legislation in a college's instrument of government. If the Assembly wants to introduce the requirement in due course, that instrument, rather than primary legislation, is the right place to do so. Alternatively, the Assembly could deal with the matter in the administrative arrangements that will be made with the CETW. I am happy to give the hon. Member for Daventry the assurance that it is my intention with regard to the Bill, and the Assembly's intention with regard to the way in which the proposal will be administered when the legislation is enacted, that the matter will be dealt with in the initial remit of the CETW. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of the Under-Secretary's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): I shall be brief. I want to take the opportunity to thank the hon. Member for Daventry who, last Thursday, raised issues under clause 12 relating directly to those in clause 39, which covers Wales.
<P>
A matter of concern to me, as someone from further education, is the lack of reliable statistical information, particularly concerning the salaries of teaching staff in the FE sector and their teaching qualifications. The all-party group on further education has been discussing for some time the importance of having reliable information so that future planning can be done properly with a clearer picture of where the problems lie than is available by simply taking anecdotal evidence from our constituencies.
<P>
I want to press my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary on the importance of obtaining high-quality data on the salary levels of lecturers in further education in Wales. I am worried that the salaries of FE lecturers will fall behind those of school teachers, particularly in sixth form colleges where the difference will be more marked because teachers teaching A-level subjects in schools will be on newer salary scales than those teaching identical subjects in sixth form colleges. That should be dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's comments. However, does he agree that, to obtain the parity between FE lecturers and school teachers that we both want, a professional qualification in FE is required? There could then be comparable standards and, hopefully, a single General Teaching Council covering lecturers at FE colleges and teachers in schools, so that they could move between one and the other with ease. Without qualification structure, it will be difficult to raise the profile, standards and quality of lecturing staff in Wales and elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's comments and I shall come to qualifications shortly.
<P>
One way in which to deal with the matter is to consider the sort of qualifications held by lecturing staff and the move towards professionalism of teaching in further education. I am not entirely convinced that a single GTC is the answer, but I have no firm view. However, there must be a professional body for further education sitting alongside the GTC and the equivalent body for higher education. People should be able to move between the three sectors, but I am not sure that parity between school teachers and further education lecturers is the way ahead. They should be on a par, but with the changing nature of further education some lecturers, if they are teaching higher education content, may feel themselves to be more clearly on a par with those teaching in higher education than with school teachers. There is a debate to be had and we must be careful where we go on that point.
<P>
The Further Education National Training Organisation offers great opportunities to make FE teaching a professional status occupation. If the Minister can reassure me on this point, I hope that the clause will give more information to those such as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough who are keen to see greater professional status among FE teachers. That will enhance their reputation and the reputation of further education not only in England but in Wales, which must be good for everybody concerned with the lifelong learning agenda.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I want to speak in favour of the clause, which I think is eminently sensible. It says that the council has the right to commission research statistics, to set up a system for doing that and to communicate its findings to the National Assembly, so that it can make the right decisions at a national level.
<P>
Statistics are available in individual schools, LEAs, TECs, FE colleges and private providers, but they are not centralised. As a result, in the past there has been a hotchpotch development of FE in Wales and in the whole of the United Kingdom. With centralised statistics, it will be possible to develop a vision for Wales. Funding is limited, so it is incumbent on us all, politicians and managers alike, to ensure that it is spent in the best possible way. Using the words of the clause, I believe that this information will lead to decisions being made "on a sound basis".
<P>
The clause will help us to plan nationally across Wales, on a sub-national or regional level--say, in north Wales--and even down to ward level in a council. The statistics are there, but they are in different pockets. I shall give three examples, from a national level, a sub-regional level and a local level. These are statistics that I have been given this afternoon for participation rates for all Welsh domiciled students by unitary authority, 100 being the average. For Blaenau Gwent, the participation rate is 45; for Ceredigion, it is 153, so there one is three times more likely to go into higher education than in Blaenau Gwent. Those statistics will allow national politicians in Cardiff to draw up the resources and the strategy to tackle variations.
<P>
At a regional level, perhaps I may use my own constituency as an example, the main town of which is Rhyl. In Deeside, 20 miles to the east, there is a college, and 20 miles to the west there is a college in Llandrichlo, in Colwyn Bay. There is only a very small college in Rhyl. The FE participation rate in Llandrichlo is 8 per cent. of the local population. I think that the national average is 6 per cent. so it is above the average. In the Deeside area the participation rate is at the national average--6 per cent. In the Rhyl area, which is an area 10 miles around Rhyl of 80,000 people, the participation rate is below 2 per cent. That would have been lower than 1 per cent. had we not established a small college, the Rhyl College. Therefore, our chances of retraining and reskilling our work force in a traditional tourist town such as Rhyl or Prestatyn, where there is no, or very little history of manufacturing, to get the requisite skills and the jobs in the business and technology parks, are much lower, because people have to travel 40 miles a day five days a week to go to those colleges to get those skills. These statistics of FE availability can help us to plan at a sub-regional level the skills necessary to redevelop our regional economy.
<P>
Finally, at ward level, I have been given statistics over the past week that can trace, by postcard, participation levels right down to streets and wards in a community. That can help an LEA to plan the areas to which it needs to divert its funding and strategy to ensure that participation is more even. For example, in the West ward in Rhyl, the most socially deprived of the 960 wards in Wales, participation in higher education is minuscule, yet 15 miles down the road participation rates in the relatively prosperous ward of Tremeirchion are four or five times higher.
<P>
Statistics can provide a snapshot of the position across the whole of Wales, or sections of Wales, so as to assist in developing a policy to tackle problems but, equally importantly, they can help us to manage those policies. Statistics are a good management tool for politicians and managers involved in learning and skills, and they help with quality control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I rise primarily because the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) was gracious enough to refer to my remarks of last Thursday, which I do not intend to repeat. He did the Committee a service by tabling the amendment. However, it is not quite clear whether it is designed to promote openness and transparency in public administration or to work out a statistically interesting, decision-prompting set of conclusions about the pay and remuneration of further education lecturers. Those two options may have different implications for public confidentiality. Having said that, it is important that the Committee should consider the remuneration of further education lecturers for the purposes of reading across into sixth forms, private businesses, and so on.
<P>
I say to the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd that it is important to have a wider overview of statistics. It will enable us draw lessons or conclusions from comparative statistics between Wales and England, where many wards have similar levels of social deprivation according to the Jarman index, but different outcomes. We need to learn the lessons from across the United Kingdom and abroad.
<P>
My late father, at a very tender age--possibly before the first world war--had a traumatic, but no doubt educationally satisfying, experience in Rhyl.  His aunt gave him a small boat and he decided, when he was on a pleasure boat, to launch his little boat over the stern of the vessel on a string.  The wake of the larger vessel consigned it to the waves of the Irish sea, and it was never seen again. That distressed him, and might even have led indirectly to the decline in Rhyl's tourist industry, but it taught him something about the laws of physics.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to stick up for his constituency. We have a common interest in ensuring that further education lecturers are properly remunerated and that the council in Wales and its counterpart in England work hard to identify areas of difficulty and try proactively to find solutions.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I feel a little anxious about commenting on further education in Wales, as it is not an area of which I have direct experience.  I cannot compete with the Welsh antecedents that are shared by the Front-Bench spokesmen, and have not even had the pleasure of the acquaintance of Jonathan Morgan.  However, I used to spend my holidays in Wales, and have just remembered that my brother-in-law used to run an hotel there.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester is right to draw attention to the need for better information systems, especially in relation to staffing.  He did the Committee a service by tabling the amendment.  I endorse what he said about the importance of establishing a robust staffing information base. There is an increasing problem of parity between the further education, higher education and secondary sectors. Difficulties will arise in many further education colleges during the coming months, as teachers in the secondary sector exercise their option to apply to pass through the threshold.  That will become a major concern in sixth form colleges in particular, where people who do exactly the same job have substantially different terms, conditions and salaries.
<P>
In recent years, the availability of information on staffing structures in FE colleges has been lamentably poor, particularly in respect of the balance between part-time and full-time staffing. I want to draw the Committee's attention to the serious problem of the increasing numbers of agency staff who are employed by FE colleges.  Following incorporation in 1993, the FEFC constructed a remarkable system for collecting information on students--the annual individual student record returns.  However, it did nothing to collect information on staff, and it cannot be argued that the necessary technology does not exist.
<P>
To conform to the requirements of the FEFC's funding methodology in a seven-year period, all further education colleges had to introduce new technology for the collection of information, so it is clear that the systems and technology exist. However, the previous Government and this Government have interpreted the implications of the 1992 Act in such a way that they can virtually abdicate responsibility for staffing in colleges. The argument is that colleges are now incorporated bodies that are responsible for their own staffing policies, but that argument does not hold water.  We certainly do not use that argument in areas of public service such as hospital trusts.  In the Department of Health, there is a substantial data base on the deployment of nurses, doctors and ancillary staff in the NHS, even though the legal position of a hospital trust is exactly analogous to that of a further education college.
<P>
I appeal to the Minister and the Government to end this abdication of responsibility for staffing conditions, terms of employment and staffing policy in FE colleges. One way to do so would be to ensure that the LSC puts considerable effort into establishing a national staffing data base.
<P>
Finally, there is the important question of professionalisation and the level of qualifications in the FE sector. I am not entirely hung up on the issue of qualified teacher status. I have met and supervised many people with qualified teacher status whom I would not allow within a mile of my own children. Equally, I have encountered many people with not a minute's training in teaching techniques who had astonishing expertise in their own field and proved extremely good teachers. Increased professionalisation of the sector is crucial. Without proper staffing, there is no base from which to advance the professionalisation agenda.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> My hon. Friend is making an interesting point. Does he agree that one way to deal with the salary problem that, as he said, gets worse as teachers take on the new threshold, is to use professionalisation as a carrot? We should encourage lecturers who are not qualified teachers to gain that qualification in return for enhanced salaries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I agree that that is an extremely important solution to the problem, the possibility of which is enhanced by the unprecedented 10 per cent. budget increase that the FE sector will receive next year. The opportunity to deal with the staffing problem now exists. However, unless we build a data base and the Government take responsibility for staffing at a national level, our efforts will be hampered.
<P>
It is a question not only of FE colleges, but of private training providers. It worries me that that is a completely closed book. There is no evidence whatever about the qualification and experience of staffing used by private training providers. Therefore, the provision will have enormously important implications if the LSC chooses to use it correctly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I support the comments made by the hon. Member for Worcester. I was with the hon. Member for Bury, North until he reached the end of his comments, when he quickly moved from old Labour to new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have just started and shall speak for some time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am curious how I did that. I would appreciate some advice, as it might be useful in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have no connections to Wales at all, apart from the fact that I went to Llandudno for the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers conference, and I remember going on holidays there. When the hon. Gentleman had relatives with a hotel, he obviously found his special gift. He knows that I agree with him about the way in which the FE sector has been disadvantaged in Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom, especially since incorporation in 1992-93.
<P>
The issue of lecturers' salaries has been a real problem that we have all let go by, to our shame. We have fought strongly about salaries and structures in schools, but have not had the same passion for staff working in the FE or HE sectors. HE lecturers are, comparatively speaking, even worse treated. Far too many HE lecturers are on low salaries simply because there is exploitation.
<P>
I fell out with the hon. Gentleman for Bury, North about qualifications. I fundamentally disagree with the premise that anyone can be a teacher.  Those of us in the Select Committee on Education and Employment--the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey) was with us in America-- recently heard, especially in Boston, about the virtue of recruiting people with no training as teachers because they did not need it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> May I clarify my remarks? I know the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make. I did not say or imply that anyone could be a teacher. I said--I strongly believe this and will always defend the argument--that the acquisition of qualified teacher status does not necessarily guarantee high quality teaching, nor does its absence necessarily mean that an individual cannot teach effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Of course I agree with those comments. I have worked with people with good qualifications who were relatively poor teachers. However, I do not want to predicate the idea of building the profession in future from people who will come out of the woodwork and be good teachers without qualifications. That is not what the future should be.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman could have spoken about how we should move from where we are to where we should be. I agree that many people working in FE with no formal qualifications do a good job, and we have to be able to accredit their experience as part of the qualification structure. That is a challenge. If the Minister cannot respond directly to that message today, I hope that he will take it home, as it is one of the most positive messages that we can send to FE lecturers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a mechanism already exists for teachers with experience to gain professional qualifications through City and Guilds 7307, parts I and II, of which prior learning would exempt them from earlier stages? They could then quickly gain the professional qualification status that both the hon. Gentleman and I agree is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Worcester that there are such mechanisms. Going on to a formal salary structure as a result of qualification would really give an incentive to those people to undertake such action. We both know that those who have gone down the City and Guilds route find themselves blocked from teaching, for example, in a traditional school for 11 to 18-year-olds, unless they accept unqualified salary rates. The whole purpose of the Learning and Skills Bill, particularly those clauses that bring in the 14 to 16-age group, is to provide such flexibility, which is why I support the clause.
<P>
The other issue that must be dealt with in Wales and England concerns the Learning and Skills Council providing the resources for all post-16 teaching. One set of resources will be going through the LEAs into schools for post-16 teaching in sixth forms at a rate that is much higher than the resources going into the further education colleges. I am talking about the rates that will be going into our sixth form colleges and the private sector. We do not want what we have had since 1983 in that sector: a competition to drive down costs.
<P>
As we all know, salary costs are the major costs within any organisation that is involved in education. I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us comfort and say that he will encourage the Learning and Skills Council in Wales to make sure that, before grants are given to organisations to deliver teaching programmes, salary costs will be examined. If we do not do that, there will be a free-for-all. We shall have private sector providers, which may be good or may be bad, but they will be delivering on price, not quality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We have had an interesting and much wider discussion than I thought that we would have. I welcome the contributions of members of the Committee because they have helped to raise important issues. I reassure the hon. Member for Daventry that his father is certainly not the first person to have had an educational experience in Rhyl. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd will not mind my saying that. It is a fine town. It is very close to my constituency and I spent many happy days there on holiday as a child myself.
<P>
Clause 40 relates solely to the council in Wales. We have already had extensive and useful debates on its provisions and its English equivalent. The clause provides the CETW with similar powers and duties as those relating to the Further Education Funding Council for Wales under the 1992 legislation. It will establish the CETW as an expert source of information and research on post-16 education and training and will ensure that it can support the objectives for learning and skills of the National Assembly for Wales. I take very much on board the points made about that by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd. The clause is about collecting information and looking at a range of information about how delivery is taking place on the ground and how resources are deployed.
<P>
The reason why the provisions under clause 40 have been included in the Bill is to give the councils in Wales and in England, too, powers to examine the broad learning and skills agenda throughout those countries, to which my hon. Friend referred. It is important that councils pick up on the take-up of further education. It is not acceptable that wards such as Rhyl south-west which represents have such a low participation rate, given that wards that are wealthier and have a higher proportion of people on middle and higher incomes have a much higher participation rate. Again, part of the Government's agenda is to drive forward such points and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing them to the Committee's attention, so that we can ensure by research and information that further learning and skills opportunities are developed.
<P>
As well as leading on the identification and analysis of learning and skills needs and gaps, and offering advice on the national learning targets for Wales, the council in Wales will work in partnership with the National Assembly on the design of national initiatives and programmes and will lead on their development, management, quality and evaluation.  That aspect of the work touches on the points that have been made by my hon. Friends the Members for Worcester and for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor) and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. We discussed those points when we debated the same matters in the English clauses. I understand from looking at the Official Report that the debate took place on 4 May, which may explain the absence of my hon.  Friend the Member for Worcester. We debated the issues he raised then.
<P>
At that stage, the Under-secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon gave a strong indication that the council in England and the council in Wales would be required to establish data about qualifications and salaries.  That would be a valuable addition to their work. I emphasise again that the councils cannot impose conditions on salaries on independent corporations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I understand and accept what my hon. Friend says in regard to imposing conditions and salaries. However, the proportion of unqualified people in the private sector to the qualified is wrong.  For example, the balance between the professionally qualified further education teacher and the person who may just be good at teaching is incorrect. Does he not agree that the issue of spurious bits of paper alleging some test has been passed, very often from private sector organisations, have devalued qualifications received after practical studies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention.  I emphasise that though we can collect information on salaries, it is not appropriate for the councils in either England or Wales to impose conditions because the colleges are independent.  Their role will be to collect information and that information will be available.
<P>
As has been mentioned previous consultation has been carried out on the merits of compulsory qualifications in the sector.  In England. the consultation has just come to an end. The Government, in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), and others will consider the views that have been expressed. I will examine with the National Assembly the results of a similar exercise in Wales. I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friend. The consultation is coming to an end and we will be able to examine the issues soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Does my hon Friend not agree that the relationship between the Department for Education and Employment and the newly independent further education sector is analogous with the relationship between the Department of Health and the HNS since the formation of NHS trusts? How can it be the case that the Department of Health happily collects information on staffing at every NHS trust, but the Department for Education and Employment has always backed away from collecting information on staffing in further education colleges?

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I hope my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not stray too deeply into that point. My responsibilities are for Wales and though I am member of the Government I do not want to commit the Department for Education and Employment. We shall examine terms and conditions and salaries, but there is no compulsion for corporations because they are independent. I shall draw my hon. Friend's comments to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister, who is not able to be present today. I have tried to clarify the present position, and I hope that my hon. Friend will accept my reassurances.

Clause 40 also enables the council in Wales to support and develop information, advice and guidance services to adults, to help ensure that decisions about adult guidance services and leaming provisions for adults are properly co-ordinated. Given what my hon. Friends and Opposition Members have said, I hope that the Committee recognises that the main purpose of clause 42 is to allow the council in Wales--the council in England has analogous powers--to collect a range of information to help it discharge its duties, so that it can improve the agenda set by the Government. I hope that the Committee will allow clause 40 to stand part.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'and between those who are or are not Welsh speakers.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is an important issue. It is primarily, though not formally, about the Welsh language and the delivery of education and training through the medium of Welsh.  The amendments are tied to the clause in a way that might be misinterpretable and derogatory. One is about learning difficulties and the other about equality of opportunity.  I approach the debate wishing to see parity of treatment between the two languages and parity of esteem and status.  There is no hidden agenda.
<P>
As a non-Welsh speaker, I am somewhat disinterested in the matter. I wish the two languages to co-exist harmoniously, perhaps with a slight sympathy towards Welsh, not least because that has been the view of many Secretaries of State over the years, including Conservative ones, who have sought to foster the language. Those of us who are linguists, in whatever capacity, including my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), are anxious to see pluralism. That is highly germane to today's report, which I have not been able to study in detail, on the recent Nuffield study on the speaking of foreign languages, which is a separate but clearly related subject. We want not to to confine or narrow the provision, but to expand it.
<P>
Amendment No. 171 would deal with a slight difficulty in the wording in relation to persons with learning disabilities. It would remove subsection (4) which relates to the language in which someone is to be taught if it is different from that which is spoken at home. We know whether homes are Welsh or English speaking. As I said, some of my kin are Welsh. Nevertheless, most of us--including most people in Wales--normally speak English at home. The definition becomes a little less easy to follow in cases that involve mixed allegiances or when people are less competent in one language than in another but perhaps try to speak Welsh in order to practise the language, so it is spoken at home. The evidence for that is not clear. Even where discourse is conducted entirely in one language, it might still be influenced by another. I have in mind my wife's late stepfather, with whom I communicated for many years in English faute de mieux, but I never succeeded in explaining to him the difference between a milk bottle and a bottle of milk. Therefore, there is scope for misunderstanding, let alone, if one goes to a court of law, for evidential arguments about what language was spoken at what time by people who might have decided that they cannot speak Welsh.
<P>
I am not suggesting that a speaker of one language or the other has a learning difficulty, as we would understand that term. However, if such people are to receive provision--I shall come to the substantive educational point in a moment--to help them with a language with which they are less familiar, but which is a sensible language in which to deliver education or training, it is important for them to obtain support to get them up to speed in order to avail themselves effectively of that education or training experience.
<P>
Amendment No. 172 raises the issue of potential discrimination. We heard some jocular exchanges earlier, which arose from my right hon. Friend's comments about drowning and being trained not in swimming but in bilingualism. The whole debate in Wales has, healthily, moved on--at least that is my experience as a friendly visitor to the Principality. It seems to me that there is a much better understanding and, indeed, mutual sympathy between the two languages. For example, the creation of S4C seems to have given a focus to, and taken some tension from, the debate in Welsh culture. People now seem to co-exist fairly happily. Nevertheless, not so many generations ago, people remembered the Welsh knot and, more recently, some people were preferred for public office, whether in lifesaving or more exalted office, on the basis of their bilingualism. That is not the right approach. We want people to be considered without fear or favour and, above all, to be given the education or training that is appropriate for them.
<P>
Those two issues, the need to give support to persons whose medium of instruction might not be the language with which they are most familiar, and the need to ensure that people are not typecast, are raised in the amendment. It would also be helpful if the Minister would say something about opportunities in post-16 education for studying in Welsh, and say how we can help persons who perhaps do not speak Welsh but would like to acquire it, or who are habitually Welsh speakers and find English not as easy as they would wish, especially in technical subjects. The amendments are intended as probing amendments, and I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of the Wales Office and the Welsh Assembly to get this right. The present culture is well-disposed towards creating a sensible balance, so the amendments are not designed to hector the Government but to draw out the issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for tabling the amendments. I had seen them in a slightly different light and I was grateful for his explanations. There is a contradiction between clause 41(4), the paragraph that he wishes to remove--I support him on that--and clause 42(1)(a), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In exercisinsg its functions the Council must have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different racial groups.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I did not read paragraph 41(4) as referring to a division between Welsh speakers and non-Welsh speakers
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> With due respect, the hon. Gentleman did concentrate on that division.
<P>
In Cardiff or Swansea, ethnic minority populations, particularly of Urdu or Punjabi speakers, can be found. They are not large communities. It was wrong of the previous Government and it is wrong of this Government to exclude people who have difficulty with English as a second language from being defined as having special educational needs. The fact that the numbers for whom this is the case are relatively small does not mean that there is not an acute problem in some areas. Perhaps when the Minister responds he can give the Committee some reassurance regarding adolescents and young adults who do not have English or Welsh as their first language, particularly those from minorities from oversease, because it is important that we do not exclude them. The most vulnerable group are Asian women. They often find themselves in the situation post-16 where they have poor English or Welsh language skills. We need to ensure that they have access to the special education programmes that are necessary to make them part of a modern society. Clause 41(4) suggests that they will be excluded from that provision and that the CETW will not be able to make any provision for them. I may have read the clause wrongly. If so the Minister can tell me that it is due to my understanding of Welsh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I should like to share my urban experiences on these matters and translate them into the Welsh situation. In Wales, there are Somali communities, Yemeni communities and many others. We are living in the global village. Like that of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, my understanding of subsection (4) is that no special provision will be made. In adult education classes in Wolverhampton we have people from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and the Balkans. They all have problems from special educational needs to learning difficulties. Children from homes where the first language is not Welsh or English are a special case. In Wolverhampton, in the 1960s, we had enormous problems. To the untutored ear, West Indian and Caribbean children in the schools sounded as if they were speaking English, but they were speaking patois. Their parents spoke patois. The children did not speak enough English to enable them to learn their lessons. Perhaps the Minister could clarify beyond any doubt that it is not the intention to exclude the cases to which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and I have referred.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Some valuable points have been raised and I hope to answer the concerns that hon. Members have expressed.
<P>
As with amendment No. 116 to clause 13, which we have already debated and which the hon. Member for Daventry later withdrew, amendment No. 171 would remove an important qualification on the definition of learning difficulties in clause 41. I emphasise the phrase "learning difficulties". The definition specifically excludes a person whose difficulties result solely from the fact that the language in which they would be taught is different from that used in their home. I do not want to delay the Committee by debating an amendment that we have already discussed. However, I reiterate what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Croydon, North, said. The amendment would allow people to claim that they had a learning difficulty if tuition were conducted in a language different to that spoken at home, such as Welsh.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I reassure the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) that the education and training needs of people from another country who speak a different language will receive appropriate provision. The clause sets out who will receive help because of a disability, which is defined in terms of access to education. The CETW will support courses for people who need to have English as a second language. However, that is not regarded as a disability in clause 41(4). We should not expand the definition, which is taken from the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The amendment would divert vital support from those people who have learning difficulties in terms of access to learning. The National Assembly expects the new arrangements to lead to a significant growth in Welsh medium provision. I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Daventry for that aim and hope that other hon. Members will agree with him. The clause will extend opportunities for Welsh speakers to receive tuition in the language that they speak at home.
<P>
Amendment No. 172 is unnecessary. The National Assembly for Wales has a clear commitment, which we support, to promote equality of opportunity for English and Welsh speakers. It will be incumbent on the CETW to ensure that high-quality learning opportunities are available to meet the needs of learners. It is critical that the council is able to combat the disadvantages that are faced by some learners and potential learners. The Government announced in November their intention to place in legislation a cross-cutting obligation on public bodies to promote equality of opportunity when parliamentary time permits it. We aim to take a consistent approach across all public bodies and the clause represents that broad policy. In the interim, however, it is desirable to place a duty to promote equality of opportunity on the CETW from the outset.
<P>
Amendment No. 172 relates to equality of opportunity between Welsh and non-Welsh speakers. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that the Government and the National Assembly intend Welsh and non-Welsh speakers to be treated equally under the new arrangements for post-16 education and training. I hope that I have clarified for the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East our approach to language difficulties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a useful debate. I shall deal first with the comments made by the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Wolverhampton, North-East. Many of us have encountered the problems that people from outside experience. It is important that provision is made albeit, as the Minister said, not necessarily under the formal remit of special educational needs. I hope that the council and the Assembly will act on that consideration. The only point I make en passant is that people who come from such countries might not know whether they should learn Welsh or English. That is another complication, but I shall not try to underwrite it in legislation.
<P>
The Minister's response to linguistic discrimination was as near perfectly satisfactory as we could expect. There is a common objective. The enactment of the European convention on human rights into domestic legislation means that there is an even sharper duty on public bodies not to discriminate and to provide equal opportunities outside the more traditional remit. I welcome that in relation to language. The Assembly should be able to get on with working that out in practice. The assurances have been powerful enough. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruane:</B> I think that it was the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) who mentioned this morning several old Victorian mental health establishments that were located in his constituency but which have been closed down. The North Wales hospital, a mental health institution that was the main provider of such care for the whole of north Wales and which had some 1,500 patients in its heyday, was located in my constituency. It has now closed down and many of its patients, some of whom still have learning difficulties, have settled in my community.
<P>
There are also two schools in my constituency for people with mental difficulties.  Plas Brondyffryn is a school for autism and a regional centre of excellence that takes students from Pembroke up to Knowsley. I have visited the school on numerous occasions and spoken to its head teacher, Mike Tobin. I asked him how many of his pupils could enter the work force. He said that approximately a third of them could enter it without any supervision, that a third could do so with some supervision and that a third would not be suitable.
<P>
The Bill and the clause will provide important help.  I refer especially to subsection (2)(a), which states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the case of a person who has not attained the age of 25, the Council must secure the provision of boarding accommodation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision will help schools such as Plas Brondyffryn, which offer the chance of a ladder of opportunity to students with autism who want to make the leap into the economy and to provide for themselves.
<P>
Pengwem Hall, a regional school that is one of the three Mencap schools in the country, is also located in my constituency. The clause will help it to provide skills and training to young people with mental difficulties. The school runs its own farm, with help, and runs its own tea shop in St. Asaph; it is called Turner's tea rooms, although I nearly said that it was called Tina Turner's tea rooms. The school provides a ladder of opportunity for people who may have been sidelined, and I am sure that such people will welcome the clause.
<P>
I discussed with the hon.  Member for Daventry in the Jubilee Room the foyer project that is planned for my constituency. The project will help people who have been dealt a poor card in life by taking them off the streets, providing with them with the security of accommodation and giving them life skills that will enable them to re-enter society and to play their full part in it.  I am sure that the clause will be welcomed by my constituents in the Vale of Clwyd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> My hon. Friend has made some valuable points. The clause is important, as it sets out the responsibilities of the CETW for securing provision for people with learning difficulties. Our earlier debate illustrated its values. I shall reflect on my hon. Friend's comments and I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I shall be brief. I have clearly failed hitherto in the de rigueur declaration of interest, so I report to the Committee that I have had nine holidays in St. David's. I already look forward to my 10th visit, whenever that may occur. Against the mildly disobliging quotation from my noble mother concerning the coroner's inquest on death by drowning, I still retain the memory of an event that occurred many years ago, when we were staying on a farm near St. David's. I recall my late noble father, who was already a Member of Parliament and was later to become the Minister for Welsh Affairs, helping to bring in the harvest by horse and cart.  He was unable to communicate with the horse, which would respond only to the Welsh equivalent of words such as "Whoa" and "Gee up".
<P>
I shall not have the opportunity to make the same observations about a clause on plans in England preceding a clause on strategy as I made in relation to clauses 15 and 16, as the Welsh clauses can manage without strategy or plans. Parenthetically, I take maternal pride in this instinctive deafness, although I notice that we shall get action plans in clause 77.
<P>
On re-reading clause 16 on strategy in Hansard, I see that I failed to grasp the admirable irony of the Minister's remark that, regardless of their content, it was a legislative convention that clause 16 should follow clause 15, which I instantly if retrospectively recognise. The exchange between the Minister and myself will be even more difficult for future readers to follow if the Hansard title of clause 15, which should be "Plans" continues in the final record of the Committee's proceedings to read "Equality of Opportunity" as it does not in column 304, that being the title of clauses 14 and 42.
<P>
You, Mr. Hancock, would rule me out of order if I took my next observation too far, but even Ministers serving on a Committee as good natured as this one sometimes animadvert adversely on the work of their Conservative predecessors. St. David was an Irishman, just as his mother St. Non was an Irishwoman. I therefore remark in passing that I hope that the Government pursue clause 42, when it is enacted, more energetically than the somewhat dilatory manner in which the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has pursued fair employment considerations in public bodies in Northern Ireland by the Equality Commission, which was set up under the Belfast agreement and consequential legislation.  The Government have not pressed the consequential aspect of that legislation as urgently as I believe is desirable in Northern Ireland, not least because it affects further education in the Province.
<P>
I seek no comment from the Minister in reply. I know, of course, Mr. Hancock, that you would rule him out of order immediately, although you have very generously not ruled me out of order.

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's comments. I hope that he will accept clause 42. I know that he has made 10 visits to Wales on recent holidays; I am sure that when he retires from the House, he will make many more. I, of course, spend 160 days a year in his constituency.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 43 to 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 5</center></H4>
Committees (Wales)
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 67, line 35, leave out 'may' and insert 'must'.
<P>
I have probably completed a personal record by leaving until the Committee's 12th sitting a "may" or "must" debate. It has a certain purpose, but realising that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough requires to be amused from time to time, I can tell the Committee that it will be positively my last bow of the day--unless arrangements have miscarried--and it will not be extended or result in a Division.  However, I have some real worries about appointments to regional committees.
<P>
We know--it is a different and bigger country--that England is to have 47 local learning and skill councils. It would seem sensible to have some local representation in Wales, not least because of the geographic circumstances.  Those hon.  Members who represent constituencies in north Wales will appreciate that, because of their difficulties in travelling to Cardiff. I know that it is not easy to travel around the Principality. The economic interests of the north Wales coastal area do not equate with those of south Wales, which lies to the west of the Midlands, or to parts of west Wales, which are remote from both the main conurbations over the border in England.
<P>
Local representation is clearly needed. In a sense, that is secured by the present paragraph because it refers to the ability to establish committees. There is now a history of development in this area. The First Secretary announced as long ago as June last year that there would be a regional tier. There has since been consideration by the Assembly's post-16 education and Training Committee of the way in which that should work.  It considered several options and came up with regional advisory committees.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My colleague, who was the sole Conservative member of the Committee, felt that the system should have teeth. Having read his analysis, I share his view.  The Government have provided for local councils throughout England. In Wales, there are to be non-statutory committees.
<P>
We must know more clearly what it is envisaged the regional committees will do. In particular, it is extremely important that the Minister tells the Committee the extent to which they will reflect local interests and the need for local flexibility.  Given that he is in consultation with the National Assembly, it would be useful to know the current thinking on the proportion of local discretion that should devolve down to the four intended committees. He might wish to say that that is a matter for the Assembly.  Incidentally, the four committees are planned broadly on the lines of the existing TECS.  That is interesting; I shall not go into that matter now.  We would like to feel that the amount of local discretion matches that available in England and that the powers of the regional committees, as I will call them, are broadly equivalent to those of the local learning and skills councils that we have debated already in relation to the English clauses.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister also explained community partnerships. I understand that these are to be semi-voluntary bodies, active at the delivery end. The relationship between the partnerships, the regional committees and the national council is important and delicate. We are not seeking to trip up the Minister on the matter or to subvert the discretion of the National Assembly.  However, having gone at length through the English provisions, it will be interesting to see the extent to which the Welsh arrangements that he is establishing in conjunction with his colleagues will replicate those in England.  The reasons for divergence where there is not replication will also be interesting.  The reasons might be good or bad, but the Committee needs to know what is in mind.
<P>
As the Bill is drafted, the committee's powers are weak.  The committees seem to have been almost an afterthought to the original construction as it related to Wales.  Regional and local representation is of great importance. It is necessary for the articulation of needs, for making demands for education and for training and supervising local delivery. We look forward to the Minister's response to the general but brief points on an important matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Amendment No. 144 would require the council in Wales to establish a regional committee for each of the four regions of Wales.  As the hon. Gentleman has noted, this is a "may" or "must" debate. The noble Lord Roberts proposed an identical amendment in another place. My noble Friend Lady Farrington urged the noble Lord to withdraw that amendment; I hope that the hon.  Gentleman will withdraw his.
<P>
I have a duty to explain and to answer the points advanced by the hon.  Gentleman.  I emphasise that the provisions in the Bill reflect the National Assembly's consideration, which has derived from its thorough and careful scrutiny of the arrangements for the council's committees.  There has been cross-party support.
<P>
Clause 46 and schedule 5 enable the CETW to establish regional committees and give the council the power to establish other committees as it thinks fit. The National Assembly's preference, which the Government support, is that the CETW should have a permissive power, rather than a duty--the "may" or "must" debate to which the hon. Member for Daventry referred--to establish regional committees, based on the wish to give the CETW the maximum flexibility to determine its own organisational structures to suit the particular needs and circumstances of Wales. The National Assembly has made plain its expectation that the new council will indeed establish regional committees, as Opposition Members wish.  The regional committees will each be chaired by a member of the CETW, and the new council will have responsibility for appointing other members.
<P>
It is intended that the council's regional committees--this reflects another of the points raised by the hon. Member for Daventry--will have a key role in the learning and skills agenda for Wales, in identifying regional skills needs, and a strong influence over the way in which the budget for work-based training is used. The National Assembly also intends that the CETW's regional committees should be in a position to influence the use of funds for post-16 education and training more generally within their areas. They will have a key role in helping to guide the work of the local community consortia for education and training--the post-16 service providers--in their areas. It is envisaged that the business community will have significant representation on the CETW's regional committees.
<P>
The regional committee's functions will be advisory rather than executive.  They will be committees of the CETW, not independent bodies, as we and the National Assembly wish to ensure that the CETW remains a strong and effective unitary public body.  The Bill reflects the wish of the Government and the National Assembly to work co-operatively with the CETW in the interests of people throughout Wales. The intention of the Government and the National Assembly is not to be prescriptive, and that intention is reflected in the Bill.  The amendment tabled by the hon.  Member for Daventry would place restrictions on the Assembly.  Given those assurances -- despite the fact that I cannot accept the "must"--I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of the Minister's declared intention to pursue a policy of seductive reasonableness, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 5 agreed to.
<P>
Clauses 47 to 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
