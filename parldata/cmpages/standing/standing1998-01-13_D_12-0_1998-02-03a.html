<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin, I should announce that in the light of the new order of consideration, which was agreed this morning, a revised selection list is available in the Room. The amendment paper, however, has not been remarshalled, so hon. Members will have to be alert.
<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to apply Act to individuals who are not otherwise ``workers''</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 24, line 10, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``After a process of consultation with persons representative of industry''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 200, in page 24, line 10, after `38', insert `(1)'. 
<P>
No. 241, in page 24, line 10, after `may', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where he reasonably believes that such provision is required to avoid the unreasonable exclusion from the provisions of this Act of any person whose position is analogous to that of a worker as defined in this Act but whose contractural arrangements do not fall within the definition of a worker in this Act,''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 201, in page 24, line 18, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(2) Nothing in regulations made under subsection (1) above shall cause to be treated as a worker for the purposes of this Act any person counted as self-employed for the purposes of such an individual's tax.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We will indeed be alert. The clause is important and these are modestly important amendments to it. I endorse the sentiment behind the two longer amendments tabled by my hon. Friends--the first merely paves the way.
<P>
I shall confine mose of my remarks to the amendment in my name, which would make the clause begin:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``After a process of consultation with persons representative of industry''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can hardly believe that that sentiment would create difficulty across the Committee, but I suspect --I judge the Under-Secretary's smile to mean that it is possible to anticipate what her brief will say--that I will be told that the amendment is unnecessary because the words are prescribed by what is reasonable.
<P>
I am sure that the Government would want to consult in normal circumstances. The purpose of the amendment is to hammer home the fact that consultation is necessary to get the fairest outcome.
<P>
In government, the Under-Secretary has sounded and has often been positive to the interests of smaller businesses. The amendment is in no sense tied to such businesses, but the people who run smaller businesses think that consultation is important.
<P>
As the Minister of State would no doubt say if he were here, both sides of industry should be represented in the consultation process. I do not like that phrase. The Minister sometimes slips into the continental style and talks of social partners. I always understood that phrase to be the European translation of ``both sides of industry''. We will not dilate on that. I once used those words in Europe to rather electric effect--people were not expecting me to say them.
<P>
The clause is meant to deal with problems. If difficulties arise, it would be common sense for the Secretary of State and Ministers to talk to industry. That does not always happen in the way that it should. I do not wish to refight the battles over earlier clauses, but there was concern about whether there had been adequate consultation with the Chamber of Shipping over clause 37.
<P>
We want the Bill to provide for consultation. To borrow and modify a phrase used by the Prime Minister, the best conduct of government arises from a process of consultation, consultation, consultation. That is not a cop-out from Ministers' responsibility for decisions, but a commonsense observation that if they talk around a problem, they may find a solution that requires no legislation or regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow: </B>(Buckingham): Does my hon. Friend agree that the merit of the amendments is that they provide protection from the arbitrary use of ministerial power? They would ensure that future provision for new categories of people to be treated as workers for the purpose of the Bill would be based on objectively definable criteria.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Exactly so. My hon. Friend is perceptive. He is a staunch supporter of the Freedom Association. Every member of the Committee has a favourite libertarian organisation, such as the National Council for Civil Liberties.
<P>
The Government want sufficient government and a sensible outcome for their problems. Who knows what those problems are? I will not tease the Under-Secretary to tell me what problems might require regulation. If she has a list, she ought to come out with it, but I hope that she has not. I hope that she feels that she has produced a comprehensive Bill. If she strikes a set of problems, she should consult both sides of industry and come up with a fair and workable solution because it will then be more likely to work and be accepted.
<P>
I return to the importance of consultation with people in what might loosely be called the small business or small employers' sector. In my experience, which is not only of taking decisions in government but of suffering decisions as an ordinary regulatee, Governments occasionally fall into the trap of talking to the great and the good but not talking to representatives of smaller operations. The Under-Secretary is nodding.
<P>
Some years ago, I had a farm petrol tank. I received a set of regulations telling me that I would have to be there when petrol was delivered or nominate a responsible person to be there to check that the petrol did not spill over the top of the tank. The regulations stated that the person who would perform the task would have to receive appropriate training. I remember being unsure whether I should approach the Chief Whip and ask if I could be let off the three-line Whip so that I could go home to check that my farm petrol tank had not overspilled or whether I should get my chap off the combine when he was busy--he was the only person conducting farming operations for me. I did not know what kind of training was needed. I nearly asked ``What set of clots has passed this regulation?'', but I thought that as it was my colleagues and, perhaps, myself, I should not do so. I ended by saying, ``It's a fair cop, guv. I'm going diesel.''
<P>
I make that point because it was obvious from the inquiries I made about that issue that the big operators of specialist sites dealing in large quantities of fuel daily--they probably use more in a day than I would require by offtake in a year--were perfectly happy with the provision to have professional, trained persons performing the task, and rightly so. However, the regulations were not tailored to the circumstances of smaller operations.
<P>
As the Governments new evidence to the Low Pay Commission reveals, small businesses are a productive part of the economy. There are 1 million new employee jobs as well as additional self-employed jobs in that sector. Although I have not highlighted the point in the amendment, consultation should be not only with the great and the good, but with the smaller and less vocal. The legislation would then be more likely to work.
<P>
I want to make two other points, one of which my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) has perceptively flagged up. I do not wish to accuse Ministers of seeking or planning to oppress business people or employers by suddenly imposing new and arbitary regulations. There would be legal constraints on their doing so, as the Under-Secretary will know. Even if there were no such constraints, however, or if they were not effective because the Under-Secretary kept her schemes to herself, it would still be better to have the filter of a consultation process.
<P>
There is only one conceivable argument against consultation, and I would be interested to test the Under-Secretary on it. There could be a clear case of abuse if somebody found a loophole and was frustrating the intentions of the national minimum wage regulations. I said earlier that Conservative Members had no sympathy for such an approach. In such a case, it might just be necessary to run the new regulations from a starting date to avoid evasive action. Anyone who is familiar with tax law will know exactly what I mean. That is a possible qualification, and I would be interested in the Minister's response.
<P>
Broadly speaking, however, the process should move from consutlation with representatives from across the scale of employers to find the best practical solution to the open presentation of regulations to meet the case. Ideally, the regulations would be properly presented to and considered by the House, as they would be under clause 38.
<P>
I want the Under-Secretary to consider the issue of retrospections, which follows on from the thought of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. Even if the Under-Secretary were faced with a loophole, it is unlikely that she would wish to go back in time to penalise an employer who had found a way of doing things, but then discovered that the regulations had struck it down and that he was confronted with a retrospective assessment for the minimum wage. I hope that you will forgive me for my shorthand on the matter, Mr. Atkinson. It would be much better to run new regulations from a starting point. They would presumably have to have effect from the pay reference period of the individual employer, which would be initiated after the regulations came into force; otherwise, there could be problems about whether the regulations were in place in the periods they straddled.
<P>
As a general principle and unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, we should avoid retrospection. The purpose of the amendments is to show that Conservative Members want there to be consultation and an open decision-making process to tackle what employers, too, will often see as abusive ways of getting round the regulations. We should not, however, use regulations to oppress the individual employer or to confront him with a retrospective bill for the national minimum wage.
<P>
I promised to say two words about the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). He has now returned to the Committee and will make the case himself. I think, however, that he is essentially making the same point as me, which is that Ministers need to operate reasonably and have good reasons for their decisions, rather than acting arbitrarily.
<P>
My other hon. Friends from the Back-Bench team are looking for a coincidence between the regulations on self-employment for the purpose of the Inland Revenue and the provisions before us. Leaving aside the Government's little local difficulties with the armed forces, the big exception to the adult national minimum wage are the self-employed. It would be sensible to take the same approach to the definition as the Inland Revenue. The Under-Secretary will know that that subject is sensitive because many problems with 714 certificates and with the redefinition of people as employed have arisen in the building industry. I shall not go into that matter now. It does seem silly, however, to create circumstances in which a person who is treated as employed for the purposes of the national minimum wage can be treated as self-employed with regard to income tax. If that can be avoided, it should be.
<P>
I take comfort from the fact that the Government argue in their explanatory notes on clause 40 that share fishermen should be excluded because they are de facto and ``de taxo''--if I may shorten the phrase--treated as self-employed. That is a useful analogy.
<P>
To summarise, I do not take exception to the clause in principle. The Bill should contain an exceptions clause if it is properly filtered through regulations that will enact any changes. The clause requires proper consultation and a due process, rather than the arbitrary action of Ministers. It is in that spirit that I move the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I should like briefly to add to what my hon. Friend said in speaking to amendment No. 241, which was tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley).
<P>
Clause 38 allows the Secretary of State wide and sweeping powers to extend the provisions of the Bill to any other group. Such wide and sweeping powers are undesirable in any legislation. The Bill contains very comprehensive and carefully phrased definitions of employee and worker to ensure that all the people whom the Government intend to entrap or endow with the benefit of the legislation--depending upon point of view--are entrapped or endowed. The Government may have missed something when drafting the legislation. Later events may demonstrate that additional provision is necessary to give effect to the original intended scope of the Bill.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 241 is simply to impose an explicit test on the legislation. In acting to extend the scope of the Bill, the Secretary of State must do so because he--at present, she--reasonably believes that such extension is required to avoid an unfair outcome, which would result in the exclusion, via a technicality or loophole, of someone who was clearly intended to be included in the scope of the Bill.
<P>
I can see no objection to such an amendment. The Bill devotes great attention to defining precisely and comprehensively the people who are to be included. It contains not only the routine definition of an employee, but a carefully crafted definition of a worker. It therefore appears that to some extent such a catch-all extension clause will be redundant. However, a potentially dangerous amount of power will pass into the hands of the Secretary of State unless there is a specific restriction on her freedom of action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it should logically follow that if the Bill is fundamentally sound, it should be possible at least to predict confidently that such extensions will be few and far between?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, provided that the clause is used only as the amendment suggests, namely to deal with anomalous situations. Where someone who clearly should be--and was intended to be--included is excluded by some loophole, we would have no problem with the provision, but such circumstances are likely to be limited. The danger is that the clause as drafted, without any restriction on the Secretary of State's discretion, could be used to extend the scope of the Bill in ways that have not been presented by the Government as being their intention. It is in that spirit that I propose the amendment; I hope that the Government will view it sympathetically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I am grateful for the opportunity to follow my hon. Friends. I want to speak specifically to amendments Nos. 200 and 201, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) and me, but if I may, Mr. Atkinson, I also want to comment on amendments Nos. 247 and 241.
<P>
Clause 38 is a catch-all provision. All hon. Members know that, at this stage of a Bill, there is a tendency to put in a saving clause that gives Ministers the opportunity to rectify any omissions in the specific provisions. I would not contend that the clause was unusual in that sense, but nevertheless it contrasts with all that has been said in previous sittings about the care with which the Bill has been drafted to ensure that it is comprehensive--a word that has from time to time been used in our debates.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) said in relation to the Government's difficulties over the armed forces, the universality of Ministers' intentions ought to make much more certain the predictability of the application of the Bill. It is difficult to legislate for many boundaries, but the Government intend there to be as few boundaries as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that clause 38 provides for an individual to be prescribed and could give rise to highly specific regulations tied to just one individual, as opposed to a class or group of people? That would be, if not hybrid, at least invidious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. It is specifically intended for that purpose, not least--as the notes on clauses make clear--because of the reference to the application of the provisions, ``with or without modifications''. I would not for a moment contend that hybridity comes into play, but my hon. Friend is right to say that the Government are contemplating individual and particular circumstances.
<P>
The notes on clauses--again, I sympathise with the Government's difficulties in presenting the clause--do no more than describe the provision in terms that are perfectly evident from the clause itself. Notes on clauses usually illustrate by example the purposes for which a given provision has been drafted. I do not argue that it is difficult for the Government to do that for this clause as, by definition, if they were aware of particular circumstances that might give rise to the use of this provision, we would reasonably criticise them because those circumstances were not provided for elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
We must be cautious with the clause, because the Government are not trying to legislate for a set of circumstances that has many interfaces--or boundaries--with other groups. Effectively, they are trying so to define worker beyond those who have employment contracts as to include definitions of agency workers and home workers and carefully to define the exclusions that, in theory at least, they will have included all those whom they wish to include and excluded only those whom they wish specifically to exclude.
<P>
I come to amendments Nos. 200 and 201. The principal boundary at the end of that process divides those defined as workers for the purposes of the Bill from the genuinely self-employed--a term that the Minister has used regularly.
<P>
If the Bill is to exclude the genuinely self-employed, the clause should provide--as the amendments would ensure--that the Government do not cross that boundary when exercising that saving, catch-all power. As drafted, the clause does not do that. It gives Ministers a general power to define other persons as workers, and the phrase ``with or without modifications'' means that Ministers can disregard other provisions in the Bill designed to prevent them from trespassing across that boundary.
<P>
The amendments would prevent Ministers--inadvertently or otherwise--from treating self-employed people as though they were not self-employed. The Inland Revenue definition of self-employed is perfectly viable. Our earlier debates on the Bill's architecture did not consider whether the Government should have chosen to define those not covered by the Bill instead of including everyone in the national minimum wage provisions. The Government's approach means that people who do not have employee status or an employment contract are to be treated as employees. A different architecture would have used the Inland Revenue definition of self-employment to define those excluded from the national minimum wage provisions.
<P>
On amendment No. 247, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about the need for consultation. That implicit need becomes explicit when it comes to exceptions or extending the Bill's scope. Conservative Members do not cavil about the comprehensiveness of the consultation process conducted by the Low Pay Commission in connection with the general provisions of the Bill. However, will the consultation over specific provisions covering particular circumstances be as comprehensive?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry noted that our deliberations have exposed some problems with the Bill--for example, in connection with mariners--and I am sure that there will be others before we have finished debating the clauses on exclusion. It does not always follow that the representative organisations have, on their own initiative, undertaken quite the full extent of examination and representation necessary.
<P>
For those reasons, and especially given that the Government are moving beyond provisions that have been the subject of scrutiny in the House in order to include them in the Bill, they need to demonstrate, before making regulations, that they have actively sought representations from those who are likely to be affected and from industry generally.
<P>
Amendment No. 241, like amendment No. 201, which deals with self-employment, is intended to ensure that in the exercise of the Bill's provisions, the Government secure their intentions as expressed in the Bill and as debated and approved by Parliament. That is hardly exceptionable.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Ministers will no doubt assure us that they would not contemplate the use of regulations and order-making powers to secure something other than the worthy intentions of the legislation. However, it will do no harm, and will indeed do some good, for us to make it clear in the clause--wide ranging as it may be--that Ministers should not think to use it as a device for achieving some intention other than that which is explicitly in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I agree that there is no reason to doubt the intentions of the current incumbents of the Department of Trade and Industry, but does my hon. Friend agree that we cannot predict with confidence the motivation of future occupants of those offices?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is characteristically generous. His interpretation of the intentions of the present incumbents of the Department of Trade and Industry is generous, although he may have an even more laudatory view of those who previously held office in that Department. None of us knows in whose hands the powers are to be vested. It is not the purpose of Parliament, when it can avoid doing so, to vest in the hands of Ministers--however well disposed--powers that can be used to go beyond the intentions of Parliament. I agree with my hon. Friend's point.
<P>
I realise how difficult it is to illustrate how powers could be used. However, in her reply to the debate, the Under-Secretary should explain why it is necessary for the phrase ``with or without modifications'' to be used in the clause. Amendment No. 241 is designed to ensure that the clause is used only to give an entirely reasonable extension of the intentions of the Bill as reflected elsewhere in its provisions. Therefore, the use of the phrase ``with or without modifications'' inspires caution in Opposition Members. It suggests that in so doing--and acknowledging that individual and particular circumstances may be involved--Ministers will in effect set aside some of the particular provisions elsewhere in the Bill to construe that a worker or class of persons should be treated as covered by the national minimum wage provisions when they may specifically not be so included by reference to some other provision. We are dealing not with something that is designed simply to catch those people who may have escaped notice in the provisions, but with a clause that is designed to set aside in certain circumstances, something in the Bill's provisions to bring within the national minimum wage someone who would clearly be outside it under the existing provisions.
<P>
If I tried hard, I could acquire a reputation for being the pedant of the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I claim that prize.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> We are vying for that dubious honour.
<P>
The notes on clauses, which are otherwise accurate in all respects, make an erroneous reference in part 2, which relates to the purpose and background of the clause, to clause 39(1) when they should refer to clause 38(1).
<P>
The notes on clauses make our point because they do not explain the circumstances in which the clause will be used, but simply describe the powers that will be given to the Secretary of State. It falls to us not simply to give Ministers the necessary powers if the Committee's intentions are to be fulfilled, but to circumscribe the powers so that Ministers are limited within those intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I congratulate my hon. Friend on his bid for pedant of the Committee. His attention to detail is such that I will fear for his officials when he attains ministerial office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To avoid doubt, my hon. Friend's should know that I shall award the title of pedant of the Committee and the recipient will be buying the drinks at the knees-up we will have afterwards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to hear that, since I am deeply unlikely to win the award. I regard my hon. Friend's proposal as eminently sensible and far-sighted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Would my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry take note of the remark of the late Ernest Bevin, speaking of Ernest Morrison, who he said was his own worst enemy and added, ``Not while I'm around he ain't''? Neither of my hon. Friends is the pedant of the Committee while I'm around.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is all very amusing, but if anybody were to select a pedant, I should have thought that Mrs. Dunwoody and I would be candidates for making that decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> We shall all submit ourselves to your judgment in this, Mr. Atkinson, as in all matters, so long as we can stick to the rule of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that whoever wins the award, buys the drinks afterwards.
<P>
My problem with the clause and the reason I support the amendments is the fact that the extra, swingeing--arbitrary is a strong word--powers that Ministers are taking on themselves are a one-way process. The purpose of the amendments is to hobble those powers. Having spent so long in discussions of what were described this morning as tortuous clauses that seek to specify in great detail the people who will be covered by the Bill, we get to this clause and it is as though suddenly the Government have decided to give up on the nit-picking and arrogate to the Secretary of State the power to do anything. That seems to render many of our recent discussions redundant.
<P>
There are three main reasons to support the amendments and cast a jaundiced eye over the clause. It is a sign of skill in the divvying up of the reply speeches that the reply to this clause, which is one of the most difficult, swingeing and aggressive in the Bill, will be made by the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche). In the hard cop-soft cop act that the two Ministers have perfected--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Soft cop, softer cop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Under-Secretary is obviously ideal to slide under the wire with some of the more aggressive clauses. I will offer to referee the fight between Ministers later on when they both claim the hard cop accolade.
<P>
The first reason to support the amendments is one of good order in legislation. The clause--a catch-all provision that works in only one direction--should be unnecessary in a properly drafted Bill. It is an admission that the Bill does not cover all possibilities and that some micro management of the labour market is needed. That is not practical.
<P>
Secondly, the clause offends against tidiness. Amendment No. 201 would rectify that. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry pointed out the absurd inequity of a clause that means that a person who is widely regarded as self-employed for one purpose can suddenly be regarded, for some other purpose and possible by ministerial fiat, as an employee. That is not sensible: worse, it could bring tax collection into disrepute.
<P>
People treated by the Inland Revenue as self-employed will order their affairs to maximise the benefits. They will feel that they have been treated unfairly if a different Government rule states that they are employees. What will be their tax status? There initial fear will affect how they run their business, but there will also be incredulity that the definition of whether they are self-employed could vary between two arms of Government--the Inland Revenue and the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>
Such an anomaly would be bad for both their reputations, and for the reputation of good government in general. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the intention behind the amendment. The Government should be consistent in their approach to workers: people who are self-employed in the assessment of one branch of Government should not be regarded as employees by another.
<P>
Thirdly, the clause is not consistent with the Government's much heralded evidence to the Low Pay Commission. It extends the Government's power to include ever more people into an all-embracing national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does not my hon. Friend consider that the only possible motto for the Government's evidence is ``parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus''--``the mountains give forth, and a tiny mouse is born''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend's classical education always impresses me--and amazes the Minister.
<P>
A clear signal can be read between the lines of the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission. That is, that the commission should go easy when it comes to trying to extend the provisions. Page 2 of that mouse-like document states that the commission has been asked
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to pay particular attention to the position of young people.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the language of Whitehall, that means, ``For God's sake, give us a lower rate for young people please, otherwise it will all go belly up.''
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Similary, the Government's evidence states at page 12:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In recommending a national rate, the Commission should pay particular attention to its effect in regions of the UK where low pay is most widespread.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Translated from the native Whitehall, that means, ``We may have cocked this one up. We'd better make sure the rate is as low as possible, otherwise in some regions unemployment is going to go through the roof.'' The thrust of the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission, as far as there is one, is, ``We've, set out on a course of all-inclusiveness and a national wage, but we are now desperately searching for exceptions and hoping the commission will get us off our own hook.''
<P>
The commission may or may not do that, but such evidence is inconsistent with the clause, which seeks in every last nook and cranny of the labour market to bring into the provisions people who would not otherwise be included. Do Ministers want that power to be in their hands and those of their successors? I dare say that in the lead-up to the last general election both Ministers complained bitterly about a Government who took unto themselves unspecified, arbitrary powers. If such phraseology came out of their mouths, they should ask themselves why it is all right for them to take such action when it was not all right for previous Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): For the past 45 minutes I have been wondering whether we were considering a different clause. I do not recognise Conservative Members' descriptions of a catch-all clause, dangerous, aggressive and swingeing powers and regulations that are aimed at a single individual. The purpose of the clause is to apply the minimum wage in today's labour market, and the powers will ensure that that is done effectively.
<P>
The labour market has changed since the 1970's when many employment rights were created. It was reasonable and right then that employment rights applied to employees. Most people were employees, few were self-employed and next to none were subject to the casualised conditions of employment that have been so common in recent years. Labour-only sub-contracting in the construction industry and zero-hours contracts in the fast-food industry were unknown 20 years ago.
<P>
When discussing House of Lords staff, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that it was a dangerous precedent to legislate only for today. That is quite right. The clause allows the minimum wage to be effective in today's labour market and in tomorrow's. The reserve powers are framed so that legislation can be adapted by regulation to meet changes in the labour market and patterns of employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I made it clear that we understood and supported that argument? All that amendment No. 241 would do is impose on the Secretary of State a duty to use the clause only when it was necessary to do so to ensure that the Bill's intention was given effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> One of the clause's strengths is that it has a clear place in the Bill's purpose and framework, but I shall comment on amendment No. 241 later.
<P>
It is reasonable and necessary for the Secretary of State to have the power to make good the guarantee that the right to the minimum wage will apply to all but those who are genuinely self-employed. Time and again employers have set lawyers on to employment law with the sole purpose of finding loopholes which they can then exploit. Clause 38 is intended to deal with the devices that employers will develop to get around the definitions of ``worker'' set out in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman foresee circumstances in which somebody who is treated as self-employed by the Inland Revenue for tax purposes could, under the Bill, be treated as a worker for national minimum wage purposes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> That would hinge on the precise definition of who was genuinely self-employed.
<P>
Clause 38 is in the interests of low-paid and exploited workers. It is, however, also in the interests of good employers, who do not want cowboys devising new forms of employment to get around paying the national minimum wage.
<P>
The amendments are a little long-winded, although nothing like the explanations that have accompanied them. We have heard sensible concerns about consultation, a reasonableness test in the regulations, the link to the tax system and the treatment of the self-employed for tax purposes. Those are sensible and interesting issues, which should all form part of the consideration of the regulations. Their proper place is in detailed scrutiny of proposed regulations, not in primary legislation.
<P>
I should remind members of the Committee that regulations made under the clause will be debated. Clause 48(4) means that Ministers will not introduce regulations by diktat. The hon. Member for Daventry pleaded for due process, and Ministers will be using the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
The amendments are not necessary, but clause 38 certainly is.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire was right to refer to my charitable instincts. I am in a charitable mood and I begin, therefore, with a charitable contribution. In fairness to Ministers, it is right to say that the intention of clause 38 is not to ensnare those who are genuinely self-employed, but to prohibit those who are not from being treated as though they were. The notes on clauses show that that is the thrust of the Government's thinking, and I accept that. My first point is, therefore, that we accept the Government's good faith in that respect.
<P>
Secondly, it is likely that the motives of the existing ministerial team at the Department of Trade and Industry are reasonable. If we view the ministerial team against the Richter scale of reasonableness, we see that there are divisions, which may necessitate the amendments or make them desirable. I do not want to damage the already damaged career of the Under-Secretary by excessive compliment, but the truth is that she is eminently reasonable. The Minister of State is periodically reasonable. The President of the Board of Trade is occasionally reasonable although, even then, only by accident. In terms of reasonableness, therefore, we cannot confidently predict the way in which Ministers will exercise the powers that they have recently acquired, which they understandably clutch to their breasts and the exercise of which will no doubt be deeply pleasurable and leave them salivating. It is, therefore, necessary to have an argument about the merit of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend recognise that the test that the Minister of State has to pass does not so much concern the reasonableness of the common man? Rather, the test is whether he becomes so unreasonable as not to fit within the definition of reasonableness that any person of a normal character might construe. It is a narrow definition of reasonableness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely valid point with a degree of sophistication that is both to be expected and unlikely to be equalled by any other member of the Committee. On that feat, I congratulate him.
<P>
In reality, if Ministers are fundamentally reasonable about this, it should also follow that their attitude to consultation will be reasonable. That is the basis of our argument. There are two main points, which have been partly made already but which require reinforcement.
<P>
First, if the changes that the Government propose to make in the distant future are relatively uncontroversial and would be accepted as so by this Committee, there can be no legitimate objection to consultation. If what is proposed is a technical adjustment and is referable to, and defensible in accordance with, objective criteria, who is going to object? Realistically, none of us. What is the harm, therefore, in writing into the clause a requirement for that consultation?
<P>
The Under-Secretary will have noticed that nothing in the wording of the amendment requires a particularly laborious or long-winded process of consultation. My hon. Friends and I are simply saying, ``Let there be consultation''. If what is proposed in future regulations is a modest and uncontroversial tidying-up operation, there can be no legitimate objection to consultation being required by the Bill.
<P>
Secondly, if what is proposed is rather more dramatic, our argument is even more compelling. I do not for a moment think that the Under-Secretary is dreaming up some secret and extensive list of categories of people to whom the legislation will apply in future but not now; if she were doing so, she would no doubt include provision for them in the Bill. It is in the nature of the beast that Ministers cannot think of the people to whom the clause will apply. I do not criticise them for that.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Linda.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister is seeking to aid the Committee by suggesting that my cleaner, Linda, might be the person to whom the extension of power is intended to apply in the future. That is a manifestly unreasonable, albeit witty, observation because my cleaner is already treated as a worker and will enjoy far greater remuneration in the future--as she does now--than anything that will be made available under the Bill. To whomsoever Ministers may plan to apply the extensions, my good cleaner Linda--there is none better in the United Kingdom--will not be one of them.
<P>
If Ministers are planning a major extension or they decide in future that that is necessary, and the extension is controversial, it must follow that there should be consultation. Ministers cannot have it both ways. When it suits them to talk about the way in which they have consulted and selectively to quote the results of that consultation, they do so. Indeed, they do not do that reluctantly, with a show of distaste for the performance of a necessary but tedious task; the Under-Secretary does so regularly, with brio, as does the Minister of State.
<P>
They regularly cite, for example, the fact that the Federation of Small Businesses, having listened to their eloquent orations in support of the national minimum wage, has come round to the need for it. Ministers quote selectively, but legitimately, the motion that was passed at its annual conference. They know, therefore, that there is a powerful argument for any Government to conduct consultation. If a major, non-technical extension is proposed, what is the harm in having, say, a six-week, eight-week or three-month consultation period on that proposal? I cannot for the life of me see what the objection to that is.
<P>
My next observation builds upon the comments made by one of my hon. Friends a little earlier. It relates to the work that has already been done by the Low Pay Commission, and which is, as we speak still being done. The value of that body's contribution has been lauded and magnified by Ministers and by Government Back Benchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> And by the Institute of Directors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Indeed, as the Minister says from a sedentary position, the Institute of Directors has made some favourable reference to the Low Pay Commission. It may well be that the Institute of Directors is paying tribute to the Low Pay Commission in the faint hope that it might exercise some restraining influence upon the Government's intentions; I do not know. I hope that the Minister will consider that point. The Low Pay Commission has been referred to in favourable terms for the work that it has done and is doing.
<P>
It seems curious to Opposition Members that while the Government propose a potentially--I do not put it any higher--dramatic extension, the Low Pay Commission has apparently not been asked to suggest future categories to which it may be necessary for the extension to apply. Surely it would be possible to ask the Low Pay Commission to reflect upon these matters, and then perhaps to enable them to be dealt with now. That would mean no dramatic enabling power for the future, but the production of specific, narrow and technical provision. The Government choose not to do that, which is a pity.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friends have referred to the phrase ``with or without modifications''. Perhaps the Government could elaborate on that. I suspect that Ministers will argue that the architecture of the Bill means that there will be no provision for getting out of its main purposes. I have to say to the Minister that if that is not so, the Committee should be told. If the potential extension of categories would allow modifications that include changes to the rate of the national minimum wage or to the means by which it will be calculated in terms of the inclusion or exclusion of benefits in kind and so on, those are material facts of which the Committee should now be informed. Otherwise, there is a real danger that because of the application of the power involved, the way in which the minimum wage operates across the country could be substantially different from the way in which it would operate under the Bill at present.
<P>
I should like Ministers to understand that in making that point, I am not saying that the minimum wage will necessarily be applied in a way that is more or less damaging to industry, or more or less beneficial to the work force. I am saying that as a result of its application by different Ministers in the future, the effects could be substantially different from what people presently believe to be in prospect because of the wording of the Bill.
<P>
I wish the Under-Secretary well in the exercise of her duties. She may well be in office for some time, although the Opposition will attempt to foreshorten her tenure. She will accept that in her lifetime other Ministers will occupy her high office. The Opposition hope that that will be so in her lifetime, as we wish her a long, happy and healthy life. Those Ministers may well have intentions that are different from hers.
<P>
I shall return to the subject of reasonableness. In arguing for amendments that we support, the attitude, speeches and comportment of my hon. Friends and I are so manifestly reasonable that it is very difficult to see what Ministers' objections can be.
<P>
The hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), who is shaking his head in a bizarre fashion, made a speech, two thirds of which were an objection per se. The speech could easily have been part of a clause stand part debate. It did not concern the amendments. I do not know whether it was the intention of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge to lift the hon. Gentleman from the trough into which he had sunk, but that was the effect that he had. When my hon. Friend intervened and challenged the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Gentleman signalled his intention to say something about the amendments. Until then, he had simply favoured the Committee with his view that the clause was a good clause. The argument is not about the clause itself, and its retention in or exclusion from the Bill, but whether it is capable of betterment. Our contention is that the clause can be improved. I politely suggest to the Under-Secretary--and would be grateful if she would be polite enough to listen to me--that the wording of the amendments is reasonable.
<P>
I conclude with a reminder, for the benefit not just of members of the Committee but of those who are listening to or will read our deliberations. It is a crying shame, as my hon. Friends will readily agree, that so far in the Committee's deliberations, Ministers have not accepted one amendment proposed by Conservative Members. That is a regrettable state of affairs. No matter how reasonable and how reasonably argued have been the amendments that we tabled on a variety of clauses, Ministers have not accepted one of them.
<P>
These amendments are modest; they are designed not to wreck but to clarify. I do not object to the idea that we take account of the future labour market. All I say is that we should do so on a basis that we can reasonably predict, and within limits. With respect to the hon. Member for Wentworth, his objection to the amendment was not compelling. His objection, if applied more widely in legislation, would be dangerous.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I had a sedentary conversation about this point a few moments ago. The hon. Member for Wentworth advanced his case in a reasonable--indeed almost plodding--fashion, but his point was profoundly unreasonable. He appeared to be saying that it was all rather awkward to have these restraints--in other words, we know what we are about, so let us get on with it. That argument is a justification for having vaguely defined, inadequately circumscribed legislation. We are being fussy; we are being pedantic. That is the responsibility of legislators--to hold the Executive to account and to circumscribe the exercise of their powers.
<P>
I make no apology for saying that I want the Bill to be safe in the hands of someone who is unreasonable. I am not content simply to regard it as safe in the hands of two relatively reasonable inhabitants of this planet. We deserve better than that. We know not when there might be a renaissance of the ugly forces of old Labour in the Labour party. Against that possibility we have to guard, and Conservative Members are determined that we shall do so.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I begin by reminding members of the Committee of the purpose of the clause, in case we have departed from it. The clause will provide the Secretary of State with flexibility. That point was covered very well by the hon. Member for Daventry. We want to cover any loopholes which unscrupulous employers may find and exploit. The hon. Gentleman referred to that earlier and to his own desire, and that of his hon. Friends, to deal with that issue.
<P>
Let me say once again for the avoidance of doubt that of course we expect that employers will want overwhelmingly to comply with the legislation. But there will always be a few who do not, and that is one reason for the clause. We believe that we have drafted the Bill tightly enough to cover all those who should be covered, but experience shows that some employers--although very few--will go to great lengths to evade their responsibilities.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth not only explored what the labour market is at the moment but spoke about the labour market of tomorrow. I think that the Committee benefited from his great experience in this matter.
<P>
I come now to the amendments. I am afraid that I have to disappoint the hon. Member for Buckingham, because I am not minded to recommend accepting the amendment. I am disappointed about this, because I gather that the hon. Gentleman feels a little fragile, sensitive and neglected because the Government have not been able to accept any amendment. The Committee knows that my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I vie with each other to be as sensitive as we can towards hon. Members. Sometimes I tell my hon. Friend that he should not be so sensitive and reticent in his views.
<P>
Self-employment is complex: anyone familiar with this part of the law knows the discussion that it has generated. In most cases, the distinction between the self-employed and workers causes no trouble, but sometimes there is uncertainty at the margin.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 200 and 201 would tie the Bill to the definition of self-employment used in tax law. However, the Committee will know that there are many ways of drawing the line between bogus and genuine self-employment. That is why the clause has to be flexible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I put to the Under-Secretary the question posed earlier to the hon. Member for Wentworth: can she envisage circumstances in which a person defined by the Inland Revenue as self-employed would be defined as an employee by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes. For example, the Inland Revenue may define home workers as self-employed, but the Bill would treat them differently. Such things are not uncommon, but I have said before that there is no one test of self-employment. The amendments would only increase uncertainty.
<P>
The Inland Revenue has no strict definition of self-employment, but it does use certain criteria. As a result, cases are decided individually.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that a home worker who works for only one employer could not be classified as self-employed?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Some categories of home workers may be so defined by the Inland Revenue, even though they disagree with the definition. Such difficulties can occur in all sorts of circumstances. That is why the clause, and the drafting of the Bill, follow the example of legislation such as the Employment Rights Act 1996. That Act defines employment in one way, but does not incorporate the separate legislation relevant to the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Government intends to ensure that homeworkers and agency workers who are not genuinely self-employed should be entitled to the''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
national minimum wage. That is their intention too for temporary employees, but the implication is that the Government consider some people whom the Inland Revenue treat as self-employed to be not genuinely self-employed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We are talking about two different things. Conservative Members are trying to make out that there is only one test to decide whether a person is genuinely self-employed. I understand that, but I do not accept that that the Inland Revenue test for self-employment is the only one that should be used. Not only legislation, but case law shows that self-employment is not defined only by the way in which the Revenue treats it. There are many other definitions. If we used only the definition proposed by Conservative Members, the scope of the Bill would be very much restricted.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept the Minister's argument and I know that the definition of self-employment is complex, but is there justification for two definitions for Government purposes, one for the Inland Revenue and one for the Department of Trade and Industry? Will there be other definitions for other Departments?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> They are not separate definitions. Self-employment is not defined. I said earlier that there is no legal definition of self-employment. There are a number of tests. By considering them, one infers whether someone is self-employed. Conservative Administrations enacted similar employment legislation--this is not new.
<P>
Amendment No. 247 would require the Secretary of State to consult representatives of industry before extending the Bill. The hon. Member for Daventry was right to talk about the importance of consultation and the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire was kind enough to mention the Low Pay Commission's work on consultation.
<P>
I should stress that the Government strongly favour the consultation process. Indeed, the existence of the commission proves that. It has carried out its consultative task effectively. The hon. Member for Daventry mentioned small businesses. I share his view on their need to be consulted, which is why we gave the commission an express remit to consider that important factor.
<P>
The commission is a model for a new cohesive approach. Employers and workers' representatives, along with independent experts, are working towards a common aim. The commission's manner of working, as much as its objective, reinforces the aim of bringing together those who will be affected by the implementation of the minimum wage.
<P>
Consultation will take place, but the amendment would undermine the workings of the clause. Conservative Members have portrayed the clause as extremely wide-ranging, but it may never be needed. It may rarely be necessary to use its powers. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked why we had not specified who will be affected. We cannot specify at the moment. We think that we have catered for everybody, but we want to be able to legislate for a rapidly changing employment market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> If the occasions upon which extensions are needed are few and far between, it follows logically that the time required for consultation would be minimal. Therefore, what is the objection to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall come on to that matter. I am not saying that the Secretary of State would not consult before extending the provisions by using her power and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth said, the regulations will be subject to debate and affirmation in the House.
<P>
There may be circumstances in which consultation would make action less effective. I come to a point I made earlier; indeed, it was also helpfully made by the hon. Member for Daventry. One of the aims of clause 38 is to ensure that the Secretary of State can close any loopholes that emerge. The hon. Member for Daventry has frequently spoken about crafty employers who will use every means to evade their responsibility, although I should repeat that there are very few such employers. Such means could include reclassifying their entire work force or revising all their working arrangements. If that happened, we would want to act swiftly to ensure that workers were not deprived of their rights. In addition, we would want to make sure that those employers were not acting anti-competitively. I am sure that the hon. Member for Daventry would expect that. Consultation might not serve a purpose in those circumstances, especially if we consulted precisely those employers who sought to evade their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I may have interrupted the Under-Secretary before she came to it, but she might like to comment on retrospection.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> One cannot envisage wanting to use regulations retrospectively.
<P>
On the wording of the amendment, the hon. Member for Daventry has used the term ``both sides of industry'', but I like the expression ``all parts of industry''. If the hon. Gentleman had thought about the amendment, he could have approached it in that way. I accept that the hon. Gentleman would want to include such a phrase. I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman. I promise, therefore, that, unlike the character in ``The Mikado'', I do not have a little list. The clause is drafted for the unforeseen.
<P>
Amendment No. 241 offers nothing new; if anything, it is a reworking or restatement of the clause. The clause is already drafted precisely to catch persons who would not otherwise be workers by virtue of their existing working relationships.
<P>
There was some discussion about the nature of arbitrary powers--I believe that the hon. Member for Buckingham used that expression. Of course, all powers that the Secretary of State exercises are challengeable through judicial review. Such challenges would succeed if powers were exercised unreasonably. That approach is in everything that we do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I heard what the Under-Secretary said, but does she accept that nothing in the Bill makes it clear that the intention of the clause is to deal with an unforeseen loophole that would offend against the Bill's original principle? My understanding is that the clause could be used to include a group that is expressly excluded elsewhere in the Bill.

Clause 38 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 40</center></H4>
<H4><center>Share fisherman</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This clause does not appear to be particularly contentious. It was thanks to The Guardian's contribution to open government that we learned that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had indented for exemption for share fishermen. There are helpful resonances with other employment legislation, where share fishermen are also treated as exempt, which is referred to in the notes on clauses.
<P>
When, however, one subjects any clause of the Bill to detailed consideration, it undergoes a process of deconstruction. While I would not cast myself in the role of Derrida, I will draw the Committee's attention to three points. The first relates to the absence for share fishermen of any fixed wage or salary. That is not unprecedented and of no application in other cases. It is perfectly possible to conceive of a situation on dry land where there is no arrangement for a wage. The clause will create an anomaly between those who are at sea and those who are not.
<P>
Another point relates to the comments made about piece work by the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), who has knowledge of the textiles industry. Using a loose analogy, it is possible to imagine a situation where there is a piece work structure--payment by result or, in the case of share fishermen, by catch--and yet a good employer might want to provide a low hourly rate to fishermen as a fall-back arrangement. As I read the clause, it would be impossible to do that. The clause limits the potential flexibility of remuneration and the ability to introduce good, balanced packages. If any element of pay or remuneration other than the share of the catch were introduced, the fishermen would be disqualified from the exemption set out here. I hope that the Minister will comment on that.
<P>
The notes on clauses argue that the remuneration would not be clear because the fishing expedition might be of indeterminate duration and it certainly could not be worked out until the catch was home and had been sold. That argument is not strong because that situation could arise in other industries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Ministers have expressly taken the power in the Bill to allocate or attribute subsequent pay to given pay reference periods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is precisely the point. It would not be impossible for the Government to take that power here. It might not suit them to do it, and it is probably right that they do not, but they should not argue in the notes on clauses that this breaks new and different ground, which they are not prepared to break in relation to difficulties in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
Finally, although this may not apply to British-registered ships--the clause is silent on the matter, because it is hardly likely to apply to foreign-registered ships--there seems to be no way for the legislation to a situation on a British-registered ship on which there are two brothers--leaving aside the question of joint or dual nationality--one of whom has, say, Irish citizenship and the other has British citizenship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Bring back Pedro.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I pass over the Minister's barracking. We could easily find that one brother was liable to the national minimum wage and the other was not, according to the interpretation of their several countries. Will Ministers consider--and perhaps report to the Committee by letter--whether any other European countries have found a way through and extend the national minimum wage to their share fishermen.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to add a word or two. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is right to say that we run the risk--not that it would be wrong to exclude share fishermen by this clause--that this may not be the only circumstance in which workers are paid not by fixed wages or salaries but wholly by commission. One thinks of those who work in estate agency, for example, who are perhaps paid wholly by commission on sales. That is their catch in that industry.
<P>
By way of further chastising Ministers, I note that in paragraph 73 of their evidence to the Low Pay Commission, the Government ask the commission to consider exclusions and, with reference to share fishermen, say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For tax and National Insurance purposes, share fishing is considered to be self-employment. The Government's view is that share fishermen should similarly be classified as self-employed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for national minimum wage purposes. I have searched without success for any point in the Government's evidence where they illustrate by reference to given factors the criteria for a definition of self-employment for the purposes of the national minimum wage which is different from its definition for tax and national insurance purposes.
<P>
Here is another example of the Government resting on a tax and national insurance definition of self-employment in order to justify the exclusion of share fishermen from the national minimum wage. The Government choose to have it this way only when it suits them.
<P>
<B>Ms Candy Atherton </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): I shall be brief. As perhaps the only member of the Committee representing share fisherman, it would be incorrect of me not to bring to the Committee the feelings of the fishermen whom I represent. They welcome the fact that the Government have recognised their special, if not unique, role. I want to make it clear that we are not talking about people who buy and sell wares, but of fishermen who go out to sea and may not come back with anything to share--indeed, that is all too often the case in the Falmouth and Penryn area. The fishermen are grateful that the Government recognise the uniqueness of their industry. They say, ``Thank goodness the Government are not imposing on our industry as so many previous Governments have done in the past.''
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As a Roche--or roach--I am happy to commend the clause. That was a bad joke; I know that it is only just past 6 pm. It might have been a better joke if it were just past 6 am, but perhaps those days are behind us. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We must hear the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister is floundering.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee should hear the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall end by saying that at my brother and sister-in-law's wedding, at which there was a best man and I was the best woman, I presented my sister-in-law with a little book on fishing entitled, ``How to Catch a Roach''. That is my last word on the subject.
<P>
The reason for this exclusion is because of the way in which share fisherman operate, not because they work in a particular sector. My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton) has quite rightly spoken about the unique nature of the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Roche:</B> Please let me make my point. When share fishermen divide up the catch, they obviously depend on the total size of the catch. That is not in the power of any employer to determine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Just so that we can establish the practical relevance of this exemption, has the hon. Lady made any assessment of the average earnings of share fishermen in the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I have not, but if the hon. Gentleman would find that useful he can, if he is so minded, look it up. We are talking about the actual industry. As I was saying, the size of the catch is not in the power of any employer to determine. In any event, it would be unworkable, because who would a share fisherman bring a claim against if the value of his share were below the national minimum wage? The clause excludes share fishermen from the application of the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne quite rightly said, it shows that the Government have been listening to the industry. I am glad that my hon. Friend has been able to bring her knowledge of the industry to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In the spirit of our previous exchanges, I was going to suggest that perhaps a share fisherman would bring his claim against the same person that a minister of religion in the Church of England would bring his claim if his wages fell below the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> You will be glad to know, Mr. Atkinson, that I will not be tempted to get involved in a theological discussion of this kind.
<P>
Share fishermen who divide up the proceeds from the catch in that way are technically workers, although in effect they act as self-employed. I do not want to reopen our last discussion. As I said earlier, there are a variety of different tests. This is not something new; the way in which people are regarded has been covered in legislation and in case law for some time.
<P>
The clause removes any doubt as to whether the Bill applies to share fishermen. Indeed, there are precedents in other items of employment law, enacted by previous Conservative Administrations, exempting them from the legislation. We are following precedent and practice in regarding share fishermen as self-employed.
<P>
I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Daventry said about different treatment on land and sea. It was ingenious, but I do not think that I can accept the premise on which he based his argument.
<P>
I am sure that this is a clause on which all members of the Committee can agree, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
No. 218, in page 25, line 43, after `trust', insert or trading enterprise'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> As members of the Committee will note, the amendments concern the status and description of volunteers. It is worth remembering that several thousand people give their time free, often for up to a year at a time, working in the voluntary sector. These are probing amendments which are intended to deal with the anxiety that is felt by some volunteers that they may be unable to continue to invest their time in the community if the clause is not amended; especially to extend the definition of volunteers and to make proper provision for them to receive adequate expenses to allow them to continue volunteering.
<P>
There is undoubtedly general agreement that the Bill should exclude voluntary workers from the minimium wage. It is important to protect the distinctive contribution that volunteers make to the economy by giving their time free, without expecting financial reward. They provide what can be nicely described as a gift relationship to charitable and voluntary organisations. That contribution is important for the economy, as it is for people who wish to volunteer. I do not want the Bill to prejudice that ambition.
<P>
The Bill refers to people who are employed as voluntary workers. The Minister and their colleagues may be aware that that has caused a certain frisson among people in the voluntary sector, who feel that voluntary workers are not employed, and that ``employed'' is an ill-chosen word to describe what they do. They are not employees, and they do not enter into contracts of employment. They are not and do not wish to be protected by legislation that concerns contracts and employment law.
<P>
A feeling exists that a better definition of volunteers could easily be found by turning to a Government report, entitled ``Make a Difference'', which most people would accept provides a good and commonly agreed set of terms to describe a volunteer. I wish to probe the Minister as to whether the description of volunteers can be made clear.
<P>
There is also a feeling that the Bill's definition could well be too prescriptive regarding expenses. It may not allow for volunteers who receive regular, weekly subsistence allowances because they are working full time, away from home. Such allowances are, for those people, an important part of meeting the costs that they inevitably and necessarily incur. I am thinking especially of volunteers who give their time to Community Service Volunteers, which, as we all know, undertakes projects throughout Britain.
<P>
Anxiety exists about whether the clause conflicts with statutory instruments that form part of council tax legislation, in relation to allowing for a wider definition of expenses for volunteers. That is an important point, which should be addressed.
<P>
Many volunteers work for an honorarium, or for a low wage by agreement. Many people in Britain sadly find themselves in early retirement, but are nevertheless more than happy, and are often keen and eager, to work in the voluntary sector for a charity or for another organisation that provides care and support services in their community. Many of them cannot afford to give their time freely. They may have a reduced pension because they retired early, and need some money to top up their income to ensure that they can continue to enjoy a reasonable standard of living.
<P>
They choose therefore to offer their services at a low wage, which may well be--I am sure that it is--lower than the rate at which the national minimum wage will eventually be set. Such people provide a great deal of expertise, experience, responsibility and reliability, and require a reduced level of income to help them make ends meet. I am anxious that they could be prevented from giving their services because the small honorarium that they receive would bring them under the umbrella of the national minimum wage. That would help neither those people nor the organisations wanting to employ them, which might not be able to afford to continue with their services.
<P>
In recent years, charitable organisations have become significant providers of services in the care sector and they do a great deal of work for elderly and vulnerable people. It is common for such organisations to enter into contracts with local authority social services departments, with hospital trusts or with community services.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Age Concern, for example, has about 120 separate organisations providing services to older people. Some of those organisations have an annual turnover of more than &#163;1 million. By way of contrast, in my Eastleigh constituency the community services organisation employs community service officers alongside volunteers. Those volunteers contract to provide advocacy services to explain carers' rights, among other things.
<P>
So there is at present in the caring services a mixture of volunteers, paid officers and those willing to work, sometimes full time, for the small amount of money that helps make ends meet. Over the past decade or so, a contract culture using paid volunteers has arisen for the provision of caring services. There will be cost implications for charitable organisations if those paid volunteers fall within the scope of the national minimum wage.
<P>
The contract culture is to be promoted and encouraged. The tradition of volunteers popping in for a few hours a week to help out is laudable and admirable, but it is different from the use of paid volunteers. Those people receive an income and, it is to be hoped, thereby take on a commitment to achieve the goals that their organisations are obliged under contract to deliver.
<P>
To achieve the necessary cultural shift, voluntary organisations look to paid volunteers to provide a backbone behind their full-time staff. Those volunteers must evince the sense of responsibility that paid employment requires. The Government's commitment to the national minimum wage has to be matched by a commitment to fund the extra costs of services purchased at local level to prevent a reduction in the volume of services provided under those contracts. Alternatively, and more worryingly, that volume will be maintained at the contract prices, despite the extra cost that the providers incur. That could lead to the demise of those providers--a highly regrettable outcome.
<P>
The final amendments in the group deal with the definition of a charitable organisation. There is a significant hole in the net that the Government want to cast around such organisations--it omits those trading enterprises established for charitable purposes.
<P>
The Committee will know that nearly every large charitable organisation in this country now operates a trading concern, a trading enterprise or a limited company. Age Concern, Oxfam and Save the Children have all established--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> For the purposes of clarification, could that mean a charity shop?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been listening intently and has pre-empted my next remark. He is on the right track.
<P>
It is now commonplace for national charities to have established a separate trading enterprise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Again for clarification, does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is normal practice for the profits of such companies to be covenanted to the charity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am amazed by the perception of members of the official Opposition. Again, my contribution has been pre-empted. Similarity between amendments has perhaps led to those points being drawn out so quickly.
<P>
I am worried about trading enterprises operating counter to charitable organisations. The essence of the point is that trading enterprises are covenanted to pay profits into the charity which spawned them. They run charity shops and supply products such as Christmas cards, but they also supply financial services. A range of activities is properly undertaken, but trading operations are distinct and separate from the normal pursuits of a charity.
<P>
The Bill does not make clear how volunteers, paid volunteers and staff will be treated. Perhaps the matter has not been addressed. There appears to be no specific mention of trading enterprises associated with charitable organisations or trusts. The key question is, who is entitled to be paid the national minimum wage? I seek clarification from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). I have never thought that the world is fair, but last week before--time flies when we are enjoying ourselves--I referred to the exclusion of low-paid charity workers. I did not have the foresight to use the term ``honorarium'', which seems to have done the trick, and drew torrents of abuse and vilification from Labour Members. The hon. Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) was uncharacteristically silent during the hon. Gentleman's speech. Perhaps the term has some superficial appeal which my speech in favour of excluding charity workers did not have.
<P>
Amendment No. 242 takes us back to a now-familiar theme. The amendment would exclude those in receipt of only nominal payments, perhaps something akin to an honorarium.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Has my hon. Friend noticed that in paragraph 74 of the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission, the Government raise the issue of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the point at which the payment of expenses or an honorarium shades into being a wage''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government are contemplating exactly the point that my hon. Friend is making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend; he anticipates one of the points that I intended to make. Once again, the Bill may conflict with Inland Revenue practice and lead to confusion and what will be perceived as unfairness. In tax legislation the payment of expenses is a clear, precise term. The hon. Member for Eastleigh raised the question of when small payments such as honorariums would not be considered expenses. The Bill is clear on that point. It refers, in the case of a voluntary worker, to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``expenses actually incurred in the performance of his duties, or . . . expenses reasonably estimated as likely to be . . . incurred''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman care to develop that theme and tell the Committee how he feels subsistence should be dealt with in the Bill? Does he think that people who are away from home and necessarily involving themselves in living costs for food and so on should be covered by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that thought. If he casts his mind back to what we said about defining what is and what is not included in the minimum wage, he will remember that there is a simple way to deal with such matters--one takes the Inland Revenue's definitions. I will not rehearse that argument again. The Inland Revenue has a clear understanding of what is reasonable subsistence in given circumstances.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh has attempted to blur the lines on the issue by talking about expenses over and above those actually incurred and about honorariums. Let us call a spade a spade: we are discussing a situation where people, for the best of reasons, decide to work through mixed motivation, partly because they would like to earn pocket money--if I may call it that--and partly because they believe that the cause they are working for is good.
<P>
There are many decent people, including, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh said, those who have taken early retirement, who are willing to work for relatively low wages for a charitable organisation. They believe that the work they are doing is beneficial to the community and they will work for a wage that they would not accept if their employer were a commerical organisation seeking to make a profit from their efforts. It is precisely because nobody is seeking to make a profit from their efforts that they are willing to work for relatively low wages.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Before my hon. Friend moves too far from the subject of expenses, I can, having worked as a journalist for 15 years, assure him that the idea that there is a simple definition of expenses is far from the truth, and the Inland Revenue knows that. In almost all circumstances in which expenses are paid, there is the possibility of a shading, as the Government evidence puts it, into straightforward pay. Many people will know roughly what their expenses level will be and will calculate it as part of their pay package. If the Government, as they appear to, think that there is a hard and fast line to be drawn between expenses and pay, they are sadly misled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I would hope, in the spirit of puritanism, that the expenses for which charity workers hope to be reimbursed would not match the generous receipts that journalists are wont to expect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that such expenses are unlikely to be on a par with those that Ministers incur when, for example, they are undertaking official engagements or travelling abroad?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We will not pursue that line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I shall save that for the Smoking Room, after dinner [Interruption.] Members on the Governement Back Benches are welcome to join us for a debate on that subject if they wish.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh has put his point in slightly different terms from me, but it is clear that this is not simply a Conservative move to condone low pay among people who work for charities. I hope that Ministers will begin to understand that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that, in response to a debate on an amendment to clause 4, the Minister of State said that he would reflect on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge when we reached clause 41. Subsequently, my hon. Friend withdrew the amendment because the Minister offered a glimmer of hope--the evidence that was to be presented to the Low Pay Commission, which we had not seen at that point, and the response that he would make later.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend's intervention is a timely prompt to the Minister of State if that point is not covered in his brief, although I am certain that it is. We look forward to his comments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh asked when an amount that was paid to a voluntary worker or charity worker rendered that person eligible for the minimum wage. It is clear from the Bill that any amount of remuneration would cause such a person to be included under the terms of the minimum wage.
<P>
Amendment No. 242 fits comfortably with those of my hon. Friends and of the Liberal Democrats. I sought to draw it narrowly and it refers specifically to part-timers and people who work for charities. I am anxious not to let us be sidetracked into dealing with someone who works for a charity 60 hours a week for a low pay and who is desperately trying to earn a living. I am thinking of somebody who gives a few hours of his time for a worthy and worthwhile cause and who seeks to earn a little money and to benefit a charity at the same time. I hope that the Minister will take on board the feeling that Opposition parties have expressed and that he will give us cause for hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I will not delay the Minister too long. I want to refer to amendment No. 202, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). The amendment is consistent with other amendments, including amendment No. 217, which is in the name of the hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter).
<P>
The amendments were tabled to reflect the debate on clause 4. In the debate on amendments Nos. 28 and 30 to clause 4, the point was made that the voluntary and charitable sector did not wish to be excluded wholesale, but would be perfectly happy to be treated like any other sector. Many examples were given of persons who worked for voluntary or charitable organisations in an employed or voluntary capacity and who did not wish to be paid at the level of the national minimum wage. The purpose of this amendment--and, I hope, of amendment No. 217, which is an alternative mechanism to achieve a similar end--is to allow an organisation, and particularly such people to achieve that outcome.
<P>
Being excluded from the national minimum wage may be a detriment, but it does not occur unless a person expressly elects for that to be the case. That clearly offers the possibility of flexibility, rather than rigidity in the Bill. That is to be wished for given the many instances that we sampled earlier of people who wished to support a charity or voluntary organisation by working for a relatively low wage, even if that does not fall within the definition of an honorarium or a nominal payment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We are all waiting for the Minister's response to a constructive debate. I just want to record that I have much sympathy with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Eastleigh and by Conservative Back-Bench Members. We are all feeling our way in an area that we accept is complex and difficult.
<P>
The only points that I would add to the discussion are, first, that page 21 of the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission refers to the cost of doing nothing for charitable services, which is a matter of particular concern. It is also the subject of more general concern in regard to the national minimum wage, but we will not pursue that now.
<P>
Secondly, there is the potential for job substitution, which my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire flagged up--the Government have specifically rehearsed some of the problems--and concerns about volunteers being put in. I would add my concern about possible patterns of employment or means by which to get round that. There might, for example, be some suggestion--my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made it in the context of clause 4--of people wanting to covenant to the charity back to back, as it were, on their wages. I am not sure that that is a tidy way of doing it or what attitude the Revenue would take.
<P>
Another possibility, which is enshrined in concerns on which the Government's evidence touches briefly, is that people might start varying their hours accordingly and saying, ``I am working for this organisation for 30 hours a week. For 10 of those hours, I shall expect to be paid the national minimum wage and for the other 20, I shall be a volunteer''. That may or may not relate to reality.
<P>
I come to a matter on which all Opposition Members are united and, to be fair, with which there has been some sympathy on the Labour Benches. It is often the case--it has been for me personally--that when one wants to do something for a charity, it is better to be employed at a low rate by free choice in order to avail oneself of the legal protection of being an employee, and for good order. One is then on the payroll and subject to the professional responsibilities that are more likely to accrue to one who is employed than to one who is not. It is always possible for a volunteer to show himself the door, but it is sometimes better for someone to be employed and therefore to be in a healthier relationship.
<P>
Our view, as enshrined in one of the amendments, is that there should be some sensitivity as to the tests and any potential pressure on an individual. No one is advocating duress, where the head of the charitable organisation--whether or not it includes training activities, as I think it should--stands over an individual and says, ``Now sign here, please''. If individuals want to exempt themselves, we need to see a clear certificate that they do so freely and without duress.
<P>
It is a complex and often sensitive situation. People want to help the public interest and to do so in a way that is appropriate for their income, their time, their inclinations and their talents, as well as their will to give voluntarily or to diminish their salary in order to reflect the worth of the purposes for which they are engaged. I hope that the Minister will find a way through the issue which relects our concerns and the complexity of the situation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> This debate mirrors the debate that we had on clause 4. The latter, despite what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said about my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith), was, in the main, consensual with regard to what we believed to be true of volunteering.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon rightly highlighted the fact that the charitable sector did not want to be excluded from the national minium wage or to exclude its employees from good employment practice. It wants to ensure that there is a clear definition of the difference between volunteering and being in paid employment. That point was made during our previous debate and it applies now. I gave the hon. Gentleman a genuine commitment that when we came to this clause, I would try to take into account what was said. To be frank, we have got ahead of the Government in coming to conclusions about the matter; it is not an easy subject because charities, by their nature, are diverse. Some large charities have a substantial paid work force, which is responsible for the management of volunteers. Some charities have one person, who is paid an honorarium or expenses, who is responsible for the management of the volunteers. Some local charities are run exclusively by volunteers and want to remain so.
<P>
Even when there is a consensus, there may still be reasonable doubt about the mechanics of the proposal, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and the hon. Member for Eastleigh said. It is important that the Government reflect on that and that we ensure that our proposals take account of the complexities of the issue, which is a reasonable thing to do. Giving evidence to the Low Pay Commission will give the charities a genuine inroad into the debate, and ensure that when the Government have dealt with the matter, the Low Pay Commission will give due weight to the voluntary and charitable sectors in its consideration of organisations that employ volunteers. It has been extremely helpful to include these issues in the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister, who is making a sensitive speech. As no one else has done so, I want to flag up my view that hon. Members have a personal interest in the clause, because a political party is a voluntary organisation. People who work for political parties may go through the same thought processes as those who work for a formal charity.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Indeed, it is true to say that most political parties are run by volunteers, and politicians reap the benefit. We are all going through changes in this respect; some volunteers quite rightly want to have more say about the result of their voluntary efforts. I do not want to enter into hon. Gentleman's private grief, but the point is well made.
<P>
It is important to have a consensus that we will not allow people to reclassify genuine workers as volunteers or reclassify their wages as a nominal payment. That is not what the Government, or the Opposition want. We do not want a nominal payment to become a poverty-level wage which is then legally below the national minimum wage. That is why the clause refers to expenses actually incurred or reasonably estimated to have been incurred. We must be sure that we are not creating a loophole if we amend the clause to cover people receiving any other kind of payment. Amendment No. 242, for example, would create exactly the loophole that we want to avoid.
<P>
It is important to draw a distinction between volunteers who might be paid their actual or estimated expenses and workers who are paid a salary. Those are not just the Government's views; the National Council for Vountary Organisations submitted proposals to the Low Pay Commission that made it absolutely clear that it is important to separate the sector and to make a clear distinction between volunteering and paid work. The NCVO argued that a half-way house between paying volunteers expenses and paying a salary to their employees is considered bad practice; it implies that a volunteer is, in effect, a low-paid worker. It is critical that we get the measure right.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh raised other examples of trading enterprises and shops, and at a previous sitting, I cited the example of fund-raising schemes. This is not a difficult issue; my local Age Concern shop is run and managed by a paid employee who has a rage of responsibilities, which include the good management of the shop, employing volunteers and ensuring that they run the shop professionally and effectively. That is not difficult. Charity shops have done that for a long time. They have moved from being charity shops in the narrowest sense to becoming enterprises that provide goods and services to the local community. They have ensured that that expansion has occurred through full-time paid employers managing volunteers effectively.
<P>
However, the provision should not catch genuine volunteers.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister deal with the more difficult case that I cited earlier of a charity that runs a hostel and pays someone &#163;30 or &#163;40 a night to be in charge? The payments might fall below the minimum wage because of the number of hours involved. I could provide examples. In such circumstances the lower hourly rate might be appropriate for a charity worker.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I should like to hear examples of hostels with care responsibilities for physically or mentally disabled people, the elderly, the homeless or people who suffer from alcohol or drug abuse that are managed solely by volunteers. Volunteers are legally required to be supported by skilled, dedicated management systems and individuals. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge makes the same point as me: there is nothing wrong with people volunteering to help in such institutions.
<P>
In the hospice movement, which is close to my heart, volunteers are involved in all aspects of caring alongside skilled and dedicated staff, such as nurses, care workers and social workers, who are remunerated as employees. But the hospice movement could not function without the effective involvement of volunteers. That is well understood. However, in the light of the commitment that I made to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge in our earlier discussions on clause 4, I am prepared to consider tabling an amendment to clause 41 on Report. Again, I hesitate to look at officials, but it is important to get the clause right. When I have the draft of an amendment, I shall be happy to discuss it with the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Eastleigh. We may not be able to agree on some issues, but I am prepared to involve the hon. Gentlemen, because we share the common purpose of trying to ensure that genuine volunteers are not caught by minimum wage legislation. The Government did not intend them to be caught by the Bill. In the light of my undertaking, I hope that the hon. Member for Eastleigh will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's positive and sensitive response to the amendments. They were tabled for the best of reasons, to try to discover how volunteers would be both protected and unconstrained by the Bill. I am grateful for the Minister's offer to table a further amendment.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will deal with two key issues when he considers his amendment. First, it is important that those volunteers who wish to work for an honorarium should not be denied that opportunity. It is also important to protect people from coercion into low pay.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister should consider justifiable subsistence payments for those who volunteer for projects that are away from their homes. Why should volunteers who work away from home and need a subsistence payment be treated any differently from an employee who has to work away from home and is paid a separate rate for subsistence. Having made those two points, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 41 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
