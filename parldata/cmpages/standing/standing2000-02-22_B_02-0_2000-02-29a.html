<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. The Committee has wisdom and sagacity in great measure, given that you and Mr. Maxton are its co-Chairmen.
<P>
Clause 1 establishes the Postal Services Commission, which will be the independent regulator for postal services, and does so in a way suggested by the review of the water and gas utilities. Instead of personalising matters, perhaps unfairly, by placing the duties of the regulator on one individual, we shall introduce a group of people as a corporate body.
<P>
Subsection (2) provides that the functions of the commission should be performed on behalf of the Crown. The commission will be a non-ministerial Government Department. Subsection (3) gives effect to schedule 1, which makes further provisions in relation to the commission. Subsection (4) abolishes the existing Postal Services Commission, because we are setting up a commission that will operate from 1 April in an advisory role. The legislation enables us to put the Postal Services Commission on a statutory basis. There will be a seamless transfer from the current commission to the new commission that will be established under the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I reiterate the Minister's welcome to you, Mr. Butterfill; we look forward to your presiding over our proceedings. You may have read the fulsome remarks made to Mr. Maxton in the transcript of the Committee's first sitting. They are reciprocated in full and equal measure to youself. I would not like you to fee that there is any bias between you, except that I am more respectful to the Chairman in front of me than the one who has just left. When Mr. Maxton returns, I shall be equally obsequious to him.

<P>
It is appropriate that we are in Room 9, because members of the Committee who looked at the wall outside would have seen a large portrait of Sir Rowland Hill, the originator of the penny post. It was painted by John Vinter, apparently in the year of Sir Rowland Hill's death in 1879. I hope that that does not suggest anything disastrous about the Bill. Perhaps it would be better if the portrait were hung on the wall behind you, Mr. Butterfill, so that hon. Members could gain inspiration from the innovation, which has been of immense benefit over the years, that its subject brought to this country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): Long may the tradition continue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, long may the tradition of universal service be continued--within sensible limits and measures. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.'']

<P>
We propose several amendments to schedule 1 that underpin our concerns about the establishment of the regulator. When my hon. Friend the Member of Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) kicked off proceedings for the Opposition, he said that we supported the Bill and thought that it was advantageous, but felt that it did not go far enough. We want the Bill to go through with the minimum of disruption. However, we made it clear that the Bill has appeared in Committee weeks, if not months, too early. It has not been prepared well; some aspects are still to be decided, and I may mention those as we proceed.

<P>
Clause 1 sets up the regulator, and the purpose of our first clutch of amendments is to check whether he will be independent or a creature of the Secretary of State. Will the Secretary of State be a puppet master, who pulls the strings behind the scenes? The same question will apply when we reach the schedules and discuss whether the son or daughter of the Post Office Users National Council will be independent. Complaints have already reached me that the successor to Post Office Users National Council will have too much authority at the centre--

<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is aware that there was something of a tour d'horizon during the debate on the sittings motion, so I hope that he will now address his remarks more specifically to clause 1 stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Butterfill. Obviously, I was not obsequious enough in my earlier remarks, but I will certainly do as you have asked.

<P>
We are worried about clause 1 in relation to the regulator's independence, which we will discuss in more detail under clause 2. Will the regulator be fully independent? the explanatory notes say that

<P>
this body will be the independent regulator of licensed postal operatives and replaces the advisory body.
That is fine, but the Government's record of up-front devolution following behind-the-scenes manoeuvring and control is not a happy one. I have only to refer to what has been happening in relation to the Mayor of London. You may say, Mr Butterfill, that that is not strictly in order. However, we are worried that the regulator will not be independent and able to make his own decisions without the Secretary of State telling him what to do. What happened with the First Secretary of the National Assembly for Wales was another example of behind-the-scenes control.

<P>
We have been provided with draft statutory social and environmental guidance to the Postal Services Commission--that will come up later, so I hope that you will not rule me out of order, Mr. Butterfill. The Bill is intended to set up a commission the controls and remit of which we will supposedly have approved. However, we have only the draft social and environmental guidance before us, so how can we go ahead confidently with the debate before we know what will be in the regulator's remit? To what extent will the regulator be able to control the format of the accounts of the Post Office? To what extent will he be able to insist that the £1 limit for the reserved area is reduced to 50p? The Secretary of State announced on 8 July 1999 that it would change from £1 to 50p, and the regulator will operate in that area. Howver, that was immediately overturned at the party conference because the unions objected, and now it is back up to £1.

<P>
How independent will the regulator be? In this political world of spin rather than substance, we hope for some direct answers from the Minister about whether the regulator will be able to make his own decisions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): Another disconcerting example of political interference in institutions that should be independent is provided by the case of the former Director General of Fair Trading, John Bridgeman. It is clear that he has been eased out because he has not followed the diktats of his political masters. It is disconcerting that officials or regulators who are supposedly independent can be directly or indirectly politically accountable. If they do not carry out political instructions, they lose their jobs--as evidenced by John Bridgeman's resignation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend makes the point that we want a clear commitment from the Minister that the regulator will be independent. I would like the Minister to say up front whether the regulator will have as much power as the Oftel regulator had when BT was first liberalised. Are those two regulators comparable? I do not want to pre-empt discussion on the schedule, but it makes we wonder whether the regulator will be his own man. In the nationalised industries, we had the lunchtime directive. It was a well-kown phenomenon, particularly when by-elections or items of political sensitivity were pending. The chairmen of the nationalised industries were given that type of direction. We want to know whether the regulator is a substitute for that subtle form of central control. Will the regulator be pulled into line and told what he should do by the Secretary of State?

<P>
I have mentioned out concerns about having to consider the draft statutory social and environmental guidance. We will examine that further then we discuss other clauses.

<P>
The independence of the regulator will be essential to the success of the Post Office. There are fundamental philosophical differences in the Committee. My party believes that the people in charge of the Post Office known how to run it best--they know how to make better profits and how to satisfy their customers more--and that is better than the command and central control that is endemic in the Labour party. That is why we want to ensure that the regulator is free and is not held to the command and control that is so beloved of the Government. I would welcome the Minister's response to those few basic points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I, too, welcome you with due respect, Mr. Butterfill. I hope that you do not expect too much obsequiousness from me, but I will certainly ask for your help. I have served on several Committees, but I am still on a learning curve, so I would be grateful for your guidance.

<P>
First, I must take issue with the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) for saying that the Bill has been introduced too early. Although we are concerned that there may be several amendments at a late stage, I disagree strongly that the Bill has come too early. The public and politicians have been waiting since 1992, when the previous Government started discussing the Post Office. They daylay has caused much uncertainty and disquiet. In 1992, eight years ago, when privatisation was discussed, the matter caused disagreement within the previous Government. The Bill is far from being too early; it is about time that it was introduced. In the intervening period, largely as a result of the previous Government's inaction, the Post Office has lost a lot of ground in competing with other postal service providers. I welcome the Bill, but we shall examine it closely.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I agree with everything that the hon. Genteleman said. My complaint is that, although I would have liked the Bill to have been introduced years earlier, it will be beneficial for the Post Office as a whole only if it gives the Post Office the best opportunity of succeeding in an increasingly competitive world. The format of the Bill is not the most beneficial possible.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification.

<P>
I should like a small amendment to be made to the list of people who are members of the Committee. Next to my name, the list says ``Western'', rather than ``Weston''--

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I believe that the list has been amended.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am delighted to stand corrected. I have not seen the latest version. I hope that the s in ``super'' is small, rather than large. That is a small point, but it is important to the burghers of Weston-super-Mare.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I regret that that has not been corrected.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> We welcome the fact that the Government have at last grasped the nettle of the Post Office, but my hon. Friends will carefully examine the Bill to ensure that it will be effective. The Government have made some wide and hopeful commitments in relation to the regulator. The achievement of all their stated aims will help meet many people's anxieties about the future of the services that the Post Office provides. The regulator seems to be assuming responsibility for many issues, including social inclusion and old age penioners. We want to ensure that the regulator will be efficient, or effective, in exercising that responsibility. As he seems to be assuming responsibility for an extraordinary number of issues, we need to examine his role carefully. Some time ago, the Trade and Industry Select Committee expressed anxiety about the chief executive of the Post Office projects. We would hate to discover that two elements of regulation are involved. The way in which the regulator and what is now called the Post Office Users National Council, which will become the Consumer Council for Postal Services, will relate to each other is important.

<P>
We want to strengthen the Bill and to ensure that it will achieve its aims. Now that the Post Office is on its launch pad, we cannot afford to prevent it from taking advantage of the many opportunities available in the wider world.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I echo the paeans of praise that have been heaped on you this morning, Mr. Butterfill, and welcome you to the Chair. May you remain for ever a Chairman, and never a Chair, to preserve the dignity of your position.

<P>
The clause is essentially the launch pad of the Bill. It is a catch-all clause within which lies the blank cheque of schedule 1; our attention will be focused on the schedule because it outlines the flexibility and the extent of ministerial authority. The clause leads to that schedule; it remains to be seen whether that is a move in the right direction but because the detail of the Bill lies elsewhere, we will not seek to divide the Committee on the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire devoted our proceedings to Sir Rowland Hill, whose portrait hangs in Committee Corridor. He published his pamphlet on the reform of the Post Office in 1837, before he was involved in the postal service. The Post Office opposed his proposals and he eventually exerted influence on it by getting a job in the Treasury--perhaps not much has changed in 160 years. The clause and the role of the regulator, which I shall address in a moment, enshrine what is called the Rowland Hill principle--a universal service, from no matter how remote a part of the country, at a uniform tariff. Sir Rowland Hill actually opposed that principle, but that is another story.

<P>
The reference to Sir Rowland Hill was virtually the only relevant comment that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire made. I agree with the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare--I am glad that, appropriately for the Committee, he corrected his postal address--that is incredible that anyone can say that the proposals have come too late. Not only has the Post Office been under review since 1992, but in their 1992 manifesto, the Conservatives said that they would introduce an independant regulator into a publicly-owned Post Office. That commitment was never met, so the clause is eight years behind in that regard.

<P>
One question was whether the regulator would be independent; the answer is yes. Another question was whether the commission would mirror the independence of Oftel; the answer to that is also yes, although there is a difference in that Oftel regulates the whole of the industry, as do the other utility regulators. The Bill provides that the regulator will regulate the reserved area and the universal service obligation--the Rowland Hill principle. We will not regulate all the 4,000 postal companies that happily exist outside the reserved area and we do not intend to introduce regulation across the board.

<P>
The purpose of the regulator within the licensing regime is very different from that of other regulators. The Government will appoint the commission and will issue social and environmental guidance--I emphasise that it is guidance rather than instructions--to the regulator, because it is right that we should do so for a service that runs post buses and that delivers letters from children to Santa Claus without charge. It is a business that does many commercially unviable things that we and the public want to preserve, which is why we are issuing such guidance. Some reserved powers are given to the Secretary of State, but they are very limited. We will perhaps talk about those when we debate the amendments.

<P>
The principle behind the regulatory regime for postal services is in line with that for economic regulation in general and for private utilities in particular. Opposition Members did not draw attention to any inconsistency with existing statute in other regulated areas. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire referred for the second time--I remember his reference to it on Second Reading--to something called the lunchtime directive. We should perhaps consider our employment law policies and introduce such a directive. I am not aware that one exists or that anyone running for the office of Mayor of London is also applying to be the regulator, so I did not follow the logic of that argument. I assure the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members that we want to introduce a regulator who can independently regulate the reserved area and the universal service obligation and I advise them that it is high time that we introduced regulation.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Postal Services Commission</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 57, line 6, at end of insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultations with the Trade and Industry Select Committe of the House of Commons''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 42, in page 57, line 20, insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultations with the Trade and Industry Select Committee of the House of Commons''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr Duncan:</B> The amendments refer to schedule 1, which deals with membership, appointment terms and remuneration of members, and the terms and conditions of the Postal Services Commission. They refer specifically to the appointment of the chairman and of members of the commission, and their purpose is simply to improve the accountability and transparency of the regulatory system by ensuring that appointments of the commission are properly scrutinised and by restricting the size of its membership.

<P>
The Minister may ask whether there is any history to that argument. There certainly is--much of it from his side of the Committee. Paragraph 16 on page 23 of the July 1999 White Paper, ``Post Office Reform: A world class service for the 21st century'', states

<P>
there is a strong case for transparent regulation.
It is that very transparency that I seek to establish through these two simple amendments. They seek to add substance to the Government's claim that they want a more accountable system of regulation. The Opposition think that it makes perfect sense for the Secretary of State or his Ministers to consult the Trade and Industry Select Committee before key members of the regulatory authority are appointed. There is a precedent for that, which some may argue is a step forward for the transparency that the Minister claims to support. A similar process takes place with the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, in which people submit themselves to scrutiny by the Treasury Select Committee prior to their appointment.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments. If he is not prepared to do so, it will be interesting to know whether he will agree voluntarily to submit the names, and the people themselves, to the Trade and Industry Committee for consultation. His party has a track record of tabling and supporting amendments that embody such a principle. Labour Members tabled similar amendments during the passage of the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989. An amendment to the latter, for example, stated that:

<P>
The Secretary of State shall make the appointment of the Director
--that is, the director of Offer--

<P>
after consultation with the Select Committee on Energy and the consumers committees, who shall be given the opportunity to interview and question the appointee.
We have since seen a contradiction--not unprecedented in the lifetime of this Labour Government--in the Goverment's conduct of the Utilities Bill. They claim to support transparency and accountability in regulation, but are unwilling to extend that to the appointment of the chairman of the Postal Services Commission. A parallel amendment was moved in that Bill and was rejected by the Government.

<P>
We merely ask the Government to be consistent with the views that the Labour party purported to hold when it was in opposition and with the much-heralded claim now that it is in government. These simple, straightforward, commonsense amendments would require the Secretary of State to have the decency, courtesy and the straightforward transparency and openness to consult with a Select Committee system that is growing in significance and which plays a useful part in the democratic process, in the scrutiny of the Executive and increasingly in the formation of policy and, in some cases, the pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment; it would be a simple step forward and would make the Postal Services Commission work better and be more accountable and transparent to the House of Commons.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr Page:</B> There is little that I can add to what my hon. Friend has already said, except to extend it a little. The purpose of the amendment is to tease out of the Minister the basis of selection. From where will the methods of choice come? We want to be absolutely certain that the members of the regulator's panel are spread broadly throughout the industry and that the panel will not be packed with time-serving Labour supporters, even though they may be worthwhile ladies and gentlemen. How will the Minister ensure that a broad spectrum of the industry's views is reflected in the make-up of the Committee?

<P>
I have referred to the timing of the Bill. I wish that it had been introduced years ago. I am glad, however, that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare has now accepted that I am worried about the quality rather than the immediate timing. I hope that the Minister can expand on how the people will be chosen. He said that he knew nothing about the lunchtime directive method of control. I can only advise him to talk to heads of the nationalised steel industry, who can give him chapter and verse. We want to ensure that the regulator is a free spirit. I welcome what the Minister has said so far, but I have a niggling doubt that the Postal Services Commission will be less independent and act more like an executive agency than a regulatory body. That is my worry; if the hon. Gentleman can say that it will be a regulatory body, not an executive agency, the more comfort he will be giving to Opposition Members, to the industry and to the regulator.

<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> I join other members of the Committee in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton is bizarre. I assure the Committee that neither I nor my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) are necessarily looking for additional work for the Trade and Industry Committee. Some of us already find our work onerous, especially as four members of this Committee sometimes have to dart between here and the Select Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> No, I will not give way at the moment. Undoubtedly, the chairman of the Postal Services Commission will, from time to time, be invited before the Select Committee for us to scrutinise his or her activities and the overall performance of the commission. I would have real worries if a Select Committee had a firm hand in ascertaining who was or who was not suitable for a position. Is the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton advocating moving down the road of the American system of senate hearings before judges and goodness knows who else appointed to senior roles on behalf of Government?

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We are already well down that road. The Monetary Policy Committee has to go before the Treasury Committee for that purpose. Does the hon. Gentleman propose that the Select Committee's power to consider the Monetary Policy Committee's appointees should be removed to make his argument consistent across Departments?

<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> No, I do not. My understanding--it may be flawed, although I hope not--of the Treasury Committee is that its role is not dissimilar to the one that would apply to the Trade and Industry Committee. I thought that it scrutinised the activity of the Monetary Policy Committee, but I was not aware that it had a clear hand in saying who should be appointed to it.

<P>
I am not happy at the prospect of what the amendment would do, but I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B>  I bow to no one in my respect for the Trade and Industry Select Committee, of which I was a member for six happy months, but I think that the amendments are impractical and unnecessary. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton referred to some amendments that were proposed when Labour was in opposition. Indeed, some colleagues reminded me of them as I walked through the Lobby last night. It is important to remember that the then Government rightly rejected those amendments to the Bills on gas and other utilities. [
Interruption.] I think that I can hear hon. Members distancing themselves from the previous Government and airbrushing them out of history.

<P>
We do not believe that it would be appropriate to involve Select Committees directly in the appointment process. Ministers are responsible and accountable, and the first report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life expressed the view that such a clear line of accountability was the best way to ensure that the appointments were properly made, and that the right people with quality skills were appointed.

<P>
Let me remove the niggling doubt-- I am glad that it is only niggling--expressed by hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire about the independence of the regulatory body--the Postal Services Commission. In the previous debate, we made a point about the reduction of the reserved area from £1 to 50p and back to £1 when the regulatory system was not in place. It is only now being set up to commence on 1 April, and the regulator will be entirely responsible for setting the reserved area. The regulatory system is open and transparent. The commission will be required to publish an annual report, will need to consult on, publish and have regard to a code of practice governing the discharge of its function, and will also publish its forward programme under clause 50.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister says that the Secretary of State has to be accountable. We do not deny it, but how and to whom? The answer is that it will account to the House of Commons. It makes sense that he or those whom he wants to appoint should appear before the Trade and Industry Select Committee. The Minister's saying that the Secretary of State should be accountable is consistent with the amendment, because the Secretary of State could appear before the Select Committee to talk about the appointments that he proposes. In the absence of the Secretary of State or the appointees before the Select Committee, no transparency will exist, as the Secretary of State could make any appoinment to the commission without proper detailed scrutiny.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses an important point about what happpens if there is a disagreement between the Select Committee and the Secretary of State. The amendment does not provide for that. How will the Committee judge the merits of those individuals? When Labour Members were tabling amendments to the Bills to privatise the utilities, the Nolan principles were not in place. Now, the appointment of the chairman will be made in accordance with those principles. I assure the Committee that they are being fully adhered to in the recruitment of the first chairman, which is now well advanced.

<P>
There is no question of padding out. The commission is not representative but regulatory. We want the right people, who can do the job of regulation. A role for the Trade and Industry Select Committee in selection would slow the process and would probably run contrary to Nolan. There is no provision in the amendment for disagreement. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North, (Mr. Laxton) made the most relevant point. If the accountability of the commission is the problem, the commission and its chairman, once appointed, may be summoned before any Committee, including the Public Accounts Committee. If the amendment's purpose is to ensure that the appointees are held to account effectively by Parliament and the consumer, the Trade and Industry Committee could assert its powers at the suitable time, instead of being appropriately involved in the appoinments. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The commission will have extensive and important powers as a regulator, and we do not know what the corporate strategy and development of the Post Office will be in the future. It will operate in what is likely to be a fast-developing sector for business, in which many business partnerships will arise, so it is important for the House, through its specialist Select Committee, to have a bigger say in who sits on the commission.

<P>
I appreciate the Minister's argument that he can be called before the Select Committee at any time and be asked to explain himself. None the less, it is better in the view of Conservative Members to enshrine in primary legislation a clear obligation for the Secretary of State, or those appointed, to appear before the Select Committee for scrutiny and consideration. To support the transparency that the Minister claims to promote, we would like to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

</FONT><B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 57, line 7, after `three', insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and no more than five''
<P>
</UL></FONT>
This is a short, sweet and simple amendment. It would cap the number of members of the commission. The schedule specifies that the commission should consist of no fewer than three people in addition to the chairman, which is a total of four people, but how big will the commission be? Might it consist of 40 people or five? The Minister is giving me a high five. Only five members would be fine, but no upper limit is specified. If the Government were ever desperate to keep together their fragile coalition, they would have ample scope to put no end of Tony's cronies on the commission.

<P>
It does not seem unreasonable to say that, as a minimum has been specified, should so a maximum. If I have misread the Bill and it specifies a maximum, I shall withdraw the amendment. However, I cannot discern a maximum. Given that the commission will be an extremely important regulatory body of which the expertise and daily working practice must be of the highest possible standard, we should not allow the risk of bureaucratic structure developing over time with any number of members.

<P>

</P>


<P>
We should like an upper limit to be specified so that we can understand more about the commission's nature, scale, and, therefore, its authority. A dozen members would be too many. Arguably, the number of members could be 20--like the Cabinet--and the commission could continue to function as a reasonable working organisation. However, any number approaching that would be completely inappropriate for the tasks specified in the Bill. Five is enough. One plus five makes six. Half a dozen is a reasonable cap that will allow a variety of expertise, age, and, possibly, other disciplines from different parts of the country. Six is about right.

<P>
What composition is likely? What sort of people will sit on the commission? What combination of people will make the commission an efficiently functioning, well staffed and well equipped body to do the job that has been specified? Is a gender or geographical balance necessary? Must the commission contain a representative of a trade union, for example? From where does the Minister expect to draw the commission's membership? How does he expect members to work together? What priority does he give to business, as distinct from academic, expertise? Should the commission contain anyone who has no experience of the communications business, whether academic or through a postal service or distribution business--in other words, a layman? What will the composition be? If he doe not agree that an upper limit of six people would be a simple, reasonable cap to place on the commission's structure, why not?

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The amendment is useful in signalling that a reasonable maximum should be specified. I have not had a chance to examine the provision properly, so I am not sure whether it would make the final figure six or seven, but it is not unreasonable to suggest a limit of five. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton made some valuable points, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton. The amendment flows from the first group of amendments. The Minister did not respond fully to the points that were made about the first group of amendments. Those points are applicable to amendment No. 41, which would give the Secretary of State complete and utter power to choose whomever he wants to be members of the Commission. If he wishes to stuff it with placemen from a particular union, he can do so. That is why we want the Minister to answer the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton, such as on what basis the members will be chosen. Surely, it would be better if advice were available from an independent source to guide the Secretary of State to ensure that the commission is as balanced as possible. As the Minister knows, we have mentioned, one source. The schedule gives the Secretary of State too much latitude to decide how many people should serve on the commission. There will be a danger of patronage, which was highlighted by Nolan. The Minister should respond to that point, too.

<P>
Cost should be considered, too. Commissions are expensive bodies to run. Obviously, they must be set up correctly. There must be some guidance on cost and, if such a body is to be stuffed with too many people, costs will escalate. Undoubtedly, the costs will be met out of licence fees, which will be a burden on the industry. Will the Minister spend a little time explaining on what basis the members will be chosen and what their qualifications will have to be? I sincerely hope that he will say that there will be an upper limit of people serving on the commission beyond which the Government will not go. Although the amendment refers to the figure of five, we want to tease out how many people will make up the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> I trust that you will extend to me a certain amount of leeway, Mr. Butterfill, because my contribution may not be precisely about the number of members of the commission. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton referred to employee representatives being members of the commission. Has the Minister given any thought to that? Several years ago, the Post Office that employed me when it was a mix of postal services and telecommunications services undertook a worthwhile experiment under the terminology of industrial democracy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Oh dear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister remembers it well. I remember my contribution--small and insignificant, though it was-- when I was an employee member of one of the numerous Post Office Telecommunications boards. It was a worthwhile experiment. Given the role of the commission, it would be useful to have an employee representative--from within the Post Office or from outwith, but someone who represented organised labour. A member of the Post Office Board has already been appointed to represent the wider trade union movement; that, too, is a useful contribution. I shall be interested in the Minister's response.

<P>
Thank you Mr. Butterfill, for the extensive leeway that you have given me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): It is interesting how a figure has just been plucked out of the air today. Members are saying, ``Is it five? Have we got our maths right? Is it six or seven?'' That is not right. If this is a lottery, we should roll the balls or the dice once more and find out what numbers we want. The amendment is ill though out and ill judged. It is not good business simply to pluck a figure out of the air; in fact, it is very bad business.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): Does the hon. Gentleman agree with our general point that there should be an upper limit?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> The problem is the figures, not the idea of having limits. The question is, ``Is that a low limit, or a medium limit?'' The problem is that we are picking out a number, which is dangerous. There was plenty of opportunity for hon. Members to mention that earlier. A quiet word with the Minister would have been helpful. It is not good business simply to pluck a number out today. Trying to choose a figure--be it five, six or seven--is rather silly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> All minimums and maximums can be said to be arbitrary. Our purpose, given that there is already a minimum, is to establish a maximum, so that we have a clear picture of the commission composition that will allow it to do its job. If the Minister wants some leeway, we will not mind if he proposes an amendment on Report suggesting a chairman and a chief executive plus, say, six. At the moment, in the absence of an upper limit, there is no clear picture of the ideal composition of the staffing of the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Hon. Members are still trying to specify a figure. That is silly. They are just plucking at figures, and that is dangerous. I am sure that the Minister will seriously consider the issue, and come forward with something, but he will not simply take on board what has been suggested today. We have gone from five to six, plus one, plus another. That is quite silly, and the Minister will respond accordingly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page rose--</B><P>


<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Page.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I was seeking to intervene, but the hon. Gentleman has run for cover.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that the hon. Member for Chorley has resumed his seat.

<P>
<B>Mr Alan Johnson:</B> We should get the maths right. I am tempted to refer to the Chancellor's comment about problems with the previous Government's method of adding up figures, although I understand some of the confusion. Under schedule 1, there will be five members of the commission--a chairman, a chief executive and three lay members. The amendment would make that seven, rather than six.

<P>
The question is not about upper limits; it is about achieving the most effective regulation. The idea of a commission, rather than an individual, acting as regulator is a new concept, and is supported by everyone. Having regard to the Nolan principles, we believe that a commission of five is the minimum necessary to ensure a reasonable mix of experience and expertise, and the representation of other views. That would also cover for the odd unavoidable absence and prevent the commission from being reduced to too small a size.

<P>
We have not set a maximum, because the legislation is meant to last for many years. It is not about, to use the derogatory reference that comes up in every debate, ``Tony's cronies''. It is not totally inconceivable--practically inconceivable, but not totally inconceivable--that there might be a change of Government at some time. The legislation is meant to be on the statute book for many years, and we are setting up the new regulatory body in the belief that five is about the right number.

<P>
The body will have an enormous work load. For instance, the Post Office--a huge organisation with about 250,000 employees--has given up its right to police the reserved area and ensure that no one encroaches on it. That function will fall to the commission, along with many other responsibilities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I do not disagree with anything that the Minister has just said, but most of the leg work will be done by the staff of the commission. We are discussing the membership of the overseeing board of directors. Will the Minister explain what would be the ideal mix of experience? In the Bill as drafted, the board is to have a total of five members--the chairman and the chief executive plus a minimum of three--which we are seeking to make a maximum of seven.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I will answer that question shortly. We are only in the foothills of the idea of a commission. Conservative Members are also missing the fact that the job of the commission is not merely to regulate the Post Office. The regulatory regime comes through the licence. The Post Office will have to apply for a licence like everyone else, and it is highly unlikely, if not almost inconceivable, that it will not receive one. However, licences can go to other organisations. We are not setting in concrete a maximum limit--I agree with Conservative Members that five is about right--because, two years later, in the light of experience, the commission may say in a report to the Trade and Industry and Select Committee that, to do its work on the national network effectively, with all the onerous duties that that involves, it needs one more member. We would have to pass new legislation, which would be ridiculous. Such inflexibility would be ludicrous, irrespective of the argument about the mix of members, which I will deal with later.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
My hon. friend the Member for Derby, North has reminded me of the industrial democracy experiment, and the word ``bullock'' comes to mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Laxton:</B> Did my hon. Friend say ``bullock''?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I did say ``bullock''. I had the joy of participating in that experiment, but we are not recreating it now. To be fair to the Prime Minister at the time, Mrs. Thatcher, she gave it a decent burial--it had already been killed off long before. Nevertheless, as I said in the last debate, we are not talking about some corporate body. The commission is not the Post Office Board or a representative body. It will consist of a group of people who are appointed on the basis of the need for an assortment of people from different backgrounds with a rich mix of the skills required to do the job of regulator. That does not mean that they must have experience of the communications industry or that they cannot be trade unionists. They can be captains of industry. Currently, we are going through the process of appointing the chair of the existing PSC, which will be replaced.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The chairman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No, the chair. Professional recruitment consultants are advising us on the selection process and we are setting up a selection panel that includes independent members. We intend to follow a similar process for the establishment of the whole commission, after we have appointed the chairman. We will, of course, consult the chairman--the term is appropriate in this case--on the recruitment of the other members of the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Given that any employee representation of the Post Office on the commission would entrench the interests of one main competitor as against those of others that may wish to compete, does the Minister rule out such an approach as part of any appointment to the commission?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I hestitate to rule out anything. It is almost inconceivable that, given the conflict of interest, anyone who is part of the Post Office or any other industry that may come under the scrutiny of the regulator will be appointed to the commission. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point.

<P>
This debate is not about the make-up of the commission, or recreating an industrial democracy experiment, or the mix of people on the commission. We are debating setting a limit that will be enshrined in statute at a time when we have no experience of how the commission will operate, how its work will evolve or how it will fulfil its duties. Although we all believe that five is about the right number, it would be foolish to add a provision to the Bill that prevented flexibility. If it were ever suggested to extend the commission beyond seven, eight, nine or 10 members, I am sure that various bodies--including the Trade and Industry Committee-- would have something to say about that. It would have to be demonstrated that such a membership was necessary. It is far better to go through that process, however, than to be bound for ever more by capping the number of members now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Will the Minister explain the time commitment that the members will have to make to the commission? I suspect that they are not to be full-time posts, but do the Government have in mind a certain number of days a month? There must always be the capacity to cope with an additional work load. I have been a member of a few Standing Committees when the Government have intended that the Bill under discussion should leave it open as to what amendments can be made under statutory instruments. Such arrangements would not be difficult to introduce should additional appointments have to be made.

<P>
As the Minister said, we are in the foothills of the Bill. Many of us want to see how it will work and to place a few more precise figures on some of its provisions. For example, what about holding a review after, say, three or four years, to see how members of the commission are operating and to see what regulations they have been able to achieve? That would not be unreasonable. Will the Minister give us a flavour of the time commitment of the additional members and say whether such posts are likely to be full or part-time?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We are advertising for a chairman for three days a week. The chief executive will hold a full-time post, while other members will work for about 30 days a year. It is ludicrous to require a statutory instrument to change something of which we have no experience. When the commission is up and running, I am confident that its members will consider that five is the right number. They might think that they could manage with fewer than five. However, if they say in their first year of operation that they need three or four more members to undertake the job properly, the legislation should be flexible enough to take that into account rather than taking up parliamentary time unnecessarily. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The amendment is a probing amendment to find out the thinking behind the measure, so that we know on what basis the members of the commission would be chosen. The Minister said that a recruitment agency will provide the names of those to be considered by the Secretary of State. It was interesting to hear that, given our previous suggestion of including the Trade and Industry Committee in such considerations was possibly more relevant to such matters.

<P>
The Minister said that he ruled out considering anyone to be a member of the commission who had an involvement in the industry at present. Will that ban apply to people who had previously been employed in the industry, but who have now retired or moved into other work?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No. People who had previous experience of the industry and who had moved on would not be debarred. There would not be the problem of conflict of interest in such circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We feel sufficiently strongly about the amendment to press it to a Division. We would be flexible about the exact number. For instance, if the Minister agreed to table an amendment on Report and suggested seven or eight instead of five, we would seriously consider that. We are trying to shape an ideal body to do the job described in the Bill, and something open-ended is not satisfactory. We should try at the outset to give the commission a clear idea of what it should look like and what it should do. We are not giving it a clear enough steer as to its composition.

<P>
As a minimum number has been set, it seems valid to set a maximum number so that the shape of the commission can be clearly defined. As the hon. Member for Chorley said, it would be arbitrary to pick any minimum or maximum, but having a clear idea of the sort of organisation that one wants would diminish that. The Minister has given us a rough idea of how he sees the commission shaping up, but it lacked detail. He mentioned a few people here with a bit of expertise, and a few people there who have never had anything to do with the Post Office, but we want to know more. What definitions and details will there be, such as the full job descriptions and requirements that the Minister has given to the recruitment agency? We do not know those, which is not transparent given that it is going abut its business even as we speak.

<P>
We will press the amendment to a vote so I urge the Minister to reconsider. If we are unsuccessful in marshalling our troops and winning the Division, I hope that he will consider returning on Report with an amendment that encapsulates the principle of an upper limit, even one that allows sufficient flexibility for the reasonable developments in the commission that he has explained.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I regret that we are in the game of numbers, but we felt that it was worth suggesting that the term should not exceed three years rather than five. We look forward to the Minister's response. In the light of our general discussions and especially the debate that we had on the previous amendment, it has become clear that the commission should become a significant force assuming many important responsibilities. As it is a completely new concept, it might be better to specify three years rather than five.

<P>
The schedule states:

<P>
The Secretary of State may remove a person from any such office on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour.
That can be extremely difficult to do. If the entire group of people involved are not especially good at the job, it can be extremely difficult to point to ``incapacity or misbehaviour'', pin people down and make the necessary changes. As the commission is new, and will need to bed down, it is not unreasonable to propose that the initial term should be three years rather than five.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We do not feel especially strongly one way or another about the amendment. As we discussed earlier, numbers are chosen to provide clarity, and arguments can always be advanced for making them higher or lower. We are not especially exercised by the proposal of three years, as opposed to five, and are essentially indifferent. We shall listen to why the Minister favours five years rather than three and assess our position.

<P>
The amendments are designed to introduce clarity. Those who, like me, served on the Committee that considered the Electronic Communications Bill will be aware of my constant campaign for simplicity and clarity of language in our legislation. It think that I understand paragraph 3(1) and (5), but it seems a rather convoluted way of saying something that is essentially very simple and understood by anyone who has ever employed anyone for anything: a contract may be renewed.

<P>
The schedule states that an appointment

<P>
shall be for a term not exceeding five years.
The number may be three, but that is by the by. I think that paragraph 3(5) essentially says that such a contract is renewable, but by golly what a clumsy, elephantine way of simply saying that a five-year or three-year contract may be renewed. Paragraph 3(5) states:

<P>
No person shall be prevented from being a member of the commission (whether as chairman or otherwise) merely because he has previously been a member of the commission (whether as chairman or otherwise).
That seems a rather backwards somersaulty way of saying that members may serve on the commission who have served on it before. I make a plea for us to simplify life. No advantage in law is served and no certainty is added by that clumsy, lumpy paragraph, when at the end of paragraph 3(1) we could simply put ``The appointment shall be for a term not exceeding five years, renewable thereafter.'' Could we not just grow up and keep it simple?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> The arguments used in support of a three-year term in fact justify a five-year term. I cannot think of a better reason why the term should be five years. The argument certainly led me to believe that it should be, especially as the commission is new. In the beginning, a longer period makes much more sense because it will allow the commision to bed down. Five years is the right period, especially to begin with because the commission will take a long time to run in. Five years is not an unreasonable period--it is the length of a parliamentary term, after all. The minority Opposition party should reconsider and perhaps withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall said that the amendment was probing how the commission was expected to function in its first period of operation. It is a matter of trying to decide an appropriate time for review. We are talking about a pretty fast-moving business. Things are already moving swiftly and we hope that the chairman and members of the commission will get into their stride quickly because if they do not, the purpose of much of what we are doing will be lost. It could be argued that a period of five years would allow enough time for things to be done properly, but three years would encourage a sense of urgency to do the things that needed to be done.

<P>
The two Opposition parties in the committee have mainly tabled amendments on separate subjects, but this grouping of amendments fits well together. It is sensible to have a period of three years that could be renewed if matters were perfectly satisfactory and a good job were being done. We are talking about a completely new measure that needs to get moving swiftly. Reducing the period to three years would add a note of urgency to stimulate the commission to get on with things, but as I said, the amendment is a probing one. I shall listen to the Minister with interest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said about the need for plain English in legislation. My role over the past hour or so seems to have been to endorse what he says, which is a smart position for me to take. I assume that the schedule means that if the chairman or a member of the commission does a good job, his or her appointment is renewable and can be extended for a second period.

<P>
The days of a single regulator, of which I have some experience, could at times provide an exciting ride, especially if the Government and the regulator of the day were in conflict. If such a conflict arises under the new arrangements, the panel will to a large extent mitigate that, so the argument whether the period should be three or five years is not as relevant as it would be if we were appointing a single regulator. There could be a case for some form of exception due to incapacity; in such circumstances, one might want to get rid of the person or merely wait until the period had elapsed. The period of five years is fine and I cannot envisage that it will cause any difficulty.

<P>
I should particularly like an answer from the Minister on my next point. The new body will start April 1. According to the way in which the paragraph reads, at the end of five years, some members could finish while others could go on--or all of them could finish, in which case one would have a host of new people. The Minister should give us some idea of how the appointment arrangements will be staggered to ensure that the experience of the previous body is retained while the new members are bedded in.

<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 55 seeks to change our cap of five years to three years. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare believes that three years is an appropriate initial period; we also believe that and are appointing the chairman of the commission for an initial three-year period. However, the established period for the appointment of regulators is five years, which allows them a sufficient period to learn the job and operate independently without the end of the period constantly looming. That is one reason why my union appoints trade union officers for a period of five years. I recognise that there are exceptions and, initially, we are appointing the chairman for three years. There are good reasons for that. It is a good idea that the chairman serves for only three years while we see how the work of the commission pans out in practice. We also want to see if he--I know who it will be--understands the job. It is important for him to get the feel of it and the period of three years in the first instance is right.

<P>
None of us can foresee how the work of the commission will settle down, and the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire made a relevant point when he asked how we would get round the problem of staggering the periods of employment. We intend to stagger the initial appointments with a period of three years for the chair and periods of three, four and five years for members of the commission. After that, we aim to reappoint people for five years. We believe that that period is right. Initially, however, it will be for three years, and if we stagger the appointments of members of the commission, we will not suffer the problem to which the hon. Gentleman referred.

<P>
Having considered the Electronic Communications Bill, I shall sign up to the campaign for Bills being written in clear English. Unfortunately, they are written in legal terms because we do not, by accepting the amendments tabled by the Opposition--well-intentioned though they may be--want to end up in a situation that we were trying to avoid. I was asked why we are proceeding in such a convoluted fashion. If taken together, amendments Nos. 43 and 44 would first prevent a member of the commission from moving to the role as chair of the commission. Because the amendment would make the contract renewable, it would be drawn up for a lay member of the commission. That would stop us moving a lay member of the commission into the position of the chair.

<P>
Secondly, the amendments would prevent a member of the commission who may, for certain reasons, wish to come off it, but who might become available to be reappointed to it after five years, from being able to be reappointed. I accept that Opposition Members do not intend that, but that would be the result.

<P>
If we accepted amendment No. 44 on its own, contracts would not be renewable. It is our intention that appointments will be for a limited period, typically of five years, but it is in the interests of continuity and flexibility that we should not rule out the possibility of individuals being appointed to another term as a member, whether as chairman or otherwise. The amendments would severely restrict or even stop that highly desirable flexibility.

<P>
I understand why Opposition Members asked about the mix of the commission and the appointments process. The information that is available to applicants, which sets out the criteria for the skills of the commission members has been placed in the Library. I shall gladly circulate that to members of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> As usual, the Minister courteously ranged over the points. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall said, the amendment was designed to probe the matter. It is interesting to hear that the chairman is already in position, presumably, beavering away. I hope that he is taking an interest in our proceedings--for all that I know, he might be observing them. It is encouraging to hear that he is up and running, especially in view of the fact that he has been initially appointed for three years. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 58, line 20, leave out ``(including quorum)'', and insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``but such procedures must specify a quorum of either 50 per cent. of its membership or three, whichever, is the greater''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I seek your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. Given that there is clear nomenclature on the Bill to suggest that the person running the commission will be called the chairman, could you convey to the Committee at an appropriate moment whether it is best in our proceedings for us constantly and consistently to refer to him as a chairman rather than a chair?
12 noon

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for me. It is for hon. Members to decide the language that they use. I would personally prefer not to be called by a term that relates to an inanimate object.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. We can see that you are a calm but suitably animated Chairman.

<P>
The principle of a quorum in the proceedings of any decision-making body is long established. It applies to many part of the House, including Committee and the Floor of the House. It is improper for a small huddle of members to be able to take decisions and possibly override the wishes of the greater body to which they belong. In the amendment, we seek to establish a clearly defined quorum in the proceedings of the commission that must be met if it is to take any binding decisions. That quorum should be

<P>
either 50 per cent. of its membership or three, whichever is the greater.
That is all the more significant now that our earlier amendment to cap the membership of the commission has been turned down.

<P>
We want to establish the overall working practice of the commission. We accept that many of the smaller details--when, how and where it meets, how its agenda is drawn, how the members are notified and summoned--are for it to decide. As with any club, organisation or business, those details can be left to some memorandum of procedure, and we accept that that will be drafted in a responsible manner. The amendment is designed to avoid the danger of any small, unrepresentative group on the authority making a decision, good or bad, simply because several members were absent for some reason. We want to be sure of accountable regulation.

<P>
There have been several references this morning to the novelty of the commission's structure. In a nutshell, we are moving from a single regulator to a collective regulatory body. That is a first. The nature of regulation will shift, its format will be different, and perforce, so will its proceedings.

<P>
Paragraph 35 on page 29 of the July 1999 White Paper to which I referred earlier states:

<P>
In line with the Government's policy for better regulation of the private utilities the Government proposes to appoint a Board of Regulators rather than a single Regulator. The advantages of the Board approach ... are that: it depersonalises the regulatory process; provides collective but streamlined decision-making; spreads the burden and increases the scope for greater continuity and consistency when new regulators are appointed.
The Minister made a similar comment in relation to an earlier amendment, for which I am grateful. His foresight in realising that appointments need to overlap and be staggered is absolutely right, and Opposition Members entirely agree that such forward planning will result in a better functioning commission.

<P>
In the White Paper, the Government say that they welcome a new form of collective regulation. However, it will not be collective if only a few people on the commission are empowered to make a decision. The schedule states:

<P>
The Commission may regulate its own procedure (including quorum).
The issue of quorum is, therefore, on the agenda and it clearly matters. The Government have considered it, but have not reached a conclusion and are leaving the commission to work out its own quorum.

<P>
Quorums may be specified in primary legislation. Doing so would not tie the Minister's hand, because although he has decided that the commission will consist of a minimum of three plus two--five--which might be increased to seven, the amendment is flexible because it would apply pro rata according to the commission's composition. It does not specify that three members would constitute a quorum. Indeed, it would be nonsensical for me to propose a quorum of only three members if a prospect remained of the commission ultimately becoming a body of 20 members. I would ultimately defeat my own argument and render it idiotic by stating that a tiddly quorum would be acceptable for a larger commission. Rather, we propose that as the commission increases, so should the quorum, so that a full participating number of commission members are involved in decisions.

<P>
Under the amendment, a commission of 20 members would require a quorum of about 10 members. A commission of seven members would require a quorum of four members, as would one of eight members. The amendment would provide that a particular number of participating members is required before a decision can be taken. It is fully in line with the Government's policy of moving away from personalised regulators to a board of regulators, and it would guarantee a level of collective decision making.

<P>
The Minister might argue--and he might just get away with it--that it would not be unreasonable for a quorum comprising the chief executive, the chairman and A.N. Other to be sufficient to make a binding decision. However, such a quorum would be too small. Genuine collective regulation means that more than one person other than the chief executive or the chairman should be involved in such a decision.

<P>
I hope that the Committee will realise that the amendment is reasonable and straightforward. No politics are involved. It is simply a matter of the efficient administration of the commission to specify in the Bill the minimum number of people who can participate in a commission decision that may have enormous ramifications for the communications industry. Such decisions may concern licences. If the Nolan committee rules are to apply, we do not want a licence to be granted or refused by only three people sitting around a table. The decision-making process on big commercial matters must be more inclusive than that.

<P>
I hope that the Minister accepts that the Committee should set the quorum and that it should not be left--as many other decisions are left by the Bill--either to the Secretary of State or to the commission. It is wrong that, on such a significant matter, the commission should be judge and jury and set its own rules. That is our job--we should be setting the rules, and we should set them now, so that quorum details are included in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> I believe that not to accept our amendment will be a direct negation of the whole purpose of setting up a commission and moving away from the single regulator. I am sure that we are all in harmony about that. Without our amendment, there is a danger that postal services could be pushed back to the existing position under a single regulator.

<P>
It is right that the Committee should give direction or guidance to the the commission on the size of the quorum. Will the Minister explain how the current body operates? Does it have rules on the size of the quorum? It is anticipated that those rules will be transferred to the procedures that the new commission will adopt? A few parallels can be drawn in company law, whereby existing guidelines and laws must be adhered to by those who wish to operate a company and operators who transgress them do so at their own peril. Will the hon. Gentleman explain the present situation and, if it is line with out amendment, say whether it can be translated into the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I accept that there are good intentions behind the amendment. Do we want a quorum on the Postal Services Commission? Yes. Does it need to be in legislation? No. The important issue is flexibility. All the examples of quorums cited by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, and a few more than I have thought about, have been decided by the bodies themselves. All politicians have grown up in the world of quorums and remember town halls on windy nights. Whether the quorum is for an executive council, for a union conference or for a branch meeting, it is the members of the organisation concerned who have the say in setting the quorum. Under clause 39, the commission must produce a code of practice that governs the discharge of its functions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> Mr. Page rightly said that, within company law, companies usually adhere to what has been proposed. He should also acknowledge that each company decides on the quorum. That is what my hon. Friend the Minister is saying, which would also be in line with Mr. Page's thinking.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer to other hon. Members by name. He knows that he must refer to them by their constituencies.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley makes an extremely relevant point. That is the nub of the argument. Well-intentioned though the amendment is, I cannot balance the need for the commission to be independent with the specification of a quorum--in addition to our prescription of its duties and powers. The important point is that we expect a quorum to be included in the code of practice, but we want the commission to decide that matter.

<P>
Operational freedom must also be a factor in the setting of a quorum for the commission. Matters that have enormous ramifications occasionally need to be dealt with quickly. If, for example, there were a serious disruption of the universal postal service, or a licensed operator were on the brink of insolvency, a swift decision would be necessary. The procedure should be set by those with the experience of carrying out such procedures and should be in line with the kind of operations of which the new Postal Services Commission will gradually get experience.

<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked me what happens at the moment. There will not be a Postal Services Commission in place until 1 April. We currently have a chief executive and some staff so that we can hit the ground running on that date. We are in the process of appointing a chair--or, should I say, chairman. Once the chairman is in place, we will start the process of recruiting the other three members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister said that setting a quorum would undermine the commission's independence. The commission's independence would in no way be affected by the requirement for a quorum. The amendment would merely order the commission's practices in a certain way. Surely the Minister will admit that? It will still have the same powers; all that we are saying is that it will have to exercise them in the way that we set down. The requirement for a quorum would not prevent the commission from acting quickly. A quorum does not have to consist of people sitting round a table; it merely means that people have to be embraced in a decision. Modern communications can easily achieve that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I do not want to argue about the amendment because, as I said, it is well intentioned. However, quorums for an organisation are normally--no one has given an example of an exception--set by the organisation itself. We expect the commission to set a quorum, which we should allow it to set by itself, and that decision will be published in the code of practice. That is a far more reasonable, sensible and flexible way of setting a quorum than imposing it through the might of legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Was there a statutory quorum in what was the Manpower Services Commission. Is there one in the Countryside Agency or the Forestry Commission?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I do now know the answer to that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We feel strongly enough about the matter to press it to a Division. As there is more than a quorum in the Committee, I hope that we can do so without further delay.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The House, not the Committee, sets the quorum of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48 fall naturally together, and are about something akin to the words near the end of each Queen's Speech at the opening of Parliament each November: ``Other measures will be laid before you.'' One's alarm bells always ring, because there is an open-ended promise of things that the Government of the day do not want to notify people about but have every intention of doing. Paragraph 11 is entitled ``Supplementary powers'', and those powers are unnecessary because they are covered elsewhere in the Bill.

<P>
For example, I am puzzled as to why the powers in paragraph 11(2) to allow the commission to form advisory bodies are needed when the commission already has the power to establish committees and sub-committees under paragraph 6. I am not sure that the commission will need to form advisory bodies. The Minister has said all morning that the exercise of the commission's functions should by and large be left to it after we have done the broad-brush outline, yet we are letting and almost implicitly instructing the commission to set up advisory bodies. That will create an overweening empire that is not necessary to fulfil the commission's functions.

<P>
Sub-committees are always necessary; this Committee is effectively a sub-committee of the main House of Commons. The commission will legitimately need sub-committees to consider the terms of a licence, the nature of a licence applicant, whether postal services are working well in outlying areas and so on. However, to say in primary legislation that the commission can also set up all sorts of advisory bodies runs the risk of putting into law an incentive for the commission to establish them. They may become campaigning bodies, and one does not know what kind of public face they will have. They may take on some sort of spurious and specious legitimacy so that they get on Radio 4 every morning. I question the need for them.

<P>
Paragraph 11(1) lets the commission

<P>
do anything  which is calculated to facilitate, or is  conducive to, the performance of any of its functions.
The word that I have a problem with is ``anything''. The Bill already gives the commission sufficient powers to carry out its functions, and the provision goes against the goal of minimum regulation.

<P>
The same is true for amendment No. 48. Paragraph 12, which is a blank cheque, would be acceptable if the Bill contained no other provisions for the payment of moneys, but it does. Paragraph 4 covers commission members' pay and remuneration, rendering paragraph 12 unnecessary. Paragraph 12 can therefore be deleted.

<P>
Amendment No. 10 would delete from first ``licence'' to end of line 15 and would insert

<P>
and then annually, of such amount as may be necessary to enable the commission to exercise its functions.
I shall allow my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire to speak to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I have a few words to say about amendment No. 56. Paragraph 12 states:

<P>
The Secretary of State may pay such amounts in respect of the expenses of the Commission as he may determine.
The addition of the words ``as reasonable'' would strengthen that commitment.

<P>
I shall be corrected if I am wrong, but I understand that no impact assessment has been made of the Bill. I have pressed for such assessments to be made of other Bills. Is such an assessment proposed? Would it be appropriate? In the light of commitments relating to expenses and other costs associated with the Bill, it is not unreasonable to ask what financial impact it will have.

<P>
The amendment is designed to strengthen the commitment to the payment of expenses.

<B>Mr. Page:</B> Amendment No. 46 strikes at--[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must either resume their seats or leave the Room.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am heartbroken that the hon. Member for Chorley will not be present to hear my immortal words, but I shall try to live with that disappointment.

<P>
Amendment No. 46 is designed to ensure fair play. Paragraph 11(1) gives the commission too wide a remit and too much discretion in exercising its functions that relate to individuals. What recourse, other than to a court of law, will a company have against a decision by the commision? A procedure might be introduced to avoid that process. We all know how expensive and time-consuming it is. Frankly, all that it does is give finance and revenue to lawyers, and it does not speed industry up at the rate that is necessary for the Post Office and the companies involved in postal services to compete in the world today. The speed at which the industry is changing is impressive, and we do not want individual companies caught up in legislation and commission decisions against which they cannot appeal.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Amendment No. 10 would amend the provisions relating to the grants and conditions of licence. It would limit licence payments to an annual payment necessary to finance the regulator's function. The argument in favour of that amendment is that it brings the licence and cost into balance. The July 1999 White Paper, ``Post Office Reform: A world class service for the 21st century'', states that

<P>
It is intended that the Regulator will be funded by a contribution from the Post Office itself, and in due course any other licensees as appropriate. This is in line with the financing of regulation in the utilities.

<P>
Previously, fees have been linked to the costs of operating the regulators. I served on the Committee that considered the then British Telecommunications Bill, a piece of legislation that liberalised BT and set it free in the marketplace. Oftel was set up at the same time, and the balance of cost was taken into account.

<P>
I will be delighted if the Minister can tell me that I have completely the wrong end of the stick, but the requirement in the Bill is to make unspecified payments while the licence is in force. That is less transparent than it should be. It could almost be akin to another form of taxation, and a balance between the cost of operating the commission and the cost of the licence should be related. That is why we have considered the costs that the commission could incur and have evinced some doubts.

<P>
The Liberal Democrats' amendment has its heart in the right place, but it is a little soggy in using the words ``as reasonable''. How long is a piece of string? It reminds me of when one is selling a product as a bargain. Someone might say, ``That's not a bargain,'' and one might reply, ``It is for me. So far as I'm concerned, it's a low price.'' It appears that there is no direction and guidance about the costs, which could increase.

<P>
I do not want to become too technical, but the costs could be a form of taxation, and could offend or infringe the general principle of constitutional taxation. I shall move the Committee to a higher realm by quoting from ``Halsbury's Laws of England'', paragraph 229, volume 8(2). It states:

<P>
So important are these taxes requiring annual renewal that Parliament must be summoned annually in order to provide enough revenue (or public income) for current needs. The Comptroller and Auditor General is required to examine whether adequate regulations and procedure exist to secure an effective check on assessment, collection and proper allocation of revenue and to satisfy himself that they are being duly carried out.
The amendment would make sure that the commission did not fall foul of that. It would limit the payment of the licence to that which is necessary to fund the regulated fund. On the basis of fair play, that should be welcomed by the Committee. It is already accepted in the White Paper, but clause 13 allows for the possibility of levying an open-ended charge. What checks and balances would prevent such a charge from being made disproportionately? What happens if the commission is allowed to expand to 20 members? I do not think that that will happen, but would the charges be levied out of all proportion to the value of the commission's advice or direction? What happens if the commission sets up many of the so-called advisory or support bodies, and the cost escalates through the roof? I agree with the sentiments of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. The Minister should provide directions and guidance on how far the commission can go in setting costs and incurring charges.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I understand the concerns that lie behind this group of amendments. I hope that Opposition Members will be satisfied by my response, and that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
The concerns about amendments Nos. 46 and 47 may be well intentioned, but they are unfounded. If I may leave aside the issue of advisory bodies for the moment, the powers that we are discussing relate to day-to-day administrative tasks. For example, they enable the commission to enter into contracts for the purchase of goods and services such as office furniture. I am advised that, as a matter of law, it is harder to prescribe powers for incidental or conducive expenditure to a non-Ministerial Government Department such as the commission than to individuals such as the existing utility regulators. Generally speaking, an individual can do anything that he is not prohibited from doing. However, a statutory body such as the commission can do only what it is expressly empowered to do. That is why the supplementary powers are necessary. They do not set a precedent; they follow precedents set by the previous Government, in relation to the Gas Act 1986.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Can the Minister explain what the status of advisory bodies will be? Perhaps I misheard him, but he appeared to say that one of them might advise on the purchase of office furniture. Will they be formal public organisations? Will there be a little committee called, for instance, the advisory body on licensing? Will people who are appointed to it take to the airwaves to make a public comment on how they are advising the commission? Alternatively, will they be entirely internal private advisory bodies that help the chairman, chief executive and members of the commission go about their duties?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I was explaining the complex point about paragraph 11(1), before moving on to paragraph 11(2). I did not say that there would be advisory bodies on office furniture--God forbid. Paragraph 11(1) is drafted in such a way because it relates to corporate powers, not individuals.

<P>
The status of advisory bodies will not be that of a committee. The commission can have a committee of the commission, and delegate its powers to that committee. It cannot delegate its powers to an advisory body. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton was wrong to suggest that that is prescriptive. We are providing the power to set up advisory bodies, if they are deemed necessary.

<P>
What will the advisory bodies be? The commission must bear it in mind that once it takes a decision to reduce the level of the reserved area or monopoly limit, it cannot go back again. The toothpaste will be out of the tube, and it will not be possible to put it back. The commission will have to judge whether that will damage the universal service obligation. I can imagine that it may wish to seek the expert advice and opinions of users such as charities or rural groups, and set up an advisory body accordingly. For example, off the top of my head--which is always a bad way to do things--the question of VAT on postal services could come before the commission. Charities cannot reclaim VAT, and an advisory body composed purely of charities could advise on that.

<P>
I can think of many good reasons why the commission might want to set up an advisory body: not a sub-committee of the commission or a body that features on the ``Today'' programme every morning, but a grouping that genuinely informs the commission's decisions on the important tasks that the Bill gives them. By removing the power for it to set up an advisory body if it wishes to do so, we would damage the commission and add nothing to the quality of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Who would be liable to receive the charges? The Minister cited the example of VAT. A body that queried VAT could be outside the licence, and therefore outside the charges. Those charges would then fall on the Post Office, which would find it wholly unfair that it should be funding the commission to carry out research that could not only be harmful to the Post Office but involve it financing its own destruction.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I prefer not to pursue that point. I should not use hypothetical examples off the top of my head.

<P>
The Bill deals with a national postal service that operates throughout the United Kingdom, touching the lives of nearly everyone--28 million people a week use postal services and 24.5 million addresses receive deliveries. It is therefore not inconceivable that the commission may wish at some stage to set up an advisory body, and it would be ludicrous to prevent it from doing so.

<P>
We have absolute sympathy with amendments Nos. 48 and 56, and intend to table amendments that will include the removal of paragraph 12. However, we cannot do that without a money resolution, and must therefore wait until the Bill is considered on Report. On that basis, I ask hon. Members to withdraw the amendments.

<P>
I find it difficult to see what hon. Members are trying to achieve in amendment No. 10. We have no disagreement in relation to the purpose of licence fees, but the amendment appears to be designed to put the commission and the people whom it licenses into an administrative straitjacket by making them abide to payments made on an annual basis, even if it proved to be more sensible for them to be made on a different basis.

<P>
Another, more serious, reason why the amendment should be withdrawn is that clause 13(2) gives the Commission the power to demand a payment.

<P>
on the grant of the licence, or payments while the licence is in force, or both
specifically to fund the commission and the consumer council. The amendment would not allow any funding to the consumer council, limiting it to the commission. The licensees paying for the service are currently paying into the consolidated fund; a vote system is not yet established. We intend to deal with that at a later stage through a money resolution. The amendment would not be constructive, especially in respect of the funding of the consumer council.

<B>Mr. Page:</B> That is precisely the point of concern. The first two and a quarter lines of clause 13 areas:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A license may include such provisions as the Commission considers appropriate; and a provision need not relate to anything authorised by the licence.
That enables the commission to wander far afield, and the licence payer will have no control over what is being investigated. Therefore, the licensee, who at present will be the Post Office, could be faced with an almost open-ended commitment to pay that amount. That is our concern in the amendment.

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am pointing out a practical difficulty. The other reason why I find it difficult to understand why Opposition Members have tabled the amendments is that there is precedent for the provision. This is a perfectly reasonable licence fee regime, which is very similar to that in the Electricity Act 1989, the Water Industry Act 1991 and the Gas Act 1995--all legislation introduced under the previous Administration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I want to clarify this matter, because I am a touch confused. I am also confused about why this is the only provision in the Bill that appears in italics. Perhaps it is just a gremlin.

<P>
Will the Minister give a categorical assurance that the licence fee regime will equate only to the commission's running costs and that the provision does not allow for an arbitrary supplementary charge on a licence holder to transmit money to the commission for another purpose?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The provision is in italics because it involves expenditure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That is right. It is in italics because the licence fee will be a licence condition to which licensees can object.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> That, I think, is not an answer. I am seeking an assurance from the Minister that someone who has a licence will not suddenly and arbitrarily face a supplementary charge. The paragraph appears to allow that, but it would appear from what the Minister has said, that all members of the Committee accept that that would be an unreasonable thing to happen.

<P>
I seek assurance from the Minister that the paragraph simply provides that the charges that apply to a licence holder relate only to the commission's costs and that a licence holder does not have to pay an extra fee. It appears to give total freedom--licence--to the Commission to charge almost anything for anything, or am I mistaken?

<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is mistaken. The licence fee regime is an agreement between the licensee and the commission. It is for the commission to decide the licence, and the licensee can object to any clause in that licence. We do not wish to interfere with that. The paragraph ensures that there is sufficient funding for the commission and the council, applied through this route. As one of its by-products, the amendment would allow funding simply to come to the commission and not to the consumer council. The commission has a responsibility to carry out its duties properly. It is under scrutiny from all kinds of bodies, including the House. The intention is that the fees will be charged for relevant purposes--to enable it to carry out its duties. We do not expect the commission to require licence holders to give it money for other purposes. I cannot restrict it as narrowly as the hon. Gentleman asked me to. The point is to fund the commission, but in the context of its agreeing, with the licensee, the terms and conditions of the licence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> At the moment, we are considering only one major licence holder--the Post Office, the main contributor. We hope that, in the fullness of time, other licensees will come into the frame to contribute and lighten the load. Will the Minister tell the Committee--I am looking to the future--what the grounds for appeal will be on this matter? The question was raised earlier. It appears that, under the Bill, the only recourse for a company paying a licence fee is to go to law. I would be grateful to know what the appeal procedure is to be. At present, it is a matter of agreeing, as has been stated. However, the Government will own 100 per cent. of the shares, and in those circumstances it would almost require the Minister to say to the regulator whether the charge was fair. Can the Minister see the circular problem that we face.

<P>
<B>Mr Johnson:</B> Yes, and we shall deal with the question of appeals when we discuss part II. We have also set out in the Library and distributed to right hon. and hon. Members an example of the kind of licence that we intend the commission to issue. Such matters are important, but I hope that I have explained the difference--convoluted though it may be--between a corporate body and an independant regulator in relation to amendment No. 46. I hope that I have also explained satisfactorily the need for advisory bodies in relation to amendment No. 47.

<P>
If Opposition Members will be kind enough not to press amendments Nos. 48 and 56 to a vote, we shall return to those issues under a money resolution. Amendment No. 10 is prescriptive in the sense that it would allow only annual funding, and the effect of the wording would be to cut off funds to the Post Office Users National Council, although I recognise that that was not the intention behind the amendment. The proposal is in line with the kind of regimes contained in previous legislation. Furthermore, the important point raised about appeals will be discussed at a later stage in our deliberations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the Minister for his response, in the light of which I beg leave to withdraw amendment No. 56.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I explain for the assistance of hon. Members that it is not necessary to withdraw an amendment that has not yet been formally moved. The only amendment that has formally been moved is amendment No. 46. However, it is helpful for me to have an indication that an amendment will not be pressed to a Division at a later stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for what he said about amendments Nos. 48 and 56. It is nice to score a bull's eye after a morning's work, and we look forward to seeing the amendment tabled on Report. For your guidance, Mr. Butterfill, we do not wish to press any amendment in this group to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
